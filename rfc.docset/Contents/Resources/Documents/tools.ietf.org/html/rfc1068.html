Status of This Memo

   This memo describes an Internet background file transfer service that
   is built upon the third-party transfer model of FTP.  No new
   protocols are involved.  The purpose of this memo is to stimulate
   discussion on new Internet service modes.  Distribution of this memo
   is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   For a variety of reasons, file transfer in the Internet has generally
   been implemented as an interactive or "foreground" service.  That is,
   a user runs the appropriate local FTP user interface program as an
   interactive command and requests a file transfer to occur in real
   time.  If the transfer should fail to complete for any reason, the
   user must reissue the transfer request.  Foreground file transfer is
   relatively simple to implement -- no subtleties of queuing or stable
   storage -- and in the early days of networking it provided excellent
   service, because the Internet/ARPANET was lightly loaded and
   reasonably reliable.

   More recently, the Internet has become increasingly subject to
   congestion and long delays, particularly during times of peak usage.
   In addition, as more of the world becomes interconnected, planned and
   unplanned outages of hosts, gateways, and networks sometimes make it
   difficult for users to successfully transfer files in foreground.

   Performing file transfer asynchronously (i.e., in "background"),
   provides a solution to some of these problems, by eliminating the
   requirement for a human user to be directly involved at the time that
   a file transfer takes place.  A background file transfer service
   requires two components: a user interface program to collect the
   parameters describing the required transfer(s), and a file transfer
   control (FTC) daemon to carry them out.

   Background file transfer has a number of potential advantages for a
   user:

   o    No Waiting

        The user can request a large transfer and ignore it until a
        notification message arrives through some common channel (e.g.,
        electronic mail).

   o    End-to-end Reliability

        The FTC daemon can try a transfer repeatedly until it either
        succeeds or fails permanently.  This provides reliable end-to-
        end delivery of a file, in spite of the source or destination
        host being down or poor Internet connectivity during some time
        period.

   o    Multiple File Delivery

        In order for background file transfer to be accepted in the
        Internet, it may have to include some "value-added" services.
        One such service would be an implementation of a multiple file
        transfer capability for all hosts.  Such a facility is suggested
        in <a href="rfc959.html">RFC-959</a> (see the description of "NLST") and implemented in
        some User-FTP programs.

   o    Deferred Delivery

        The user may wish to defer a large transfer until an off-peak
        period.  This may become important when parts of the Internet
        adopt accounting and traffic-based cost-recovery mechanisms.


   There is a serious human-engineering problem with background file
   transfer: if the user makes a mistake in entering parameters, this
   mistake may not become apparent until much later.  This can be the
   cause of severe user frustration.  To avoid this problem, the user
   interface program ought to verify the correctness of as many of the
   parameters as possible when they are entered.  Of course, such
   foreground verification of parameters is not possible if the remote
   host to which the parameters apply is currently unreachable.

   To explore the usefulness of background file transfer in the present
   Internet, we have implemented a file-mover service which we call the
   Background File Transfer Program or BFTP.

   conclusions.  The appendices contain detailed information about the

   2.1 General Model

      In the present BFTP design, its user interface program and its FTC
      daemon program must execute on the same host, which we call the
      BFTP control host.

      Through the user interface program, a BFTP user will supply all of
      the parameters needed to transfer a file from source host S to
      destination host D, where S and D may be different from the BFTP
      control host.  These parameters include:

      o    S and D host names,

      o    login names and passwords on S and D hosts, and

      o    S and D file names (and optionally, directories).


      The user may also specify a number of optional control parameters:

      *    Source file disposition -- Copy, move (i.e., copy and
           delete), or simply delete the source file.  The default is
           copy.

      *    Destination file operation -- Create/Replace, append to, or
           create a unique destination file.  The default is
           create/replace ("STOR").

      *    FTP Parameters -- Explicitly set any of the FTP type, mode,
           or structure parameters at S and D hosts.

      *    Multiple Transfers -- Enable "wildcard" matching to perform
           multiple transfers.

      *    Start Time -- Set the time of day for the first attempt of
           the transfer. The default is "now" (i.e., make the first
           attempt as soon as the request has been queued for the FTC
           daemon).


      Finally, the user specifies a mailbox to which a completion
      notification message will be sent, and "submits" the request to
      the FTC daemon queue.  The user can then exit the BFTP user



<span class="grey">DeSchon &amp; Braden                                                [Page 3]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-4" id="page-4" href="#page-4" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1068.html">RFC 1068</a>                                                     August 1988</span>


      interface program.

      If the transfer should fail permanently, the FTC daemon will send
      a notification message to the user's mailbox.  In the event of a
      temporary failure (e.g., a broken TCP connection), the FTC daemon
      will log the failure and retry the transfer after some timeout
      period.  The retry cycles will be repeated until the transfer
      succeeds or until some maximum number of tries specified has been
      reached.  In either case, a notification message will then be sent
      to the user's mailbox.

      The user can check on the progress of the transfer by reentering
      the BFTP user interface program, supplying a key that was defined
      with the request, and displaying the current status of the
      request.  The user may then cancel the request or leave it in the
      queue.

      The BFTP program includes a server-Telnet module, so it can be
      executed as a remotely-accessible service that can be reached via
      a Telnet connection to the BFTP well-known port (152).  This
      allows a user on any Internet host to perform background file
      transfers without running BFTP locally, but instead opening a
      Telnet connection to port 152 on a BFTP service host.  Of course,
      a user can also run the local BFTP user interface program directly
      on any host that supports it and for which the user has login
      privileges.

      The next section discusses how BFTP uses standard FTP servers to
      perform the transfers, while the following section covers the user
      interface of BFTP.

   2.2 File Transfer Mechanics for BFTP

      The BFTP makes use of the "third party" or "Server-Server" model
      incorporated in the Internet File Transfer Protocol [<a href="rfc959.html" title="&quot;File Transfer Protocol (FTP)&quot;">RFC-959</a>].
      Thus, the FTC daemon opens FTP control connections to the existing
      FTP servers on source host S and destination host D and instructs
      them to transfer the desired file(s) from S to D.  The S and D
      hosts may be any two Internet hosts supporting FTP servers (but at
      least one of them must support the FTP "PASV" command).  This
      approach allows the implementation of a background file transfer
      capability for the entire Internet at a very low cost.

      Figure 1 illustrates the BFTP model of operation.  Note that the
      BFTP control host is not necessarily the same as S or D.  Figure 2
      illustrates the FTP command interchange used in a typical Server-
      Server file transfer operation; this may be compared with the
      User-Server FTP scenario illustrated in <a href="rfc959.html#section-7">Section&nbsp;7 of RFC-959</a>.



<span class="grey">DeSchon &amp; Braden                                                [Page 4]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-5" id="page-5" href="#page-5" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1068.html">RFC 1068</a>                                                     August 1988</span>


      Since BFTP may be asked to transfer files between any two hosts in
      the Internet, it must support all the file types and transfer
      modes that are defined in <a href="rfc959.html">RFC-959</a>, not just a subset implemented
      by particular hosts.

      BFTP supports the transfer of a set of files in a single request,
      using the standard technique:

      (1)  Send an NLST command to the source host S, specifying a
           pathname containing "wildcard" characters.  The reply will
           contain a list of matching source file names.

      (2)  Execute a separate transfer operation for each file in this
           list.  The destination file name in each case is assumed to
           be the same as the source file name; this requires that these
           names be compatible with the naming conventions of D.

      It will typically be necessary to specify working directories for
      the transfers at S and D, so the file names will be simple,
      unstructured names on each system.

      This approach depends upon the wildcard matching capability of the
      source host S.  A more general implementation would acquire a
      complete list of the file names from the source host and do the
      matching in the FTC daemon, for example using a regular-expression
      matcher.  Another useful extension would be a general pattern-
      matching file name transformation capability (e.g., like the one
      included in the 4.3BSD version of FTP) to generate appropriate
      destination pathnames for multiple requests.

      BFTP currently utilizes the following Server-FTP commands [RFC-
      959]: USER, PASS, ACCT, PASV, PORT, RETR, STOR, STOU, CWD, NLST,
      MODE, STRU, TYPE, and QUIT.

      The FTC daemon attempts to work around FTP servers that fail to
      support certain commands.  For example, if a server does not
      support the optional command "CWD", the FTC daemon will attempt to
      construct a complete path name using the source directory name and
      the source file name.  However, it is necessary that at least one
      of the two hosts support the FTP passive (PASV) command.  While
      many FTP server implementations support do this command, some (in
      particular, the 4.2BSD FTP) do not.  The PASV command was
      officially listed as being optional in <a href="rfc959.html">RFC-959</a>.

   2.3 Reliable Delivery

      The reliable delivery function of BFTP is analogous to reliable
      delivery in a transport protocol like TCP.  Both depend upon
      repeated delivery attempts until success is achieved, and in both
      cases the choice of the retry interval requires some care to
      balance overhead against unresponsiveness.

      Humans are impatient, but even their impatience has a limit.  If
      the file cannot be transferred "soon", a human will turn to
      another project; typically, there is a tendency for the transfer
      to become less urgent the longer the wait.  The FTC daemon of BFTP
      therefore starts each transfer request with a very short retry
      interval -- e.g., 10 minutes -- and then doubles this interval for
      successive retries, until a maximum interval -- e.g., 4 hours --
      is reached.  This is essentially the exponential backoff algorithm
      of the Ethernet, which is also used by transport protocols such as
      TCP, although BFTP and TCP have quite different rationales for the
      algorithm.

      We must also define the meaning of reliable transmission for a
      multiple-transfer request.  For example, the set of files selected
      by wildcard characters in a pathname is not well defined; the set
      may change while the request is pending, as files are created and
      deleted.  Furthermore, it is unreasonable to regard the entire
      multiple transfer as a single atomic operation.  Suppose that
      transferring a set of files fails part way through; for an atomic
      operation, the files which had been successfully transferred would
      have to be deleted pending the next retry of the entire set.  This
      would be ridiculously inefficient and may be impossible (since the
      communication path may be broken when it is time to issue the
      deletion requests).





<span class="grey">DeSchon &amp; Braden                                                [Page 8]</span>

      BFTP addresses these issues in the following manner:

      *    For a multiple file operation, the FTC daemon saves the file
           name list returned by the first successful NLST command in
           the request queue entry.  This name list determines the set
           of source files for the transfer; there can be no later
           additions to the set.

      *    The FTC daemon maintains a transfer status pointer.  On each
           retry cycle, it tries to transfer only those files that have
           not already been successfully transferred.

      *    The request is complete when all the individual file
           transfers have been successful, a permanent failure has
           occured, or when the retry limit is reached.

      *    The notification message to the user lists the status of each
           of the multiple files.


   2.4 BFTP User Interface

      The purpose of BFTP is to simplify the file transfer process and
      to place the burden of reliability on the BFTP control host.  We
      have attempted to provide a "user friendly" command interface to
      BFTP, similar in flavor to the user interface of the TOPS-20
      operating system.  This interface provides extensive prompting,
      defaulting, and help facilities for every command.

      For a list of all BFTP commands, the user may enter "?&lt;Return&gt;" at
      the main BFTP prompt ("BFTP&gt;").  Entering "help&lt;Return&gt;" and
      "explain&lt;Return&gt;" will provide increasing levels of explanatory
      material.  To obtain information on a particular command, "help
      &lt;command name&gt;&lt;Return&gt;" may be entered.  The 'quit' or 'exit'
      command will exit from BFTP.  Command and subcommand names may be
      abbreviated to the shortest unique sequence for that context;
      alternatively, a partial name can be automatically completed by
      typing &lt;Return&gt;.

      The normal procedure for a BFTP user is to set up a set of
      parameters defining the desired transfer and then submit the
      request to the FTC daemon.  To give the user the maximum
      flexibility, BFTP supports three modes of submission:

      o    Background Operation

           To request a reliable background file transfer, the user will
           issue the BFTP 'submit' command to the FTC daemon.



<span class="grey">DeSchon &amp; Braden                                                [Page 9]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-10" id="page-10" href="#page-10" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1068.html">RFC 1068</a>                                                     August 1988</span>


      o    Foreground Verification, Background Operation

           The BFTP 'verify' command may be used to ascertain that file
           transfer parameters are valid.  It causes BFTP to connect to
           the FTP servers on both the source and the destination hosts
           (if possible), log into both, verify the FTP parameters, and
           verify that the specified source file is present.

           Once the 'verify' command has successfully completed, the
           user can issue the 'submit' command to schedule the actual
           file transfer.


      o    Foreground Operation

           The BFTP 'transfer' command will perform the specified
           third-party transfer in foreground mode.  This is illustrated
           by the dotted path bypassing the queue in Figure 1.


      The easiest way to set up the parameters is to issue the 'prompt'
      command, which will prompt the user for all of the basic
      parameters required for most transfers.  Certain unusual
      parameters must be set with the 'set' command (see <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for
      details).

      When entering any parameter, the following control characters may
      be used:

      ?    will display help text for the parameter, indicating its
           meaning, the choices, and the default, and then reprompt for
           the parameter.

      &lt;ESC&gt; will display the default value (or the last value set) for
           this parameter.  The user can accept this default by entering
           &lt;Return&gt;, or else erase it with Control-W and enter a
           different value for the parameter, followed by &lt;Return&gt; to
           accept the entered value.

      &lt;Control-W&gt;
           will erase the value typed or displayed for current
           parameter.

      &lt;Return&gt;
           will accept the value displayed for this parameter, and
           continue to the next parameter, if any.  If the user has not
           typed a value or used &lt;ESC&gt; to display the default, &lt;Return&gt;
           will display the default and then accept it.

      It is important to provide a means for a user to obtain status
      information about an earlier request or even to cancel an earlier
      request.  However, these functions, especially cancellation, must
      be controlled by some user authentication.  We did not want to
      build a user authentication database with each BFTP instance or
      require login to BFTP itself, and there is no Internet-wide user
      authentication mechanism.  We adopted the following weak
      authentication mechanism as a compromise:

      *    When the 'submit' command is issued, it prompts the user for
           a character string called a "keyword", which recorded with
           the request.

      *    This keyword can be entered later as the argument to a 'find'
           command, which will display the status of all requests with
           matching keywords.

      *    Similarly, the keyword may be used to cancel the
           corresponding request.

      If two different users happen to choose the same keywords, of
      course, this scheme will not protect each other's requests from
      accidental or malicious cancellation.  However, a notification
      message will be sent at the time that a cancellation occurs.

      To make a series of similar requests, the user needs only to
      change the individual parameters that differ from the preceding
      request and then issue a new 'submit' command, for each request.
      There are commands for individually setting each of the parameters
      that 'prompt' sets -- and 'time' -- to provide a shortcut for BFTP
      experts.  A simpler but lengthier procedure is to use the 'prompt'
      command to run through the current set of parameters, reentering
      the parameters that must change and using the sequence
      &lt;ESC&gt;&lt;return&gt; to retain the previous value for each of the others.
      The same procedures may be used to correct a mistake made in
      entering a particular parameter.

      The current settings of all the BFTP parameters can be displayed
      at any time with the 'status' command, while the 'clear' command
      will return all parameters to their initial values.  Finally, the
      'request' command allows the user to save the current set of
      parameters in a file or to restore the parameters from a
      previously-saved file.

      There is also a window-based BFTP user interface for use on a Sun
      Workstation, described in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  The complete list of BFTP
      commands is presented in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>. Experience and Conclusions</span>

   BFTP has been available to users at ISI for some months.  Users have
   reported a number of advantages of using BFTP:

   (a)  Some users prefer the prompting style of BFTP to the user
        interface of the foreground FTP they normally use.

   (b)  The BFTP "verify" command allows the user to verify that host
        names, passwords, and filenames are correct without having to
        wait for the entire transfer to take place.

   (c)  Since results are returned through the mail system, a transfer
        can occur without tying up a terminal line, a phone line, or
        even a window.


   BFTP must be able to communicate with a variety of Server-FTP
   implementations, and we have observed much variation in the commands
   supported, error handling, and the timing in these servers.  Some of
   the problems we have encountered are:

   (1)  Some systems (e.g., 4.2BSD) do not support the PASV command.

   (2)  4.2/3BSD systems return a non-standard response to the NLST
        command.  Instead of returning a list of complete path-names,
        they use an ad hoc format consisting of a directory name
        followed by a list of files.

   (3)  4.2/3BSD systems may return a "permanent negative completion
        reply" (a 5xx FTP reply code) as a result of a communications
        failure such as a broken TCP connection.  According to <a href="rfc959.html">RFC-959</a>,
        the appropriate response is a "transient negative completion
        reply" (a 4xx FTP reply code), which would inform the BFTP that
        the transfer should be retried.

   (4)  A number of servers return badly formatted responses.  An
        example of this is the 4.2/3BSD response to an NLST command for
        a non-existent file name: an error string which is not preceded
        by a numerical response code.


   To diagnose problems that do occur, we have found it very useful to
   have a complete record of the interchange between the FTC daemon and
   the two FTP servers.  This record is saved and is currently always
   included in the notification message mailed to the user (see <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix</a>
   <a href="#appendix-D">D</a> for an example).  As we get more experience with this program, some
   of the details of the transfer may be omitted from this log.

   The use of library routines shared between modules makes it
   relatively easy to implement additional user interface programs.  We
   are currently experimenting with a window version of BFTP, the
   "bftptool", which runs in the SunView environment, and is described
   in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Some additional interfaces that might be useful are:

   o    A command line interface for use in shell scripts and
        "Makefiles".

   o    A more general library interface which would make it easy to
        invoke BFTP from a variety of programs.

   o    Additional full-screen form based interfaces, for example a tool
        running in X-Window system environment.


   Lastly, BFTP would benefit from the resolution of the following open
   protocol issues:

   o    There currently exist no provisions for Internet-wide user
        authentication.  In the BFTP context, this means that passwords
        required for a file transfer must be present in BFTP request
        files.  The security of these passwords is subject to the
        limitations of the file system security on the BFTP control
        host.  Anonymous file transfer provides a partial solution, but
        a more general, long term solution is needed.

   o    Better mechanisms are needed to cope with the diversity of real
        file systems in the Internet.

        For example, an extension could be made to the FTP protocol to
        allow the daemon to learn the delimiter conventions of each host
        file system.  This could allow a more flexible and powerful
        multiple-file facility in BFTP.  This could include the
        automatic transfer of directory subtrees, for example.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> -- BFTP Implementation Structure</span>

   BFTP has been implemented on both a Sun workstation running Sun OS
   3.4 (based on 4.2BSD) and a VAX running 4.3BSD.  The program modules
   are: the local user interface programs "bftp", the Internet server
   program "bftpd", and the FTC daemon "fts".  BFTP makes use of the
   "at" command, a UNIX batch job facility, to submit requests and
   execute the daemon.  An additional user interface program, the
   "bftptool", is available for Sun OS 3.4, and runs in the SunView
   environment.

   BFTP keeps its state in a set of control files: request files,
   command files, and message files.  These files are stored in the home
   directory specified for the environment of the process running
   "bftp".  If a user is running "bftp" directly, this will typically be
   the user's home directory.  In the case where a user has made a
   Telnet connection to the well-known port 152 on a BFTP service host,
   "bftp" is started by "bftpd" (or "inetd", indirectly).  As a result,
   the control files will be owned by the user-id under which "inetd"
   was started, normally "root", and stored in the top level directory
   "/".  Note, however, that under BFTP all user files are written by
   the FTP servers, which are presumed to enforce the operating systems'
   access control conventions.  Hence, BFTP does not constitute a system
   integrity exposure.

   A.1  User Interface Program

      The BFTP user interface program "bftp" may be run directly via a
      UNIX shell.  Once the program has been started, the prompt "BFTP&gt;"
      will appear and commands may be entered.  These commands are
      described in detail in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

   A.2  Tool-Style User Interface Program

      The BFTP user interface program "bftptool" may be started from a
      shell window in the SunView environment on a Sun workstation.  The
      BFTP commands may be selected via the left mouse button.  The
      various file transfer parameters appear in a form-style interface;
      defaults and multiple-choice style parameter values can be filled
      in via menus.  An advantage of this form-style interface program
      is that it is possible to view all of the file transfer parameters
      simultaneously, providing the user with a sense for which
      parameter values might be mutually exclusive.

      Help information can be displayed in a text subwindow by
      positioning the on-screen mouse pointer over a command or a
      parameter, and clicking the center mouse button.  (No standard
      mechanism for displaying help information is currently included in



<span class="grey">DeSchon &amp; Braden                                               [Page 14]</span>

      the SunView package.)

      The commands used in the "bftptool" are for the most part very
      similar to the commands described in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Request
      submittal and the execution of the FTC daemon are identical for
      the "bftp" and the "bftptool" interface programs.

   A.3  Internet Server

      The Internet server program "bftpd" can be invoked by opening a
      Telnet connection to a well-known port, and does not require
      login.  The "bftpd" program runs under "inetd", the standard
      BSD4.x well-known port dispatcher.  When a SYN arrives for the
      BFTP well-known port, "bftpd" opens the TCP connection and
      performs Telnet negotiations.  It then passes control to the user
      interface "bftp" which allows the user to enter file transfer
      requests.

   A.4  BFTP Server Daemon

      The BFTP file transfer control daemon program is named "fts" (for
      "File Transfer Service").  This module contains code to actually
      cause a single file transfer operation using the FTP server-server
      model as shown in Figures 1 and 2.  It is invoked with the command
      "fts &lt;request-file&gt;".  The &lt;request-file&gt; contains the necessary
      parameters for the file transfer, in ASCII format, separated by
      linefeeds.  Such a request file may be created by the user
      interface program, "bftp".

      As a byproduct of the development of BFTP, "fts" represents a
      server-server FTP driver that can be run independent of the "bftp"
      program.  Parameters used in the file transfer are read from a
      request file, which is created and accessed via library routines
      which can be shared between modules.  This could be used to
      perform FTP's under program control.

Appendix B: BFTP Command Summary

   B.1 Special Editing Characters

      In the "bftp" program, the special editing characters for command
      words, subcommands, and parameter fields are as follows:

        &lt;return&gt;    Accept current command/field.
        &lt;escape&gt;    Complete current command/field, or display default.
        &lt;space&gt;     Complete and delimit current command.
        &lt;delete&gt;    Erase last character.
        control-L   Refresh screen.
        control-R   Refresh line.
        control-U   Erase line.
        control-W   Erase current token.
        ?           List legal options.

   B.2 BFTP Commands

      The remainder of <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> consists of a list of the BFTP
      commands.  Each command should be followed by a carriage-return.
      In the description of the syntax for each command, square brackets
      "[]" are used to indicate a ssubcommand, or a list of possible
      subcommands, which are separated by the "|" character.  Angle
      brackets "&lt;&gt;" are used to indicate a description of a parameter
      where the choices would be too numerous to list, for example
      "&lt;host name/number&gt;".

   B.2.1 Clear Command


      Return all parameters to their default values.

            clear

   B.2.2 Destination Commands

      Set the destination directory.

            ddir &lt;directory name&gt;

      Set the destination file name.

            dfile &lt;file name&gt;

      Set the destination host, user, and password.

            dhost &lt;host name/number&gt; &lt;login&gt; &lt;password&gt;

   B.2.3 Explain Command

      Display a short explanation of how to use BFTP.

            explain

   B.2.4 Find Command

      Find and display a previous request.

            find

      BFTP will prompt for the request id, which is printed when the
      request is first submitted.  An example of a request id is
      "bftp583101774".  BFTP also prompts for the request keyword, which
      was determined by the user when the request was first submitted.
      If no keyword was specified, a &lt;CR&gt; should be typed.  If no
      request id is entered, BFTP will display all requests which
      contain a matching keyword.

            RequestID (optional): &lt;bftp-request-id&gt;
            RequestKeyword: &lt;keyword&gt;

      After BFTP has displayed a summary of a matching request, it asks
      whether the request is to be changed, or canceled.

            Do you wish to change this request? [yes | no]
            Do you wish to cancel this request? [yes | no]

      If the user indicates that the request is to be changed, BFTP will
      read in the parameters and cancel the existing request.  At this
      point the user may make any desired changes and use the "submit"
      command to requeue the request.  At this point a new request id
      will be assigned and displayed.

















<span class="grey">DeSchon &amp; Braden                                               [Page 17]</span>

      Although this may happen extremely rarely, if at all, it is
      possible that a system crash (or the interruption of the BFTP
      program) at a particularly inopportune moment may leave a request
      which is not queued.  When the "find" command locates such a
      request, it displays the warning:

            Your request is NOT currently queued.

      If this happens, the request may be read in and resubmitted using
      the following procedure:

            Your request is NOT currently queued.
            Do you wish to change this request? yes

              (BFTP displays the parameters that have been read in.)

            Previous request canceled.
            Use the 'submit' command to submit a new request.

   B.2.5 Help Command

      Print local help information.

            help
            help &lt;command&gt;

   B.2.6 Quit Command

      Clear parameters and exit the BFTP program.

            quit

   B.2.7 Prompt Command

      Prompt for commonly-used parameters.

            prompt

      The following are the parameters that BFTP prompts for:

            copy/move/delete: [copy | move | delete]
            ascii/ebcdic/image/local:
                  [ascii|ebcdic] [nonprint|telnet|carriage-control]
      or
                  [image]
      or
                  [local] &lt;byte size&gt;
      (see "set type" for additional information)

            Source --
                Host: &lt;host name/number&gt;
                User: &lt;login&gt;
                Password: &lt;password&gt;
                Dir: &lt;directory including a delimiter, e.g., "/" or "&gt;"&gt;
                     (either an absolute path, or relative to the login)
                File: &lt;file name&gt;

            Destination --
                Host: &lt;host name/number&gt;
                User: &lt;login&gt;
                Password: &lt;password&gt;
                Dir: &lt;directory&gt;
                File: &lt;file name&gt;

      Once the prompting has been completed, the current values of all
      parameters will be displayed.  Parameters not mentioned in the
      prompting will be initialized with default values, and may be
      changed via the "set" commands.

   B.2.8 Request Commands

      The request commands enable the user to save a set of BFTP
      parameters in a "request-file" for future use.  Subcommands are
      provided to to list all available request-files, or to read,
      write, or delete a request-file.  All request-files are stored in
      the user's home directory.  Therefore, this facility is not
      available when the user is accessing BFTP by telneting to port
      152.

      Delete request file "bftp-save.name".

            request delete &lt;name&gt;

      List all bftp-save files.

            request list

      Read a request file in as the current request.

            request load &lt;name&gt;

      Save the current request in a file named "bftp-save.name".

            request store &lt;name&gt;

   B.2.9 Set Commands

      The "set" commands have complex subcommand structures and are used
      to set many of the less commonly used FTP parameters. The
      subcommands of "set" are as follows:

      Set the account for the source/destination login.

            set account [source | destination] &lt;account string&gt;

      Set to true to append to destination file.

            set append [true | false]

      The source file will be copied to the destination file name.

            set copy

      The source file will be deleted after the file has been moved or
      copied.

            set delete



<span class="grey">DeSchon &amp; Braden                                               [Page 20]</span>

      Set the mailbox to which the results will be returned.  The
      mailbox should be in standard internet format, for example:
      "deschon@isi.edu".

            set mailbox &lt;mailbox string&gt;

      Set the FTP transfer mode.

            set mode [stream | block | compress]

      The source file will be deleted after it has been copied.

            set move

      Set to true to transfer multiple files.

            set multiple [true | false]

      Set the port for the source/destination FTP connection.

            set port [source | destination] &lt;port number&gt;

      Set the FTP structure.

            set structure [file | record | page]

      Set the FTP type and format / byte size parameters.  Note that a
      normal text file is usually "ascii", and a "binary" file is often
      the same as an "image" file.

            set type [ascii|ebcdic] [nonprint|telnet|carriage-control]
      or
            set type [image]
      or
            set type [local] &lt;byte size&gt;

      Set to true if the STOU command is to be used.  If the STOU
      command is supported by the destination host, the file will be
      stored into a file having a unique file name.

            set unique [true | false]

      Set to true to display full FTP conversations for "verify" and
      "transfer" commands.

            set verbose [true | false]
