Status of this Memo

   This RFC describes an existing print server protocol widely used on
   the Internet for communicating between line printer daemons (both
   clients and servers).  This memo is for informational purposes only,
   and does not specify an Internet standard.  Please refer to the
   current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol Standards" for the
   standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   The Berkeley versions of the Unix(tm) operating system provide line
   printer spooling with a collection of programs: lpr (assign to
   queue), lpq (display the queue), lprm (remove from queue), and lpc
   (control the queue).  These programs interact with an autonomous
   process called the line printer daemon.  This RFC describes the
   protocols with which a line printer daemon client may control
   printing.

   This memo is based almost entirely on the work of Robert Knight at
   Princeton University.  I gratefully acknowledge his efforts in
   deciphering the UNIX lpr protocol and producing earlier versions of
   this document.

   A group of hosts request services from a line printer daemon process
   running on a host.  The services provided by the process are related
   to printing jobs.  A printing job produces output from one file.
   Each job will have a unique job number which is between 0 and 999,
   inclusive.  The jobs are requested by users which have names.  These
   user names may not start with a digit.

   The specification includes file formats for the control and data
   files as well as messages used by the protocol.

   LPR is a a TCP-based protocol.  The port on which a line printer
   daemon listens is 515.  The source port must be in the range 721 to
   731, inclusive.  A line printer daemon responds to commands send to
   its port.  All commands begin with a single octet code, which is a
   binary number which represents the requested function.  The code is
   immediately followed by the ASCII name of the printer queue name on
   which the function is to be performed.  If there are other operands
   to the command, they are separated from the printer queue name with
   white space (ASCII space, horizontal tab, vertical tab, and form
   feed).  The end of the command is indicated with an ASCII line feed
   character.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20Diagram%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>. Diagram Conventions</span>

   The diagrams in the rest of this RFC use these conventions.  These
   diagrams show the format of an octet stream sent to the server.  The
   outermost box represents this stream.  Each box within the outermost
   one shows one portion of the stream.  If the contents of the box is
   two decimal digits, this indicates that the binary 8 bit value is to
   be used.  If the contents is two uppercase letters, this indicates
   that the corresponding ASCII control character is to be used.  An
   exception to this is that the character SP can be interpreted as
   white space.  (See the preceding section for a definition.)  If the
   contents is a single letter, the ASCII code for this letter must be
   sent.  Otherwise, the contents are intended to be mnemonic of the
   contents of the field which is a sequence of octets.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20Daemon%20commands"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>. Daemon commands</span>

   The verbs in the command names should be interpreted as statements
   made to the daemon.  Thus, the command "Print any waiting jobs" is an
   imperative to the line printer daemon to which it is sent.  A new
   connection must be made for each command to be given to the daemon.

      Command code - 2
      Operand - Printer queue name

   Receiving a job is controlled by a second level of commands.  The
   daemon is given commands by sending them over the same connection.
   The commands are described in the next section (6).

   After this command is sent, the client must read an acknowledgement
   octet from the daemon.  A positive acknowledgement is an octet of
   zero bits.  A negative acknowledgement is an octet of any other
   pattern.

   The stream continues until the connection closes.  Ends of lines are

      Command code - 5
      Operand 1 - Printer queue name
      Operand 2 - User name making request (the agent)
      Other operands - User names or job numbers

   This command deletes the print jobs from the specified queue which
   are listed as the other operands.  If only the agent is given, the
   command is to delete the currently active job.  Unless the agent is
   "root", it is not possible to delete a job which is not owned by the
   user.  This is also the case for specifying user names instead of
   numbers.  That is, agent "root" can delete jobs by user name but no
   other agents can.

   These commands  are processed when  the line printer  daemon  has
   been given the  receive job command.  The  daemon will continue  to
   process commands until the connection is closed.

   After a subcommand is sent, the client must wait for an
   acknowledgement from the daemon.  A positive acknowledgement is an
   octet of zero bits.  A negative acknowledgement is an octet of any
   other pattern.

   LPR clients SHOULD be able to sent the receive data file and receive
   control file subcommands in either order.  LPR servers MUST be able
   to receive the control file subcommand first and SHOULD be able to
   receive the data file subcommand first.

      Command code - 2
      Operand 1 - Number of bytes in control file
      Operand 2 - Name of control file

   The control file must be an ASCII stream with the ends of lines
   indicated by ASCII LF.  The total number of bytes in the stream is
   sent as the first operand.  The name of the control file is sent as
   the second.  It should start with ASCII "cfA", followed by a three
   digit job number, followed by the host name which has constructed the
   control file.  Acknowledgement processing must occur as usual after
   the command is sent.

   The next "Operand 1" octets over the same TCP connection are the
   intended contents of the control file.  Once all of the contents have
   been delivered, an octet of zero bits is sent as an indication that
   the file being sent is complete.  A second level of acknowledgement
   processing must occur at this point.

      Command code - 3
      Operand 1 - Number of bytes in data file
      Operand 2 - Name of data file

   The data file may contain any 8 bit values at all.  The total number
   of bytes in the stream may be sent as the first operand, otherwise
   the field should be cleared to 0.  The name of the data file should
   start with ASCII "dfA".  This should be followed by a three digit job
   number.  The job number should be followed by the host name which has
   constructed the data file.  Interpretation of the contents of the
   data file is determined by the contents of the corresponding control
   file.  If a data file length has been specified, the next "Operand 1"
   octets over the same TCP connection are the intended contents of the
   data file.  In this case, once all of the contents have been
   delivered, an octet of zero bits is sent as an indication that the
   file being sent is complete.  A second level of acknowledgement
   processing must occur at this point.

   This section  discusses the format of  the lines in the  control file
   which is sent to the line printer daemon.

   Each line of the control file consists of a single, printable ASCII
   character which represents a function to be performed when the file
   is printed.  Interpretation of these command characters are case-
   sensitive.  The rest of the line after the command character is the
   command's operand.  No leading white space is permitted after the
   command character.  The line ends with an ASCII new line.

   Those commands which have a lower case letter as a command code are
   used to specify an actual printing request.  The commands which use
   upper case are used to describe parametric values or background
   conditions.

   Some commands must be included in every control file.  These are 'H'
   (responsible host) and 'P' (responsible user).  Additionally, there
   must be at least one lower case command to produce any output.

   This command sets the class name to be printed on the banner page.
   The name must be 31 or fewer octets.  The name can be omitted.  If it
   is, the name of the host on which the file is printed will be used.
   The class is conventionally used to display the host from which the
   printing job originated.  It will be ignored unless the print banner
   command ('L') is also used.
