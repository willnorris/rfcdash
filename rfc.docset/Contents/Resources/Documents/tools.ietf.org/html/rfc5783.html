<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   In this document, we define congestion control as the feedback-based
   adjustment of the rate at which data is sent into the network.
   Congestion control is an indispensable set of principles and
   mechanisms for maintaining the stability of the Internet.  Congestion
   control has been closely associated with TCP since 1988 [<a href="#ref-Jac88" title="&quot;Congestion Avoidance and Control&quot;">Jac88</a>], but
   there has also been a great deal of congestion control work outside
   of TCP (e.g., for real-time multimedia applications, multicast, and
   router-based mechanisms).  Several such proposals have been produced
   within the IETF and published as RFCs, along with RFCs that give
   architectural guidance (e.g., by pointing out the importance of
   performing some form of congestion control).  Several of these
   mechanisms are in use within the Internet.

   When designing a new Internet transport protocol, it is therefore
   important to not only understand how congestion control works in TCP
   but also have a broader understanding of the other congestion control
   RFCs -- some give guidance, some of them describe mechanisms that may
   have a direct influence on a newly designed protocol, and some of
   them may only be "related work" worth knowing about.  The purpose of
   this document is to facilitate and encourage this search for
   knowledge by providing an overview of RFCs related to congestion
   control that have been published thus far.  This document is a
   product of the IRTF's Internet Congestion Control Research Group
   (ICCRG).  It was developed because a strong grasp of the existing
   literature should benefit further ICCRG work.  The ICCRG developed
   consensus on the content of this document during a two-year
   development period based on review comments and ICCRG mailing list
   discussions.  A list of the main review contributors is contained in
   the Acknowledgements section of this document.

   While the ICCRG agreed to the document's production, any opinions
   expressed are the authors' own, and as this document is not an IETF
   publication, it does not update or modify the status of any published
   RFCs.  The format of this document is similar to an annotated
   bibliography.  Although host and router requirements for congestion
   control functions are discussed, this is only an informational
   document and does not contain any formal standards bearing of its
   own.

   Congestion control is a large and active topic, and so the scope of
   this document is limited to published RFCs and a small number of
   current working group drafts.  This allows the document to focus on
   congestion control principles and mechanisms that are among the most
   well-supported, well-accepted, or widely used.  Significant
   contributions to this subject also exist in both the academic
   literature and in the form of Internet-Drafts; however, we exclude

   these from this study.  In many cases the RFC describing some
   mechanism will contain references to relevant academic publications
   in journals or conference proceedings that presented the research and
   validation of the mechanism.  For instance, <a href="rfc2581.html">RFC 2581</a> cites Jacobson's
   1988 SIGCOMM paper that has a less standards-oriented but more
   illustrative treatment and explanation of some of the mechanisms in
   <a href="rfc2581.html">RFC 2581</a>.

   The majority of the documents discussed here pertain to end-host-
   based congestion control.  Many network-based mechanisms, such as a
   number of queue management algorithms, do not require any protocol
   exchanges between elements, but merely operate within a single host
   or router.  Thus, network-based congestion control mechanisms have
   often not been described in any RFC, as they generally fall under the
   domain of implementation details that do not influence
   interoperability.

   There are many RFCs related to Quality of Service (QoS), especially
   within the Integrated Services and Differentiated Services frameworks
   [<a href="rfc1633.html" title="&quot;Integrated Services in the Internet Architecture: an Overview&quot;">RFC1633</a>] [<a href="rfc2475.html" title="&quot;An Architecture for Differentiated Services&quot;">RFC2475</a>] [<a href="rfc2998.html" title="&quot;A Framework for Integrated Services Operation over Diffserv Networks&quot;">RFC2998</a>].  These QoS RFCs themselves deserve a
   similar bibliography to the one that this document provides for
   congestion control.  We specifically do not include the vast amount
   of QoS work into the scope of this document, as it is a full field in
   its own right, and deals with issues that are mostly orthogonal to
   end-host congestion control and router queue management.  Although
   there can certainly be interactions between QoS and congestion
   control mechanisms, scheduling mechanisms used to implement QoS (on
   either a per-flow or an aggregate basis), for instance, can be used
   independently of the end-host congestion control and queue management
   functions also in use.  Similar arguments can be made for traffic-
   shaping, admission control, and other functions that are intended for
   QoS and are only side-notes for congestion control.

   A similar argument can be made for excluding consideration of the
   media access control (MAC) layer protocols used by the links
   throughout a path.  Although the MAC protocols implement various
   forms of resolving contention for shared links (and sometimes offer
   QoS services), these are also distinct from end-to-end congestion
   control.  Furthermore, MAC protocols are not typically discussed in
   the RFC series, but they are defined in outside documents (e.g., IEEE
   standards), since the IETF does not generally work on link layers
   themselves.  Few, if any, of the RFCs that describe mappings of IP
   onto various link layers directly discuss congestion control.

   To organize the subject matter in this document, the content is
   classified into several broad categories.  First, we list documents
   relating to Internet architecture and general architectural concepts
   in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.  Next, the congestion control algorithms used in the

   TCP transport protocol are discussed in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  Interactions
   between link properties and mechanisms with the kinds of algorithms
   and heuristics used within end-to-end congestion control are covered
   in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  One method that has been developed by the IETF (and
   deployed to some extent) for allowing network-based and host-based
   congestion control to interact without dropping packets is the
   subject of <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>.  The congestion control algorithms used by
   unicast transport protocols other than TCP are described in
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.  Work on congestion control for multicast transports and
   applications is listed in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.  RFCs that give guidance to
   developers of new algorithms are discussed in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.  Finally,
   documents that have historic significance, but perhaps not current

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Architectural Documents</span>

   Some documents in this section contain architectural guidance and
   concerns, while others specify congestion-control-related mechanisms
   that are broadly applicable and have impacts on more than a single
   class of congestion control techniques.  Some of these documents are
   direct products of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), giving
   their guidance on specific aspects of congestion control in the
   Internet.

   <a href="rfc1122.html">RFC 1122</a>: "Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers"
      (October 1989)

      [<a name="ref-RFC1122" id="ref-RFC1122">RFC1122</a>] formally mandates that hosts perform congestion control.
      For TCP, several congestion control features are described and
      listed as required elements of conforming implementations, and for
      UDP, <a href="rfc1122.html">RFC 1122</a> leaves congestion control as an issue for higher-
      layered protocols.  Although sending and reacting to ICMP Source
      Quench packets is no longer recommended [<a href="rfc1812.html" title="&quot;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers&quot;">RFC1812</a>] [<a href="#ref-Gont10" title="&quot;ICMP attacks against TCP&quot;">Gont10</a>], the
      rest of the congestion control guidance in this RFC is still a
      basis for several current practices in TCP implementations.


   <a href="rfc1812.html">RFC 1812</a>: "Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers" (June 1995)

      Numerous issues relevant to router behavior are discussed in
      [<a href="rfc1812.html" title="&quot;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers&quot;">RFC1812</a>], and requirements for routers to support are prescribed
      within the document.  Portions of <a href="rfc1812.html">RFC 1812</a> that are particularly
      relevant to congestion control include the directive that routers
      SHOULD NOT originate ICMP Source Quench messages, discussion of
      precedence in queueing, and <a href="#section-5.3.6">Section 5.3.6</a> titled "Congestion

      product of the bandwidth of the link times the path delay of the
      flows using the link, and advises on the implementation of active
      queue management techniques.


   <a href="rfc1958.html">RFC 1958</a>: "Architectural Principles of the Internet" (June 1996)

      Several guidelines for network systems design that have proven
      useful in the evolution of the Internet are sketched in [<a href="rfc1958.html" title="&quot;Architectural Principles of the Internet&quot;">RFC1958</a>].
      Congestion control is not specifically mentioned or alluded to,
      but the general principles apply to congestion control.  For
      instance, performing end-to-end functions at end nodes, lack of
      centralized control, heterogeneity, scalability, simplicity,
      avoiding options and parameters, etc., are all valid concerns in
      the design and assessment of congestion control schemes for the
      Internet.


   <a href="rfc2140.html">RFC 2140</a>: "TCP Control Block Interdependence" (April 1997)

      [<a name="ref-RFC2140" id="ref-RFC2140">RFC2140</a>] suggests that TCP connections between the same endpoints
      might share some information, including their congestion control
      state.  To some degree, this is done in practice by a few current
      operating systems; for example, Linux currently has a destination
      cache with this information, but this behavior is not yet formally
      standardized or recognized as a best practice by the IETF.


   <a href="rfc2309.html">RFC 2309</a>: "Recommendations on Queue Management and Congestion
      Avoidance in the Internet" (April 1998)

      [<a name="ref-RFC2309" id="ref-RFC2309">RFC2309</a>] briefly discusses the history of congestion and the
      origin of congestion control in the Internet.  The focus is mainly
      on network- or router-based queue management algorithms.  This RFC
      recommends to test, standardize, and deploy Active Queue
      Management (AQM) in routers; it provides an overview of one such
      mechanism, Random Early Detection (RED), and explains how and why
      AQM mechanisms can improve the performance of the Internet.
      Finally, this document explains the danger of a possible
      "congestion collapse" from unresponsive flows and makes a strong
      recommendation to develop and eventually deploy router mechanisms
      to protect the Internet from such traffic.

      Today, the advice in this document has been followed to some
      extent.  Hardware and software vendors have been receptive, and
      AQM techniques are widely available in many popular dedicated
      commercial router products and even in more general operating

      systems that are sometimes used as routers.  However, AQM
      techniques may not be enabled in default configurations of these
      systems, and it is often left to users and network engineers to
      enable and configure AQM mechanisms when desired.  In some cases,
      enabling QoS mechanisms on a device also enables AQM mechanisms by
      default.  The number of production routers that actually have
      these AQM features enabled is an open question.


   <a href="rfc2914.html">RFC 2914</a> (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp41">BCP 41</a>): "Congestion Control Principles" (September 2000)

      [<a name="ref-RFC2914" id="ref-RFC2914">RFC2914</a>] is an explanation of the principles of congestion
      control, and the IETF's Best Current Practice for congestion
      control design.  It points out that there are an increasing number
      of applications that do not use TCP, and elaborates on the
      importance of performing congestion control for such traffic in
      order to prevent congestion collapse.  The TCP Reno congestion
      control mechanisms are described as an example of end-to-end
      congestion control within transport protocols.

      SCTP is one example of a non-TCP transport protocol that
      implements congestion control based on these principles.  The
      developments of TFRC [<a href="rfc3448.html" title="&quot;TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification&quot;">RFC3448</a>] and DCCP [<a href="rfc4340.html" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>] are attempts to
      provide useful tools implementing those principles for
      applications with needs similar to streaming media, where TCP's
      reactions are too fast.  It would be beneficial for users and the
      Internet itself if these carefully designed tools become widely
      deployed in place of other ad hoc schemes that may not be well-
      grounded in the congestion control principles.  This replacement
      process is ongoing and not yet complete.  Appropriate and usable
      congestion control schemes for non-TCP flows continue to be an
      open research area.


   <a href="rfc3124.html">RFC 3124</a>: "The Congestion Manager" (June 2001)

      [<a name="ref-RFC3124" id="ref-RFC3124">RFC3124</a>] specifies the Congestion Manager, an end-system service
      that realizes congestion control on a per-host-pair rather than a
      per-connection basis, which may be a more appropriate way to carry
      out congestion control.  Using the Congestion Manager, multiple
      streams between two hosts (which may include TCP flows) can adapt
      to network congestion in a unified fashion.

      This proposal is related to <a href="rfc2140.html">RFC 2140</a>, discussed above, but with a
      wider scope than TCP.  Because some pieces of its supporting
      architecture have not yet been specified, the Congestion Manager's
      techniques are not commonly used today and have not been widely
      implemented and deployed yet beyond experimental stacks.  Sharing

      continues to be an open research area with branches in detecting
      shared bottlenecks when using multiple paths, caching of old state
      for faster startup, and sharing of current state and feedback.


   <a href="rfc3426.html">RFC 3426</a>: "General Architectural and Policy Considerations" (November
      2002)

      [<a name="ref-RFC3426" id="ref-RFC3426">RFC3426</a>] lists a number of questions that can be answered for a
      particular technical solution to determine its architectural
      impact and desirability.  These are valid for congestion control
      mechanisms, and end-point congestion management is used as an
      example case-study several times in <a href="rfc3426.html">RFC 3426</a>.  Two salient
      questions that <a href="rfc3426.html">RFC 3426</a> advises asking about proposed mechanisms
      are why they are needed in addition to existing protocols, and why
      they are needed at a certain layer rather than at other layers.
      These are particularly relevant for congestion control mechanisms
      since several already exist and since they can span network,
      transport, and application layers.


   <a href="rfc3439.html">RFC 3439</a>: "Some Internet Architectural Guidelines and Philosophy"
      (December 2002)

      [<a name="ref-RFC3439" id="ref-RFC3439">RFC3439</a>] supplements <a href="rfc1958.html">RFC 1958</a>.  Simplicity is stressed, as the
      unpredictable results of complexity (due to amplification and
      coupling) are described.  Congestion control issues stemming from
      layering interactions between transport and lower protocols are
      presented, as well as other items relevant to congestion control,
      including asymmetry and the "myth of over-provisioning".


   <a href="rfc3714.html">RFC 3714</a>: "IAB Concerns Regarding Congestion Control for Voice
      Traffic in the Internet" (March 2004)

      [<a name="ref-RFC3714" id="ref-RFC3714">RFC3714</a>] can be seen as a follow-up to the concerns that were
      discussed in <a href="rfc2914.html">RFC 2914</a>.  It expresses the IAB's concern over the
      lack of effective end-to-end congestion control for best-effort
      voice traffic, which is noted as being a current service with
      growing demand.  An example of a VoIP connection between Atlanta,
      Georgia, USA, and Nairobi, Kenya, is given, where a single VoIP
      call consumed more than half of the access link capacity (which is
      normally shared across several different users).  This example is
      used as the basis for further discussion, making it clear that
      using some form of congestion control for VoIP traffic is highly
      recommended.

   The TCP specifications found in <a href="rfc793.html">RFC 793</a> and its predecessors did not
   contain any discussion of using or managing a congestion window.
   Other than a simple retransmission timeout and flow control through
   the advertised receive window, TCP implementations based only on <a href="rfc793.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc793.html">793</a> do not contain congestion control.  As several congestion
   collapse events occurred on the Internet, it was later realized that
   congestion control was needed.  The host requirements in <a href="rfc1122.html">RFC 1122</a>
   require conforming TCP implementations to implement Jacobson's slow
   start and congestion avoidance algorithms (later specified in <a href="rfc2001.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2001.html">2001</a> and then <a href="rfc2581.html">RFC 2581</a>).  <a href="rfc1122.html">RFC 1122</a> also recommends several other
   behaviors that influence congestion control like the Nagle algorithm,
   delayed acknowledgements, Jacobson's retransmission timeout (RTO)
   estimation algorithm, and exponential backoff of the retransmission
   timer.

   Basic TCP congestion control is defined in <a href="rfc2581.html">RFC 2581</a>, with many other
   RFCs that specify ancillary modifications and enhancements.  <a href="rfc2581.html">RFC 2581</a>
   obsoletes the first proposed standard for TCP congestion control in
   <a href="rfc2001.html">RFC 2001</a>.  These two RFCs document the mechanisms that had already
   been in common use by TCP implementations for many years.  The reader
   may refer to the TCP Roadmap [<a href="rfc4614.html" title="&quot;A Roadmap for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Specification Documents&quot;">RFC4614</a>] for more information on the
   RFCs that specifically describe TCP congestion control, as this
   material is not replicated here.

   Recently, significant effort has been put into experimental TCP
   congestion control modifications for obtaining high throughput with
   reduced startup and recovery times.  RFCs have been published on some
   of these modifications, including HighSpeed TCP [<a href="rfc3649.html" title="&quot;HighSpeed TCP for Large Congestion Windows&quot;">RFC3649</a>], and
   Limited Slow-Start [<a href="rfc3742.html" title="&quot;Limited Slow-Start for TCP with Large Congestion Windows&quot;">RFC3742</a>], but high-rate congestion control
   mechanisms are still considered an open issue in congestion control
   research.  Other schemes have been published as Internet-Drafts or
   have been discussed a little by the IETF, but much of the work in
   this area has not been adopted within the IETF yet, so the majority
   of this work is outside the RFC series and may be discussed in other
   products of the ICCRG.

   At the time of writing, the IETF's TCP Maintenance and Minor
   Extensions (TCPM) Working Group was developing an update to <a href="rfc2581.html">RFC 2581</a>
   to incorporate small changes from other documents and advance TCP
   congestion control mechanisms on the IETF Standards Track.  The
   update also clarifies and revises some points.  These include the
   definition of a duplicate ACK, initial congestion window and slow
   start threshold values, behavior in response to retransmission
   timeouts, the use of the limited transmit mechanism, and security
   with regards to misbehaving receivers that practice ACK division.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Challenging Link and Path Characteristics</span>

   Links with large and/or variable bandwidth-delay products have
   traditionally been problematic for congestion control schemes because
   they can distort the properties of the feedback loop.  Links that
   either expose a high rate of packet losses to the upper layers, or
   use highly-persistent retransmission mechanisms to prevent losses
   also cause problems with some of the standard congestion control
   mechanisms.  The documents in this section discuss challenging link
   characteristics; many of them were written by the Performance
   Implications of Link Characteristics (PILC) Working Group.

   While these documents often refer to specific problems with TCP, the
   link characteristics that they describe can be expected to affect
   other congestion control mechanisms too.  In particular, interactions
   between link properties and TCP congestion control will be shared by
   other protocols that use the similar congestion control behavior,
   such as SCTP [<a href="rfc4960.html" title="&quot;Stream Control Transmission Protocol&quot;">RFC4960</a>] and DCCP with CCID 2 [<a href="rfc4341.html" title="&quot;Profile for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control ID 2: TCP-like Congestion Control&quot;">RFC4341</a>] (see
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>), and should be taken into consideration by designers of
   congestion control mechanisms that utilize the same kind of feedback
   as TCP.

   Some RFCs only make recommendations regarding the implementation and
   configuration of TCP based upon characteristics of special links.  As
   these RFCs are so closely connected to the specification of TCP
   itself, they are not included in this document, but are listed in the
   TCP Roadmap [<a href="rfc4614.html" title="&quot;A Roadmap for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Specification Documents&quot;">RFC4614</a>].

      The summary of recommendations in [<a href="rfc2488.html" title="&quot;Enhancing TCP Over Satellite Channels using Standard Mechanisms&quot;">RFC2488</a>] came from the TCP over
      Satellite (TCPSAT) Working Group, whose goal was to identify the
      performance problems that TCP may have over satellite links and
      suggest mitigations.  The document explains several ways that
      existing standards can be applied to improve the performance of
      basic TCP congestion control over paths with characteristics
      similar to those involving satellite links.

      often employed to improve degraded TCP performance caused by

      improve performance.  While there is a specific focus on TCP in
      this document, PEPs can operate on any protocol, and the
      performance enhancements that PEPs achieve are often closely
      related to congestion control.

      The use of PEPs has architectural implications as they sometimes
      violate end-to-end assumptions and can add complexity to the inner
      portions of a network.  Certain types of PEPs are commonly used
      today in satellite or long-distance networking because it is
      easier to insert a small number of PEPs near problematic links
      than to upgrade the TCP implementations on all the end hosts that
      might use those links.  One down-side is that their deployment
      raises some issues when introducing new or updated congestion
      control (CC) methods into these deployed networks, since the PEPs
      may be operating with undocumented algorithms, making assumptions
      about the end-host CC behavior, and/or altering packet fields that
      will affect the end-host CC behavior.

   information to packets that makes the network's congestion state less
   of a mystery to end-host congestion controllers.  Routers supporting
   these can signal information about the current congestion state to
   flows in-band, providing faster and finer-grained information than
   inference-based methods.  Two examples of this are discussed in this
   section; the first directs sources to slow down in order to avoid
   losses, and the other assists in determining an appropriate starting
   rate for new flows.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Explicit Congestion Notification</span>

   Traditionally, under congestion, IP routers enqueue packets until
   some limit is reached, at which point packets are dropped.  TCP, and
   other IETF transport protocols, use a stream of acknowledgements to
   infer these losses and take congestion control action.  This section
   describes a more advanced way to signal congestion to sources before
   packet-dropping is required.

   There are two Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits in the IP
   header that enable an AQM mechanism (see [<a href="rfc2309.html" title="&quot;Recommendations on Queue Management and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet&quot;">RFC2309</a>] or <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) to
   convey congestion information to endpoints without dropping packets.
   This can significantly reduce the losses experienced by transport
   endpoints if they are responsive to ECN.  While ECN is most
   frequently discussed in the context of TCP (and therefore included in
   the TCP Roadmap [<a href="rfc4614.html" title="&quot;A Roadmap for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Specification Documents&quot;">RFC4614</a>]), its applicability is broader, and ECN use
   has also been specified for protocols such as DCCP and SCTP.

   <a href="rfc2481.html">RFC 2481</a>: "A Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
      to IP" (January 1999) - Obsoleted by <a href="rfc3168.html">RFC 3168</a>

      [<a name="ref-RFC2481" id="ref-RFC2481">RFC2481</a>] introduced ECN into the RFC series, describing when the
      Congestion Experienced (CE) bit in the IP header should be set in
      routers, and what modifications are needed to TCP to make it ECN-
      capable.  It includes a discussion of issues related to nodes and
      routers that are non-compliant, IPsec tunnels, and dropped or
      corrupted packets, as well as a summary of related work.  Many of
      these issues will also be faced by operators trying to deploy
      other network-based congestion control methods.  <a href="rfc2481.html">RFC 2481</a> has been
      obsoleted by <a href="rfc3168.html">RFC 3168</a>.


   <a href="rfc2884.html">RFC 2884</a>: "Performance Evaluation of Explicit Congestion Notification
      (ECN) in IP Networks" (July 2000)

      [<a name="ref-RFC2884" id="ref-RFC2884">RFC2884</a>] presents a performance study of ECN as specified in
      [<a href="rfc2481.html" title="&quot;A Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP&quot;">RFC2481</a>] using an implementation on the Linux operating system.
      The experiments focused on ECN for both bulk and transactional
      transfers, showing that there is improvement in throughput over
      TCP without ECN in the case of bulk transfers and substantial
      improvement for transactional transfers.  Studies like this help
      to build the community's confidence that extensions like ECN are
      both safe and valuable.  Similar RFCs helped the community accept
      larger initial windows for TCP [<a href="rfc2414.html" title="&quot;Increasing TCP's Initial Window&quot;">RFC2414</a>] [<a href="rfc2415.html" title="&quot;Simulation Studies of Increased Initial TCP Window Size&quot;">RFC2415</a>] [<a href="rfc2416.html" title="&quot;When TCP Starts Up With Four Packets Into Only Three Buffers&quot;">RFC2416</a>].

   <a href="rfc3168.html">RFC 3168</a>: "The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to
      IP" (September 2001)

      [<a href="rfc3168.html" title="&quot;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP&quot;">RFC3168</a>], which obsoletes [<a href="rfc2481.html" title="&quot;A Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP&quot;">RFC2481</a>], specifies the incorporation
      of ECN into TCP and IP.  One notable change in this significantly
      extended specification is the definition of a bit combination that
      was not defined in [<a href="rfc2481.html" title="&quot;A Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP&quot;">RFC2481</a>], which can be used to realize a nonce
      that would prevent a receiver from falsely claiming that there was
      no congestion.  Potential issues related to ECN are discussed at
      length, including those already included in [<a href="rfc2481.html" title="&quot;A Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP&quot;">RFC2481</a>] and
      backwards compatibility with implementations that would follow the
      specification in the obsoleted document.

      ECN, as specified in <a href="rfc3168.html">RFC 3168</a>, is implemented in several popular
      router and end-host platforms.  It is in active use, to at least
      some extent.  Problems with ECN "blackholes" (Internet routers
      misconfigured to discard packets with ECN-capable bits set) were
      discovered when ECN was enabled by default in some end-host
      operating systems.  Fears about the persisting presence of these
      blackholes currently may be keeping ECN from being used by default
      in many end-host operating systems even though it is implemented
      as an option within them.  Some measurements on ECN support and
      usability are available [<a href="#ref-PF01" title="&quot;On Inferring TCP Behavior&quot;">PF01</a>] [<a href="#ref-MAF04" title="&quot;Measuring Interactions Between Transport Protocols and Middleboxes&quot;">MAF04</a>] [<a href="#ref-MAF05" title="&quot;Measuring the Evolution of Transport Protocols in the Internet&quot;">MAF05</a>].


   <a href="rfc3540.html">RFC 3540</a>: "Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signaling
      with Nonces" (June 2003)

      [<a name="ref-RFC3540" id="ref-RFC3540">RFC3540</a>] specifies a nonce mechanism that uses an ECN bit
      combination that is not used in [<a href="rfc2481.html" title="&quot;A Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP&quot;">RFC2481</a>], but that is specified
      in [<a href="rfc3168.html" title="&quot;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP&quot;">RFC3168</a>] to allow a one-bit ECN nonce.  This nonce mechanism
      includes a Nonce Sum (NS) field in the TCP header so that senders
      can ensure that ACKs that do not indicate congestion are credible.
      The mechanism improves the robustness of congestion control by
      preventing receivers from exploiting ECN to gain an unfair share
      of network bandwidth.

      This nonce technique is not understood to have been widely
      implemented or deployed, and there has been some discussion as to
      whether the mechanism is really effective or is the best use of
      these bits (see emails to the IETF Transport Area Working Group
      (TSVWG) mailing list, in the thread "ECN nonce snag in TCP ESTATS
      MIB" from December 2006 - January 2007, or [<a href="#ref-MBJ07" title="&quot;A TCP Test to Allow Senders to Identify Receiver Non-Compliance&quot;">MBJ07</a>]).

   <a href="rfc4782.html">RFC 4782</a>: "Quick-Start for TCP and IP" (January 2007)

      Quick-Start provides a way for hosts to ask routers to help them
      select an initial sending rate, and use this rate rather than the
      traditional small initial congestion window and slow-start
      algorithm.  [<a href="rfc4782.html" title="&quot;Quick- Start for TCP and IP&quot;">RFC4782</a>] describes the Quick-Start mechanism and its
      use with TCP.  In addition to discussing the benefits of Quick-
      Start, the document also discusses several limitations of the
      Quick-Start technique with respect to some types of tunnels in use
      over the Internet today and other potential costs of Quick-Start
      including those related to router design.  Analysis of the effects
      of misbehaving entities and appendices containing design rationale
      and related work are also notably present in this RFC.

      Many of the issues discussed in <a href="rfc4782.html">RFC 4782</a>, including router
      architecture, network design / tunnels, and misbehaving agents are
      all challenges relevant to other proposals that try to add router
      assistance into the network.  The consideration of these issues
      can be illustrative for other protocol designers, even if they are
      not interested in Quick-Start itself.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Non-TCP Unicast Congestion Control</span>

   In the past, TCP dominated Internet traffic, as it was used for many
   of the popular applications (email, web browsing, file transfer,
   remote login, etc.).  The majority of early congestion control work
   focused on TCP, and the introduction of congestion control into TCP
   alone is often credited with saving the Internet from additional
   congestion collapse events.  Today, TCP has been joined by other
   transport protocols (e.g., custom UDP-based protocols, SCTP, DCCP,
   RTP over UDP [<a href="rfc3550.html" title="&quot;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications&quot;">RFC3550</a>], etc.), and so having properly functioning
   congestion control within these other protocols is important for the
   Internet's health (as explained in <a href="rfc3714.html">RFC 3714</a>, for instance, or see the
   discussion of the "congestion control arms race" scenario in <a href="rfc2914.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2914.html">2914</a>).  Documents that describe unicast congestion control methods
   for non-TCP transport protocols have been grouped into this section.


   <a href="rfc4960.html">RFC 4960</a>: "Stream Control Transmission Protocol" (September 2007)

      SCTP congestion control is very similar to TCP with Selective
      Acknowledgements, but there are some differences, as described in
      <a href="rfc4960.html#section-7.1">Section&nbsp;7.1 of [RFC4960]</a>.  The major difference lies in the fact
      that SCTP supports multihoming, whereas TCP does not.  Thus, SCTP

      keeps a different set of congestion control parameters for each
      destination address within an association, whereas TCP only keeps
      a single set of congestion control parameters per connection.


   <a href="rfc5348.html">RFC 5348</a>: "TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification"
      (September 2008)

      [<a href="rfc5348.html" title="&quot;TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification&quot;">RFC5348</a>], which obsoletes [<a href="rfc3448.html" title="&quot;TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification&quot;">RFC3448</a>], specifies TCP-Friendly Rate
      Control (TFRC), a rate-based congestion control mechanism for
      unicast flows operating in a best-effort Internet environment
      where flows are competing with standard TCP traffic.  TFRC ensures
      conformance with TCP by continuously calculating the rate that a
      TCP sender would obtain under similar circumstances using a
      slightly simplified version of the TCP Reno throughput equation in
      [<a href="#ref-PFTK98" title="&quot;Modeling TCP Throughput: A Simple Model and its Empirical Validation&quot;">PFTK98</a>].  Its sending rate is smoother than the rate of TCP,
      making it suitable for multimedia applications.  TFRC is not a
      wire protocol but rather a mechanism that could, for instance, be
      used within a UDP-based application, in a transport protocol such
      as RTP, or in the context of endpoint congestion management
      [<a href="rfc3124.html" title="&quot;The Congestion Manager&quot;">RFC3124</a>].


   <a href="rfc3550.html">RFC 3550</a>: "RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"
      (July 2003)

      [<a name="ref-RFC3550" id="ref-RFC3550">RFC3550</a>] specifies the real-time transport protocol RTP along
      with its control protocol RTCP.  RTP/RTCP does not prescribe a
      specific congestion control behavior, but it is recommended that
      such a behavior be specified in each RTP profile (which is due to
      the fact that the potential for reducing the sending rate is often
      content dependent in the case of real-time streams).
      Specifically, [<a href="rfc3550.html" title="&quot;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications&quot;">RFC3550</a>] states: "For some profiles, it may be
      sufficient to include an applicability statement restricting the
      use of that profile to environments where congestion is avoided by
      engineering.  For other profiles, specific methods such as data
      rate adaptation based on RTCP feedback may be required".
      [<a href="rfc4585.html" title="&quot;Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)&quot;">RFC4585</a>], which discusses RTCP feedback and adaptation
      mechanisms, points out that RTCP feedback may operate on much
      slower timescales than transport layer feedback mechanisms, and
      that additional mechanisms are therefore required to perform
      proper congestion control.  One way to make use of such additional
      mechanisms is to run RTP over DCCP.

      Protocol.  This protocol provides bidirectional unicast
      connections of congestion-controlled unreliable datagrams.  It is
      suitable for applications that can benefit from control over the
      tradeoff between timeliness and reliability.  The core DCCP
      specification does not include a specific congestion control
      behavior; rather, it functions as a framework for such mechanisms,
      which can be selected via the Congestion Control Identifier
      (CCID).

      within DCCP.  This should be used by senders who would like to

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Multicast Congestion Control</span>

   In the IETF, congestion control for multicast (one-to-many)
   communication has primarily been tackled in the Reliable Multicast
   Transport (RMT) Working Group.  Except for [<a href="rfc2357.html" title="&quot;IETF Criteria for Evaluating Reliable Multicast Transport and Application Protocols&quot;">RFC2357</a>] and [<a href="rfc3208.html" title="&quot;PGM Reliable Transport Protocol Specification&quot;">RFC3208</a>],
   all the documents in this section were written by this group.  Since
   a "one size fits all" protocol cannot meet the requirements of all
   possible applications in this space, the approach taken is a modular
   one, consisting of "protocol cores" and "building blocks".  Multiple
   congestion control building blocks have been defined, providing both
   sender-driven and receiver-driven congestion control methods that
   differ widely in their assumptions and behavior.

   <a href="rfc2357.html">RFC 2357</a>: "IETF Criteria for Evaluating Reliable Multicast Transport
      and Application Protocols" (June 1998)

      Some early multicast content dissemination proposals did not
      incorporate proper congestion control; this is pointed out as
      being a severe mistake in [<a href="rfc2357.html" title="&quot;IETF Criteria for Evaluating Reliable Multicast Transport and Application Protocols&quot;">RFC2357</a>], as large-scale multicast
      applications have the potential to do vast congestion-related
      damage.  This document clearly makes the case that congestion
      control mechanisms should be developed and incorporated into
      multicast content dissemination protocols intended for use over
      the Internet.


   <a href="rfc2887.html">RFC 2887</a>: "The Reliable Multicast Design Space for Bulk Data
      Transfer" (August 2000)

      Several classes of potential congestion control schemes for
      single-sender multicast protocols are briefly sketched as
      possibilities, but no specific protocols are developed or selected
      in [<a href="rfc2887.html" title="&quot;The Reliable Multicast Design Space for Bulk Data Transfer&quot;">RFC2887</a>].

      and mentions that several different congestion control building
      blocks may be required in order to deal with different situations.
      Some of the possible interactions between building blocks for

      acknowledgement, and group management are also mentioned.

      Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) is a reliable multicast
      transport protocol for applications that require ordered or
      unordered, duplicate-free, multicast data delivery from multiple
      sources to multiple receivers.  As discussed in [<a href="rfc3208.html" title="&quot;PGM Reliable Transport Protocol Specification&quot;">RFC3208</a>]'s
      <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>, a PGM protocol source can request congestion control
      feedback from both network elements (routers) and receivers (end
      hosts).  These reports can indicate the load on the worst link in
      a particular path, or the load on the worst path.  The actual
      procedure used in response to this feedback is not part of <a href="rfc3208.html">RFC</a>
      <a href="rfc3208.html">3208</a>, but the notion of using multicast routers to assist in
      congestion control is significant.

      [<a name="ref-RFC3450" id="ref-RFC3450">RFC3450</a>] specifies ALC, a rough header format using the RMT
      building blocks, that can be used by multicast content
      dissemination protocols.  ALC is intended to use a multi-rate
      congestion control building block, where the sender does not
      require any feedback, but where multiple multicast groups with
      different transmission rates are available within and ALC session,
      and receivers control their rates by joining or leaving groups.


   <a href="rfc3738.html">RFC 3738</a>: "Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC) Building

      The WEBRC mechanism defined in [<a href="rfc3738.html" title="&quot;Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC) Building Block&quot;">RFC3738</a>] is a receiver-driven form
      of congestion control, where each receiver in a multicast group
      can determine the individual rate at which packets are delivered
      to it.  WEBRC senders create a base channel for control
      information and several multicast channels for data transmission
      that each send packets at a varying rate in the form of a wave.
      The receivers dynamically join and leave channels at chosen points
      within the wave of sending rates to obtain the desired overall
      receive rate based on an equation using the estimated loss
      probability and round-trip time within an epoch.  WEBRC is

   <a href="rfc4654.html">RFC 4654</a>: "TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC):
      Protocol Specification" (August 2006)

      TFMCC, as described in [<a href="rfc4654.html" title="&quot;TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC): Protocol Specification&quot;">RFC4654</a>], is a sender-driven congestion
      control mechanism, where the received rate for the entire
      multicast group is determined by the worst-connected receiver.
      TFMCC builds upon TFRC, but scales down the feedback to prevent
      ACK-implosion effects by having receivers suppress their feedback
      unless they perceive it to be the worst among the reception group.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Guidance for Developing and Analyzing Congestion Control Techniques</span>

   Some recently published RFCs discuss the properties of congestion
   control protocols that are "safe" for Internet deployment, as well as
   how to measure the properties of congestion control mechanisms and
   transport protocols.  These documents are particularly relevant to
   the ICCRG as some of the group's activities involve reviewing
   congestion control proposals that have been brought to the IETF for
   publication (see
   <a href="http://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/congestion-control.html">http://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/congestion-control.html</a>).

   <a href="rfc5033.html">RFC 5033</a> (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp133">BCP 133</a>): "Specifying New Congestion Control Algorithms"
      (August 2007)

      The concurrent development of multiple TCP modifications for high-
      rate use and the deployments of these modifications on the
      Internet prompted [<a href="rfc5033.html" title="&quot;Specifying New Congestion Control Algorithms&quot;">RFC5033</a>] to be written.  <a href="rfc5033.html">RFC 5033</a> comes from
      the Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG), and gives guidance on
      the classes of Experimental RFC that can be published to document
      algorithms that are either encouraged for investigation on the
      Internet, and those that are only encouraged for experimentation
      in less-critical environments.  It has been described as a list of
      things for people to think about when creating new congestion
      control techniques that they are planning to widely deploy.


   <a href="rfc5166.html">RFC 5166</a>: "Metrics for the Evaluation of Congestion Control
      Mechanisms" (March 2008)

      The IRTF Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG) produced
      [<a href="rfc5166.html" title="&quot;Metrics for the Evaluation of Congestion Control Mechanisms&quot;">RFC5166</a>] to describe the set of metrics and related tradeoffs
      between metrics that can be used to compare, contrast, and
      evaluate congestion control techniques.  This RFC gives an
      overview of many such metrics, and gives references to their
      detailed descriptions.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-9" href="#section-9">9</a>.  Historic Interest</span>

   Early in the RFC series, there are many documents that represent an
   author's thoughts on a subject or brief summaries from measurement
   and experimentation, rather than the result of a long formal IETF
   process.  Some of the RFCs listed in this section have this
   distinction.

   <a href="rfc889.html">RFC 889</a>: "Internet Delay Experiments" (December 1983)

      Based on reported measurement experiments, changes to the TCP
      retransmission timeout (RTO) calculation are suggested in
      [<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0889" title="&quot;Internet delay experiments&quot;">RFC0889</a>].  It is noted that the original TCP RTO calculation
      leads to congestion when a delay spike occurs because it takes too
      long for the RTO to adapt, leading to superfluous retransmissions.


   <a href="rfc896.html">RFC 896</a>: "Congestion Control in IP/TCP Internetworks" (January 1984)

      [<a name="ref-RFC0896" id="ref-RFC0896">RFC0896</a>] is the first document known to the authors where the
      term "congestion collapse" was used.  Here, it refers to the
      stable state that was observed when a sudden load on the net
      caused the round-trip time to rise faster than the sending hosts
      measured round-trip time could be updated.  Two problems are
      discussed: the "small-packet problem" (now commonly known by the
      name "silly window syndrome") and the "source-quench problem",
      which is about inappropriately deciding when to send and how to
      react to ICMP Source Quench messages.  Solutions for these
      problems are presented.


   <a href="rfc970.html">RFC 970</a>: "On Packet Switches with Infinite Storage" (December 1985)

      Using a thought experiment based on a router with infinite
      buffering capacity, [<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0970" title="&quot;On packet switches with infinite storage&quot;">RFC0970</a>] develops a different kind of
      congestion collapse scenario, where few useful packet
      transmissions occur due to the queue being longer than the time-
      to-live of the packets within it.  As described in <a href="rfc970.html">RFC 970</a>, this
      scenario was also demonstrated using real equipment by the author.

      The document also includes discussion of game-theoretic analysis
      of congestion control and obtaining fairness between behaving and
      non-behaving flows, by focusing on the order of scheduling packets
      within the buffer rather than the actual allocation of buffer
      space between flows.

   <a href="rfc1016.html">RFC 1016</a>: "Something a Host Could Do with Source Quench: The Source
      Quench Introduced Delay (SQuID)" (July 1987)

      [<a name="ref-RFC1016" id="ref-RFC1016">RFC1016</a>] outlines a rate-based congestion control mechanism where
      end-hosts use Source Quench packets from routers to adjust their
      sending rates.  <a href="rfc1016.html">RFC 1016</a> also suggests sending congestion
      notifications before queues are actually full, at a rate that
      increases with the current queue occupancy.  This strategy has
      been used in several other AQM mechanisms, notably RED [<a href="#ref-FJ93" title="&quot;Random Early Detection Gateways for Congestion Avoidance&quot;">FJ93</a>].


   <a href="rfc1254.html">RFC 1254</a>: "Gateway Congestion Control Survey" (August 1991)

      [<a name="ref-RFC1254" id="ref-RFC1254">RFC1254</a>] is a survey of congestion control approaches in routers
      that first discusses general congestion control performance goals
      (such as fairness), and then elaborates on the use of Source
      Quench messages (which are now discouraged, as they have been
      found ineffective), Random Drop (which would now be called "Active
      Queue Management"), Congestion Indication (DEC Bit; an early form
      of ECN), "Selective Feedback Congestion Indication" (one
      particular method for applying ECN), and Fair Queuing.  Finally,
      end-system congestion control policies are discussed, including
      Jacobson's well-known algorithms [<a href="#ref-Jac88" title="&quot;Congestion Avoidance and Control&quot;">Jac88</a>] and their predecessor --
      "CUTE" [<a href="#ref-Jain86" title="&quot;A Timeout-Based Congestion Control Scheme for Window Flow-Controlled Networks&quot;">Jain86</a>].
