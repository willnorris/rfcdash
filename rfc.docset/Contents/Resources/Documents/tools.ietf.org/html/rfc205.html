                 <span class="h1">NETCRT - A CHARACTER DISPLAY PROTOCOL</span>

   At the May NWG, meeting, CCN circulated dittoed copies of a proposed
   character-display protocol NETCRT.  Since that time, NETCRT has been
   revised significantly; the current version is now being published as
   an RFC, as promised last May.

   NETCRT was developed because a particular site (RAND) requested
   Network access to URSA, CCN's display-based crje system.  The primary
   use of URSA at UCLA is conversational remote job entry from a display
   terminal: entering and editing program text, submitting programs for
   batch execution, and examining job output; URSA is not a general-
   purpose time-sharing system.

   URSA's text editor is designed for a fast updating character display
   and cannot be used in any reasonable way from a typewriter-like
   console.  Therefore, a simple TELNET protocol is not adequate for
   using the crje function of URSA.  Furthermore, we have assumed that
   other ARPA sites will have their own text editors, well matched to
   their own terminals and systems.  Therefore, CCN has implemented
   NETRJS (see RFC #189), to provide remote job submission and retrieval
   services, before implementing NETCRT.

   There are a number of other functions in URSA besides crje; some of
   these would probably be useful to remote users.  URSA contains a
   comprehensive STATus service, whose constantly-updating displays are
   "windows" into the operation of the machine and the operating system,
   allowing a user to watch the progress of his jobs through the system.
   URSA also includes on-line data set (file) utilities, convenient for
   a user with files stored at CCN.  To obtain access to these
   facilities, a few sites which use CCN heavily may want to implement
   NETCRT.  The schedule for implementation of NETCRT at CCN to allow
   Network access to URSA will depend upon the existence of a user site
   that wants the service and that will write a suitable NETCRT user
   process.  Interested sites are urged to contact the CCN Technical
   Liaison, Bob Braden.

   Even though the implementation schedule for NETCRT is nebulous, we
   are publishing the specs now for several reasons.  First, we would
   like comments and criticisms.  Furthermore, NETCRT contains some
   features which may be useful in the protocol(s) now being developed
   for full graphical displays.

NETCRT PROTOCOL - VERSION 3

<span class="h1"><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" name="appendix-A">A</a>. INTRODUCTION</span>

   The UCLA Campus Computing Network (CCN) node intends to provide
   Network access to its conversational remote job entry system URSA.
   The URSA system is display-oriented, supporting only character
   displays with local buffers (originally IBM 2260 displays, now CCI
   301 TV display consoles).  This document defines a third-level
   protocol called NETCRT which allows a Network user in a remote Host
   to look like a CCI console to URSA.  NETCRT is defined in terms of a
   virtual character display ("VCD") terminal, simulated by a process in
   the user host.

   URSA, like many on-line console systems, attempts to provide a good
   man/machine interaction by keeping tight control over the state of
   the terminal.  On the other hand, the Network Working Group has
   deliberately built some "squishiness" into the standard Network
   protocols.  We believe this squishiness is a conceptual mistake when
   dealing with remote man/machine interaction, and we would support
   protocol revisions to allow control over the effective communication
   compliance between processes in different hosts.  However, this
   NETCRT protocol attempts to cope with the present squishiness, which
   is apparently built into a number of host's NCPs.  In fact, we have
   arranged things so a host can improve response time and reduce
   Network traffic with NETCRT by using the message buffering inherent
   in his NCP.

<span class="h1"><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B" name="appendix-B">B</a>. THE VIRTUAL CHARACTER DISPLAY</span>

   A VCD consists of the following virtual hardware (see Figure 1):

   1. A rectangular _display screen_ capable of displaying N lines of M
      characters.

   2. A _local buffer_ of M x N characters used to refresh the display.

   3. A _cursor register_ which addresses the characters in the buffer
      (and hence on the screen).  This register controls the writing of
      text into the local buffer from either the keyboard or the server,
      and the reading of the local buffer by the server.

   4. A _keyboard_ containing text keys and control keys.  Each text key
      enters a character into local buffer at the current cursor address
      and steps the cursor register by 1.






<span class="grey">Braden                                                          [Page 2]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-3" id="page-3" name="page-3"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc205.html">RFC 205</a>          NETCRT - A CHARACTER DISPLAY PROTOCOL     6 August 1971</span>


   5. A _communication interface_ through which the server CPU can send
      a stream of _command_ segments to the VCD and receive a stream of
      _response_ segments from the VCD.  The command segments include
      control commands to the VCD and text to be written into the local
      buffer.  Response segments contain status indicators and text read
      from the buffer.  In addition, both VCD and server may send break
      signals.

   The current address in the cursor register, an integer between 0 and
   M x N-1, is displayed as a blitch, underscore, or other visual
   indication at the corresponding point on the screen; this indication
   is called the _cursor_.  Position 0 is the upper left corner of the
   screen.

   The screen is addressed in line ("row") order, and read and write
   operations by the server overflow automatically from one line to the
   next.  The cursor register is not assumed to operate modulo M x Nxsy.
   It is possible for a server command to set the cursor register to M x
   N, one position beyond the last screen position; however, the server
   should never set the register to an address beyond M x N, and it
   should not leave the cursor at M x N when the keyboard is unlocked.

   The application program or conversational system using the VCD may
   format each display screen in a variety of ways, and may use a number
   of styles of interaction.  One consequence is that the application
   program might have to look anywhere on the screen (i.e., in the local
   buffer) to find the input information it requires.  We may consider
   three alternative mechanisms for transmitting information from the
   VCD to the serving CPU:

   Mechanism 1    Whenever the user presses a "Transmit" control key,
                  the entire M x N characters in the buffer are
                  transmitted to the server CPU.

   Mechanism 2    When the user presses "Transmit", the string of text
                  between a "start" control character and the cursor is
                  transmitted to the server.

   Mechanism 3    The server must send a read command segment to the VCD
                  before the "Transmit" key will have an effect.  The
                  read command segment determines which parts of the
                  buffer are to be transmitted to the server.

   Mechanism 1 may be faulted as too costly in transmission time and
   channel capacity, while Mechanism 2 is too restrictive.  The scheme
   which we propose here is based on Mechanism 3, which subsumes the
   other two.




<span class="grey">Braden                                                          [Page 3]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-4" id="page-4" name="page-4"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc205.html">RFC 205</a>          NETCRT - A CHARACTER DISPLAY PROTOCOL     6 August 1971</span>


   The VCD is assumed to include the following control keys:

   Erase          Clears the display buffer to all blanks and resets the
                  cursor to position 0 (the upper left corner of the
                  screen).

   Transmit       Locks the keyboard and places the VCD under control of
                  the server CPU.  Typically, the server will read
                  specified areas of the screen and perhaps write out
                  new data before unlocking the keyboard again.

   Break          Has the same effect as _Transmit_, and in addition
                  sends an interrupt message to the server CPU.  The
                  _Break_ key always sends the interrupt, regardless of
                  the state of the VCD.

   Reset          May be used to unlock the VCD keyboard in case the
                  server CPU fails to respond immediately and the user
                  wishes to enter new or different information.

   These may be called pure control keys, since they do not correspond
   to any text characters.  The following control key does store a
   character into the display buffer:

   Newline        Enter a Newline (NL) character into the display buffer
                  and reset the cursor to the beginning of the next
                  line.  If this character is encountered during a read
                  or write operation, it is executed (i.e., the cursor
                  is moved to the beginning of the next line) and the NL
                  is counted as _one_ character.

   Finally, there are assumed to be keys for manually positioning the
   cursor to any address on the screen.  Cursor positioning keys may
   include: cursor right, cursor up, cursor left (BS), cursor down (LF),
   and cursor return (CR).  A tab (HT) mechanism could also be defined,
   although none is included here.

<span class="h1"><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C" name="appendix-C">C</a>. VCD STATES</span>

   The VCD has two internal states, _Local_ and _Control_ (see Figure
   2).

   Local State:   The keyboard is unlocked and all keys are active.  The
                  VCD does not accept or recognize any commands from
                  server except (reverse) Break.






<span class="grey">Braden                                                          [Page 4]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-5" id="page-5" name="page-5"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc205.html">RFC 205</a>          NETCRT - A CHARACTER DISPLAY PROTOCOL     6 August 1971</span>


   Control State: The keyboard is locked, and only the _Break_ and
                  _Reset_ keys are active.  The VCD accepts and executes
                  command segments from the server, and returns response
                  segments as the result of read commands.

   The VCD changes from Local to Control state if either:

      (1) The user presses the _Transmit_ key; or

      (2) the user presses the _Break_ key; or

      (3) the server sends a reverse Break request.

   _Transmit's_ only effect is to enter Control State; _Break_ enters
   Control State and also sends a break request (INS and X'80') to the
   server.

   The VCD returns to Local State when either:

   1. The user presses the _Reset_ key; or

   2. the VCD encounters a LOCAL command from the server and is not in
      the process of synchronizing a reverse break (see section E
      below).

   We should note that CCI and IBM 2260 character display consoles
   actually have only one control key ("Interrupt" on CCI, "Enter" on
   2260) to perform the functions of both _Break_ and _Transmit_; this
   one key in fact has the function of the _Break_ key of the VCD.  We
   have included both _Break_ and _Transmit_ keys in the VCD for
   generality, but the URSA-NETCRT interface will be programmed to allow
   a Network user of URSA to either (1) employ the _Break_ key
   exclusively, or (2) use either _Break_ or _Transmit_ as appropriate.
   This will be achieved by URSA simply by ignoring those break requests
   (INS messages) which occur while there are outstanding read commands.

<span class="h1"><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-D" name="appendix-D">D</a>. VCD COMMANDS</span>

   The server sends the VCD a string of command segments.  These are of
   varying length, consisting of an op code and none or more parameters.
   The commands recognized by the VCD are as follows:

   UNBLANK         none            Enable display refresh.

   LOCAL           none            Put VCD in _local_ state.  The result
                                   is to suspend command interpretation
                                   and unlock the keyboard.

   SYNC            none            Used to synchronize reverse Break
                                   from server.  SYNC (X'80) is placed
                                   in stream by server at same time that
                                   it sends an INS.  VCD enters Control
                                   State, synchronizes INS with BREAK
                                   command (see next section), and
                                   continues command interpretation.

I/O Commands:

   WRITE n,text    16 bit integer  Write n bytes of text into display
                   n, followed by  buffer starting at current cursor
                   n text bytes.   position and advancing cursor by 1
                                   for each byte (except NL character
                                   advances to beginning of next line).
                                   Here [sigma] + n &lt;= M x N.

   READ n          16 bit integer  Read n bytes starting at the cursor
                   n.              [sigma] and advancing cursor by one
                                   for each byte (except NL advances
                                   cursor to beginning of next line).
                                   NL counts as one character.  Send the
                                   text to the server as a response
                                   segment.  Must have n + [sigma]
                                   &lt;= M x N.

   SREAD           none            Read S - [sigma] bytes starting from
                                   the current cursor position [sigma]
                                   up to (but not including) the cursor
                                   address stored in register S.  The
                                   cursor is left in position S as a
                                   result.  Send the text to the server
                                   as a response segment.

   AWRITE n,text   16 bit integer  Same as WRITE n, except characters
                   n, followed by  are not stored in buffer if they
                   n text bytes.   have a lower cursor address than
                                   the value in S.

   Here are some applications of these commands in URSA:

   1. One elementary URSA terminal operation reads the screen from
      position x up to (but not including) the current cursor position.
      This could be done with the sequence of VCD command segments:

                        SAVE
                        CURSOR x
                        SREAD

   2. Another common operation in URSA is to remember the cursor, update
      specific information on the screen, and replace the cursor.  This
      can be done by the following 8 + n byte sequence of command
      segments:






<span class="grey">Braden                                                          [Page 7]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-8" id="page-8" name="page-8"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc205.html">RFC 205</a>          NETCRT - A CHARACTER DISPLAY PROTOCOL     6 August 1971</span>


                        SAVE
                        CURSOR x
                        WRITE n, text
                        RESTORE

   3. In URSA, the area in which a user is to type his response is
      usually delimited on the left by a "Start Symbol" (graphic '[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]').
      This is a historical remnant of the IBM 2260, which has only two
      hardware read operators: read the full screen, and read from the
      Start Manual Input Symbol ("SMI") to the cursor.  The SMI read
      operation can be simulated easily on the VCD as follows:

                        SAVE
                        FIND '[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]'
                        SREAD

   4. The _Break_ (or _Transmit_) key on the VCD may serve the function
      of the INTerrupt key on a CCI console (or ENTer on an IBM 2260).
      URSA will often attempt to minimize Network traffic by sending a
      sequence of commands (one message if allocation allows) like the
      following:

                                              -+
            CURSOR m                           |
            WRITE n, text                       - URSA writes a request
            LOCAL                              |
                                              -+
                                              -+
                       +-          +-+         |_ User types response
                       |   _BREAK_   |         |
      - -User Presses  | _TRANSMIT_  |key - - -+
                       +-           -+        -+
              SAVE                             |
              CURSOR p                          - URSA reads response
              SREAD                            |
                                              -+

      At other times, URSA might send the sequence:

                CURSOR m
                WRITE n,TEXT
                LOCAL
                READ  0

      and wait for the INS from the user pressing _Break_ (or the
      response segment triggered by the zero-length read if he presses
      _Transmit_); then URSA will send the appropriate read command
      sequence.

<span class="h1"><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-F" name="appendix-F">F</a>. NETWORK MESSAGE FORMATS</span>

   The VCD connects the server through ICP to a standard socket,
   establishing thereby a pair of connections between the VCD and the
   server.  Command segments (server-to-VCD) and response segments
   (VCD-to-server) are sent over these connections, without regard to
   physical message boundaries, using byte size 8.  The VCD is defined
   to operate in a segment-at-a-time mode (rather than character-at-a-
   time), with local echo.  Therefore, the server never echoes under
   NETCRT.

   In many cases URSA will send a sequence of command segments (as in
   the examples of the preceding section) at once; if there is
   sufficient allcocation they will be sent in the same message.
   Response time may be improved, therefore, if the user site is able to
   buffer ahead on command segments.  This buffering does raise break
   synchronization problems, which are solved in the following manner
   for reverse (server-to-user) break:

      The server sends an INS on the control link and also a SYNC
      command (X'80) on the data link to the VCD.  On receiving either,
      the VCD enters Control State and then achieves synchronization
      between the INS and BREAK; if the INS arrives first, the VCD
      executes normally all commands buffered in his host, _except_ it
      ignores LOCAL commands, until the SYNC appears.  Having achieved
      synchronization, the VCD continues normal command interpretation
      (without ignoring ensuring LOCAL commands).

   By this means the server can regain control of the VCD to write new
   information at any time.  For example, when URSA is used under
   NETCRT, most WRITE or AWRITE sequences will be preceded by a BREAK
   from the server, since URSA will not know the current state of the
   VCD.  Even if URSA left the VCD in Control State, the user might have
   manually returned his VCD to Local State by pressing _Reset_.

   After receiving an INS, the VCD executes rather than ignores buffered
   commands so that pending writes will not be lost in case that
   processing at the user side has been held up temporarily.  The read
   commands executed after the server sent an INS might be irrelevant to
   a server, which can ignore the corresponding response segments.  In
   order to do so, the server simply keeps matching counts of read
   commands sent and corresponding response segments received.

   Command segments will use the following formats:

   Form 1 (No parameters)  q:OPCODE(8)

      where q = X'80' means SYNC

            q = X'9A' means AWRITE

            q = X'9F' and n=1 means FIND

   A response segment, caused by a READ or SREAD command, has the
   following format:

      RESPONSE &lt;-----X'A1' + CURSOR(16) + n:LENGTH(16) + (TEXT(8) = n)

   where n &gt; 0 is the number of characters actually read.  CURSOR(16) is
   an integer giving the final cursor position after the corresponding
   read command.  Note that the command READ 0 is permissible and may be
   used by the server to find the current cursor position, or to find
   out when the user presses _Transmit_.

<span class="h1"><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-E" name="appendix-E">E</a>.  SCREEN SIZE</span>

   For simplicity and consistency with URSA, we have chosen to treat the
   cursor as a single integer.  This in turn means that VCD and server
   must agree upon the number of columns M; it is also desirable for the
   server to know N.

   The agreement on M and N takes place through a one-sided negotiation.
   The server is assumed to know what M and N values he can handle and
   these are published for user sites.  When the VCD is first connected
   to the server, the VCD must send an Open response segment with the
   values M and N:

      Open segment &lt;---- X'B1' + M(8) + N(8) + X'0000'

   If the VCD fails to send this segment or the server does not like the
   values, the server closes the connections and the user is considered
   logged off.
