Abstract

   The process by which the members of the IAB and IESG are selected,
   confirmed, and recalled is specified.  The evolution of the process
   has relied principally on oral tradition as a means by which the
   lessons learned could be passed on to successive committees.  This
   document is a self-consistent, organized compilation of the process
   as it is known today.

   This document supercedes <a href="rfc2027.html">RFC2027</a>, the first complete specification of
   the process by which members of the IAB and IESG are selected,
   confirmed, and recalled.  Prior to that time, a single paragraph in
   <a href="rfc1602.html">RFC1602</a> is the extent to which the process had been formally
   recorded.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2282.html">RFC 2282</a>                 IAB and IESG Selection            February 1998</span>


   This revision is based on the experience of the 1996 Nominating
   Committee, the first committee to operate according to <a href="rfc2027.html">RFC2027</a>.  The
   following two assumptions of that specification are also true for
   this revision.

    (1)   The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Internet Research
          Steering Group (IRSG) are not a part of the process described
          here.

    (2)   The organization (and re-organization) of the IESG is not a
          part of the process described here.

   The time frames specified here use IETF meetings as a frame of
   reference.  The time frames assume that the IETF meets at least once
   per year with that meeting occurring during the North American Spring
   time, i.e., the IETF meets at least on or about March of each year.

   The remainder of this document is divided into four major topics as
   follows.

   General
        This a set of rules and constraints that apply to the selection
        and confirmation process as a whole.

   Nominating Committee Selection
        This is the process by which volunteers from the IETF community
        are recognized to serve on the committee that nominates
        candidates to serve on the IESG and IAB.

   Nominating Committee Operation
        This is the set of principles, rules, and constraints that guide
        the activities of the nominating committee, including the
        confirmation process.

   Member Recall
        This is the process by which the behavior of a sitting member of
        the IESG or IAB may be questioned, perhaps resulting in the
        removal of the sitting member.

   A final section describes how this document differs from its
   predecessor: <a href="rfc2027.html">RFC2027</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  General</span>

   The following set of rules apply to the selection and confirmation
   process as a whole.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the
   interpretation of each rule is included.




<span class="grey">Galvin                   Best Current Practice                  [Page 2]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-3" id="page-3" href="#page-3" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2282.html">RFC 2282</a>                 IAB and IESG Selection            February 1998</span>


    (1)   The principal functions of the nominating committee are to
          review the open IESG and IAB positions and to either nominate
          its incumbent or recruit a superior candidate.

        The nominating committee does not select the open positions to
        be reviewed; it is instructed as to which positions to review.

        At a minimum, the nominating committee will be given the title
        of the position to be reviewed.  The nominating committee may be
        given a desirable set of qualifications for the candidate
        nominated to fill each position.

        Incumbents must notify the nominating committee if they do not
        wish to be nominated.

        The nominating committee does not confirm its candidates; it
        presents its candidates to the appropriate confirming body as
        indicated below.

    (2)   The annual selection and confirmation process is expected to
          be completed within 3 months.

        The annual selection and confirmation process is expected to be
        completed one month prior to the friday of the week before the
        Spring IETF.  It is expected to begin 4 months prior to the
        friday of the week before the Spring IETF.

    (3)   One-half of each of the then current IESG and IAB positions is
          selected to be reviewed each year.

        The intent of this rule to ensure the review of approximately
        one-half of each of the sitting IESG and IAB members each year.
        It is recognized that circumstances may exist that will require
        the nominating committee to review more or less than one-half of
        the current positions, e.g., if the IESG or IAB have re-
        organized prior to this process and created new positions, or if
        there are an odd number current positions.

    (4)   Confirmed candidates are expected to serve at least a 2 year
          term.

        The intent of this rule is to ensure that members of the IESG
        and IAB serve the number of years that best facilitates the
        review of one-half of the members each year.

        It is consistent with this rule for the nominating committee to
        choose one or more of the currently open positions to which it
        may assign a term greater than 2 years in order to ensure the

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2282.html">RFC 2282</a>                 IAB and IESG Selection            February 1998</span>


        ideal application of this rule in the future.

        It is consistent with this rule for the nominating committee to
        choose one or more of the currently open positions that share
        responsibilities with other positions (both those being reviewed
        and those sitting) to which it may assign a term greater than 2
        years to ensure that all such members will not be reviewed at
        the same time.

        All member terms begin and end during the Spring IETF meeting
        corresponding to the end of the term for which they were
        confirmed.  Normally, the confirmed candidate's term begins when
        the currently sitting member's term ends on the last day of the
        meeting.  A term may begin or end no sooner than the first day
        of the meeeting as determined by the mutual agreement of the
        currently sitting member and the confirmed candidate.

    (5)   Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules as documented
          here with four qualifications.  First, the most recently
          constituted nominating committee is reconvened to nominate a
          candidate to fill the vacancy.  Second, the selection and
          confirmation process is expected to be completed within 1
          month, with all other time periods otherwise unspecified
          prorated accordingly.  Third, the confirming body has two
          weeks from the day it is notified of a candidate to reject the
          candidate, otherwise the candidate is assumed to have been
          confirmed.  Fourth, the term of the confirmed candidate will
          be either:

   a.   the remainder of the term of the open position if that remainder
        is not less than one year.

   b.   the remainder of the term of the open position plus the next 2
        year term if that remainder is less than one year.

    (6)   All deliberations and supporting information that relates to
          specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are
          confidential.

        The nominating committee and confirming body members will be
        exposed to confidential information as a result of their
        deliberations, their interactions with those they consult, and
        from those who provide requested supporting information.  All
        members and all other participants are expected to handle this
        information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.

    (7)   Unless otherwise specified, the advise and consent model is
          used throughout the process.  This model is characterized as
          follows.

   a.   The IETF Executive Director advises the nominating committee of
        the IESG and IAB positions to be reviewed.

   b.   The nominating committee selects candidates and advises the
        confirming bodies of them.

   c.   The sitting IAB members review the IESG candidates, consenting
        to some, all, or none.

        If all of the candidates are confirmed, the job of the
        nominating committee with respect to reviewing the open IESG
        positions is considered complete.  If some or none of the
        candidates are confirmed, the nominating committee must
        reconvene to select alternate candidates for the rejected
        candidates.  Any additional time required by the nominating
        committee should not exceed its maximum time allotment.

   d.   The Internet Society Board of Trustees reviews the IAB
        candidates, consenting to some, all, or none.

        If all of the candidates are confirmed, the job of the
        nominating committee with respect to reviewing the open IAB
        positions is considered complete.  If some or none of the
        candidates are confirmed, the nominating committee must
        reconvene to select alternate candidates for the rejected
        candidates.  Any additional time required by the nominating
        committee should not exceed its maximum time allotment.

   e.   The confirming bodies decide their consent according to a
        mechanism of their own choosing, which must ensure that at least
        one-half of the sitting members agree with the decision.

        At least one-half of the sitting members of the confirming
        bodies must agree to either confirm or reject each individual
        nominee.  The agreement must be decided within a reasonable
        timeframe.  The agreement may be decided by conducting a formal
        vote, by asserting consensus based on informal exchanges
        (email), or by whatever mechanism is used to conduct the normal
        business of the confirming body.

   3.  Nominating Committee Selection

   The following set of rules apply to the creation of the nominating
   committee and the selection of its members.

    (1)   The committee is comprised of at least a non-voting Chair, 10
          voting volunteers, and 3 non-voting liaisons.

        A Chair is permitted to invite additional non-voting advisors to
        participate in some or all of the deliberations of the
        committee.

    (2)   The Internet Society President appoints the non-voting Chair,
          who must meet the usual requirements for membership in the
          nominating committee.

        The nominating committee Chair must agree to invest the time
        necessary to complete the duties of the nominating committee and
        to perform in the best interests of the IETF community during
        the performance of those duties.

    (3)   The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be
          reviewed and publishes it along with a solicitation for names
          of volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
          nominating committee.

        The list of open positions is published with the solicitation to
        facilitate community members choosing between volunteering for
        an open position and volunteering for the nominating committee.

        The list and solicitation must be publicized using at least the
        same mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for its
        announcements.

    (4)   Members of the IETF community must have attended at least 2 of
          the last 3 IETF meetings in order to volunteer.

    (5)   Internet Society Board of Trustees, sitting members of the
          IAB, and sitting members of the IESG may not volunteer.

    (6)   The Chair announces the pool of volunteers from which the 10
          voting volunteers will be randomly selected.

        The announcement must be made using at least the same mechanism
        used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2282.html">RFC 2282</a>                 IAB and IESG Selection            February 1998</span>


    (7)   The Chair randomly selects the 10 voting voluteers from the
          pool of names of volunteers using a method that can be
          independently verified to be unbiased and fair.

        A method is fair if each eligible volunteer is equally likely to
        be selected.  A method is unbiased if no one can influence its
        outcome.

        The method must include an announcement of an enumerated list of
        the pool of names together with the specific algorithm for how
        names will be chosen from the list.  The output of the selection
        algorithm must depend on random data whose value is not known at
        the time the list and algorithm are announced.

        One possible method is to compute the MD5 hash of future winning
        lottery numbers and use the result to select names from the
        list.

        All announcements must be made using at least the mechanism used
        by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.

    (8)   The sitting IAB and IESG members each appoint a non-voting
          liaison to the nominating committee from their current
          membership who are not sitting in an open position.

    (9)   The Chair of the prior year's nominating committee serves as a
          non-voting liaison.

        The prior year's Chair may designate an alternate voting member
        from the prior year's committee if the Chair is unavailable.  If
        the prior year's Chair is unavailable and is unable or unwilling
        to make such a designation in a timely fashion, the Chair of the
        current committee may do so.

    (10)  The Chair may solicit additional non-voting liaisons from
          other organizations, who must meet the usual requirements for
          membership in the nominating committee.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Nominating Committee Operation</span>

   The following rules apply to the operation of the nominating
   committee.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation
   of each rule is included.

   The rules are organized approximately in the order in which they
   would be invoked.





<span class="grey">Galvin                   Best Current Practice                  [Page 7]</span>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2282.html">RFC 2282</a>                 IAB and IESG Selection            February 1998</span>


   The term nominee refers to an individual under consideration by the
   nominating committee.  The term candidate refers to a nominee that
   has been selected by the nominating committee to be considered for
   confirmation by a confirming body.  A confirmed candidate is a
   candidate that has been reviewed and approved by a confirming body.

    (1)   All rules and special circumstances not otherwise specified
          are at the discretion of the Chair.

        Exceptional circumstances will occasionally arise during the
        normal operation of the nominating committee.  This rule is
        intended to foster the continued forward progress of the
        committee.  All members of the committee should consider whether
        the exception is worthy of mention in the next revision of this
        document and followup accordingly.

    (2)   The Chair must establish and publicize milestones, which must
          include at least a call for nominations.

        There is a defined time period during which the selection and
        confirmation process must be completed.  The Chair must
        establish a set of milestones which, if met in a timely fashion,
        will result in the completion of the process on time.  The Chair
        should allow time for iterating the activities of the committee
        if one or more candidates is not confirmed.

        The milestones must be publicized using at least the same
        mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.

    (3)   The Chair must establish a voting mechanism.

        The committee must be able to objectively determine when a
        decision has been made during its deliberations.  The criteria
        for determining closure must be established and known to all
        members of the nominating committee.

    (4)   At least a quorum of committee members must participate in a
          vote.  A quorum is comprised of at least 7 voting members.

    (5)   The Chair may establish a process by which a member of the
          nominating committee may be recalled.

        The process, if established, must be agreed to by a 3/4 majority
        of the members of the nominating committee, including the non-
        voting members since they would be subject to the same process.

    (6)   All members of the nominating committee may participate in all
          deliberations.



<span class="grey">Galvin                   Best Current Practice                  [Page 8]</span>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2282.html">RFC 2282</a>                 IAB and IESG Selection            February 1998</span>


        The emphasis of this rule is that no member, whether voting or
        non-voting, can be explicitly excluded from any deliberation.
        However, a member may individually choose not to participate in
        a deliberation.

    (7)   The Chair announces the open positions to be reviewed and the
          call for nominees.

        The call for nominees must include a request for comments
        regarding the past performance of incumbents, which will be
        considered during the deliberations of the nominating committee.

        The announcements must be publicized using at least the same
        mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.

    (8)   Any member of the IETF community may nominate any member of
          the IETF community for any open position.

        A self-nomination is permitted.

    (9)   Nominating committee members must not be nominees.

        To be a nominee is to enter the process of being selected as a
        candidate and confirmed.  Nominating committee members are not
        eligible to be considered for filling any open position.

    (10)  Members of the IETF community who were recalled from any IESG
          or IAB position during the previous two years must not be
          nominees.

    (11)  The nominating committee selects candidates based on its
          understanding of the IETF community's consensus of the
          qualifications required to fill the open positions.

        The intent of this rule is to ensure that the nominating
        committee consults with a broad base of the IETF community for
        input to its deliberations.

        The consultations are permitted to include a slate of nominees,
        if all parties to the consultation agree to observe customary
        and reasonable rules of confidentiality.

        A broad base of the community should include the existing
        members of the IAB and IESG, especially sitting members who
        share responsibilities with open positions, e.g., co-Area
        Directors.

    (12)  Nominees should be advised that they are being considered and
          must consent to their nomination prior to being confirmed.

        The nominating committee should help nominees provide
        justification to their employers.

        A nominee's consent must be written (email is acceptable) and
        include a commitment to provide the resources necessary to fill
        the open position and an assurance that the nominee will perform
        the duties of the position for which they are being considered
        in the best interests of the IETF community.

    (13)  The nominating committee advises the confirming bodies of
          their candidates, specifying a single candidate for each open
          position and a testament as to how each candidate meets the
          qualifications of an open position.

        The testament may include a brief resume of the candidate and a
        summary of the deliberations of the nominating committee.

    (14)  With respect to any action to be taken in the context of
          notifying and announcing confirmed candidates, and notifying
          rejected nominees and candidates, the action must be valid
          according to all of the rules specified below prior to its
          execution.

   a.   Up until a candidate is confirmed, the identity of the candidate
        must be kept confidential.

   b.   The identity of all nominees must be kept confidential (except
        that the nominee may publicize their intentions).

   c.   Rejected nominees may be notified as soon as they are rejected.

   d.   Rejected candidates may be notified as soon as they are
        rejected.

   e.   Rejected nominees and candidates must be notified prior to
        announcing confirmed candidates.

   f.   Confirmed candidates may be notified and announced as soon as
        they are confirmed.

        It is consistent with these rules for a nominee to never know if
        they were a candidate or not.






<span class="grey">Galvin                   Best Current Practice                 [Page 10]</span>

        It is consistent with these rules for some nominees to be
        rejected early in the process and for some nominees to be kept
        as alternates in case a candidate is rejected by a confirming
        body.  In the matter of whether a confirmed candidate was a
        first choice or an alternate, that information need not ever be
        disclosed and, in fact, probably never should be.

        It is consistent with these rules for confirmed candidates to be
        notified and announced as quickly as possible instead of
        requiring all confirmed candidates to wait until all open
        positions have been reviewed.

        When consulting with individual members of the IETF community,
        if all parties to the consultation agree to observe customary
        and reasonable rules of confidentiality the consultations are
        permitted to include a slate of nominees.

        The announcements must be publicized using at least the same
        mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Member Recall</span>

   The following rules apply to the recall process.  If necessary, a
   paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is included.

    (1)   Anyone may request the recall of any sitting IAB or IESG
          member, at any time, upon written (email is acceptable)
          request with justification to the Internet Society President.

    (2)   Internet Society President shall appoint a Recall Committee
          Chair.

        The Internet Society President must not evaluate the recall
        request.  It is explicitly the responsibility of the IETF
        community to evaluate the behavior of its leaders.

    (3)   The recall committee is created according to the same rules as
          is the nominating committee with the qualifications that the
          person being investigated and the person requesting the recall
          must not be a member of the recall committee in any capacity.

    (4)   The recall committee operates according to the same rules as
          the nominating committee with the qualification that there is
          no confirmation process.

    (5)   The recall committee investigates the circumstances of the
          justification for the recall and votes on its findings.

        The investigation must include at least both an opportunity for
        the member being recalled to present a written statement and
        consultation with third parties.

    (6)   A 3/4 majority of the members who vote on the question is
          required for a recall.

    (7)   If a sitting member is recalled the open position is to be
          filled according to the mid-term vacancy rules.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Changes From <a href="rfc2027.html">RFC2027</a></span>

    (1)   In order to foster better communication between nominating
          committees from one year to the next the Chair of each year's
          committee has been added as a non-voting liaison of the next
          year's committee.

    (2)   In order to confirm the eligibility of each volunteer in the
          pool of names from which nominating committee members are
          chosen the Chair must announce the list prior to the random
          selection.

    (3)   In order to confirm the random selection process used to
          select voting nominating committee members the Chair must
          announce the fair and unbiased method used in advance of its
          execution.

    (4)   Some guidance was added to ensure that the nominating
          committee consults with a broad base of the IETF community.

    (5)   Some guidance was added to ensure that the nominating
          committee understands that it may name prospective nominees
          when consulting with individual members of the IETF community.

    (6)   Some guidance was added to ensure that the nominating
          committee understands that it is responsible for ensuring that
          an appropriate set of one-half of each of the IESG and IAB
          positions are reviewed each year.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Any selection, confirmation, or recall process necessarily involves
   investigation into the qualifications and activities of prospective
   candidates.  The investigation may reveal confidential or otherwise
   private information about candidates to those participating in the
   process.  Each person who participates in any aspect of the process
   has a responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of any and all
   information not explicitly identified as suitable for public
   dissemination.
