<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Secure Hash Algorithms are specified in [<a href="#ref-SHS" title=" FIPS Publication 180-3: Secure Hash Standard">SHS</a>].  A previous
   version of [<a href="#ref-SHS" title=" FIPS Publication 180-3: Secure Hash Standard">SHS</a>] also specified SHA-0.  SHA-0, first published in
   1993, and SHA-1, first published in 1996, are message digest
   algorithms, sometimes referred to as hash functions or hash
   algorithms, that take as input a message of arbitrary length and
   produce as output a 160-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the
   input.  The published attacks against both algorithms show that it is
   not prudent to use either algorithm when collision resistance is
   required.

   [<a id="ref-HASH-Attack" name="ref-HASH-Attack">HASH-Attack</a>] summarizes the use of hashes in Internet protocols and
   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's one-way
   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet
   protocols.  Familiarity with [<a href="#ref-HASH-Attack" title='"Attacks on Cryptographic Hashes in Internet Protocols"'>HASH-Attack</a>] is assumed.

   Some may find the guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in
   [<a href="#ref-SP800-57" title=" Special Publication 800-57: Recommendation for Key Management - Part 1 (Revised)">SP800-57</a>] and [<a href="#ref-SP800-131" title=" Special Publication 800-131A: Recommendation for the Transitioning of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes">SP800-131</a>] useful.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20SHA-0%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  SHA-0 Security Considerations</span>

   What follows are summaries of recent attacks against SHA-0's
   collision, pre-image, and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally,
   attacks against SHA-0 when used as a keyed-hash (e.g., HMAC-SHA-0)
   are discussed.

   The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   withdrew SHA-0 in 1996.  That is, NIST no longer considers it
   appropriate to use SHA-0 for any transactions associated with the use
   of cryptography by U.S. federal government agencies for the
   protection of sensitive, but unclassified information.  SHA-0 is
   discussed here only for the sake of completeness.

   Any use of SHA-0 is strongly discouraged.  Analysis of SHA-0
   continues today because many see it as a weaker version of SHA-1.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Collision%20Resistance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Collision Resistance</span>

   The first attack on SHA-0 was published in 1998 [<a href="#ref-CHJO1998" title='"Differential Collisions in SHA-0"'>CHJO1998</a>] and showed
   that collisions can be found in 2^61 operations.  In 2006,
   [<a href="#ref-NSSYK2006" title='"Improved Collision Search for SHA-0"'>NSSYK2006</a>] showed an improved attack that can find collisions in
   2^36 operations.

   In any case, the known research results indicate that SHA-0 is not as
   collision resistant as expected.  The collision security strength is
   significantly less than an ideal hash function (i.e., 2^36 compared
   to 2^80).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Pre-Image%20and%20Second%20Pre-Image%20Resistance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance</span>

   The pre-image and second pre-image attacks published on reduced
   versions of SHA-0 (i.e., less than 80 rounds) indicate that the
   security margin of SHA-0 is resistant to these attacks.  [<a href="#ref-deCARE2008" title='"Preimages for Reduced SHA-0 and SHA-1"'>deCARE2008</a>]
   showed a pre-image attack on 49 out of 80 rounds with complexity of
   2^159, and [<a href="#ref-AOSA2009" title='"Meet-in-the-Middle Preimage Attacks Against Reduced SHA-0 and SHA-1"'>AOSA2009</a>] showed a pre-image attack on 52 out of 80
   rounds with a complexity of 2^156.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.%20HMAC-SHA-0"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>. HMAC-SHA-0</span>

   The current attack vectors on HMAC can be classified as follows:
   distinguishing attacks, existential forgery attacks, and key recovery
   attacks.  Key recovery attacks are by far the most severe.

   Attacks on hash functions can be conducted entirely offline, since
   the attacker can generate unlimited message-hash value pairs.
   Attacks on HMACs must be online because attackers need a large amount
   of HMAC values to deduce the key.  The best results for a partial key
   recovery attack on HMAC-SHA0 were published at Asiacrypt 2006 with
   2^84 queries and 2^60 SHA-0 computations [<a href="#ref-COYI2006" title='"Forgery and Partial Key- Recovery Attacks on HMAC and NMAC Using Hash Collisions"'>COYI2006</a>].

   What follows are recent attacks against SHA-1's collision, pre-image,
   and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally, attacks against SHA-1
   when used as a keyed-hash (i.e., HMAC-SHA-1) are discussed.

   It must be noted that NIST has recommended that SHA-1 not be used for
   generating digital signatures after December 31, 2010, and has
   specified that it not be used for generating digital signatures by
   U.S. federal government agencies "for the protection of sensitive,
   but unclassified information" after December 31, 2013 [<a href="#ref-SP800-131" title=" Special Publication 800-131A: Recommendation for the Transitioning of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes">SP800-131</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Collision%20Resistance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Collision Resistance</span>

   The first attack on SHA-1 was published in early 2005 [<a href="#ref-RIOS2005" title='"Update on SHA-1"'>RIOS2005</a>].
   This attack described a theoretical attack on a version of SHA-1
   reduced to 53 rounds.  The very next month [<a href="#ref-WLY2005" title='"Finding Collisions in the Full SHA-1"'>WLY2005</a>] showed
   collisions in the full 80 rounds in 2^69 operations.  Since then,
   many new analysis methods have been developed to improve the attack
   presented in [<a href="#ref-WLY2005" title='"Finding Collisions in the Full SHA-1"'>WLY2005</a>].  However, there are no published results that
   improve upon the results found in [<a href="#ref-WLY2005" title='"Finding Collisions in the Full SHA-1"'>WLY2005</a>].  [Man2008/469], which is
   the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) ePrint
   version of [<a href="#ref-Man2009" title='"Classification and Generation of Disturbance Vectors for Collision Attacks against SHA-1"'>Man2009</a>], claimed that using the method presented in the
   paper, a collision of full SHA-1 can be found in 2^51 hash function
   calls.  However, this claim is absent from the published conference
   paper [<a href="#ref-Man2009" title='"Classification and Generation of Disturbance Vectors for Collision Attacks against SHA-1"'>Man2009</a>].

   In any case, the known research results indicate that SHA-1 is not as
   collision resistant as expected.  The collision security strength is
   significantly less than an ideal hash function (i.e., 2^69 compared
   to 2^80).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Pre-Image%20and%20Second%20Pre-Image%20Resistance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance</span>

   There are no known pre-image or second pre-image attacks that are
   specific to the full round SHA-1 algorithm.  [<a href="#ref-KeSch" title='"Second Preimages on n-Bit Hash Functions for Much Less than 2n Work"'>KeSch</a>] discovered a
   general result for all narrow-pipe Merkle-Damgaard hash functions
   (which includes SHA-1), finding a second pre-image takes less than
   2^n computations.  When n = 160, as is the case for SHA-1, it will
   take 2^106 computations to find a second pre-image in a 60-byte
   message.

   In the absence of full-round attacks, cryptographers consider
   reduced-round attacks for clues regarding an algorithm's strength.
   Reduced-round attacks, where the number of reduced rounds is not more
   than a few less than the full rounds, have not been shown to relate
   to full-round attacks.  However, the best reduced-round attack
   indicates a certain security margin.  For example, if the best known
   attack is on 60 out of 80 rounds, then the algorithm has about 20
   rounds to resist improved attacks.  However, the relationship between
   the number of rounds an attack can reach and the number of rounds
   defined in the algorithm is not linear; it does not provide a
   mathematical proof.  In other words, reduced-round attacks indicate
   how strong the algorithm is with regard to a certain attack, not how
   close it is to being broken.  Therefore, the following information
   about reduced-round attacks is included only for completeness.

   The pre-image and second pre-image attacks published on reduced
   versions of SHA-1 (i.e., less than 80 rounds) indicate that SHA-1
   retains a significant security margin against these attacks.
   [<a href="#ref-AOSA2009" title='"Meet-in-the-Middle Preimage Attacks Against Reduced SHA-0 and SHA-1"'>AOSA2009</a>] showed a pre-image attack on 48 out of 80 rounds with
   complexity of 2^159.

   As of today, there is no indication that attacks on SHA-1 can be
   extended to HMAC-SHA-1.

   SHA-1 provides less collision resistance than was originally
   expected, and collision resistance has been shown to affect some (but
   not all) applications that use digital signatures.  Designers of IETF
   protocols that use digital signature algorithms should strongly
   consider support for a hash algorithm with greater collision

   resistance than that provided by SHA-1.  Of course, SHA-0 should
   continue to not be used in any IETF protocol.

   [Note: Protocol designers should review the current state of the art
   to ensure that selected hash algorithms provide sufficient security.
   At the time of publication, SHA-256 [<a href="#ref-SHS" title=" FIPS Publication 180-3: Secure Hash Standard">SHS</a>] is the most commonly
   specified alternative.  The known (reduced-round) attacks on the
   collision resistance of SHA-256 indicate a significant security
   margin, and the longer message digest provides increased strength.]

   Nearly all IETF protocols that use signatures assume existing public
   key infrastructures, and SHA-1 is still used in signatures nearly
   everywhere.  Therefore, it is unwise to strictly prohibit the use of
   SHA-1 in signature algorithms.  Protocols that permit the use of
   SHA-1-based digital signatures as an option should strongly consider
   referencing this document in the security considerations.

   A protocol designer might want to consider the use of SHA-1 with
   randomized hashing such as is specified in [<a href="#ref-SP800-107" title=" Special Publication 800-107: Recommendation for Applications using Approved Hash Algorithms">SP800-107</a>].  Note that
   randomized hashing expands the size of signatures and requires
   protocols to carry material that is not needed today.  HMAC-SHA-1
   remains secure and is the preferred keyed-hash algorithm for IETF
   protocol design.
