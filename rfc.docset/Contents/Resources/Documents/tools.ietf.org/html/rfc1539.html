Abstract

   Over the last two years, the attendance at Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF) Plenary meetings has grown phenomenally.  Approximately
   38% of the attendees are new to the IETF at each meeting.  About 33%
   of those go on to become regular attendees.  When the meetings were
   smaller, it wasn't very difficult for a newcomer to get to know
   people and get into the swing of things.  Today, however, a newcomer
   meets many more new people, some previously known only as the authors
   of Request For Comments (RFC) documents or thought provoking email
   messages.

   The purpose of this For Your Information (FYI) RFC is to explain to
   the newcomers how the IETF works.  This will give them a warm, fuzzy
   feeling and enable them to make the meeting more productive for
   everyone.  This FYI will also provide the mundane bits of information
   which everyone who attends an IETF meeting should know.


Acknowledgments

   The IETF Secretariat is made up of the following people: Steve Coya
   (Executive Director of the IETF), Cynthia Clark, Lois Keiper, Debra
   Legare, John Stewart, and Megan Davies Walnut.  These are the people
   behind the Registration Table, and the success, of the IETF meetings.
   I thank them for their hard work, and for their input and review of
   this document.  Thanks also to Vinton Cerf, Christian Huitema, and
   Jon Postel for their review and comments.  And, as always, special
   thanks to April Marine and Joyce Reynolds.

What is the IETF?

   The Internet Engineering Task Force is a loosely self-organized group
   of people who make technical and other contributions to the
   engineering and evolution of the Internet and its technologies.  It
   is the principal body engaged in the development of new Internet
   Standard specifications.  Its mission includes:

   o  Identifying, and proposing solutions to, pressing operational and
      technical problems in the Internet;

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1539.html">RFC 1539</a>                    The Tao of IETF                 October 1993</span>


   o  Specifying the development or usage of protocols and the near-term
      architecture to solve such technical problems for the Internet;

   o  Making recommendations to the Internet Engineering Steering Group
      (IESG) regarding the standardization of protocols and protocol
      usage in the Internet;

   o  Facilitating technology transfer from the Internet Research Task
      Force (IRTF) to the wider Internet community; and

   o  Providing a forum for the exchange of information within the
      Internet community between vendors, users, researchers, agency
      contractors, and network managers.

   The IETF Plenary meeting is not a conference, although there are
   technical presentations.  The IETF is not a traditional standards
   organization, although many standards are produced.  The IETF is the
   volunteers who meet three times a year to fulfill the IETF mission.

   There is no membership in the IETF.  Anyone may register for and
   attend any meeting.  The closest thing there is to being an IETF
   member is being on the IETF or Working Group mailing lists (see the
   IETF Mailing Lists section).  This is where the best information
   about current IETF activities and focus can be found.


Humble Beginnings

   The first IETF meeting was held in January, 1986 at Linkabit in San
   Diego with 15 attendees.  The 4th IETF, held at SRI in Menlo Park in
   October, 1986, was the first at which non-government vendors
   attended.  The concept of Working Groups (WG) was introduced at the
   5th IETF meeting at the NASA Ames Research Center in California in
   February, 1987.  The 7th IETF, held at MITRE in McLean, Virginia in
   July, 1987, was the first meeting with over 100 attendees.

   The 14th IETF meeting was held at Stanford University in July, 1989.
   It marked a major change in the structure of the IETF universe.  The
   IAB (then Internet Activities Board, now Internet Architecture
   Board), which until that time oversaw many Task Forces, changed its
   structure to leave only two: the IETF and the IRTF.  The IRTF is
   tasked to consider the long-term research problems in the Internet.
   The IETF also changed at that time.

   After the Internet Society (ISOC) was formed in January 1992, the IAB
   proposed to ISOC that the IAB's activities should take place under
   the auspices of the Internet Society.  During INET92, in Kobe, Japan,
   the ISOC Trustees approved a new charter for the IAB to reflect the
   proposed relationship.

   A recent first for the IETF was its first European meeting.  In July,
   1993, the IETF met in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The U.S./non-U.S.
   attendees split was nearly 50/50.


The Hierarchy

   To completely understand the structure of the IETF, it is useful to
   understand the overall structure in which the IETF resides.  There
   are four groups in the structure: the ISOC and its Board of Trustees
   (BOT), the IAB, the IESG, and the IETF itself.

   Internet standardization is an organized activity of the ISOC.  The
   ISOC is a professional society that is concerned with the growth and
   evolution of the worldwide Internet, with the way in which the
   Internet is and can be used, and with the social, political, and
   technical issues which arise as a result.  The BOT is responsible for
   approving appointments to the IAB from among the nominees submitted
   by the IETF nominating committee.

   The IAB is a technical advisory group of the ISOC.  It is chartered
   to provide oversight of the architecture of the Internet and its
   protocols, and to serve, in the context of the Internet Standards
   process, as a body to which the decisions of the IESG may be
   appealed.  The IAB is responsible for approving appointments to the
   IESG from among the nominees submitted by the IETF nominations
   committee.

   The IESG is responsible for technical management of IETF activities
   and the Internet Standards process.  As part of the ISOC, it
   administers the process according to the rules and procedures which
   have been ratified by the ISOC BOT.  The IESG is directly responsible
   for the actions associated with entry into and movement along the
   IETF "standards track", including final approval of specifications as
   Internet Standards.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1539.html">RFC 1539</a>                    The Tao of IETF                 October 1993</span>


   The IETF is divided into nine functional Areas.  They are:
   Applications, Internet Services, Network Management, Operational
   Requirements, Routing, Security, Service Applications, Transport, and
   User Services.  Each Area has at least one Area Director.  There is
   also an Area Director who oversees Standards Management.  The Area
   Directors, along with the IETF Chair, form the IESG.  Phillip Gross
   has been the IETF Chair since the IETF's 7th meeting.  He founded the
   IESG and serves as its Chair as well.

   Each Area has several Working Groups.  A Working Group is a group of
   people who work under a charter to achieve a certain goal.  That goal
   may be the creation of an informational document, the creation of a
   protocol standard, or the resolution of problems in the Internet.
   Most Working Groups have a finite lifetime.  That is, once a Working
   Group has achieved its goal, it disbands.  As in the IETF, there is
   no official membership for a Working Group.  Unofficially, a Working
   Group member is somebody who's on that Working Group's mailing list;
   however, anyone may attend a Working Group meeting (see the Be
   Prepared section below).

   Areas may also have Birds of a Feather (BOF) groups.  They generally
   have the same goals as Working Groups, except that they have no
   charter and usually only meet once or twice.  BOFs are often held to
   determine if there is enough interest to form a Working Group.


IETF Mailing Lists

   Anyone who plans to attend an IETF meeting should join the IETF
   announcements mailing list.  This is where all of the meeting
   information, new and revised Internet-Draft and RFC announcements,
   IESG Recommendations, and Last Calls are posted.  People who'd like
   to "get technical" may also join the IETF discussion list,
   "ietf@cnri.reston.va.us".  This was the only list before the
   announcement list was created and is where discussions of cosmic
   significance are held (most Working Groups have their own mailing
   lists for discussions relating to their work).  To join the IETF
   announcement list, send a request to:

        ietf-announce-request@cnri.reston.va.us

   To join the IETF discussion list, send a request to:

        ietf-request@cnri.reston.va.us

   To join both of the lists, simply send a single message, to either
   "-request" address, and indicate that you'd like to join both lists.

   Do not, ever, under any circumstances, for any reason, send a request
   to join a list to the list itself!  The thousands of people on the
   list don't need, or want, to know when a new person joins.
   Similarly, when changing email addresses or leaving a list, send your
   request only to the "-request" address, not to the main list.  This
   means you!!

   The IETF discussion list is unmoderated.  This means that anyone can
   express their opinions about issues affecting the Internet.  However,
   it is not a place for companies or individuals to solicit or
   advertise.  Only the Secretariat can send a message to the
   announcement list.

   Even though the IETF mailing lists "represent" the IETF membership at
   large, it is important to note that attending an IETF meeting does
   not automatically include addition to either mailing list.


Registration

   As previously mentioned, all meeting announcements are sent to the
   IETF announcement list.  Within the IETF meeting announcement is a
   Registration Form and complete instructions for registering,
   including, of course, the cost.  The Secretariat highly recommends
   that attendees preregister.  Early registration, which ends about one
   month before the meeting, carries a lower registration fee.  As the
   size of the meetings has grown, so has the length of the lines at the
   registration desk.  Fortunately, there are three lines:
   "preregistered and prepaid" (which moves very quickly),
   "preregistered and on-site payment" (which moves a little more
   slowly), and "registration and on-site payment" (take a guess).

   Registration is open all week.  However, the Secretariat highly
   recommends that attendees arrive for early registration, beginning at
   6:00 P.M. (meeting local time), on the Sunday before the opening
   plenary.  Not only will there be fewer people, but there will also be
   a reception at which people can get a byte to eat.  If the
   registration lines are long, one can eat first and try again when the
   lines are shorter.

   Registered attendees (and there isn't any other kind) receive a
   Registration Packet.  It contains a general orientation sheet, the
   At-A-Glance sheet, a list of Working Group acronyms, the most recent
   Agenda, and a name tag.  The At-A-Glance is a very important
   reference and is used throughout the week.  It contains Working
   Group/BOF room assignments and a map of room locations.  Attendees
   who prepaid will also find their receipt in their packet.




<span class="grey">Internet Engineering Task Force                                 [Page 6]</span>

Newcomers' Orientation

   Newcomers are encouraged to attend the IETF Newcomers' Orientation.
   As the name implies, it is an orientation for first time attendees to
   IETF meetings.  The orientation is organized and conducted by the
   IETF Secretariat and is intended to provide useful introductory
   information.  The Secretariat tries to keep the orientation session
   informal, and is usually successful at it.

   The orientation is typically 30-45 minutes long and covers a number
   of topics: what's in the attendee packets, what all the dots on name
   tags mean, and how to read the At-A-Glance.  There is also discussion
   about the organization of the IETF: Working Groups and their Areas,
   and the IESG.  There is ample time at the end for questions.  The
   Secretariat also provides handouts which include the text from the
   IETF Overview and a list of important files maintained on the IETF
   Shadow directories.

   The orientation is held on Sunday afternoon and ends about 30 mintues
   before the Registration Reception.  However, attending the
   orientation does NOT mean you can go to the reception early!


Dress Code

   Since attendees must wear their name tags, they must also wear shirts
   or blouses.  Pants or skirts are also highly recommended.  Seriously
   though, many newcomers are often embarrassed when they show up Monday
   morning in suits, to discover that everybody else is wearing T-
   shirts, jeans (shorts, if weather permits) and sandals.  There are
   those in the IETF who refuse to wear anything other than suits.
   Fortunately, they are well known (for other reasons) so they are
   forgiven this particular idiosyncrasy.  The general rule is "dress
   for the weather" (unless you plan to work so hard that you won't go
   outside, in which case, "dress for comfort" is the rule!).


Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes

   Some of the people at the IETF will have a little colored dot on
   their name tag.  A few people have more than one.  These dots
   identify people who are silly enough to volunteer to do a lot of
   extra work.  The colors have the following meanings:

      red    - IAB member
      yellow - IESG member
      blue   - Working Group/BOF chair
      green  - Local host



<span class="grey">Internet Engineering Task Force                                 [Page 7]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-8" id="page-8" name="page-8"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1539.html">RFC 1539</a>                    The Tao of IETF                 October 1993</span>


   Local hosts are the people who can answer questions about the
   terminal room, restaurants, and points of interest in the area.

   Some people have Gold Stars on their name tags.  The stars indicate
   that those people chaired Working Groups or BOFs in the IETF Area
   which submitted all of its Working Group/BOF Minutes and Area Report
   from the previous meeting first.  The stars are the Secretariat's way
   of saying "Thank You" for providing the necessary information
   quickly.

   It is important that newcomers to the IETF not be afraid to strike up
   conversations with people who wear these dots.  If the IAB and IESG
   members, and Working Group and BOF chairs, didn't want to talk to
   anybody, they wouldn't be wearing the dots in the first place.

   To make life simpler for the Secretariat, Registration Packets are
   also coded with little colored dots.  These are only for Secretariat
   use, so nobody else needs to worry about them.  Please, don't peel
   them off your packet and put them on your name tag.


Terminal Room

   One of the most important (depending on your point of view) things
   the local host does is provide Internet access to the meeting
   attendees.  In general, the connectivity is excellent.  This is
   entirely due to the Olympian efforts of the local hosts, and their
   ability to beg, borrow and steal.  The people and companies who
   donate their equipment, services, and time are to be heartily
   congratulated and thanked.

   While preparation far in advance of the meeting is encouraged, there
   may be some unavoidable "last minute" things which can be
   accomplished in the terminal room.  It may also be useful to people
   who need to make trip reports or status reports while things are
   still fresh in their minds.


Social Event

   Another of the most important things organized and managed by the
   local hosts is the IETF social event.  The social event has become
   something of a tradition at the IETF meetings.  It has been
   immortalized by Marshal Rose with his reference to "many fine lunches
   and dinners" [ROSE], and by Claudio and Julia Topolcic with their
   rendition of "Nerds in Paradise" on a pink T-shirt.

   Newcomers to the IETF are encouraged to attend the social event.



<span class="grey">Internet Engineering Task Force                                 [Page 8]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-9" id="page-9" name="page-9"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1539.html">RFC 1539</a>                    The Tao of IETF                 October 1993</span>


   Everyone is encouraged to wear their name tags.  The social event is
   designed to give people a chance to meet on a social, rather than
   technical, level.

   Sometimes, the social event is a computer or high-tech related event.
   At the Boston IETF, for example, the social was dinner at the
   Computer Museum.  Other times, the social might be a dinner cruise or
   a trip to an art gallery.


Agenda

   The Agenda for the IETF meetings is a very fluid thing.  It is sent,
   in various forms, to the IETF announcement list three times prior to
   the meeting.  The final Agenda is included in the Registration
   Packets.  Of course, "final" in the IETF doesn't mean the same thing
   as it does elsewhere in the world.  The final Agenda is simply the
   version that went to the printers.

   The Secretariat will announce Agenda changes during the morning
   plenary sessions.  Changes will also be posted on the bulletin board
   near the IETF Registration Table (not the hotel registration desk).

   Assignments for breakout rooms (that's where the Working Groups and
   BOFs meet) and a map showing the room locations make up the At-A-
   Glance sheet (included in the Registration Packets).  Room
   assignments are as flexible as the Agenda.  Some Working Groups meet
   multiple times during a meeting and every attempt is made to have a
   Working Group meet in the same room each session.  Room assignment
   changes are not necessarily permanent for the week.  Always check the
   At-A-Glance first, then the bulletin board.  When in doubt, check
   with a member of the Secretariat at the Registration Table.


Other General Things

   The opening Plenary on Monday morning is the most heavily attended
   session.  It is where important introductory remarks are made, so
   people are encouraged to attend.

   The IETF Secretariat, and IETFers in general, are very approachable.
   Never be afraid to approach someone and introduce yourself.  Also,
   don't be afraid to ask questions, especially when it comes to jargon
   and acronyms!







<span class="grey">Internet Engineering Task Force                                 [Page 9]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-10" id="page-10" name="page-10"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1539.html">RFC 1539</a>                    The Tao of IETF                 October 1993</span>


   Hallway conversations are very important.  A lot of very good work
   gets done by people who talk together between meetings and over
   lunches and dinners.  Every minute of the IETF can be considered work
   time (much to some people's dismay).

   A "Bar BOF" is an unofficial get-together, usually in the late
   evening, during which a lot of work gets done over drinks.

   It's unwise to get between a hungry IETFer (and there isn't any other
   kind) and coffee break brownies and cookies, no matter how
   interesting a hallway conversation is.

   IETFers are fiercely independent.  It's safe to question opinions and
   offer alternatives, but don't expect an IETFer to follow orders.

   The IETF, and the plenary sessions in particular, are not places for
   vendors to try to sell their wares.  People can certainly answer
   questions about their company and its products, but bear in mind that
   the IETF is not a trade show.  This does not preclude people from
   recouping costs for IETF related T-shirts, buttons and pocket
   protectors.


Registration Bullets

   Registration is such an important topic, that it's in this RFC twice!
   This is the "very important registration bullets" section.

   o  To attend an IETF meeting: you have to register and you have to
      pay the registration fee.

   o  All you need to do to be registered is to send in a completed
      Registration Form.

   o  You may register by mail, email or fax.  Generally, email and fax
      registration forms will be accepted until 1:00 P.M. ET on the
      Friday before the meeting.

   o  You may preregister and pay, preregister and pay later,
      preregister and pay on-site, or register and pay on-site.

   o  To get the lower registration fee, you must register by the early
      registration deadline (about one month before the meeting).  You
      can still pay later or on-site.

   o  If you don't register by the early registration deadline, a late
      fee is added.




<span class="grey">Internet Engineering Task Force                                [Page 10]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-11" id="page-11" name="page-11"> </a>

   o Everyone pays the same fees.  There are no educational or group
      discounts.  There are no discounts for attending only part of the
      week.

   o  Register only ONE person per registration form.  Substitutions are
      NOT allowed.

   o  You may register then pay later, but you may not pay then register
      later.  Payment MUST be accompanied by a completed registration
      form.

   o  Purchase orders are NOT accepted.  DD Form 1556 is accepted.
      Invoice for payment cannot be accepted.

   o  Refunds are subject to a $20 service charge.  Late fees will not
      be refunded.

   o  The registration fee covers a copy of the meeting's Proceedings,
      Sunday evening reception (cash bar), a daily continental
      breakfast, and daily coffee breaks.


Mailing Lists and Archives

   As previously mentioned, the IETF announcement and discussion mailing
   lists are the central mailing lists for IETF activities.  However,
   there are many other mailing lists related to IETF work.  For
   example, every Working Group has its own discussion list.  In
   addition, there are some long-term technical debates which have been
   moved off of the IETF list onto lists created specifically for those
   topics.  It is highly recommended that everybody follow the
   discussions on the mailing lists of the Working Groups which they
   wish to attend.  The more work that is done on the mailing lists, the
   less work that will need to be done at the meeting, leaving time for
   cross pollination (i.e., attending Working Groups outside one's
   primary area of interest in order to broaden one's perspective).

   The mailing lists also provide a forum for those who wish to follow,
   or contribute to, the Working Groups' efforts, but cannot attend the
   IETF meetings.

   All IETF discussion lists have a "-request" address which handles the
   administrative details of joining and leaving the list.  It is
   generally frowned upon when such administrivia appears on the
   discussion mailing list.






<span class="grey">Internet Engineering Task Force                                [Page 11]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-12" id="page-12" name="page-12"> </a>

   Most IETF discussion lists are archived.  That is, all of the
   messages sent to the list are automatically stored on a host for
   anonymous FTP access.  To find out where a particular list is
   archived, send a message to the list's "-request" address, NOT to the
   list itself.


Important Email Addresses

   There are some important IETF email addresses with which everyone
   should be familiar.  They are all located at "cnri.reston.va.us"
   (e.g., "ietf-info@cnri.reston.va.us").  To personalize things, the
   names of the Secretariat staff who respond to the messages are given
   for each address.

   o  ietf-info         general queries about the IETF -
                        Cynthia Clark, Debra Legare, John Stewart,
                        and Megan Davies Walnut

   o  ietf-rsvp         queries about meeting locations and fees,
                        emailed Registration Forms -

   o  proceedings       queries about previous Proceedings availability,
                        orders for copies of the Proceedings -

IETF Proceedings

   The IETF Proceedings are compiled in the two months following each
   IETF meeting.  The Proceedings usually start with a message from
   Steve Coya, the Executive Director of the IETF.  Each contains the
   final (hindsight) Agenda, an IETF overview, a report from the IESG,
   Area and Working Group reports, network status briefings, slides from
   the protocol and technical presentations, and the attendees list.
   The attendees list includes an attendee's name, affiliation, work
   phone number, work fax number, and email address, as provided on the
   Registration Form.

   A copy of the Proceedings will be sent to everyone who registered for
   the IETF.  The cost is included in the registration fee.  The
   Proceedings are sent to the mailing addresses provided on the
   Registration Forms.

   For those who could not attend a meeting but would like a copy of the
   Proceedings send a check for $35 (made payable to CNRI) to:

      Corporation for National Research Initiatives
      Attn: Accounting Department - IETF Proceedings
      1895 Preston White Drive, Suite 100
      Reston, VA   22091

   Please indicate which meeting Proceedings you would like to receive
   by specifying the meeting date (e.g., July 1993) or meeting number
   and location (e.g., 27th meeting in Amsterdam).  Availability of
   previous meetings' Proceedings is limited, so ask BEFORE sending
   payment.


InterNIC Archives

   There is a tremendous amount of material available for those who
   follow the work of the IETF.  To make it easier to know what to read
   to prepare for a meeting, the InterNIC has established a document
   archive.  Beginning about one month prior to an IETF meeting, Working
   Group/BOF Chairs and Area Directors put documents relevent to the
   discussions to be held into the archives.  Those people who plan to
   attend a Working Group/BOF session should check the archives for
   documents which need to be read.  The documents are left in the
   archives for about two months after the end of the IETF meeting.








<span class="grey">Internet Engineering Task Force                                [Page 13]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-14" id="page-14" name="page-14"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1539.html">RFC 1539</a>                    The Tao of IETF                 October 1993</span>


   On the host "ds.internic.net", documents are stored in the directory
   "/pub/current-ietf-docs" under subdirectories named for each Area and
   then for each Working Group.  For example, a document for the NISI
   Working Group, which is in the User Services Area, would be stored as
   "current-ietf-docs/usv/nisi/nisi-doc1.txt".  Each Area will also have
   a subdirectory called "bof", where documents to be discussed in BOF
   sessions will be placed.  A directory called "plenary" will also be
   created under "/pub/current-ietf-docs" to put documents or viewgraphs
   related to a plenary session.  Any filename conflicts will be
   resolved by the archive administrator working with the submitter of
   the document via email.

   It is important to note that the service is provided by the InterNIC
   and that the documents are submitted by the people who work on them.
   The IETF Secretariat does not manage or monitor the archive service.

   Access via anonymous FTP:

      Anonymous FTP to ds.internic.net
      Change directory to /pub/current-ietf-docs
      Browse and get the document of interest

   Access via GOPHER (from a Gopher client):

      Point to gopher.internic.net
      Select menu item 4, InterNIC Directory and Database Services ...
      Then menu item named "Internet Documentation (RFC's FYI's, etc.)/"
      Lastly menu item named "Current IETF Conference Documents (...)/"

   If you do not have a Gopher client, use the InterNIC's public-access
   Gopher client.  Simply telnet to "gopher.internic.net" and login as
   "gopher" (no password required).


Be Prepared

   This topic cannot be stressed enough.  As the IETF grows, it becomes
   more and more important for attendees to arrive prepared for the
   Working Group meetings they plan to attend.  This doesn't apply only
   to newcomers; everybody should come prepared.

   Being prepared means having read the documents which the Working
   Group or BOF Chair has distributed.  It means having followed the
   discussions on the Working Group's mailing list or having reviewed
   the archives.  For the Working Group/BOF Chairs, it means getting all
   of the documents out early (i.e., several weeks) to give everybody
   time to read them and announcing an agenda and sticking to it.




<span class="grey">Internet Engineering Task Force                                [Page 14]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-15" id="page-15" name="page-15"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1539.html">RFC 1539</a>                    The Tao of IETF                 October 1993</span>


   At the Chair's discretion, some time may be devoted to bringing new
   Working Group attendees up to speed.  In fact, long lived Working
   Groups have occasionally held entire sessions which were introductory
   in nature.  As a rule, however, a Working Group is not the place to
   go for training.  Observers are always welcome, but they must realize
   that the work effort cannot be delayed for education.  Anyone wishing
   to attend a Working Group for the first time might seek out the Chair
   prior to the meeting and ask for some introduction.

   Another thing, for everybody, to consider is that Working Groups go
   through phases.  In the initial phase (say, the first two meetings),
   all ideas are welcome.  The idea is to gather all the possible
   solutions together for consideration.  In the development phase, a
   solution is chosen and developed.  Trying to reopen issues which were
   decided more than a couple of meetings back is considered bad form.
   The final phase (the last two meetings) is where the "spit and
   polish" are applied to the architected solution.  This is not the
   time to suggest architectural changes or open design issues already
   resolved.  It's a bad idea to wait until the last minute to speak out
   if a problem is discovered.  This is especially true for people whose
   excuse is that they hadn't read the documents until the day before a
   comments period ended.

   Time at the IETF meetings is a precious thing.  Working Groups are
   encouraged to meet between IETF meetings, either in person or by
   video or telephone conference.  Doing as much work as possible over
   the mailing lists would also reduce the amount of work which must be
   done at the meeting.

RFCs and Internet-Drafts

   Originally, RFCs were just what the name implies; they were requests
   for comments.  The early RFCs were messages between the ARPANET
   architects about how to resolve certain problems.  Over the years,
   RFCs became more formal.  It reached the point that they were being
   cited as standards, even when they weren't.

   To help clear up some confusion, there are now two special sub-series
   within the RFCs: FYIs and STDs.  The For Your Information RFC sub-
   series was created to document overviews and topics which are
   introductory.  Frequently, FYIs are created by groups within the IETF
   User Services Area.  The STD RFC sub-series was created to identify
   those RFCs which do in fact specify Internet Standards.








<span class="grey">Internet Engineering Task Force                                [Page 15]</span>

   Every RFC, including FYIs and STDs, have an RFC number by which they
   are indexed and by which they can be retrieved.  FYIs and STDs have
   FYI numbers and STD numbers, respectively, in addition to RFC
   numbers.  This makes it easier for a new Internet user, for example,
   to find all of the helpful, informational documents by looking for
   the FYIs amongst all the RFCs.  If an FYI or STD is revised, its RFC
   number will change, but its FYI or STD number will remain contant for
   ease of reference.

   There is also an RTR subseries of RFCs for Reseaux Associes pour la
   Recherche Europeenne (RARE) Technical Reports.  These are technical
   reports developed in the RARE community that are published as RFCs to
   provide easy access to the general Internet community.

   Internet-Drafts (I-D) are working documents of the IETF.  Any group
   (e.g., Working Group, BOF) or individual may submit a document for
   distribution as an I-D.  An I-D is valid for six months.  Guidelines
   require that an expiration date appear on every page of an I-D.  An
   I-D may be updated, replaced or obsoleted at any time.  It is not
   appropriate to use I-Ds as reference material or to cite them, other
   than as a "working draft" or "work in progress".

   For additional information, read the following documents:

   o  Request for Comments on Request for Comments [<a href="rfc1111.html">RFC1111</a>]
   o  F.Y.I. on F.Y.I: Introduction to the F.Y.I notes [FYI1]

Pointers to Useful Documents and Files

   This is a list of documents and files that provide useful information
   about the IETF meetings, Working Groups, and documentation.  These
   files reside in the "ietf" directory on the Anonymous FTP sites

   o  1wg-summary.txt            List of all Working Groups, by Area,
                                 including the name and address of the
                                 chairperson, and the mailing list
                                 address.
   o  1wg-summary-by-acronym     Same as above, but sorted by the
                                 Working Groups' acronyms.
   o  1wg-charter.txt            Abbreviated versions of all current

   o  1wg-charters-by-acronym    Same as above, but sorted by the
                                 Working Groups' acronyms.

   Additionally, the full charters and minutes of the Working Groups and
   BOFs are archived in the "ietf" directory.

   All of these documents are available by anonymous FTP from the
   following primary sites (there may be closer shadow sites, so check
   with your network administrator):

   o  North America    Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)
   o  Pacific Rim      Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)
   o  Europe           Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17)

   These files are also available through the Internet Gopher at
   "ietf.cnri.reston.va.us".

   Residing on the same archive sites are the RFCs and Internet-Drafts.
   They are in the "rfc" and "internet-drafts" directories,
   respectively.  The file "rfc-index.txt" contains the latest
   information about the RFCs (e.g., which have been obsoleted by
   which).  In general, only the newest version of an Internet-Draft is
   available.

   All of the files, RFCs and Internet-Drafts are also available via
   email from various mail servers.  To to get the IETF agenda,
   Internet-Draft abstracts and <a href="rfc1150.html">RFC 1150</a> from the mail server at the
   InterNIC, for example, you would send the following message:

      To: mailserv@ds.internic.net             Message header
      Subject: anything you want

      FILE /ietf/0mtg-agenda.txt               Body of the message
      FILE /internet-drafts/1id-abstracts.txt
      FILE /rfc/rfc1150.txt
      PATH jdoe@anywhere.us

   Where: FILE specifies the name of a file to be returned and PATH
   specifies the email address to which the file(s) should be sent.

   RFCs may also be retrieved, using email, from ISI's RFC-Info server
   at "rfc-info@isi.edu".  To get a specific RFC, include the following
   in the body of the message:

      Retrieve: RFC
       Doc-ID: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0951">RFC0951</a>

   This example would cause a copy of <a href="rfc951.html">RFC 951</a> (the leading zero in the
   Doc-ID is required) to be emailed to the requestor.  To get a list of
   available RFCs which match certain criteria, include the following in
   the body of the message:

      LIST: RFC
       Keywords: Gateway

   This example would email a list of all RFCs with "Gateway" in the
   title, or as an assigned keyword, to the requestor.  To get
   information on other ways to get RFCs:
