Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

IESG Note:

   This note documents a private protocol for tunnel management.  This
   protocol is NOT the product of an IETF working group nor is it a
   standards track document. There is ongoing effort in an IETF working
   group which could result in a standards track document which
   specifies a protocol which provides similar functionality.

Abstract

   This document specifies a generic tunnel management protocol that
   allows remote dial-in users to access their home network as if they
   were directly attached to the home network.  The user's client
   software uses an address contained in the home network address space
   for the remote access.  Packets to and from the home network are
   tunneled by the Network Access Server (NAS) to which the user
   connects and a Home Agent (HA) on the user's home network.  This
   allows for the support of access to Virtual Private Networks and also
   allows for the use of protocols other than IP to be carried over the
   tunnel.  An example of how the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In
   User Service) can be used to provide the necessary configuration
   information to support this service is also provided.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   The Ascend Tunnel Management Protocol (ATMP) is a protocol currently
   being used in Ascend Communication products to allow dial-in client
   software to obtain virtual presence on a user's home network from
   remote locations.  A user calls into a remote NAS but, instead of
   using an address belonging to a network directly supported by the
   NAS, the client software uses an address belonging to the user's
   "Home Network".  This address can be either provided by the client
   software or assigned from a pool of addresses from the Home Network
   address space.  In either case, this address belongs to the Home
   Network and therefore special routing considerations are required in

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2107.html">RFC 2107</a>                          ATMP                     February 1997</span>


   order to route packets to and from these clients.  A tunnel between
   the NAS and a special "Home Agent" (HA) located on the Home Network
   is used to carry data to and from the client.

   ATMP currently allows for both IP and IPX protocols to be tunneled
   between the NAS and the HA.  The protocol to be used, the HA to use,
   and other user specific information is provided by some configuration
   mechanism that is beyond the scope of this document.  <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>
   illustrates how RADIUS [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>5</a>] is used to convey this information to the
   NAS.

   The determination of the Home Network address to be used can be
   accomplished in different ways.  It could, for example, be configured
   in the client and negotiated by IPCP (or IPXCP).  Alternatively, it
   could be defined to be an address specific to the given user ID, or
   it could be assigned from a pool of addresses provided by the Home
   Network for the purpose of remote dial-in access.  Again, how this
   address is assigned and how the NAS decides to invoke ATMP for a
   specific call is beyond the scope of this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1%20Protocol%20Goals%20and%20Assumptions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a> Protocol Goals and Assumptions</span>

   The ATMP protocol is implemented only by the NAS and HA.  No other
   systems need to be aware of ATMP.  All other systems communicate in
   the normal manner and are unaware that they may be communicating with
   remote clients.  The clients themselves are unaware of ATMP.  It is
   assumed that standard PPP [<a href="#ref-8" title='"The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>8</a>] (or SLIP) clients are being used.

   Unlike the mobile-IP protocol [<a href="#ref-3" title='"IP Mobility Support"'>3</a>], ATMP assumes that a single NAS
   will provide the physical connection to a remote client for the
   duration of the session.  The client will not switch between NASes
   expecting to keep the same IP address and all associated sessions
   active during these transitions.  A particular client can be
   registered with a given HA only once at any given time.
   Deregistration with a HA implies loss of all higher layer sessions
   for that client.

   IP multicasting is currently not provided by ATMP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a> Terminology</span>

   The terminology used in this document is similar to that used in
   mobile-IP.  As pointed out in the previous section, however, ATMP
   provides a subset of the functionality provided by mobile-IP and the
   meanings of the various terms used herein have been modified
   accordingly.

      Connection Profile

         A table used to route packets other than by destination
         address.  The Connection Profile is a named entity that
         contains information indicating how packets addressed to it are
         to be routed.  It may be used to route packets to unregistered
         IP addresses and for routing protocols other than IP (e.g.,
         IPX).

      Foreign Agent (FA)

         A routing entity that resides in a NAS on a remote network that
         allows a mobile node to utilize a home network address.  It
         tunnels datagrams to, and detunnels datagrams from, the home
         agent for the given home network.

      Home Address

         An address that is assigned for an extended period of time to a
         mobile node.  It may remain unchanged regardless of where the
         MN is attached to the Internet.  Alternatively, it could be
         assigned from a pool of addresses.  The management of this pool
         is beyond the scope of this document.

      Home Agent (HA)

         A router on a mobile node's home network which tunnels
         datagrams for delivery to, and detunnels datagrams from, a
         mobile node when it is away from home.

      Home Network

         The address space of the network to which a user logically
         belongs.  When a workstation is physically connected to a LAN,
         the LAN address space is the user's home network.  ATMP
         provides for a remote virtual connection to a LAN.

      Mobile Node (MN)

         A host that wishes to use a Home Network address while
         physically connected by a point-to-point link (phone line,
         ISDN, etc.) to a NAS that does not reside on the Home Network.
         Also referred to as the client.

      Mobility Binding

         The association of a Home Address with a Foreign Agent IP
         address and a Tunnel ID.

      Network Access Server (NAS)

         A device providing temporary, on-demand, network access to
         users.  This access is point-to-point using phone or ISDN
         lines.

      Tunnel

         The path followed by a datagram when it is encapsulated.  The
         model is that, while it is encapsulated, a datagram is routed
         to a knowledgeable decapsulation agent, which decapsulates the
         datagram and then correctly delivers it to its ultimate
         destination.  Each mobile node connecting to a home agent does
         so over a unique tunnel, identified by a tunnel identifier
         which is unique to a given FA-HA pair.  A tunnel can carry both
         IP and IPX datagrams simultaneously.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3%20Protocol%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a> Protocol Overview</span>

   A mobile node that wishes to use a home address while connected to a
   remote NAS must register with the appropriate home agent.  The
   foreign agent entity of the remote NAS performs this registration on
   behalf of the MN.  Once registered, a tunnel is established between
   the FA and HA to carry datagrams to and from the MN.  While a MN is
   registered with an HA, the HA must intercept any packets destined for
   the MN's home address and forward them via the tunnel to the FA. When
   the FA detects that the MN has disconnected from the NAS, it issues a
   deregister request to the HA.

   Because ATMP allows protocols other than IP to be carried on its
   tunnels and also allows unregistered IP address to be used to provide
   for access to enterprise networks, the HA doesn't necessarily route
   datagrams received from the MN in the conventional manner.  The
   registration request allows for a named "Connection Profile" to be
   specified in the registration request.  This Connection Profile
   contains configuration information that tells the HA where to send
   packets that it receives from the MN.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4%20Specification%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" name="section-1.4">1.4</a> Specification Language</span>

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

      MUST               This word, or the adjective "required", means
                         that the definition is an absolute requirement
                         of the specification.

      MUST NOT           This phrase means that the definition is an
                         absolute prohibition of the specification.

      SHOULD             This word, or the adjective "recommended",
                         means that, in some circumstances, valid
                         reasons may exist to ignore this item, but
                         the full implications must be understood and
                         carefully weighed before choosing a different
                         course.  Unexpected results may result
                         otherwise.

      MAY                This word, or the adjective "optional", means
                         that this item is one of an allowed set of
                         alternatives.  An implementation which does
                         not include this option MUST be prepared to
                         interoperate with another implementation which
                         does include the option.

      silently discard   The implementation discards the datagram
                         without further processing, and without
                         indicating an error to the sender.  The

   ATMP defines a set of request and reply messages sent with UDP [<a href="#ref-4" title='"User Data Protocol"'>4</a>].
   The HA listens on UDP port 5150 [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Assigned Numbers"'>6</a>]) for requests from FA's.  The UDP
   checksum field MUST be computed and verified.  There are 7 different
   ATMP message types represented by the following Type values:

   A Registration Reply is issued by a Home Agent in reply to a
   Challenge Reply received from a Foreign Agent.  The Registration
   Reply indicates to the Foreign Agent whether the registration was
   accepted by the Home Agent or not.  It also provides a "tunnel ID" to
   uniquely identify the tunnel to be associated with this session.

   The Home Agent calculates the same MD5 hash on the Challenge Request
   Authenticator field and the shared secret.  The resulting digest is
   compared with the Reply value in the Challenge Reply and if it is
   equal, authentication is successful.  Otherwise the registration is
   not accepted and the Foreign Agent is informed by the Result Code of
   the Registration Reply that registration failed due to an
   authentication failure.

   The Deregistration Request is issued by the Foreign Agent to the Home
   Agent to indicate that the specified mobility binding is to be ended.
   This request may result from the Foreign Agent detecting that its
   connection to the Mobile Node has terminated.  It can also be issued
   in response to a detected error condition by the Foreign Agent or
   receipt of an Error Notification message from the Home Agent.

   The Deregistration Reply is issued by the Home Agent in response to a
   Deregistration Request received from a Foreign Agent.  If the
   Deregistration Request was valid, the Home Agent removes the

   Upon detection of a Mobile Node requiring ATMP service, the NAS
   invokes its ATMP Foreign Agent entity.The FA retrieves configuration
   information for the user involved.This information is obtained in a
   method particular to the NAS and is not specified by this document.
   The information obtained MUST include the Home Agent address and the
   shared secret for this HA.It also MAY include the Home Network Name,
   if a Connection Profile is to be used for this session.

   The FA then sends a Registration Request to the HA informing it that
   an MN wishes to register with it.  The FA then waits for the HA to
   respond with a Challenge Request.  The FA retransmits the
   Registration Request every 2 seconds until it receives the Challenge
   Request.  If, after 10 retransmissions, no Challenge Request is
   received, the FA will terminate the Registration Request, logs the
   registration failure, and disconnects the MN.

   Upon receipt of the Challenge Request, the FA examines the Result
   code.  If it indicates an error condition, the condition is logged
   and the MN is disconnected.  If the result is zero, the FA generates
   a Challenge Reply.  The Challenge Reply is generated by appending the
   Authenticator obtained from the Challenge Request with the shared
   secret (obtained from the configuration data) and then computing the
   MD5 hash of this concatenated string (authenticator + secret).  The
   16 octet hash is then returned in the Challenge Reply for validation
   by the HA.

   Upon receipt of the Challenge Reply from the FA, the HA does the same
   computation of the MD5 hash based on the Challenge Request
   Authenticator and the shared-secret (which it too must be configured
   with).  If this digest matches that provided in the Challenge Reply
   by the FA then the authentication is successful and the registration
   is accepted.  If the authentication fails, or resource limitations
   prohibit the registration attempt, the HA returns a Registration
   Reply with a non-zero result code to the FA.

   If the HA accepts the Challenge Reply from the FA, it assigns a
   Tunnel ID to this session and returns this Tunnel ID in a
   Registration Reply with a zero result code.  This Tunnel ID needs to
   be unique for the FA-HA pair.  The Tunnel ID is used to multiplex and
   demultiplex the packets sent between a given FA-HA pair.

   At the time the HA decides to accept a registration, it creates a
   control block that associates the Tunnel ID with the appropriate
   routing information.  If the Registration Request included a Home
   Network Name, this name is saved in the table and used as the name of
   the Connection Profile for this session.

   Upon receipt of the Registration Reply, the FA examines the result
   code. If it is non-zero, the FA logs the registration failure and
   disconnects the MN.  If it is zero, the FA saves the Tunnel ID in a
   control block associated with the MN session.  The FA and HA are now
   ready to exchange data packets for this MN session.

   On the FA side, all data received from the MN will be encapsulated
   using GRE and sent to the HA with the assigned Tunnel ID included in
   the GRE Key field.  When the HA receives a GRE packet it decapsulates
   it and routes it using the routing information contained in the HA's
   control block associated with this Tunnel ID.

   When the HA receives a packet destined for the MN's Home Address, it
   MUST encapsulate it in a GRE packet and forward it to the appropriate
   FA.  The Tunnel ID is included in the GRE Key field to allow the FA
   to demultiplex the packet.

   When the FA receives a GRE packet, it will examine the Tunnel ID in
   the GRE Key field to see if it matches the Tunnel ID assigned to any
   of the MN's currently connected to the FA.  If so, the packet is
   decapsulated and forwarded to the MN.  If the Tunnel ID doesn't match
   any active MN's, an Error Notification message is issued to the HA
   and the GRE packet is silently discarded.

   When the FA wishes to disconnect the MN from the HA, it issues a
   Deregistration Request.  This request is issued every 2 seconds.  If
   after 10 attempts a Deregistration Reply is not received from the HA,
   an error condition is logged and the MN is disconnected.  Upon
   receipt of a Deregistration Reply from the HA, the FA deallocates the
   Tunnel ID and disconnects the MN.

   The Registration function of ATMP is protected by a
   Challenge/Response mechanism similar to CHAP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"PPP Authentication Protocols"'>2</a>]. The Home Agent
   challenges each registration attempt by a Foreign Agent for
   authentication.This authentication requires the configuration of a
   shared secret for each HA/client pair.

Appendix A

   Additional RADIUS Attributes for ATMP

   This appendix indicates the RADIUS attributes that have been added by
   Ascend to support ATMP for IP.  Currently these are defined as non-
   vendor-specific attributes but have been included in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>5</a>].

       Attribute: "Ascend-Home-Agent-IP-Addr"
       Type:      IP-Address
       Value:     The IP address of the Home Agent

       Attribute: "Ascend-Home-Agent-Password"
       Type:      String
       Value:     Secret shared for this user with HA

       Attribute: "Ascend-Home-Network-Name"
       Type:      String
       Value:     Name of Connection Profile for this session

       Attribute: "Ascend-Home-Agent-UDP-Port"
       Type:      Integer
       Value:     The destination UDP port number for the specified HA

Appendix B

      IPX Operation

      ATMP specifies a mechanism which allows IPX clients to receive
      mobility services from a HA. <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> details the protocol used
      to register, deregister, and authenticate a tunnel used for IPX.
      Note that ATMP is based on IP datagrams for the management of
      tunnels and, thus, IPX tunneling with ATMP always requires an
      underlying IP network.

      Each IPX mobile client requires an IPX network number and node
      address pair.  Since IPX does not support a similar facility to
      IP's "host route," an enterprise-unique network number needs to be
      chosen for each home agent. This network number MUST be distinct
      from the IPX network number assigned to any of the home agent's
      LAN interfaces. Each mobile client tunneled to the home agent MUST
      use the same IPX network number.

      For example, consider a home agent which supports two mobile
      clients.  The home agent is on a LAN network with an IPX address
      of AA000001. The home agent's client network may be assigned
      AA000002. The two mobile clients may have addresses
      AA000002:0040F1000001 and AA000002:0040F1000002 respectively.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2107.html">RFC 2107</a>                          ATMP                     February 1997</span>


      IPX node numbers need to be unique on a given network. A mechanism
      must exist to guarantee that for each home agent's network, a
      given mobile client's node address is unique. Several techniques
      may be employed to assure unique node addresses. The current
      implementation of ATMP described in this document relies on RADIUS
      to assign a node address at the foreign agent. The following
      RADIUS attributes are included for IPX operation in addition to
      the attributes described in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> for IP operation:

       Attribute: "Framed-IPX-Network" (See [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>5</a>] for details).

       Attribute: "Ascend-IPX-Node-Addr"
       Type:      String
       String:    The node address for the mobile client in 12 octet
                  ASCII representing the hexadecimal string. Both
                  lower and upper case characters are permissible.
