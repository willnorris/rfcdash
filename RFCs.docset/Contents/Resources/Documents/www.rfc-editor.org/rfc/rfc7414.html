Abstract

   This document contains a roadmap to the Request for Comments (RFC)
   documents relating to the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol
   (TCP).  This roadmap provides a brief summary of the documents
   defining TCP and various TCP extensions that have accumulated in the
   RFC series.  This serves as a guide and quick reference for both TCP
   implementers and other parties who desire information contained in
   the TCP-related RFCs.

   This document obsoletes <a href="./rfc4614">RFC 4614</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7414">RFC 7414</a>                       TCP Roadmap                 February 2015</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   A correct and efficient implementation of the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP) is a critical part of the software of most Internet
   hosts.  As TCP has evolved over the years, many distinct documents
   have become part of the accepted standard for TCP.  At the same time,
   a large number of experimental modifications to TCP have also been
   published in the RFC series, along with informational notes, case
   studies, and other advice.

   As an introduction to newcomers and an attempt to organize the
   plethora of information for old hands, this document contains a
   roadmap to the TCP-related RFCs.  It provides a brief summary of the
   RFC documents that define TCP.  This should provide guidance to
   implementers on the relevance and significance of the standards-track
   extensions, informational notes, and best current practices that
   relate to TCP.

   This document is not an update of <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>] and is not a
   rigorous standard for what needs to be implemented in TCP.  This
   document is merely an informational roadmap that captures, organizes,
   and summarizes most of the RFC documents that a TCP implementer,
   experimenter, or student should be aware of.  Particular comments or
   broad categorizations that this document makes about individual
   mechanisms and behaviors are not to be taken as definitive, nor
   should the content of this document alone influence implementation
   decisions.

   This roadmap includes a brief description of the contents of each
   TCP-related RFC.  In some cases, we simply supply the abstract or a
   key summary sentence from the text as a terse description.  In
   addition, a letter code after an RFC number indicates its category in
   the RFC series (see <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp9">BCP 9</a> [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>] for explanation of these
   categories):

   S - Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or Internet
       Standard)

   E - Experimental

   I - Informational

   H - Historic

   B - Best Current Practice

   U - Unknown (not formally defined)




<span class="grey">Duke, et al.                  Informational                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7414">RFC 7414</a>                       TCP Roadmap                 February 2015</span>


   Note that the category of an RFC does not necessarily reflect its
   current relevance.  For instance, <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a> [<a href="./rfc5681" title='"TCP Congestion Control"'>RFC5681</a>] is considered
   part of the required core functionality of TCP, although the RFC is
   only a Draft Standard.  Similarly, some Informational RFCs contain
   significant technical proposals for changing TCP.

   Finally, if an error in the technical content has been found after
   publication of an RFC (at the time of this writing), this fact is
   indicated by the term "(Errata)" in the headline of the RFC's
   description.  The contents of the errata can be found through the RFC
   Errata page [<a href="#ref-Errata" title='"RFC Errata"'>Errata</a>].

   This roadmap is divided into three main sections.  <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> lists
   the RFCs that describe absolutely required TCP behaviors for proper
   functioning and interoperability.  Further RFCs that describe
   strongly encouraged, but nonessential, behaviors are listed in
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  Experimental extensions that are not yet standard
   practices, but that potentially could be in the future, are described
   in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   The reader will probably notice that these three sections are broadly
   equivalent to MUST/SHOULD/MAY specifications (per <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>]), and although the authors support this intuition, this
   document is merely descriptive; it does not represent a binding
   Standards Track position.  Individual implementers still need to
   examine the Standards Track RFCs themselves to evaluate specific
   requirement levels.

   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> describes both the procedures that the Internet Assigned
   Numbers Authority (IANA) uses and an RFC author should follow when
   new TCP parameters are requested and finally assigned.

   A small number of older experimental extensions that have not been
   widely implemented, deployed, and used are noted in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.  Many
   other supporting documents that are relevant to the development,
   implementation, and deployment of TCP are described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   A small number of fairly ubiquitous important implementation
   practices that are not currently documented in the RFC series are
   listed in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   Within each section, RFCs are listed in the chronological order of
   their publication dates.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7414">RFC 7414</a>                       TCP Roadmap                 February 2015</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Core%20Functionality"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Core Functionality</span>

   A small number of documents compose the core specification of TCP.
   These define the required core functionalities of TCP's header
   parsing, state machine, congestion control, and retransmission
   timeout computation.  These base specifications must be correctly
   followed for interoperability.

   <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a> S: "Transmission Control Protocol", STD 7 (September 1981)
              (Errata)

      This is the fundamental TCP specification document [<a href="./rfc793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC793</a>].
      Written by Jon Postel as part of the Internet protocol suite's
      core, it describes the TCP packet format, the TCP state machine
      and event processing, and TCP's semantics for data transmission,
      reliability, flow control, multiplexing, and acknowledgment.

      <a href="./rfc793#section-3.6">Section 3.6 of RFC 793</a>, describing TCP's handling of the IP
      precedence and security compartment, is mostly irrelevant today.
      <a href="./rfc2873">RFC 2873</a> (discussed later in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> below) changed the IP
      precedence handling, and the security compartment portion of the
      API is no longer implemented or used.  In addition, <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a> did
      not describe any congestion control mechanism.  Otherwise,
      however, the majority of this document still accurately describes
      modern TCPs.  <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a> is the last of a series of developmental TCP
      specifications, starting in the Internet Experimental Notes (IENs)
      and continuing in the RFC series.

   <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> S: "Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"
               (October 1989)

      This document [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>] updates and clarifies <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a> (see above
      in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>), fixing some specification bugs and oversights.  It
      also explains some features such as keep-alives and Karn's and
      Jacobson's RTO estimation algorithms [<a href="#ref-KP87" title='"Round Trip Time Estimation"'>KP87</a>][Jac88][<a href="#ref-JK92" title='"Congestion Avoidance and Control"'>JK92</a>].  ICMP
      interactions are mentioned, and some tips are given for efficient
      implementation.  <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> is an Applicability Statement, listing
      the various features that MUST, SHOULD, MAY, SHOULD NOT, and MUST
      NOT be present in standards-conforming TCP implementations.
      Unlike a purely informational roadmap, this Applicability
      Statement is a standards document and gives formal rules for
      implementation.

   <a href="./rfc2460">RFC 2460</a> S: "Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"
               (December 1998) (Errata)

      This document [<a href="./rfc2460" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>] is of relevance to TCP because it defines
      how the pseudo-header for TCP's checksum computation is derived
      when 128-bit IPv6 addresses are used instead of 32-bit IPv4
      addresses.  Additionally, <a href="./rfc2675">RFC 2675</a> (see <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> of this
      document) describes TCP changes required to support IPv6
      jumbograms.

   <a href="./rfc2873">RFC 2873</a> S: "TCP Processing of the IPv4 Precedence Field" (June 2000)
               (Errata)

      This document [<a href="./rfc2873" title='"TCP Processing of the IPv4 Precedence Field"'>RFC2873</a>] removes from the TCP specification all
      processing of the precedence bits of the TOS byte of the IP
      header.  This resolves a conflict over the use of these bits
      between <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a> (see above in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) and Differentiated
      Services [<a href="./rfc2474" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>RFC2474</a>].

   <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a> S: "TCP Congestion Control" (August 2009)

      Although <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a> (see above in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) did not contain any
      congestion control mechanisms, today congestion control is a
      required component of TCP implementations.  This document
      [<a href="./rfc5681" title='"TCP Congestion Control"'>RFC5681</a>] defines congestion avoidance and control mechanism for
      TCP, based on Van Jacobson's 1988 SIGCOMM paper [<a href="#ref-Jac88" title='"Congestion Avoidance and Control"'>Jac88</a>].

      A number of behaviors that together constitute what the community
      refers to as "Reno TCP" is described in <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a>.  The name "Reno"
      comes from the Net/2 release of the 4.3 BSD operating system.
      This is generally regarded as the least common denominator among
      TCP flavors currently found running on Internet hosts.  Reno TCP
      includes the congestion control features of slow start, congestion
      avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery.

      <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a> details the currently accepted congestion control
      mechanism, while <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a>, (see above in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) mandates that
      such a congestion control mechanism must be implemented.  <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a>
      differs slightly from the other documents listed in this section,
      as it does not affect the ability of two TCP endpoints to
      communicate; however, congestion control remains a critical
      component of any widely deployed TCP implementation and is
      required for the avoidance of congestion collapse and to ensure
      fairness among competing flows.

      RFCs 2001 and 2581 are the conceptual precursors of <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a>.  The
      most important changes relative to <a href="./rfc2581">RFC 2581</a> are:

      (a)  The initial window requirements were changed to allow larger
           Initial Windows as standardized in [<a href="./rfc3390" title="&quot;Increasing TCP's Initial Window&quot;">RFC3390</a>] (see <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>
           of this document).
      (b)  During slow start and congestion avoidance, the usage of
           Appropriate Byte Counting [<a href="./rfc3465" title='"TCP Congestion Control with Appropriate Byte Counting (ABC)"'>RFC3465</a>] (see <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> of this
           document) is explicitly recommended.
      (c)  The use of Limited Transmit [<a href="./rfc3042" title="&quot;Enhancing TCP's Loss Recovery Using Limited Transmit&quot;">RFC3042</a>] (see <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> of
           this document) is now recommended.

   <a href="./rfc6093">RFC 6093</a> S: "On the Implementation of the TCP Urgent Mechanism"
               (January 2011)

      This document [<a href="./rfc6093" title='"On the Implementation of the TCP Urgent Mechanism"'>RFC6093</a>] analyzes how current TCP stacks process
      TCP urgent indications, and how the behavior of widely deployed
      middleboxes affects the urgent indications processing.  The
      document updates the relevant specifications such that it
      accommodates current practice in processing TCP urgent
      indications.  Finally, the document raises awareness about the
      reliability of TCP urgent indications in the Internet, and
      recommends against the use of urgent mechanism.

   <a href="./rfc6298">RFC 6298</a> S: "Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer" (June 2011)

      Abstract of <a href="./rfc6298">RFC 6298</a> [<a href="./rfc6298" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>]: "This document defines the
      standard algorithm that Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

   RFCs 2675 and 7323 represent fundamental changes to TCP by redefining
   how parts of the basic TCP header and options are interpreted.  <a href="./rfc7323">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc7323">7323</a> defines the Window Scale option, which reinterprets the
   advertised receive window.  <a href="./rfc2675">RFC 2675</a> specifies that MSS option and
   urgent pointer fields with a value of 65,535 are to be treated
   specially.

   <a href="./rfc2675">RFC 2675</a> S: "IPv6 Jumbograms" (August 1999) (Errata)

      IPv6 supports longer datagrams than were allowed in IPv4.  These
      are known as jumbograms, and use with TCP has necessitated changes
      to the handling of TCP's MSS and Urgent fields (both 16 bits).
      This document [<a href="./rfc2675" title='"IPv6 Jumbograms"'>RFC2675</a>] explains those changes.  Although it
      describes changes to basic header semantics, these changes should
      only affect the use of very large segments, such as IPv6
      jumbograms, which are currently rarely used in the general
      Internet.

      Supporting the behavior described in this document does not affect
      interoperability with other TCP implementations when IPv4 or non-
      jumbogram IPv6 is used.  This document states that jumbograms are
      to only be used when it can be guaranteed that all receiving
      nodes, including each router in the end-to-end path, will support
      jumbograms.  If even a single node that does not support
      jumbograms is attached to a local network, then no host on that
      network may use jumbograms.  This explains why jumbogram use has
      been rare, and why this document is considered a performance
      optimization and not part of TCP over IPv6's basic functionality.

   <a href="./rfc7323">RFC 7323</a> S: "TCP Extensions for High Performance" (September 2014)

      this specification is a recommendation how to modify the algorithm

   Two of the most important aspects of TCP are its congestion control
   and loss recovery features.  TCP treats lost packets as indicating
   congestion-related loss and cannot distinguish between congestion-
   related loss and loss due to transmission errors.  Even when ECN is
   in use, there is a rather intimate coupling between congestion
   control and loss recovery mechanisms.  There are several extensions
   to both features, and more often than not, a particular extension
   applies to both.  In these two subsections, we group enhancements to
   TCP's congestion control, while the next subsection focus on TCP's
   loss recovery.

   <a href="./rfc3168">RFC 3168</a> S: "The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
               to IP" (September 2001)

      This document [<a href="./rfc3168" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>RFC3168</a>] defines a means for end hosts to detect
      congestion before congested routers are forced to discard packets.
      Although congestion notification takes place at the IP level, ECN
      requires support at the transport level (e.g., in TCP) to echo the
      bits and adapt the sending rate.  This document updates <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a>
      (see <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document) to define two previously unused
      flag bits in the TCP header for ECN support.  <a href="./rfc3540">RFC 3540</a> (see
      <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a> of this document) provides a supplementary
      (experimental) means for more secure use of ECN, and <a href="./rfc2884">RFC 2884</a> (see
      <a href="#section-7.8">Section 7.8</a> of this document) provides some sample results from
      using ECN.

   For the typical implementation of the TCP fast recovery algorithm
   described in <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a> (see <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document), a TCP sender
   only retransmits a segment after a retransmit timeout has occurred,
   or after three duplicate ACKs have arrived triggering the fast
   retransmit.  A single RTO might result in the retransmission of
   several segments, while the fast retransmit algorithm in <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a>
   leads only to a single retransmission.  Hence, multiple losses from a
   single window of data can lead to a performance degradation.
   Documents listed in this section aim to improve the overall
   performance of TCP's standard loss recovery algorithms.  In
   particular, some of them allow TCP senders to recover more
   effectively when multiple segments are lost from a single flight of
   data.

   <a href="./rfc2018">RFC 2018</a> S: "TCP Selective Acknowledgment Options" (October 1996)
               (Errata)

      When more than one packet is lost during one RTT, TCP may
      experience poor performance since a TCP sender can only learn
      about a single lost packet per RTT from cumulative
      acknowledgments.  This document [<a href="./rfc2018" title='"TCP Selective Acknowledgment Options"'>RFC2018</a>] defines the basic
      selective acknowledgment (SACK) mechanism for TCP, which can help
      to overcome these limitations.  The receiving TCP returns SACK
      blocks to inform the sender which data has been received.  The
      sender can then retransmit only the missing data segments.

      This document [<a href="./rfc6582" title="&quot;The NewReno Modification to TCP's Fast Recovery Algorithm&quot;">RFC6582</a>] specifies a modification to the standard
      Reno fast recovery algorithm, whereby a TCP sender can use partial
      acknowledgments to make inferences determining the next segment to
      send in situations where SACK would be helpful but isn't
      available.  Although it is only a slight modification, the NewReno

      multiple segments are lost from a single window of data.

      congestion control specification in <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a> (see <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of
      this document), but allows TCP senders to recover more effectively

   Spurious retransmission timeouts are harmful to TCP performance and
   multiple algorithms have been defined for detecting when spurious
   retransmissions have occurred, but they respond differently with
   regard to their manners of recovering performance.  The IETF defined
   multiple algorithms because there are trade-offs in whether or not
   certain TCP options need to be implemented and concerns about IPR
   status.  The Standards Track RFCs in this section are closely related
   to the Experimental RFCs in <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a> also addressing this topic.

      document).  It enables use of the SACK option to acknowledge
      duplicate packets.  With this extension, called DSACK, the sender
      is able to infer the order of packets received at the receiver
      and, therefore, to infer when it has unnecessarily retransmitted a
      packet.  A TCP sender could then use this information to detect
      spurious retransmissions (see [<a href="./rfc3708" title='"Using TCP Duplicate Selective Acknowledgement (DSACKs) and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Duplicate Transmission Sequence Numbers (TSNs) to Detect Spurious Retransmissions"'>RFC3708</a>]).

   The MTUs supported by different links and tunnels within the Internet
   can vary widely.  Fragmentation of packets larger than the supported
   MTU on a hop is undesirable.  As TCP is the segmentation layer for
   dividing an application's byte stream into IP packet payloads, TCP
   implementations generally include Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)
   mechanisms in order to maximize the size of segments they send,
   without causing fragmentation within the network.  Some algorithms
   may utilize signaling from routers on the path to determine that the
   MTU on some part of the path has been exceeded.

   Especially in streaming applications, the overhead of TCP/IP headers
   could correspond to more than 50% of the total amount of data sent.
   Such large overheads may be tolerable in wired LANs where capacity is
   often not an issue, but are excessive for WANs and wireless systems
   where bandwidth is scarce.  Header compression schemes for TCP/IP
   like RObust Header Compression (ROHC) can significantly compress this
   overhead.  It performs well over links with significant error rates
   and long round-trip times.

   <a href="./rfc1144">RFC 1144</a> S: "Compressing TCP/IP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links"
               (February 1990)

      This document [<a href="./rfc1144" title='"Compressing TCP/IP headers for low-speed serial links"'>RFC1144</a>] describes a method for compressing the
      headers of TCP/IP datagrams to improve performance over low-speed
      serial links.  The method described in this document is limited in
      its handling of TCP options and cannot compress the headers of
      SYNs and FINs.

   <a href="./rfc6846">RFC 6846</a> S: "RObust Header Compression (ROHC): A Profile for TCP/IP
               (ROHC-TCP)" (January 2013)

      From the Abstract of <a href="./rfc6846">RFC 6846</a> [<a href="./rfc6846" title='"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): A Profile for TCP/IP (ROHC-TCP)"'>RFC6846</a>]: "This document specifies
      a RObust Header Compression (ROHC) profile for compression of TCP/
      IP packets.  The profile, called ROHC-TCP, provides efficient and
      robust compression of TCP headers, including frequently used TCP
      options such as selective acknowledgments (SACKs) and Timestamps."
      <a href="./rfc6846">RFC 6846</a> is the successor of <a href="./rfc4996">RFC 4996</a>.  It fixes a technical issue
      with the SACK compression and clarifies other compression methods
      used.

   By default, TCP lacks any cryptographic structures to differentiate
   legitimate segments from those spoofed from malicious hosts.
   Spoofing valid segments requires correctly guessing a number of
   fields.  The documents in this subsection describe ways to make that
   guessing harder or to prevent it from being able to affect a
   connection negatively.

   <a href="./rfc4953">RFC 4953</a> I: "Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks" (July 2007)

      This document [<a href="./rfc4953" title='"Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks"'>RFC4953</a>] discusses the recently increased
      vulnerability of long-lived TCP connections, such as BGP
      connections, to reset (send RST) spoofing attacks.  The document
      analyzes the vulnerability, discussing proposed solutions at the
      transport level and their inherent challenges, as well as existing
      network level solutions and the feasibility of their deployment.

   <a href="./rfc5461">RFC 5461</a> I: "TCP's Reaction to Soft Errors" (February 2009)

      This document [<a href="./rfc5461" title="&quot;TCP's Reaction to Soft Errors&quot;">RFC5461</a>] describes a nonstandard but widely
      implemented modification to TCP's handling of ICMP soft error
      messages that rejects pending connection-requests when such error
      messages are received.  This behavior reduces the likelihood of
      long delays between connection-establishment attempts that may
      arise in some scenarios.

   <a href="./rfc4987">RFC 4987</a> I: "TCP SYN Flooding Attacks and Common Mitigations" (August

      This document [<a href="./rfc4987" title='"TCP SYN Flooding Attacks and Common Mitigations"'>RFC4987</a>] describes the well-known TCP SYN flooding
      attack.  It analyzes and discusses various countermeasures against
      these attacks, including their use and trade-offs.

   <a href="./rfc5925">RFC 5925</a> S: "The TCP Authentication Option" (June 2010)

      This document [<a href="./rfc5925" title='"The TCP Authentication Option"'>RFC5925</a>] describes the TCP Authentication Option
      (TCP-AO), which is used to authenticate TCP segments.  TCP-AO
      obsoletes the TCP MD5 Signature option of <a href="./rfc2385">RFC 2385</a>.  It supports
      the use of stronger hash functions, protects against replays for
      long-lived TCP connections (as used, e.g., in BGP and LDP),
      coordinates key exchanges between endpoints, and provides a more
      explicit recommendation for external key management.
      Cryptographic algorithms for TCP-AO are defined in [<a href="./rfc5926" title='"Cryptographic Algorithms for the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO)"'>RFC5926</a>] (see

   <a href="./rfc5927">RFC 5927</a> I: "ICMP Attacks against TCP" (July 2010)

      Abstract of <a href="./rfc5927">RFC 5927</a> [<a href="./rfc5927" title='"ICMP Attacks against TCP"'>RFC5927</a>]: "This document discusses the use
      of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to perform a

      that help to mitigate these issues."

   <a href="./rfc5961">RFC 5961</a> S: "Improving TCP's Robustness to Blind In-Window Attacks"

      This document [<a href="./rfc5961" title="&quot;Improving TCP's Robustness to Blind In-Window Attacks&quot;">RFC5961</a>] describes minor modifications to how TCP
      handles inbound segments.  This renders TCP connections,
      especially long-lived connections such as H-323 or BGP, less
      vulnerable to spoofed packet injection attacks where the 4-tuple
      (the source and destination IP addresses and the source and
      destination ports) has been guessed.

   <a href="./rfc6528">RFC 6528</a> S: "Defending against Sequence Number Attacks" (February

      Abstract of <a href="./rfc6528">RFC 6528</a> [<a href="./rfc6528" title='"Defending against Sequence Number Attacks"'>RFC6528</a>]: "This document specifies an
      algorithm for the generation of TCP Initial Sequence Numbers

   The RFCs in this section are either Experimental and may become
   Proposed Standards in the future or are Proposed Standards (or
   Informational), but can be considered experimental due to lack of
   wide deployment.  At least part of the reason that they are still
   experimental is to gain more wide-scale experience with them before a
   standards track decision is made.

   If the Experimental RFC is a proposal for a new protocol capability
   or service, i.e., it requires a new TCP option code point, the
   implementation and experimentation should follow [<a href="./rfc6994" title='"Shared Use of Experimental TCP Options"'>RFC6994</a>] (see
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> of this document), which describes how the experimental TCP
   option code points can concurrently support multiple TCP extensions.

   By their publication as Experimental RFCs, it is hoped that the
   community of TCP researchers will analyze and test the contents of
   these RFCs.  Although experimentation is encouraged, there is not yet

   formal consensus that these are fully logical and safe behaviors.
   Wide-scale deployment of implementations that use these features
   should be well thought out in terms of consequences.

   As multiple flows may share the same paths, sections of paths, or
   other resources, the TCP implementation may benefit from sharing
   information across TCP connections or other flows.  Some experimental
   proposals have been documented and some implementations have included
   the concepts.

   <a href="./rfc2140">RFC 2140</a> I: "TCP Control Block Interdependence" (April 1997)

      This document [<a href="./rfc2140" title='"TCP Control Block Interdependence"'>RFC2140</a>] suggests how TCP connections between the
      same endpoints might share information, such as their congestion
      control state.  To some degree, this is done in practice by a few
      operating systems; for example, Linux currently has a destination
      cache.  Although this RFC is technically Informational, the
      concepts it describes are in experimental use, so we include it in
      this section.

   <a href="./rfc3124">RFC 3124</a> S: "The Congestion Manager" (June 2001)

      This document [<a href="./rfc3124" title='"The Congestion Manager"'>RFC3124</a>] is a related proposal to <a href="./rfc2140">RFC 2140</a> (see
      above in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).  The idea behind the Congestion Manager,
      moving congestion control outside of individual TCP connections,
      represents a modification to the core of TCP, which supports
      sharing information among TCP connections.  Although a Proposed
      Standard, some pieces of the Congestion Manager support
      architecture have not been specified yet, and it has not achieved
      use or implementation beyond experimental stacks, so it is not
      listed among the standard TCP enhancements in this roadmap.

   Like the Standards Track documents listed in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>, there also
   exist new Experimental RFCs that specify fundamental changes to TCP.
   At the time of writing, the only example so far is TCP Fast Open that
   deviates from the standard TCP semantics of [<a href="./rfc793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC793</a>].

   <a href="./rfc7413">RFC 7413</a> E: "TCP Fast Open" (December 2014)

      This document [<a href="./rfc7413" title='"TCP Fast Open"'>RFC7413</a>] describes TCP Fast Open that allows data
      to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the
      receiver during the initial connection handshake.  It saves up to
      one RTT compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way
      handshake to complete before data can be exchanged.

   TCP congestion control has been an extremely active research area for
   many years (see <a href="./rfc5783">RFC 5783</a> discussed in <a href="#section-7.6">Section 7.6</a> of this document),
   as it determines the performance of many applications that use TCP.
   A number of Experimental RFCs address issues with flow start up,
   overshoot, and steady-state behavior in the basic algorithms of <a href="./rfc5681">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc5681">5681</a> (see <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document).  In these subsections,
   enhancements to TCP's congestion control are listed.  The next
   subsection focuses on TCP's loss recovery.

   <a href="./rfc2861">RFC 2861</a> E: "TCP Congestion Window Validation" (June 2000)

      This document [<a href="./rfc2861" title='"TCP Congestion Window Validation"'>RFC2861</a>] suggests reducing the congestion window
      over time when no packets are flowing.  This behavior is more
      aggressive than that specified in <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a> (see <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this
      document), which says that a TCP sender SHOULD set its congestion
      window to the initial window after an idle period of an RTO or
      greater.

   <a href="./rfc3540">RFC 3540</a> E: "Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signaling

      This document [<a href="./rfc3540" title='"Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signaling with Nonces"'>RFC3540</a>] describes an optional addition to ECN that
      protects against accidental or malicious concealment of marked

   <a href="./rfc4782">RFC 4782</a> E: "Quick-Start for TCP and IP" (January 2007) (Errata)

      This document [<a href="./rfc4782" title='"Quick- Start for TCP and IP"'>RFC4782</a>] specifies the optional Quick-Start
      mechanism for TCP.  This mechanism allows connections to use
      higher sending rates at the beginning of the data transfer or
      after an idle period, provided that there is significant unused
      bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers
      along the path approve this higher rate.

      This document [<a href="./rfc5562" title="&quot;Adding Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Capability to TCP's SYN/ACK Packets&quot;">RFC5562</a>] describes an experimental modification to

      ECN in TCP SYN/ACK packets.  This would allow to ECN-mark rather
      than drop the TCP SYN/ACK packet at an ECN-capable router, and to
      avoid the severe penalty of a retransmission timeout for a
      connection when the SYN/ACK packet is dropped.

      for TCP (and SCTP) that can be used to recover lost segments when
      a connection's congestion window is small.  In certain special
      circumstances, Early Retransmit reduces the number of duplicate
      acknowledgments required to trigger fast retransmit to recover
      segment losses without waiting for a lengthy retransmission
      timeout.

      be used to disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion

      to increase the threshold used to trigger a fast retransmission

   Besides the well-known retransmission timeout the TCP standard
   [<a href="./rfc793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC793</a>] defines other timeouts.  This section lists documents that
   deal with TCP's various timeouts.

   <a href="./rfc5482">RFC 5482</a> S: "TCP User Timeout Option" (March 2009)

      As a local per-connection parameter, the TCP user timeout controls
      how long transmitted data may remain unacknowledged before a
      connection is forcefully closed.  This document [<a href="./rfc5482" title='"TCP User Timeout Option"'>RFC5482</a>]
      specifies the TCP User Timeout Option that allows one end of a TCP
      connection to advertise its current user timeout value.  This
      information provides advice to the other end of the TCP connection
      to adapt its user timeout accordingly.

   MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) is an ongoing effort within the IETF that
   allows a TCP connection to simultaneously use multiple IP addresses /
   interfaces to spread their data across several subflows, while
   presenting a regular TCP interface to applications.  Benefits of this
   include better resource utilization, better throughput and smoother
   reaction to failures.  The documents listed in this section specify
   the Multipath TCP scheme, while the documents in Sections <a href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>, <a href="#section-7.4">7.4</a>,
   and 7.5 provide some additional background information.

   <a href="./rfc6356">RFC 6356</a> E: "Coupled Congestion Control for Multipath Transport
               Protocols" (October 2011)

      This document [<a href="./rfc6356" title='"Coupled Congestion Control for Multipath Transport Protocols"'>RFC6356</a>] presents a congestion control algorithm
      for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP.  It
      couples the congestion control algorithms running on different
      subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically
      controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow.  The
      result is an algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while
      moving traffic away from congested links.

   The RFCs listed here define extensions that have thus far failed to

      This document [<a href="./rfc1263" title='"TCP Extensions Considered Harmful"'>RFC1263</a>] argues against "backwards compatible" TCP
      extensions.  Specifically mentioned are several TCP enhancements
      that have been successful, including timestamps, window scaling,
      PAWS, and SACK.  <a href="./rfc1263">RFC 1263</a> presents an alternative approach called
      "protocol evolution", whereby several evolutionary versions of TCP
      would exist on hosts.  These distinct TCP versions would represent
      upgrades to each other and could be header incompatible.
      Interoperability would be provided by having a virtualization
      layer select the right TCP version for a particular connection.
      This idea did not catch on with the community, while the type of
      extensions <a href="./rfc1263">RFC 1263</a> specifically targeted as harmful did become
      popular.

   <a href="./rfc1379">RFC 1379</a> H: "Extending TCP for Transactions -- Concepts" (November

      The inventors of TCP believed that cached connection state could
      have been used to eliminate TCP's three-way handshake, to support
      two-packet request/response exchanges.  <a href="./rfc1379">RFC 1379</a> [<a href="./rfc1379" title='"Extending TCP for Transactions -- Concepts"'>RFC1379</a>] (see

      from simple.  Furthermore, T/TCP floundered on the ease of denial-
      of-service attacks that can result.  One idea pioneered by T/TCP
      lives on in <a href="./rfc2140">RFC 2140</a> (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> of this document), in the
      sharing of state across connections.

      This document [<a href="./rfc1693" title='"An Extension to TCP : Partial Order Service"'>RFC1693</a>] defines a TCP extension for applications
      that do not care about the order in which application-layer
      objects are received.  Examples are multimedia and database
      applications.  In practice, these applications either accept the
      possible performance loss because of TCP's strict ordering or use
      specialized transport protocols other than TCP, such as PR-SCTP
      [<a href="./rfc3758" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Partial Reliability Extension"'>RFC3758</a>].

               (October 1994): lack of interest

      To overcome the exhaustion of the IP class B address space, this
      document [<a href="./rfc1705" title='"Six Virtual Inches to the Left: The Problem with IPng"'>RFC1705</a>] suggests that a new version of TCP (TCPng)
      needs to be developed and deployed.  It proposes that a globally
      unique address be assigned to the transport layer to uniquely
      identify an Internet host without specifying any routing
      information.  Later work on splitting locator and identifier
      values is summarized well in [<a href="./rfc6115" title='"Recommendation for a Routing Architecture"'>RFC6115</a>], but no resulting changes
      to TCP have occurred.

   <a href="./rfc6013">RFC 6013</a> E: "TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT)" (January 2011): lack of
               interest

      This document [<a href="./rfc6013" title='"TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT)"'>RFC6013</a>] describes a method to exchange a cookie
      (nonce) during the connection establishment to negotiate
      elimination of receiver state.  These cookies are later used to
      inhibit premature closing of connections and reduce retention of
      state after the connection has terminated.

      Since the cookie pair is too large to fit with the other TCP
      options in the 40 bytes of TCP option space, the document further
      describes a method to extent the option space after the connection
      establishment.

      Although <a href="./rfc6013">RFC 6013</a> was published in 2011, the authors of this
      document places it in this section of the roadmap document due to
      two factors.

      (a)  The authors are not aware of any wide deployment and use of
           <a href="./rfc6013">RFC 6013</a>.
      (b)  <a href="./rfc6013">RFC 6013</a> uses experimental TCP option code points, which
           prohibits a large-scale deployment.

   The documents listed in this section contain information that is
   largely duplicated by the standards documents previously discussed.
   However, some of them contain a greater depth of problem statement
   explanation or other context.  Particularly, RFCs 813 - 817 (known as

               1984)

      This document [<a href="./rfc896" title='"Congestion control in IP/TCP internetworks"'>RFC896</a>] contains some early experiences with
      congestion collapse and some initial thoughts on how to avoid it
      using congestion control in TCP.  Furthermore, it defined an
      algorithm for efficient transmission of small packets that is
      today known as the Nagle algorithm.

   <a href="./rfc964">RFC 964</a> U: "Some Problems with the Specification of the Military
               Standard Transmission Control Protocol" (November 1985)

      This document [<a href="./rfc964" title='"Some problems with the specification of the Military Standard Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC964</a>] points out several specification bugs in
      the US Military's MIL-STD-1778 document, which was intended as a
      successor to <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a> (see <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document).  This
      serves to remind us of the difficulty in specification writing
      (even when we work from existing documents!).

   Some documents in this section contain architectural guidance and
   concerns, while others specify TCP- and congestion-control-related
   mechanisms that are broadly applicable and have impacts on TCP's
   congestion control techniques.  Some of these documents are direct
   products of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) giving their
   guidance on specific aspects of congestion control in the Internet.

   <a href="./rfc1958">RFC 1958</a> I: "Architectural Principles of the Internet" (June 1996)

      This document [<a href="./rfc1958" title='"Architectural Principles of the Internet"'>RFC1958</a>] describes the underlying principles of the
      Internet architecture.  It provides guidelines for network systems
      designs that have proven useful in the evolution of the Internet.

   <a href="./rfc2914">RFC 2914</a> B: "Congestion Control Principles" (September 2000)

      This document [<a href="./rfc2914" title='"Congestion Control Principles"'>RFC2914</a>] motivates the use of end-to-end congestion
      control for preventing congestion collapse and providing fairness
      to TCP.  Later work on TCP has included several more aggressive
      mechanisms than Reno TCP includes, and <a href="./rfc5033">RFC 5033</a> (see <a href="#section-7.4">Section 7.4</a>
      of this document) provides additional guidance on use of such
      algorithms.  The fundamental architectural discussion in <a href="./rfc2914">RFC 2914</a>
      remains valid, regarding the standards process role in defining
      protocol aspects that are critical to performance and avoiding
      congestion collapse scenarios.

   <a href="./rfc3360">RFC 3360</a> B: "Inappropriate TCP Resets Considered Harmful" (August
               2002)

      This document [<a href="./rfc3360" title='"Inappropriate TCP Resets Considered Harmful"'>RFC3360</a>] is a plea that firewall vendors not send
      gratuitous TCP RST (Reset) packets when unassigned TCP header bits
      are used.  This practice prevents desirable extension and
      evolution of the protocol and thus is potentially harmful to the
      future of the Internet.

   <a href="./rfc2757">RFC 2757</a> I: "Long Thin Networks" (January 2000)

      Several methods of improving TCP performance over long thin

      as geosynchronous satellite links, are discussed in this document
      [<a href="./rfc2757" title='"Long Thin Networks"'>RFC2757</a>].  A particular set of TCP options is developed that
      should work well in such environments and be safe to use in the
      global Internet.  The implications of such environments have been
      further discussed in RFCs 3150 and 3155 (see below in
      <a href="#section-7.3">Section 7.3</a>), and these documents should be preferred where there

      This document [<a href="./rfc2760" title='"Ongoing TCP Research Related to Satellites"'>RFC2760</a>] discusses the advantages and disadvantages
      of several different experimental means of improving TCP
      performance over long-delay or error-prone paths.  These include
      T/TCP, larger initial windows, byte counting, delayed
      acknowledgments, slow start thresholds, NewReno and SACK-based
      loss recovery, FACK [<a href="#ref-MM96" title='"Forward Acknowledgement: Refining TCP Congestion Control"'>MM96</a>], ECN, various corruption-detection
      mechanisms, congestion avoidance changes for fairness, use of
      multiple parallel flows, pacing, header compression, state
      sharing, and ACK congestion control, filtering, and
      reconstruction.  Although <a href="./rfc2488">RFC 2488</a> (see above in <a href="#section-7.3">Section 7.3</a>)

   <a href="./rfc6056">RFC 6056</a> B: "Recommendations for Transport-Protocol Port
               Randomization" (December 2010)

      This document [<a href="./rfc6056" title='"Recommendations for Transport- Protocol Port Randomization"'>RFC6056</a>] describes a number of simple and efficient
      methods for the selection of the client port number.  It reduces
      the possibility of an attacker guessing the correct five-tuple
      (Protocol, Source/Destination Address, Source/Destination Port).

   <a href="./rfc6191">RFC 6191</a> B: "Reducing the TIME-WAIT State Using TCP Timestamps"

      This document [<a href="./rfc6191" title='"Reducing the TIME-WAIT State Using TCP Timestamps"'>RFC6191</a>] describes the usage of the TCP Timestamps
      option (<a href="./rfc7323">RFC 7323</a>, see <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> of this document) to perform
      heuristics to determine whether or not to allow the creation of a
      new incarnation of a connection that is in the TIME-WAIT state.

   <a href="./rfc6429">RFC 6429</a> I: "TCP Sender Clarification for Persist Condition"
               (December 2011)

      This document [<a href="./rfc6429" title='"TCP Sender Clarification for Persist Condition"'>RFC6429</a>] clarifies the actions that a TCP can take
      on connections that are experiencing the Zero Window Probe (ZWP)
      condition.

   <a href="./rfc6897">RFC 6897</a> I: "Multipath TCP (MPTCP) Application Interface

      This document [<a href="./rfc6897" title='"Multipath TCP (MPTCP) Application Interface Considerations"'>RFC6897</a>] characterizes the impact that Multipath
      TCP (MPTCP) (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a> of this document) may have on
      applications.  It further discusses compatibility issues of MPTCP
      in combination with non-MPTCP-aware applications.  Finally, it
      describes a basic API that is a simple extension of TCP's
      interface for MPTCP-aware applications.

      A few of the tools that this document [<a href="./rfc1470" title='"FYI on a Network Management Tool Catalog: Tools for Monitoring and Debugging TCP/IP Internets and Interconnected Devices"'>RFC1470</a>] describes are
      still maintained and in use today, for example, ttcp and tcpdump.
      However, many of the tools described do not relate specifically to
      TCP and are no longer used or easily available.

   <a href="./rfc2398">RFC 2398</a> I: "Some Testing Tools for TCP Implementors" (August 1998)

      This document [<a href="./rfc2398" title='"Some Testing Tools for TCP Implementors"'>RFC2398</a>] describes a number of TCP packet
      generation and analysis tools.  Although some of these tools are
      no longer readily available or widely used, for the most part they
      are still relevant and usable.

   <a href="./rfc5783">RFC 5783</a> I: "Congestion Control in the RFC Series" (February 2010)

      This document [<a href="./rfc5783" title='"Congestion Control in the RFC Series"'>RFC5783</a>] provides an overview of RFCs related to
      congestion control that had been published at the time.  The focus
      of the document is on end-host-based congestion control.

   The first MIB module defined for use with Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP) was a single monolithic MIB module, called MIB-I,
   defined in <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a>.  This evolved over time to the MIB-II
   specification in <a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a>, which obsoletes <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a>.  It then became
   apparent that having a single monolithic MIB module was not scalable,
   given the number and breadth of MIB data definitions that needed to
   be included.  Thus, additional MIB modules were defined, and those
   parts of MIB-II that needed to evolve were split off.  Eventually,
   the remaining parts of MIB-II were also split off, the TCP-specific
   part being documented in <a href="./rfc2012">RFC 2012</a>.  <a href="./rfc2012">RFC 2012</a> was obsoleted by <a href="./rfc4022">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc4022">4022</a>, which is the primary TCP MIB document at the time of writing.
   For current TCP implementers, <a href="./rfc4022">RFC 4022</a> should be supported.

   <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> S: "Management Information Base for Network Management of
               TCP/IP-based Internets" (May 1990)

      This document [<a href="./rfc1156" title='"Management Information Base for network management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>RFC1156</a>] describes the required MIB fields for TCP
      implementations with minor corrections and no technical changes
      from <a href="./rfc1066">RFC 1066</a>, which it obsoletes.  This is the Standards Track
      RFC for MIB-I.

      This document [<a href="./rfc1213" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets:MIB-II"'>RFC1213</a>] describes the second version of the MIB in
      a monolithic form.  It is the immediate successor of <a href="./rfc1158">RFC 1158</a>,
      with minor modifications.  It obsoletes the MIB-I, defined in <a href="./rfc1156">RFC</a>
      <a href="./rfc1156">1156</a> (see above in <a href="#section-7.7">Section 7.7</a>).

               Control Protocol using SMIv2" (November 1996)

      In an update to <a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a> (see <a href="#section-7.7">Section 7.7</a> of this document), this
      document [<a href="./rfc2012" title='"SNMPv2 Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol using SMIv2"'>RFC2012</a>] defines the TCP MIB by splitting out the TCP-
      specific portions.  It is now obsoleted by <a href="./rfc4022">RFC 4022</a> (see below in
      <a href="#section-7.7">Section 7.7</a>).

   <a href="./rfc2452">RFC 2452</a> S: "IP Version 6 Management Information Base for the
               Transmission Control Protocol" (December 1998)

      This document [<a href="./rfc2452" title='"IP Version 6 Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC2452</a>] augments <a href="./rfc2012">RFC 2012</a> (see <a href="#section-7.7">Section 7.7</a> of this
      document) by adding an IPv6-specific connection table.  The rest
      of <a href="./rfc2012">RFC 2012</a> holds for any IP version.  <a href="./rfc2452">RFC 2452</a> is now obsoleted
      by <a href="./rfc4022">RFC 4022</a> (see below in <a href="#section-7.7">Section 7.7</a>).

      Although it is a Standards Track RFC, <a href="./rfc2452">RFC 2452</a> is considered a
      historic mistake by the MIB community, as it is based on the idea
      of parallel IPv4 and IPv6 structures.  Although IPv6 requires new
      structures, the community has decided to define a single generic
      structure for both IPv4 and IPv6.  This will aid in definition,
      implementation, and transition between IPv4 and IPv6.

   <a href="./rfc4022">RFC 4022</a> S: "Management Information Base for the Transmission Control

      This document [<a href="./rfc4022" title='"Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)"'>RFC4022</a>] obsoletes RFCs 2012 and 2452 (see above in
      <a href="#section-7.7">Section 7.7</a>) and specifies the current standard for the TCP MIB
      that should be deployed.

   <a href="./rfc4898">RFC 4898</a> S: "TCP Extended Statistics MIB" (May 2007)

      This document [<a href="./rfc4898" title='"TCP Extended Statistics MIB"'>RFC4898</a>] describes extended performance statistics
      for TCP.  They are designed to use TCP's ideal vantage point to
      diagnose performance problems in both the network and the
      application.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7414">RFC 7414</a>                       TCP Roadmap                 February 2015</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Undocumented%20TCP%20Features"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Undocumented TCP Features</span>

   There are a few important implementation tactics for the TCP that
   have not yet been described in any RFC.  Although this roadmap is
   primarily concerned with mapping the TCP RFCs, this section is
   included because an implementer needs to be aware of these important
   issues.

   Header Prediction

      Header prediction is a trick to speed up the processing of
      segments.  Van Jacobson and Mike Karels developed the technique in
      the late 1980s.  The basic idea is that some processing time can
      be saved when most of a segment's fields can be predicted from
      previous segments.  A good description of this was sent to the
      TCP-IP mailing list by Van Jacobson on March 9, 1988 (see
      [<a href="#ref-Jacobson" title='"TCP-IP Mailing List"'>Jacobson</a>] for the full message):

         Quite a bit of the speedup comes from an algorithm that we
         ('we' refers to collaborator Mike Karels and myself) are
         calling "header prediction".  The idea is that if you're in the
         middle of a bulk data transfer and have just seen a packet, you
         know what the next packet is going to look like: It will look
         just like the current packet with either the sequence number or
         ack number updated (depending on whether you're the sender or
         receiver).  Combining this with the "Use hints" epigram from
         Butler Lampson's classic "Epigrams for System Designers", you
         start to think of the tcp state (rcv.nxt, snd.una, etc.) as
         "hints" about what the next packet should look like.

         If you arrange those "hints" so they match the layout of a tcp
         packet header, it takes a single 14-byte compare to see if your
         prediction is correct (3 longword compares to pick up the send
         &amp; ack sequence numbers, header length, flags and window, plus a
         short compare on the length).  If the prediction is correct,
         there's a single test on the length to see if you're the sender
         or receiver followed by the appropriate processing.  E.g., if
         the length is non-zero (you're the receiver), checksum and
         append the data to the socket buffer then wake any process
         that's sleeping on the buffer.  Update rcv.nxt by the length of
         this packet (this updates your "prediction" of the next
         packet).  Check if you can handle another packet the same size
         as the current one.  If not, set one of the unused flag bits in
         your header prediction to guarantee that the prediction will
         fail on the next packet and force you to go through full
         protocol processing.  Otherwise, you're done with this packet.
         So, the *total* tcp protocol processing, exclusive of
         checksumming, is on the order of 6 compares and an add.

   Forward Acknowledgement (FACK)

      FACK [<a href="#ref-MM96" title='"Forward Acknowledgement: Refining TCP Congestion Control"'>MM96</a>] includes an alternate algorithm for triggering fast
      retransmit [<a href="./rfc5681" title='"TCP Congestion Control"'>RFC5681</a>], based on the extent of the SACK scoreboard.
      Its goal is to trigger fast retransmit as soon as the receiver's
      reassembly queue is larger than the duplicate ACK threshold, as
      indicated by the difference between the forward most SACK block
      edge and SND.UNA.  This algorithm quickly and reliably triggers
      fast retransmit in the presence of burst losses -- often on the
      first SACK following such a loss.  Such a threshold-based
      algorithm also triggers fast retransmit immediately in the
      presence of any reordering with extent greater than the duplicate
      ACK threshold.  FACK is implemented in Linux and turned on per
      default.

   Congestion Control for High Rate Flows

      In the last decade significant research effort has been put into
      experimental TCP congestion control modifications for obtaining
      high throughput with reduced startup and recovery times.  Only a
      few RFCs have been published on some of these modifications,
      including HighSpeed TCP [<a href="./rfc3649" title='"HighSpeed TCP for Large Congestion Windows"'>RFC3649</a>], Limited Slow-Start [<a href="./rfc3742" title='"Limited Slow-Start for TCP with Large Congestion Windows"'>RFC3742</a>],
      and Quick-Start [<a href="./rfc4782" title='"Quick- Start for TCP and IP"'>RFC4782</a>] (see <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a> of this document for
      more information on each), but high-rate congestion control
      mechanisms are still considered an open issue in congestion
      control research.  Some other schemes have been published as
      Internet-Drafts, e.g.  CUBIC [<a href="#ref-CUBIC" title='"CUBIC for Fast Long-Distance Networks"'>CUBIC</a>] (the standard TCP congestion
      control algorithm in Linux), Compound TCP [<a href="#ref-CTCP" title='"Compound TCP: A New TCP Congestion Control for High-Speed and Long Distance Networks"'>CTCP</a>], and H-TCP [<a href="#ref-HTCP" title='"H-TCP: TCP Congestion Control for High Bandwidth-Delay Product Paths"'>HTCP</a>]
      or have been discussed a little by the IETF, but much of the work
      in this area has not been adopted within the IETF yet, so the
      majority of this work is outside the RFC series and may be
      discussed in other products of the IRTF Internet Congestion
      Control Research Group (ICCRG).

Acknowledgments

   This document grew out of a discussion on the end2end-interest
   mailing list, the public list of the End-to-End Research Group of the
   IRTF, and continued development under the IETF's TCP Maintenance and
   Minor Extensions (TCPM) working group.  We thank Mark Allman, Yuchung
   Cheng, Ted Faber, Gorry Fairhurst, Sally Floyd, Janardhan Iyengar,
   Reiner Ludwig, Pekka Savola, and Joe Touch for their contributions,
   in particular.  Keith McCloghrie provided some useful notes and
   clarification on the various MIB-related RFCs.
