Abstract

   In the original Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME document (<a href="./rfc2634">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2634">2634</a>), a structure for cryptographically linking the certificate to
   be used in validation with the signature was introduced; this
   structure was hardwired to use SHA-1.  This document allows for the
   structure to have algorithm agility and defines a new attribute for
   this purpose.

   In the original Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME document
   [<a href="#ref-ESS" title='"Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME"'>ESS</a>], a structure for cryptographically linking the certificate to
   be used in validation with the signature was defined.  This
   structure, called ESSCertID, identifies a certificate by its hash.
   The structure is hardwired to use a SHA-1 hash value.  The recent
   attacks on SHA-1 require that we define a new attribute that allows
   for the use of different algorithms.  This document performs that
   task.

   This document defines the structure ESSCertIDv2 along with a new
   attribute SigningCertificateV2, which uses the updated structure.
   This document allows for the structure to have algorithm agility by
   including an algorithm identifier and defines a new signed attribute
   to use the new structure.

   This document specifies the continued use of ESSCertID to ensure
   compatibility when SHA-1 is used for certificate disambiguation.

   5.4 Signing Certificate Attribute Definitions

   The signing certificate attribute is designed to prevent simple
   substitution and re-issue attacks, and to allow for a restricted set
   of certificates to be used in verifying a signature.

   Two different attributes exist for this due to a flaw in the original
   design.  The only substantial difference between the two attributes
   is that SigningCertificateV2 allows for hash algorithm agility, while
   SigningCertificate forces the use of the SHA-1 hash algorithm.  With
   the recent advances in the ability to create hash collisions for
   SHA-1, it is wise to move forward sooner rather than later.

   When the SHA-1 hash function is used, the SigningCertificate
   attribute MUST be used.  The SigningCertificateV2 attribute MUST be
   used if any algorithm other than SHA-1 is used and SHOULD NOT be used
   for SHA-1.  Applications SHOULD recognize both attributes as long as
   they consider SHA-1 able to distinguish between two different
   certificates, (i.e., the possibility of a collision is sufficiently
   low).  If both attributes exist in a single message, they are
   independently evaluated.

   Four cases exist that need to be taken into account when using this
   attribute for correct processing:

   1.  Signature validates and the hashes match: This is the success
       case.

   2.  Signature validates and the hashes do not match: In this case,
       the certificate contained the correct public key, but the
       certificate containing the public key is not the one that the
       signer intended to be used.  In this case the application should
       attempt a search for a different certificate with the same public
       key and for which the hashes match.  If no such certificate can
       be found, this is a failure case.

   3.  Signature fails validation and the hashes match: In this case, it
       can be assumed that the signature has been modified in some
       fashion.  This is a failure case.

   4.  Signature fails validation and the hashes do not match: In this
       case, it can be either that the signature has been modified, or
       that the wrong certificate has been used.  Applications should
       attempt a search for a different certificate that matches the
       hash value in the attribute and use the new certificate to retry
       the signature validation.

   5.4.1 Signing Certificate Attribute Definition Version 2

   The signing certificate attribute is designed to prevent the simple
   substitution and re-issue attacks, and to allow for a restricted set
   of certificates to be used in verifying a signature.

   SigningCertificateV2 is identified by the OID:

       id-aa-signingCertificateV2 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
           member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9)
           smime(16) id-aa(2) 47 }

   The attribute has the ASN.1 definition:

       SigningCertificateV2 ::=  SEQUENCE {
           certs        SEQUENCE OF ESSCertIDv2,
           policies     SEQUENCE OF PolicyInformation OPTIONAL
       }

   certs
      contains the list of certificates that are to be used in
      validating the message.  The first certificate identified in the
      sequence of certificate identifiers MUST be the certificate used
      to verify the signature.  The encoding of the ESSCertIDv2 for this
      certificate SHOULD include the issuerSerial field.  If other
      constraints ensure that issuerAndSerialNumber will be present in
      the SignerInfo, the issuerSerial field MAY be omitted.  The
      certificate identified is used during the signature verification
      process.  If the hash of the certificate does not match the
      certificate used to verify the signature, the signature MUST be
      considered invalid.

      If more than one certificate is present, subsequent certificates
      limit the set of certificates that are used during validation.
      Certificates can be either attribute certificates (limiting
      authorizations) or public key certificates (limiting path
      validation).  The issuerSerial field (in the ESSCertIDv2
      structure) SHOULD be present for these certificates, unless the
      client who is validating the signature is expected to have easy
      access to all the certificates required for validation.  If only
      the signing certificate is present in the sequence, there are no
      restrictions on the set of certificates used in validating the
      signature.

   policies
      contains a sequence of policy information terms that identify
      those certificate policies that the signer asserts apply to the
      certificate, and under which the certificate should be relied
      upon.  This value suggests a policy value to be used in the

      PolicyInformation can be found in [<a href="./rfc3280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC3280</a>].

   attribute; it MUST NOT be an unsigned attribute.  CMS defines
   SignedAttributes as a SET OF Attribute.  A SignerInfo MUST NOT
   include multiple instances of the SigningCertificateV2 attribute.

   attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.  A SigningCertificateV2 attribute
   MUST include only a single instance of AttributeValue.  There MUST
   NOT be zero or multiple instances of AttributeValue present in the
   attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.

   Insert the following text as a new section.

   5.4.1.1 Certificate Identification Version 2

   The best way to identify certificates is an often-discussed issue.
   The ESSCertIDv2 structure supplies two different fields that are used
   for this purpose.

   The hash of the entire certificate allows for a verifier to check
   that the certificate used in the verification process was the same
   certificate the signer intended.  Hashes are convenient in that they
   are frequently used by certificate stores as a method of indexing and
   retrieving certificates as well.  The use of the hash is required by
   this structure since the detection of substituted certificates is
   based on the fact they would map to different hash values.

   The issuer/serial number pair is the method of identification of
   certificates used in [<a href="./rfc3280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC3280</a>].  That document imposes a restriction
   for certificates that the issuer distinguished name must be present.
   The issuer/serial number pair would therefore normally be sufficient
   to identify the correct signing certificate.  (This assumes the same
   issuer name is not reused from the set of trust anchors.)  The
   issuer/serial number pair can be stored in the sid field of the
   SignerInfo object.  However, the sid field is not covered by the
   signature.  In the cases where the issuer/serial number pair is not
   used in the sid or the issuer/serial number pair needs to be signed,
   it SHOULD be placed in the issuerSerial field of the ESSCertIDv2
   structure.

   Attribute certificates and additional public key certificates
   containing information do not have an issuer/serial number pair
   represented anywhere in a SignerInfo object.  When an attribute
   certificate or an additional public key certificate is not included
   in the SignedData object, it becomes much more difficult to get the
   correct set of certificates based only on a hash of the certificate.
   For this reason, these certificates SHOULD be identified by the
   IssuerSerial object.

   This document defines a certificate identifier as:

        ESSCertIDv2 ::=  SEQUENCE {
            hashAlgorithm           AlgorithmIdentifier
                   DEFAULT {algorithm id-sha256},
            certHash                 Hash,
            issuerSerial             IssuerSerial OPTIONAL
        }

        Hash ::= OCTET STRING

        IssuerSerial ::= SEQUENCE {
            issuer                   GeneralNames,
            serialNumber             CertificateSerialNumber
       }

   The fields of ESSCertIDv2 are defined as follows:

   hashAlgorithm
      contains the identifier of the algorithm used in computing
      certHash.

   certHash
      is computed over the entire DER-encoded certificate (including the
      signature) using the SHA-1 algorithm.

   issuerSerial
      holds the identification of the certificate.  The issuerSerial
      would normally be present unless the value can be inferred from
      other information (e.g., the sid field of the SignerInfo object).

   The fields of IssuerSerial are defined as follows:

   issuer
      contains the issuer name of the certificate.  For non-attribute
      certificates, the issuer MUST contain only the issuer name from
      the certificate encoded in the directoryName choice of
      GeneralNames.  For attribute certificates, the issuer MUST contain
      the issuer name field from the attribute certificate.

      holds the serial number that uniquely identifies the certificate

   5.4.2 Signing Certificate Attribute Definition Version 1

   The signing certificate attribute is designed to prevent the simple
   substitution and re-issue attacks, and to allow for a restricted set
   of certificates to be used in verifying a signature.

   The definition of SigningCertificate is

       SigningCertificate ::=  SEQUENCE {
           certs        SEQUENCE OF ESSCertID,
           policies     SEQUENCE OF PolicyInformation OPTIONAL
       }

       id-aa-signingCertificate OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
           member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9)
           smime(16) id-aa(2) 12 }

   The first certificate identified in the sequence of certificate
   identifiers MUST be the certificate used to verify the signature.
   The encoding of the ESSCertID for this certificate SHOULD include the
   issuerSerial field.  If other constraints ensure that
   issuerAndSerialNumber will be present in the SignerInfo, the
   issuerSerial field MAY be omitted.  The certificate identified is
   used during the signature verification process.  If the hash of the
   certificate does not match the certificate used to verify the
   signature, the signature MUST be considered invalid.

   If more than one certificate is present in the sequence of
   ESSCertIDs, the certificates after the first one limit the set of
   certificates that are used during validation.  Certificates can be
   either attribute certificates (limiting authorizations) or public key
   certificates (limiting path validation).  The issuerSerial field (in
   the ESSCertID structure) SHOULD be present for these certificates,
   unless the client who is validating the signature is expected to have

   easy access to all the certificates required for validation.  If only
   the signing certificate is present in the sequence, there are no
   restrictions on the set of certificates used in validating the
   signature.

   The sequence of policy information terms identifies those certificate
   policies that the signer asserts apply to the certificate, and under
   which the certificate should be relied upon.  This value suggests a
   policy value to be used in the relying party's certification path
   validation.

   If present, the SigningCertificate attribute MUST be a signed
   attribute; it MUST NOT be an unsigned attribute.  Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMS) defines SignedAttributes as a SET OF Attribute.
   A SignerInfo MUST NOT include multiple instances of the
   SigningCertificate attribute.  CMS defines the ASN.1 syntax for the
   signed attributes to include attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.  A
   SigningCertificate attribute MUST include only a single instance of
   AttributeValue.  There MUST NOT be zero or multiple instances of
   AttributeValue present in the attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.

   certificate is used by the validator than the signer, the validator
   may not get the correct result.  An example of this would be that the
   original certificate was revoked and a new certificate with the same
   public key was issued for a different individual.  Since the issuer/
   serial number field is not protected, the attacker could replace this
   and point to the new certificate and validation would be successful.

   The attributes defined in this document are to be placed in locations
   that are protected by the signature.  This attribute does not provide
   any additional security if placed in an unsigned or un-authenticated
   location.

   The attributes defined in this document permit a signer to select a
   hash algorithm to identify a certificate.  A poorly selected hash
   algorithm may provide inadequate protection against certificate
   substitution or result in denial of service for this protection.  By
   employing the attributes defined in this specification with the same
   hash algorithm used for message signing, the sender can ensure that
   these attributes provide commensurate security.

   Since recipients must support the hash algorithm to verify the
   signature, selecting the same hash algorithm also increases the
   likelihood that the hash algorithm is supported in the context of
   certificate identification.  Note that an unsupported hash algorithm
   for certificate identification does not preclude validating the
   message but does deny the message recipient protection against
   certificate substitution.

   To ensure that legacy implementations are provided protection against
   certificate substitution, clients are permitted to include both
   ESScertID and ESScertIDv2 in the same message.  Since these

   attributes are generated and evaluated independently, the contents
   could conceivably be in conflict.  Specifically, where a signer has
   multiple certificates containing the same public key, the two
   attributes could specify different signing certificates.  The result
   of signature processing may vary depending on which certificate is
   used to validate the signature.

   Recipients that attempt to evaluate both attributes may choose to
   reject such a message.
