   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   TCP/IP-based internets.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.
   However, after experimentation, if sufficient consensus is reached in
   the Internet community, then a subsequent revision of this document
   may be placed in the Internet-standard MIB.

   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Historical%20Perspective"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Historical Perspective</span>

   As reported in <a href="./rfc1052">RFC 1052</a>, IAB Recommendations for the Development of
   Internet Network Management Standards [<a href="#ref-1" title='"IAB Recommendations for the Development of Internet Network Management Standards"'>1</a>], a two-prong strategy for
   network management of TCP/IP-based internets was undertaken.  In the
   short-term, the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined in
   <a href="./rfc1067">RFC 1067</a>, was to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.
   In the long-term, the use of the OSI network management framework was
   to be examined.  Two documents were produced to define the management
   information: <a href="./rfc1065">RFC 1065</a>, which defined the Structure of Management
   Information (SMI), and <a href="./rfc1066">RFC 1066</a>, which defined the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Both of these documents were designed so as
   to be compatible with both the SNMP and the OSI network management
   framework.

   This strategy was quite successful in the short-term: Internet-based
   network management technology was fielded, by both the research and
   commercial communities, within a few months.  As a result of this,
   portions of the Internet community became network manageable in a
   timely fashion.

   As reported in <a href="./rfc1109">RFC 1109</a>, Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network
   Management Review Group [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network Management Review Group"'>2</a>], the requirements of the SNMP and the OSI
   network management frameworks were more different than anticipated.
   As such, the requirement for compatibility between the SMI/MIB and
   both frameworks was suspended.  This action permitted the operational
   network management framework, based on the SNMP, to respond to new
   operational needs in the Internet community by producing MIB-II.

   In May of 1990, the core documents were elevated to "Standard
   Protocols" with "Recommended" status.  As such, the Internet-
   standard network management framework consists of: Structure and
   Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets,
   <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>3</a>], which describes how managed objects contained in the
   MIB are defined; Management Information Base for Network Management
   of TCP/IP-based internets, which describes the managed objects
   contained in the MIB, <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based Internets"'>4</a>]; and, the Simple Network
   Management Protocol, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title="and J. Davin">5</a>], which defines the protocol used to
   manage these objects.

   Consistent with the IAB directive to produce simple, workable systems
   in the short-term, the list of managed objects defined in the
   Internet-standard MIB was derived by taking only those elements which
   are considered essential.  However, the SMI defined three
   extensibility mechanisms: one, the addition of new standard objects
   through the definitions of new versions of the MIB; two, the addition
   of widely-available but non-standard objects through the experimental
   subtree; and three, the addition of private objects through the



<span class="grey">Satz                                                            [Page 2]</span></pre>

   enterprises subtree.  Such additional objects can not only be used
   for vendor-specific elements, but also for experimentation as
   required to further the knowledge of which other objects are
   essential.

   Since the publication of the Internet-standard MIB, experience has
   lead to a new document, termed MIB-II [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>6</a>], being defined.

   This memo defines extensions to the MIB using the second method.  It
   contains definitions of managed objects used for experimentation.
   After experimentation, if sufficient consensus is reached in the
   Internet community, then a subsequent revision of this memo may be
   placed in the Internet-standard MIB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Objects</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Specification of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)"'>7</a>]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>3</a>] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   This SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Specification of Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract Notation One (ASN.1)"'>8</a>],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

   The next section contains the specification of all object types
   contained in the MIB.  Following the conventions of the companion
   memo, the object types are defined using the following fields:

          OBJECT:
          -------
               A textual name, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, for the
               object type, along with its corresponding OBJECT
               IDENTIFIER.

          Syntax:
               The abstract syntax for the object type, presented using
               ASN.1.  This must resolve to an instance of the ASN.1
               type ObjectSyntax defined in the SMI.

          Definition:
               A textual description of the semantics of the object
               type.  Implementations should ensure that their
               interpretation of the object type fulfills this
               definition since this MIB is intended for use in multi-
               vendor environments.  As such it is vital that object
               types have consistent meaning across all machines.

          Access:
               A keyword, one of read-only, read-write, write-only, or
               not-accessible.  Note that this designation specifies the
               minimum level of support required.  As a local matter,
               implementations may support other access types (e.g., an
               implementation may elect to permitting writing a variable
               marked herein as read-only).  Further, protocol-specific
               "views" (e.g., those implied by an SNMP community) may
               make further restrictions on access to a variable.

          Status:
               A keyword, one of mandatory, optional, obsolete, or
               deprecated.  Use of deprecated implies mandatory status.

   These objects can be used when the ISO Connectionless-mode Network
   Protocol [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Protocol for providing the Connectionless-mode Network Service and Provision of Underlying Service"'>9</a>] and End System to Intermediate System [<a href="#ref-10" title='"End System to Intermediate System Routing Exchange Protocol for Use in Conjunction with the Protocol for the Provision of the Connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473)"'>10</a>] protocols are
   present. No assumptions are made as to what underlying protocol is
   being used to carry the SNMP.

   This memo uses the string encoding of [<a href="#ref-11" title='"A String Encoding of Presentation Address"'>11</a>] to textually describe OSI
   addresses.

   The ASN.1 type ClnpAddress is used to denote an OSI address.  This
   consists of a string of octets.  The first octet of the string
   contains a binary value in the range of 0..20, and indicates the the
   length in octets of the NSAP.  Following the first octet, is the
   NSAP, expressed in concrete binary notation, starting with the most
   significant octet.  A zero- length NSAP is used as a "special"
   address meaning "the default NSAP" (analogous to the IP address of
   0.0.0.0).  Such an NSAP is encoded as a single octet, containing the
   value 0.

   All other NSAPs are encoded in at least 2 octets.

          That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination
          identified with said entry from the route identified with said
          entry.  It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
          the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
          Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive
          tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries
          not currently in use.  Proper interpretation of such entries
          requires examination of the relevant clnpRouteType object.

   The Address Translation tables contain the CLNP address to physical
   address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables
   for determining address equivalences; if all interfaces are of this
   type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero
   entries.

               The type of mapping.

          Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of
          invalidating the corresponding entry in the
          clnpMediaToNetTable.  That is, it effectively dissassociates
          the interface identified with said entry from the mapping
          identified with said entry.  It is an implementation-specific
          matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry
          from the table.  Accordingly, management stations must be
          prepared to receive tabular information from agents that
          corresponds to entries not currently in use.  Proper
          interpretation of such entries requires examination of the
          relevant clnpMediaToNetType object.

   The names for all object types in the MIB are defined explicitly
   either in the Internet-standard MIB or in other documents which
   conform to the naming conventions of the SMI.  The SMI requires that
   conformant management protocols define mechanisms for identifying
   individual instances of those object types for a particular network
   element.

   Each instance of any object type defined in the MIB is identified in
   SNMP operations by a unique name called its "variable name." In

   general, the name of an SNMP variable is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the
   form x.y, where x is the name of a non-aggregate object type defined
   in the MIB and y is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER fragment that, in a way
   specific to the named object type, identifies the desired instance.

   This naming strategy admits the fullest exploitation of the semantics
   of the powerful SNMP get-next operator, because it assigns names for
   related variables so as to be contiguous in the lexicographical
   ordering of all variable names known in the MIB.

   The type-specific naming of object instances is defined below for a
   number of classes of object types.  Instances of an object type to
   which none of the following naming conventions are applicable are
   named by OBJECT IDENTIFIERs of the form x.0, where x is the name of
   said object type in the MIB definition.

   For example, suppose one wanted to identify an instance of the
   variable sysDescr in the Internet-standard MIB.  The object class for
   sysDescr is:

      iso org dod internet mgmt mib system sysDescr
       1   3   6     1      2    1    1       1

   Hence, the object type, x, would be 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1 to which is
   appended an instance sub-identifier of 0.  That is, 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
   identifies the one and only instance of sysDescr.

   The name of an CLNP-addressable network element, x, is the OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER of the form z such that z is the value (in which each
   octet of the ClnpAddress type is expressed as a sub-identifier of the
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER) of that instance of the clnpAdEntAddr object type
   associated with x.

   For each object type, t, for which the defined name, n, has a prefix
   of clnpAddrEntry, an instance, i, of t is named by an OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER of the form n.y, where y is the name of the CLNP-
   addressable network element about which i represents information.

   For example, suppose one wanted to find the maximum reassembly size
   of an entry in the CLNP interface table associated with an CLNP
   address of NS+0504030201.  Accordingly, clnpAdEntNetMask.5.5.4.3.2.1
   would identify the desired instance.

   The name of an CLNP route, x, is the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the form z

   such that z is the value (in which each octet of the ClnpAddress type
   is expressed as a sub-identifier of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER) of that
   instance of the clnpRouteDest object type associated with x.

   For each object type, t, for which the defined name, n, has a prefix
   of clnpRoutingEntry, an instance, i, of t is named by an OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER of the form n.y, where y is the name of the CLNP route
   about which i represents information.

   For example, suppose one wanted to find the next hop of an entry in
   the CLNP routing table associated  with the destination of
   NS+0504030201.  Accordingly, clnpRouteNextHop.5.5.4.3.2.1 would
   identify the desired instance.

   At the option of the agent, multiple routes to the same destination
   may be visible.  To realize this, the agent, while required to return
   a single entry for an CLNP route, x, of the form n.y, may also return
   information about other routes to the same destination using the form
   n.y.v, where v is a implementation-dependent small, non-negative
   integer.

   The name of a cached CLNP address, x, is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the
   form s.z, such that s is the value of that instance of the
   clnpNetToMediaIfIndex object type associated with the entry and z is
   the value of the CLNP address of the clnpNetToMediaNetAddress object
   type associated with x, in which each octet of the ClnpAddress type
   is expressed as a sub-identifier of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

   For each object type, t, for which the defined name, n, has a prefix
   of clnpNetToMediaEntry, an instance, i, of t is named by an OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER of the form n.y, where y is the name of the cached CLNP
   address about which i represents information.

   For example, suppose one wanted to find the media address of an entry
   in the address translation table associated with a CLNP address of
   NS+0504030201 and interface 3.  Accordingly,
   clnpNetToMediaPhysAddress.3.5.5.4.3.2.1 would identify the desired
   instance.
