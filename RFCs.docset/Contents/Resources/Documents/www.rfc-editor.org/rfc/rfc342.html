RFC #342                                         15 May 1972

                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

        This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from April
   24 to May 5.  During this interval the IBM 360/44 at the University
   of Southern California (Network Address 23) became a Network user.

        Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.
   These Hosts fall into two categories:

        1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network
   as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis
   for at least two weeks.  Included here are:

         Network
         Address              Site               Computer
         -------              ----               --------
           134               MIT-AI              PDP-10
            13               Case                PDP-10

        2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.
   Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the
   Network (AMES, MITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, and BBN*).  This category
   also includes the Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5)
   which is used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.
   Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:

         Network
         Address              Site               Computer
         -------              ----               --------
             7               Rand                IBM-360/65
            73               Harvard             PDP-1
            12               Illinois            PDP-11
            19               NBS                 PDP-11
            23               USC                 IBM-360/44

        The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for
   this period.

   is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to refine
   and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

where
D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)

F = Full (Destination Host opened a connection, informed user that all
    Network ports were in use, and immediately closed the connection.

H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.

O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)

R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
    connection within 60 seconds.)
____________
*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a Network Job
 Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to test
 NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection to the NETRJS logger
 indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
#These sites advertise that they may not have their system available at
 these times.
!Rand opened a connection but requested users to logout immediately.
