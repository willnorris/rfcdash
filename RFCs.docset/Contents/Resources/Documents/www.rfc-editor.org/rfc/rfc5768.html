Abstract

   This specification defines a media feature tag and an option tag for
   use with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The media feature
   tag allows a User Agent (UA) to communicate to its registrar that it
   supports ICE.  The option tag allows a UA to require support for ICE
   in order for a call to proceed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc3264">RFC 3264</a> [<a href="./rfc3264" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] defines a two-phase exchange of Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] messages for the purposes of
   establishment of multimedia sessions.  This offer/answer mechanism is
   used by protocols such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>].

   Protocols using offer/answer are difficult to operate through Network
   Address Translators (NAT).  Because their purpose is to establish a
   flow of media packets, they tend to carry IP addresses within their
   messages, which is known to be problematic through NAT [<a href="./rfc3235" title='"Network Address Translator (NAT)-Friendly Application Design Guidelines"'>RFC3235</a>].  To
   remedy this, an extension to SDP, called Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) has been defined [<a href="./rfc5245" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>RFC5245</a>].  ICE defines
   procedures by which agents gather a multiplicity of addresses,
   include all of them in an SDP offer or answer, and then use peer-to-
   peer Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [<a href="./rfc5389" title='"Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5389</a>]
   connectivity checks to determine a valid address.

   This specification defines a media feature tag, "sip.ice", and a SIP
   option tag, "ice", that can be used by SIP User Agents that make use
   of ICE.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> motivates the need for the media feature tag and
   option tag, and <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> and <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> formally define them.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5768">RFC 5768</a>                       ICE Support                    April 2010</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Motivation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Motivation</span>

   There are two primary motivations for defining an option tag and a
   media feature tag.  They are support for gateways, and requiring ICE
   for a call.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Gateways"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Gateways</span>

   Unfortunately, ICE requires both endpoints to support it in order for
   it to be used.  Within a domain, there will typically be User Agents
   that do and do not support ICE.  In order to facilitate deployment of
   ICE, it is anticipated that domains will make use of gateways that
   act as ICE agents on one side, and non-ICE agents on the other side.
   This would allow a call from domain A into domain B to make use of
   ICE, even if the device in domain B does not itself yet support ICE.
   However, when domain B receives a call, it will need to know whether
   the call needs to pass through such a gateway, or whether it can go
   to the terminating UA directly.

   In order to make such a determination, this specification defines a
   media feature tag, "sip.ice", which can be included in the Contact
   header field of a REGISTER request [<a href="./rfc3840" title='"Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3840</a>].  This allows the
   registrar to track whether or not a UA supports ICE.  This
   information can be accessed by a proxy in order to determine whether
   or not a call needs to route through a gateway.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Mandating%20Support%20for%20ICE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Mandating Support for ICE</span>

   Although ICE provides a built in fall back to non-ICE operation when
   the answerer doesn't support it, there are cases where the offerer
   would rather abort the call rather than proceed without ICE.
   Typically, this is because they would like to choose a different m/c-
   line address for a non-ICE peer than they would for an ICE capable
   peer.

   To do this, the "ice" SIP option tag can be included in the Require
   header field of an INVITE request.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Media%20Feature%20Tag%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Media Feature Tag Definition</span>

   The "sip.ice" media feature tag indicates support for ICE.  An agent
   supports ICE if it is either a lite or full implementation, and
   consequently, is capable of including candidate attributes in an SDP
   offer or answer for at least one transport protocol.  An agent that
   supports ICE SHOULD include this media feature tag in the Contact
   header field of its REGISTER requests and OPTION responses.





<span class="grey">Rosenberg                    Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5768">RFC 5768</a>                       ICE Support                    April 2010</span>


   An agent MAY include the media feature tag in the Contact header
   field of an INVITE or INVITE response; however, doing so is redundant
   with ICE attributes in the SDP that indicate the same thing.  In
   cases where an INVITE omits an offer, the lack or presence of the
   media feature tag in the Contact header field cannot be used by the
   callee (which will be the offerer) to determine whether the caller
   supports ICE.  In cases of third-party call control [<a href="./rfc3725" title='"Best Current Practices for Third Party Call Control (3pcc) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3725</a>], the
   caller may be a controller that does (or doesn't) support ICE, while
   the answerer may be an agent that does (or doesn't) support ICE.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Option%20Tag%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Option Tag Definition</span>

   This "ice" OPTION tag SHOULD NOT be used in conjunction with the
   Supported header field (this SHOULD NOT include responses to OPTION
   requests).  The media feature tag is used as the one and only
   mechanism for indicating support for ICE.  The option tag is meant to
   be used only with the Require header field.  When placed in the
   Require header field of an INVITE request, it indicates that the User
   Agent Server (UAS) must support ICE in order to process the call.  An
   agent supports ICE if it is either a full or lite implementation, and
   consequently, is capable of including candidate attributes in an SDP
   offer or answer for at least one transport protocol.

   A malicious intermediary might attempt to modify a SIP message by
   inserting a Require header field containing the "ice" option tag.  If
   ICE were not supported on the UAS, this would cause the call to fail
   when it would otherwise succeed.  Of course, this attack is not
   specific to ICE, and can be done using any option tag.  This attack
   is prevented by usage of the SIPS mechanism as defined in <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.

   Similarly, an intermediary might attempt to remove the media feature
   tag from a REGISTER request or OPTIONS request, which might cause a
   call to skip ICE processing when it otherwise might make use of it.
   This attack is also prevented using the SIPS mechanism.

   This section registers a new media feature tag in the SIP tree,
   defined in <a href="./rfc3840#section-12.1">Section 12.1 of RFC 3840</a> [<a href="./rfc3840" title='"Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3840</a>].

   Media feature tag name:  sip.ice

   ASN.1 Identifier:  1.3.6.1.8.4.22

   Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag:  This feature tag
      indicates that the device supports Interactive Connectivity
      Establishment (ICE).

   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:  Boolean.

   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
      applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
      This feature tag is most useful in a communications application,
      for describing the capabilities of a device, such as a phone or
      PDA.

   Examples of typical use:  Routing a call to a phone that can support
      ICE.
