              <span class="h1">IANA Registries for BGP Extended Communities</span>

Abstract

   This document reorganizes the IANA registries for the type values and
   sub-type values of the BGP Extended Communities attribute and the BGP
   IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Communities attribute.  This is done
   in order to remove interdependencies among the registries, thus
   making it easier for IANA to determine which codepoints are available
   for assignment in which registries.  This document also clarifies the
   information that must be provided to IANA when requesting an
   allocation from one or more of these registries.  These changes are
   compatible with the existing allocations and thus do not affect
   protocol implementations.  The changes will, however, impact the
   "IANA Considerations" sections of future protocol specifications.
   This document updates <a href="./rfc4360">RFC 4360</a> and <a href="./rfc5701">RFC 5701</a>.

   <a href="./rfc4360">RFC 4360</a> [<a href="./rfc4360" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>] defines the BGP "Extended Communities" (EC)
   attribute.  This attribute consists of a sequence of eight-octet
   "extended communities".  The high-order octet is defined to be the
   "Type" field.  Each Type has a range of values for "Transitive
   Extended Community Types" and a range of values for "Non-transitive
   Extended Community Types".  Some of these ranges are further
   subdivided into a sub-range of values to be assigned by IANA under
   the "Standards Action" policy, a sub-range of values to be assigned

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7153">RFC 7153</a>               IANA Registries for BGP ECs            March 2014</span>


   by IANA under the "First Come First Served" policy, and a sub-range
   for "experimental use".  (See [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>], [<a href="./rfc7120" title='"Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points"'>RFC7120</a>], and [<a href="./rfc3692" title='"Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful"'>RFC3692</a>] for
   an explanation of these policies.)

   For some Extended Community Types, the second octet of the Extended
   Community is a "Sub-Type" field, and the remaining six octets are the
   "Value" field.  These are referred to as "Extended Types".  For other
   types, there is no "Sub-Type" field, and the "Value" field contains
   seven octets.  These are referred to as "Regular Types".

   <a href="./rfc4360">RFC 4360</a> is not very specific about how the IANA registries for
   Extended Community Types and/or Sub-Types are to be organized, and
   this has led to some confusion.  The purpose of this document is to
   reorganize the registries to make the IANA codepoint allocation task
   more straightforward.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Types%2C%20Sub-Types%2C%20and%20Registries"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Types, Sub-Types, and Registries</span>

   The high-order octet of an Extended Community will be known as the
   "Type" field.

   There will be one IANA registry for "Transitive Extended Community
   Types" (see <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a>) and one for "Non-transitive Extended
   Community Types" (<a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>).  Each registry specifies three
   ranges, and each range is associated with a particular IANA
   allocation policy.

   There will be a set of IANA registries for Extended Community
   Sub-Types (see <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>).  Each such registry will have a range of
   0x00-0xFF.  Values in the range 0x00-0xBF are assignable by IANA
   according to the "First Come First Served" allocation policy of
   [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  Values in the range 0xC0-0xFF are assignable by IANA
   according to the "IETF Review" allocation policy of [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].

   If a particular Type has Sub-Types, that Type's entry in its Type
   registry identifies its Sub-Type registry.  Note that some Types do
   not have Sub-Types.  When the request is made to establish a new Type
   registry, the request must specify whether or not there is to be a
   Sub-Type registry associated with that Type.

   Whether a given Type has Sub-Types is determined when the Type is
   initially defined; this cannot be changed later.

   <a href="./rfc5701">RFC 5701</a> [<a href="./rfc5701" title='"IPv6 Address Specific BGP Extended Community Attribute"'>RFC5701</a>] defines the IPv6-Address-Specific Extended
   Community to be a 20-octet quantity whose high-order two octets may
   be considered to be the "Type" field.  The high-order octet is either



<span class="grey">Rosen &amp; Rekhter              Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7153">RFC 7153</a>               IANA Registries for BGP ECs            March 2014</span>


   0x00, indicating a transitive Extended Community; or 0x40, indicating
   a Non-transitive Extended Community.  The second octet is said to be
   a "Sub-Type", and it is suggested that the Sub-Types are the same as
   the Sub-Types for the IPv4-Address-Specific Extended Community.
   However, the existing IANA codepoint allocations for this octet do
   not always match the corresponding allocations for the
   IPv4-Address-Specific Extended Community Sub-Types.

   This document modifies <a href="./rfc5701">RFC 5701</a> by removing any requirement for the
   values of the second octet of the IPv6-Address-Specific Extended
   Community Type codepoints to match the codepoints in either of the
   IPv4-Address-Specific Sub-Types registries.

   This document requests IANA to create two IPv6-Address-Specific
   Extended Community registries -- one for transitive communities and
   one for non-transitive communities.  See <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20How%20to%20Request%20EC%20Type%20and%2For%20Sub-Type%20Codepoints"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  How to Request EC Type and/or Sub-Type Codepoints</span>

   When a codepoint is needed for a new Extended Community, the
   requester should first determine whether an existing Type can be
   used.  If so, IANA should be asked to allocate a codepoint from the
   corresponding Sub-Type registry, if there is one.

   If a new Extended Community Type is needed, the requester should ask
   IANA to allocate a new type from the "BGP Transitive Extended
   Community Types" registry, the "BGP Non-Transitive Extended Community
   Types" registry, or both.  It is up to the requester to state whether
   an allocation is needed from one or both of these registries.  When
   an allocation from both registries is requested, the requester may
   find it desirable for both allocations to share the same low-order
   six bits.  If so, it is the responsibility of the requester to
   explicitly request this of IANA.

   Of course, any request for a codepoint from a particular registry
   must follow the defined registration procedures for that registry.

   If a new Extended Community Type is needed and the new Type is to
   have Sub-Types, the requester should specify whether an existing
   Sub-Type registry can be used for the new Type or a new Sub-Type
   registry is needed.  (At the current time, every Type that has
   Sub-Types is associated with a unique Sub-Type registry.  It is
   possible that in the future a new Type registry may be created that
   is associated with a pre-existing Sub-Type registry.)  In either
   case, if a new Sub-Type value needs to be allocated from a particular
   Sub-Type registry, the request should explicitly identify the
   registry.

   If the creation of a new Sub-Type registry is requested, the range of
   values is always 0x00-0xFF.  It is recommended that the allocation
   policy described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> be used, i.e., 0x00-0xBF to be
   allocated by IANA under the "First Come First Served" policy and
   0xC0-0xFF to be allocated by IANA under the "IETF Review" policy.

   Commonly, a new Extended Community is defined such that it can be of
   several Types.  For example, one may want to define a new Extended
   Community so that it can be either transitive or non-transitive,
   either the two-octet AS Number Type or the four-octet AS Number Type,
   etc.  The requester is responsible for explicitly asking IANA to
   allocate codepoints in all the necessary Type and/or Sub-Type
   registries.

   When a new Extended Community is defined, it may be necessary to ask
   IANA to allocate codepoints in several Sub-Type registries.  In this
   case, it is a common practice to ask IANA to allocate the same
   codepoint value in each registry.  If this is desired, it is the
   responsibility of the requester to explicitly ask IANA to allocate
   the same value in each registry.

   When a new Extended Community Sub-Type codepoint is allocated, it may
   also be desirable to allocate a corresponding value in one or both of
   the IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community registries.  The
   requester is responsible for requesting this allocation explicitly.
   If the requester would like the same numerical value to be allocated
   in an IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community registry that is
   allocated in some other registry, it is the responsibility of the
   requester to explicitly ask this of IANA.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has replaced the pre-existing BGP Extended Communities
   registries with the registries described in this section.

   The registries reproduced below do not include the "references" or
   "date" fields for the individual codepoints in the registries,
   because it is difficult to incorporate those within the 72-character
   line limitation of RFCs.  The references and associated dates have
   been copied from the existing registries when creating the new
   registries; the authors have worked with IANA to ensure that this
   information has been carried over correctly to the reorganized
   registry.  As this document does not change the usage or semantics of
   any of the codepoints, the references associated with the individual
   codepoints do not change.

   On the other hand, the references for each of the registries defined
   in this section have been changed to refer to this document.
