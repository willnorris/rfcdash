                   <span class="h1">FTP Command and Extension Registry</span>

Abstract

   Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands,
   with the early ones summarized in <a href="./rfc959">RFC 959</a>.  <a href="./rfc2389">RFC 2389</a> established a
   mechanism for specifying and negotiating FTP extensions.  The number
   of extensions, both those supported by the mechanism and some that
   are not, continues to increase.  An IANA registry of FTP Command and
   Feature names is established to reduce the likelihood of conflict of
   names and the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes
   that registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands,
   with the early ones summarized in <a href="./rfc959">RFC 959</a> [<a href="./rfc0959" title='"File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC0959</a>].  <a href="./rfc2389">RFC 2389</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2389" title='"Feature negotiation mechanism for the File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC2389</a>] established a mechanism for specifying and negotiating
   extensions to the FTP protocol specified in <a href="./rfc959">RFC 959</a>, by means of
   "FEAT Strings" identifying extensions supported by the FTP server,
   and sent in response to a "FEAT" command.  The number of extensions
   continues to grow, not all of them supported by FEAT.  An IANA
   registry is established to reduce the likelihood of a conflict of
   names and the consequent ambiguity and to encourage the sharing of
   information.  This specification establishes that registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Registry%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Registry Definition</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Registry%20Name"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Registry Name</span>

   The name of this registry is "FTP Commands and Extensions".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Registry%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Registry Format</span>

   As specified in this RFC, IANA has established a registry for FTP
   commands and extensions.  Registration requests and registry entries
   should include the following:

   Command Name -  The FTP command, either new or modified, used in the
      extension or with which the extension is used.

      Following the long-standing practice to capitalize command names
      in specification documents for FTP, the command names are entered
      in all uppercase.  For extensions amending the operation of a

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5797">RFC 5797</a>           FTP Command and Extension Registry         March 2010</span>


      command, a plus sign ("+") is appended to the command name.
      However, if an extension affects the overall command parameter
      handling and/or transaction processing, instead of being bound to
      one command (or a small number of commands), the string "-N/A-" is
      entered.

      It is intended to have the registry entries ordered by ascending
      ASCII collation order of this column (including the "+" suffix if
      present).

   Extension name -  The name of the extension.

      FTP extensions predating <a href="./rfc2389">RFC 2389</a> [<a href="./rfc2389" title='"Feature negotiation mechanism for the File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC2389</a>], and some extensions
      published after it, did not specify a keyword to identify the
      extension in a FEAT response.  Some later specifications
      established FEAT strings with the respective command names as
      their keywords.  In order to provide for keywords for future
      specifications in such cases, this document establishes
      'placeholder' keywords to reserve reasonable feature names for
      future standardization.  Similarly, placeholder keywords are used
      for the basic FTP commands specified in <a href="./rfc959">RFC 959</a> [<a href="./rfc0959" title='"File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC0959</a>] and
      those of its predecessors that are still in use.  These
      placeholder keywords are placed in the registry for convenience;
      it is not intended that they be returned in FEAT responses.
      To compensate for this idiosyncrasy, the column in the registry is
      entitled "FEAT Code", and to clearly distinguish between the two
      cases, defined FEAT keywords codes are listed in all uppercase,
      whereas placeholder keywords (henceforth called "pseudo FEAT
      codes") are listed in lowercase.  Future specifications are
      allowed to "upgrade" a placeholder to a true keyword unless it is
      specifically declared 'immutable' below, but otherwise IANA
      maintains uniqueness of feature names (FEAT codes) based on case-
      insensitive comparison.

   Description -  A brief description of the extension and, where
      appropriate, the command.

   FEAT String -  (optional in registration requests to IANA)

      The string expected to be included in the response to the FEAT
      command [<a href="./rfc2389" title='"Feature negotiation mechanism for the File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC2389</a>] if the extension is supported.

      In many cases, the FEAT string required to identify an extension
      only consists of the "FEAT Code", making this item redundant.
      Therefore, this item should only be specified if it is intended to
      register a FEAT string that contains mandatory elements other than
      the "FEAT Code" itself.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5797">RFC 5797</a>           FTP Command and Extension Registry         March 2010</span>


      Due to space restrictions, and to allow registrants to provide
      additional information, IANA should present these registration
      items (if given) in numbered footnotes to the table, not in an
      additional table column.

   Command Type -  The type (or 'kind') of the command.

      <a href="./rfc959#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of RFC 959</a> [<a href="./rfc0959" title='"File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC0959</a>] introduced a subdivision of FTP
      commands into three types: Access control, transfer Parameter
      {setting}, and Service {execution}.  For clarity, and as a service
      to the user of the registry, this subdivision is extended to all
      registered FTP commands, using the characteristic initial of the
      type, 'a', 'p', or 's', respectively, filed in the registry column
      titled "type"; combinations are allowed, e.g., 'p/s'.

   Conformance Requirements -  The support expectation for the command.

      <a href="./rfc959">RFC 959</a> specifies mandatory-to-implement commands and optional
      commands.  This classification is carried over to all registered
      commands, using a column titled "conf" carrying a single character
      -- either 'm' or 'o', for "mandatory" and "optional",
      respectively.  Similarly, obsoleted or historic entries are left
      in the registry to avoid conflicts with deployed implementations,
      and these entries are marked with 'h' (for "historic").
      Beyond the initial registrations, Standards Action [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>] is
      needed to register new "mandatory" entries or to move such entries
      to "historic".

   Reference -  A reference to an RFC or other definition of the
      extension and/or to implementations supporting it (see the next
      section).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Criteria%20for%20Registration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Criteria for Registration</span>

   This registry is primarily intended to avoid conflicting uses of the
   same extension names and command keywords for different purposes, not
   to demonstrate that an extension is somehow "approved".  The "Expert
   Review" method will be used, but the designated expert is expected to
   check only that at least one of the two criteria that follow are met.

   1.  The extension is documented in a permanent and readily available
       public specification (this is the same as the "Specification
       Required" registration policy defined in <a href="./rfc5226">RFC 5226</a> [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>]).

   2.  The extension is actually implemented in FTP client and server
       systems that are generally available (not necessarily either free
       or unencumbered, but available).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5797">RFC 5797</a>           FTP Command and Extension Registry         March 2010</span>


   For an extension or command to be marked "mandatory" ('m' in the
   "conf" column), an IETF Standards Track specification is required.
   An IESG Standards Action is allowed to direct IANA to change the
   Conformance Requirements listed for any entry.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20Base%20FTP%20Commands"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Base FTP Commands</span>

   The following commands are part of the base FTP specification
   [<a href="./rfc0959" title='"File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC0959</a>] and are listed in the registry with the immutable pseudo
   FEAT code "base".

      Mandatory commands:

      ABOR, ACCT, ALLO, APPE, CWD, DELE, HELP, LIST, MODE, NLST, NOOP,
      PASS, PASV, PORT, QUIT, REIN, REST, RETR, RNFR, RNTO, SITE, STAT,
      STOR, STRU, TYPE, USER

      Optional commands:

      CDUP, MKD, PWD, RMD, SMNT, STOU, SYST

   Note: STD 3 [<a href="./rfc1123" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support"'>RFC1123</a>] clarified and updated the status and
   implementation requirements of these standard FTP commands, and it
   contains important complementary information for the following
   commands:

      LIST, NLST, PASV, REST, SITE, STOU

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.%20%20Obsolete%20Commands"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5" id="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Obsolete Commands</span>

   The following commands were specified as experimental in an extension
   to an early version of the FTP specification [<a href="./rfc0775" title='"Directory oriented FTP commands"'>RFC0775</a>] but later
   deprecated by <a href="./rfc1123">RFC 1123</a> [<a href="./rfc1123" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support"'>RFC1123</a>], because Standard FTP [<a href="./rfc0959" title='"File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC0959</a>]
   specifies their standard successors.  They are listed in the registry
   with the immutable pseudo FEAT code "hist".

      XCUP, XCWD, XMKD, XPWD, XRMD

   Implementation note:  Deployed FTP clients still make use of the
      deprecated commands and most FTP servers support them as aliases
      for the standard commands.

   The following commands were specified as part of the "FOOBAR" IPng
   effort in <a href="./rfc1545">RFC 1545</a> [<a href="./rfc1545" title='"FTP Operation Over Big Address Records (FOOBAR)"'>RFC1545</a>] and, later, <a href="./rfc1639">RFC 1639</a> [<a href="./rfc1639" title='"FTP Operation Over Big Address Records (FOOBAR)"'>RFC1639</a>] and are
   now obsolete.  They are listed in the registry with the immutable
   pseudo FEAT code "hist".

   As a service to users of the registry and the authors of existing
   specifications, all FTP commands and features published in RFCs after
   STD 3 [<a href="./rfc1123" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support"'>RFC1123</a>] and up to the time of this writing were included in
   the registry upon creation.

   The following pseudo FEAT codes have been assigned, according to
   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>:

      base - FTP standard commands [<a href="./rfc0959" title='"File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC0959</a>]
      hist - Historic experimental commands [<a href="./rfc0775" title='"Directory oriented FTP commands"'>RFC0775</a>], [<a href="./rfc1639" title='"FTP Operation Over Big Address Records (FOOBAR)"'>RFC1639</a>]

   #1 While an IETF Standards Action would be required to make the FEAT
      mechanism [<a href="./rfc2389" title='"Feature negotiation mechanism for the File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC2389</a>] mandatory, implementation of that extension
      mechanism is clearly required in conjunction with any extension or

   Any work to update or extend FTP depends on the base specification in
   <a href="./rfc959">RFC 959</a>.  The contributions of its editors, Jon Postel and Joyce
   Reynolds, are gratefully acknowledged.  The option-negotiation
   mechanism specified in <a href="./rfc2389">RFC 2389</a> (and the accumulation of features
   that followed it) made this registry relevant; the authors of those
   documents are acknowledged as well.

   Barry Leiba and Alexey Melnikov made several suggestions about
   earlier versions of this document, most of which have been
   incorporated.

   Anthony Bryan spotted a few typographical errors.

   Scott Bradner suggested a clarification to the "Expert Review" text.

   The authors appreciate the comments and support for this work
   received from FTP implementers and many IETF participants.  Comments
   from the IESG helped to shape this document and registry to improve
   its utility.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has established the registry described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> using the
   initial content specified in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> and including the body of
   Sections <a href="#section-2.4">2.4</a> and <a href="#section-2.5">2.5</a> as explanatory text in the preface of the
   registry.

   New entries should be added to this registry when extensions to FTP
   are approved or defined in RFCs or when extensions that are already
   in use and well-documented are identified.  In other words, the
   requirement for registration is a slightly relaxed version of
   "Specification Required" [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>] with Expert Review.  See
   <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a> for specifics and exceptions.

   The creation of this registry provides improved documentation and
   protection against interoperability problems.  It introduces no new
   security issues.
