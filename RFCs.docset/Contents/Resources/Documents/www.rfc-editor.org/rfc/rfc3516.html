Abstract

   This memo defines the Binary extension to the Internet Message Access
   Protocol (IMAP4).  It provides a mechanism for IMAP4 clients and
   servers to exchange message body data without using a MIME content-
   transfer-encoding.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-KEYWORD" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORD</a>].

   The abbreviation "CTE" means content-transfer-encoding.

   The MIME extensions to Internet messaging allow for the transmission
   of non-textual (binary) message content [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>].  Since the
   traditional transports for messaging are not always capable of
   passing binary data transparently, MIME provides encoding schemes
   that allow binary content to be transmitted over transports that are
   not otherwise able to do so.

   The overhead of MIME-encoding this content can be considerable in
   some contexts (e.g., slow radio links, streaming multimedia).
   Reducing the overhead associated with CTE schemes such as base64

   can give a noticeable reduction in resource consumption.  The Binary
   extension lets the server perform CTE decoding prior to transmitting
   message data to the client.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Content-Transfer-Encoding%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Content-Transfer-Encoding Considerations</span>

   Every IMAP4 body section has a MIME content-transfer-encoding.
   (Those without an explicit Content-Transfer-Encoding header are
   implicitly labeled as "7bit" content.)  In the terminology of [MIME-
   IMB], the CTE specifies both a decoding algorithm and the domain of
   the decoded data.  In this memo, "decoding" refers to the CTE
   decoding step described in [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>].

   Certain CTEs use an identity encoding transformation.  For these CTEs
   there is no decoding required, however the domain of the underlying
   data may not be expressible in the IMAP4 protocol (e.g., MIME
   "binary" content containing NUL octets).  To accommodate these cases
   the Binary extension introduces a new type of literal protocol
   element that is fully eight bit transparent.

   Thus, server  processing of the FETCH BINARY command involves two
   logical steps:

   1)  perform any CTE-related decoding

   2)  determine the domain of the decoded data

   Step 2 is necessary to determine which protocol element should be
   used to transmit the decoded data.  (See FETCH Response Extensions
   for further details.)

   This memo defines the following extensions to [<a href="#ref-IMAP4rev1" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4rev1"'>IMAP4rev1</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20CAPABILITY%20Identification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  CAPABILITY Identification</span>

   IMAP4 servers that support this extension MUST include "BINARY" in
   the response list to the CAPABILITY command.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20FETCH%20Command%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  FETCH Command Extensions</span>

   This extension defines three new FETCH command data items.

      BINARY&lt;section-binary&gt;[&lt;partial&gt;]

         Requests that the specified section be transmitted after
         performing CTE-related decoding.



<span class="grey">Nerenberg                   Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-3"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3516">RFC 3516</a>             IMAP4 Binary Content Extension           April 2003</span>


         The &lt;partial&gt; argument, if present, requests that a subset of
         the data be returned.  The semantics of a partial FETCH BINARY
         command are the same as for a partial FETCH BODY command, with
         the exception that the &lt;partial&gt; arguments refer to the DECODED
         section data.

      BINARY.PEEK&lt;section-binary&gt;[&lt;partial&gt;]

         An alternate form of FETCH BINARY that does not implicitly set
         the \Seen flag.

      BINARY.SIZE&lt;section-binary&gt;

         Requests the decoded size of the section (i.e., the size to
         expect in response to the corresponding FETCH BINARY request).

         Note: client authors are cautioned that this might be an
         expensive operation for some server implementations.
         Needlessly issuing this request could result in degraded
         performance due to servers having to calculate the value every
         time the request is issued.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20FETCH%20Response%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  FETCH Response Extensions</span>

   This extension defines two new FETCH response data items.

      BINARY&lt;section-binary&gt;[&lt;&lt;number&gt;&gt;]

         An &lt;nstring&gt; or &lt;literal8&gt; expressing the content of the
         specified section after removing any CTE-related encoding.  If
         &lt;number&gt; is present it refers to the offset within the DECODED
         section data.

         If the domain of the decoded data is "8bit" and the data does
         not contain the NUL octet, the server SHOULD return the data in
         a &lt;string&gt; instead of a &lt;literal8&gt;; this allows the client to
         determine if the "8bit" data contains the NUL octet without
         having to explicitly scan the data stream for for NULs.

         If the server does not know how to decode the section's CTE, it
         MUST fail the request and issue a "NO" response that contains
         the "UNKNOWN-CTE" extended response code.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3516">RFC 3516</a>             IMAP4 Binary Content Extension           April 2003</span>


      BINARY.SIZE&lt;section-binary&gt;

         The size of the section after removing any CTE-related
         encoding.  The value returned MUST match the size of the
         &lt;nstring&gt; or &lt;literal8&gt; that will be returned by the
         corresponding FETCH BINARY request.

         If the server does not know how to decode the section's CTE, it
         MUST fail the request and issue a "NO" response that contains
         the "UNKNOWN-CTE" extended response code.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.4.%20%20APPEND%20Command%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" id="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  APPEND Command Extensions</span>

   The APPEND command is extended to allow the client to append data
   containing NULs by using the &lt;literal8&gt; syntax.  The server MAY
   modify the CTE of the appended data, however any such transformation
   MUST NOT result in a loss of data.

   If the destination mailbox does not support the storage of binary
   content, the server MUST fail the request and issue a "NO" response
   that contains the "UNKNOWN-CTE" extended response code.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20MIME%20Encoded%20Headers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  MIME Encoded Headers</span>

   [<a id="ref-MIME-MHE">MIME-MHE</a>] defines an encoding that allows for non-US-ASCII text in
   message headers.  This encoding is not the same as the content-
   transfer-encoding applied to message bodies, and the decoding
   transformations described in this memo do not apply to [<a href="#ref-MIME-MHE" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text"'>MIME-MHE</a>]
   encoded header text.  A server MUST NOT perform any conversion of
   [<a href="#ref-MIME-MHE" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text"'>MIME-MHE</a>] encoded header text in response to any binary FETCH or
   APPEND request.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Implementation%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Implementation Considerations</span>

   Messaging clients and servers have been notoriously lax in their
   adherence to the Internet CRLF convention for terminating lines of
   textual data in Internet protocols.  When sending data using the
   Binary extension, servers MUST ensure that textual line-oriented
   sections are always transmitted using the IMAP4 CRLF line termination
   syntax, regardless of the underlying storage representation of the
   data on the server.

   A server may choose to store message body binary content in a non-
   encoded format.  Regardless of the internal storage representation
   used, the server MUST issue BODYSTRUCTURE responses that describe the
   message as though the binary-encoded sections are encoded in a CTE





<span class="grey">Nerenberg                   Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3516">RFC 3516</a>             IMAP4 Binary Content Extension           April 2003</span>


   acceptable to the IMAP4 base specification.  Furthermore, the results
   of a FETCH BODY MUST return the message body content in the format
   described by the corresponding FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE response.

   While the server is allowed to modify the CTE of APPENDed &lt;literal8&gt;
   data, this should only be done when it is absolutely necessary.
   Gratuitous encoding changes will render useless most cryptographic
   operations that have been performed on the message.

   This extension provides an optimization that is useful in certain
   specific situations.  It does not absolve clients from providing
   basic functionality (content transfer decoding) that should be
   available in all messaging clients.  Clients supporting this
   extension SHOULD be prepared to perform their own CTE decoding
   operations.
