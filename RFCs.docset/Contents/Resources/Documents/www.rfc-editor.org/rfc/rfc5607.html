<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc2865">RFC 2865</a> [<a href="./rfc2865" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>] defines the NAS-Prompt (7) and Administrative (6)
   values of the Service-Type (6) Attribute.  Both of these values
   provide access to the interactive, text-based Command Line Interface
   (CLI) of the NAS, and were originally developed to control access to
   the physical console port of the NAS, most often a serial port.

   Remote access to the CLI of the NAS has been available in NAS
   implementations for many years, using protocols such as Telnet,
   Rlogin, and the remote terminal service of the Secure SHell (SSH).
   In order to distinguish local, physical, console access from remote
   access, the NAS-Port-Type (61) Attribute is generally included in
   Access-Request and Access-Accept messages, along with the Service-
   Type (6) Attribute, to indicate the form of access.  A NAS-Port-Type
   (61) Attribute with a value of Async (0) is used to signify a local
   serial port connection, while a value of Virtual (5) is used to
   signify a remote connection, via a remote terminal protocol.  This
   usage provides no selectivity among the various available remote
   terminal protocols (e.g., Telnet, Rlogin, SSH, etc.).

   Today, it is common for network devices to support more than the two
   privilege levels for management access provided by the Service-Type
   (6) Attribute with values of NAS-Prompt (7) (non-privileged) and
   Administrative (6) (privileged).  Also, other management mechanisms
   may be used, such as Web-based management, the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP), and the Network Configuration Protocol
   (NETCONF).  To provide support for these additional features, this
   specification defines attributes for Framed Management protocols,
   management protocol security, and management access privilege levels.

   Remote management via the command line is carried over protocols such
   as Telnet, Rlogin, and the remote terminal service of SSH.  Since
   these protocols are primarily for the delivery of terminal or
   terminal emulation services, the term "Framed Management" is used to
   describe management protocols supporting techniques other than the
   command line.  Typically, these mechanisms format management
   information in a binary or textual encoding such as HTML, XML, or
   ASN.1/BER.  Examples include Web-based management (HTML over HTTP or
   HTTPS), NETCONF (XML over SSH or BEEP or SOAP), and SNMP (SMI over
   ASN.1/BER).  Command line interface, menu interface, or other text-
   based (e.g., ASCII or UTF-8) terminal emulation services are not
   considered to be Framed Management protocols.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   This document uses terminology from <a href="./rfc2865">RFC 2865</a> [<a href="./rfc2865" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>], <a href="./rfc2866">RFC 2866</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2866" title='"RADIUS Accounting"'>RFC2866</a>], and <a href="./rfc5176">RFC 5176</a> [<a href="./rfc5176" title='"Dynamic Authorization Extensions to Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC5176</a>].

   The term "integrity protection", as used in this document, is *not*
   the same as "authentication", as used in SNMP.  Integrity protection
   requires the sharing of cryptographic keys, but it does not require
   authenticated principals.  Integrity protection could be used, for
   example, with anonymous Diffie-Hellman key agreement.  In SNMP, the
   proof of identity of the principals (authentication) is conflated
   with tamper-resistance of the protected messages (integrity).  In
   this document, we assume that integrity protection and authentication
   are separate concerns.  Authentication is part of the base RADIUS
   protocol.

   SNMP uses the terms "auth" and "noAuth", as well as "priv" and
   "noPriv".  There is no analog to auth or noAuth in this document.  In
   this document, we are assuming that authentication always occurs when
   it is required, i.e., as a prerequisite to provisioning of access via
   an Access-Accept packet.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   To support the authorization and provisioning of Framed Management
   access to managed entities, this document introduces a new value for
   the Service-Type (6) Attribute [<a href="./rfc2865" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>] and one new attribute.  The
   new value for the Service-Type (6) Attribute is Framed-Management
   (18), used for remote device management via a Framed Management
   protocol.  The new attribute is Framed-Management-Protocol (133), the
   value of which specifies a particular protocol for use in the remote
   management session.

   Two new attributes are introduced in this document in support of
   granular management access rights or command privilege levels.  The
   Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute provides a text string
   specifying a policy name of local scope, that is assumed to have been
   pre-provisioned on the NAS.  This use of an attribute to specify use
   of a pre-provisioned policy is similar to the Filter-Id (11)
   Attribute defined in <a href="./rfc2865#section-5.11">[RFC2865] Section 5.11</a>.

   The local application of the Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute
   within the managed entity may take the form of (a) one of an
   enumeration of command privilege levels, (b) a mapping into an SNMP

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5607">RFC 5607</a>          RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization          July 2009</span>


   Access Control Model, such as the View-Based Access Control Model
   (VACM) [<a href="./rfc3415" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC3415</a>], or (c) some other set of management access policy
   rules that is mutually understood by the managed entity and the
   remote management application.  Examples are given in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   The Management-Privilege-Level (136) Attribute contains an integer-
   valued management privilege level indication.  This attribute serves
   to modify or augment the management permissions provided by the NAS-
   Prompt (7) value of the Service-Type (6) Attribute, and thus applies
   to CLI management.

   To enable management security requirements to be specified, the
   Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute is introduced.  The
   value of this attribute indicates the minimum level of secure
   transport protocol protection required for the provisioning of NAS-
   Prompt (7), Administrative (6), or Framed-Management (18) service.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Domain%20of%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Domain of Applicability</span>

   Most of the RADIUS attributes defined in this document have broad
   applicability for provisioning local and remote management access to
   NAS devices.  However, those attributes that provision remote access
   over Framed Management protocols and over secure transports have
   special considerations.  This document does not specify the details
   of the integration of these protocols with a RADIUS client in the NAS
   implementation.  However, there are functional requirements for
   correct application of Framed Management protocols and/or secure
   transport protocols that will limit the selection of such protocols
   that can be considered for use with RADIUS.  Since the RADIUS user
   credentials are typically obtained by the RADIUS client from the
   secure transport protocol server or the Framed Management protocol
   server, the protocol, and its implementation in the NAS, MUST support
   forms of credentials that are compatible with the authentication
   methods supported by RADIUS.

   RADIUS currently supports the following user authentication methods,
   although others may be added in the future:

   o  Password - <a href="./rfc2865">RFC 2865</a>

   o  CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) - <a href="./rfc2865">RFC 2865</a>

   o  ARAP (Apple Remote Access Protocol) - <a href="./rfc2869">RFC 2869</a>

   o  EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) - <a href="./rfc2869">RFC 2869</a>, <a href="./rfc3579">RFC 3579</a>

   o  HTTP Digest - <a href="./rfc5090">RFC 5090</a>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5607">RFC 5607</a>          RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization          July 2009</span>


   The remote management protocols selected for use with the RADIUS
   remote NAS management sessions, for example, those described in
   <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>, and the secure transport protocols selected to meet the
   protection requirements, as described in <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>, obviously need
   to support user authentication methods that are compatible with those
   that exist in RADIUS.  The RADIUS authentication methods most likely
   usable with these protocols are Password, CHAP, and possibly HTTP
   Digest, with Password being the distinct common denominator.  There
   are many secure transports that support other, more robust,
   authentication mechanisms, such as public key.  RADIUS has no support
   for public key authentication, except within the context of an EAP
   Method.  The applicability statement for EAP indicates that it is not
   intended for use as an application-layer authentication mechanism, so
   its use with the mechanisms described in this document is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  In some cases, Password may be the only compatible
   RADIUS authentication method available.

   The Service-Type (6) Attribute is defined in <a href="./rfc2865#section-5.6">Section 5.6 of RFC 2865</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2865" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>].  This document defines a new value of the Service-Type
   Attribute, as follows:

      18   Framed-Management

   The semantics of the Framed-Management service are as follows:

      Framed-Management   A Framed Management protocol session should
                          be started on the NAS.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20New%20RADIUS%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  New RADIUS Attributes</span>

   This document defines four new RADIUS attributes related to
   management authorization.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20Framed-Management-Protocol"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Framed-Management-Protocol</span>

   The Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute indicates the
   application-layer management protocol to be used for Framed
   Management access.  It MAY be used in both Access-Request and Access-
   Accept packets.  This attribute is used in conjunction with a
   Service-Type (6) Attribute with the value of Framed-Management (18).

   It is RECOMMENDED that the NAS include an appropriately valued
   Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute in an Access-Request
   packet, indicating the type of management access being requested.  It

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5607">RFC 5607</a>          RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization          July 2009</span>


   is further RECOMMENDED that the NAS include a Service-Type (6)
   Attribute with the value Framed-Management (18) in the same Access-
   Request packet.  The RADIUS server MAY use these attributes as a hint
   in making its authorization decision.

   The RADIUS server MAY include a Framed-Management-Protocol (133)
   Attribute in an Access-Accept packet that also includes a Service-
   Type (6) Attribute with a value of Framed-Management (18), when the
   RADIUS server chooses to enforce a management access policy for the
   authenticated user that dictates one form of management access in
   preference to others.

   When a NAS receives a Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute in
   an Access-Accept packet, it MUST deliver that specified form of
   management access or disconnect the session.  If the NAS does not
   support the provisioned management application-layer protocol, or the
   management access protocol requested by the user does not match that
   of the Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute in the Access-
   Accept packet, the NAS MUST treat the Access-Accept packet as if it
   had been an Access-Reject.

   A summary of the Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute format is
   shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   The Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute specifies the
   minimum level of protection that is required for a protected
   transport used with the Framed or non-Framed Management access
   session.  The protected transport used by the NAS MAY provide a
   greater level of protection, but MUST NOT provide a lower level of
   protection.

   When a secure form of non-Framed Management access is specified, it
   means that the remote terminal session is encapsulated in some form
   of protected transport, or tunnel.  It may also mean that an explicit
   secure mode of operation is required, when the Framed Management
   protocol contains an intrinsic secure mode of operation.  The
   Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute does not apply to CLI
   access via a local serial port, or other non-remote connection.

   When a secure form of Framed Management access is specified, it means
   that the application-layer management protocol is encapsulated in
   some form of protected transport, or tunnel.  It may also mean that
   an explicit secure mode of operation is required, when the Framed
   Management protocol contains an intrinsic secure mode of operation.

   A value of "No Protection (1)" indicates that a secure transport
   protocol is not required, and that the NAS SHOULD accept a connection
   over any transport associated with the application-layer management
   protocol.  The definitions of management application to transport
   bindings are defined in the relevant documents that specify those
   management application protocols.  The same "No Protection" semantics
   are conveyed by omitting this attribute from an Access-Accept packet.

   Specific protected transport protocols, cipher suites, key agreement
   methods, or authentication methods are not specified by this
   attribute.  Such provisioning is beyond the scope of this document.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5607">RFC 5607</a>          RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization          July 2009</span>


   It is RECOMMENDED that the NAS include an appropriately valued
   Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute in an Access-Request
   packet, indicating the level of transport protection for the
   management access being requested, when that information is available
   to the RADIUS client.  The RADIUS server MAY use this attribute as a
   hint in making its authorization decision.

   The RADIUS server MAY include a Management-Transport-Protection (134)
   Attribute in an Access-Accept packet that also includes a Service-
   Type (6) Attribute with a value of Framed-Management (18), when the
   RADIUS server chooses to enforce a management access security policy
   for the authenticated user that dictates a minimum level of transport
   security.

   When a NAS receives a Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute
   in an Access-Accept packet, it MUST deliver the management access
   over a transport with equal or better protection characteristics or
   disconnect the session.  If the NAS does not support protected
   management transport protocols, or the level of protection available
   does not match that of the Management-Transport-Protection (134)
   Attribute in the Access-Accept packet, the NAS MUST treat the
   response packet as if it had been an Access-Reject.

   format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to

      Value

         The Value field is a four-octet enumerated value.

         1      No-Protection
         2      Integrity-Protection
         3      Integrity-Confidentiality-Protection

   All other values are reserved for IANA allocation subject to the
   provisions of <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>.

   The names used in the above table are elaborated as follows:

   o  No-Protection: No transport protection is required.  Accept
      connections via any supported transport.

   o  Integrity-Protection: The management transport MUST provide
      Integrity Protection, i.e., protection from unauthorized
      modification, using a cryptographic checksum.

   o  Integrity-Confidentiality-Protection: The management transport
      MUST provide both Integrity Protection and Confidentiality
      Protection, i.e., protection from unauthorized modification, using
      a cryptographic checksum, and protection from unauthorized
      disclosure, using encryption.

   The configuration or negotiation of acceptable algorithms, modes, and
   credentials for the cryptographic protection mechanisms used in
   implementing protected management transports is outside the scope of
   this document.  Many such mechanisms have standardized methods of
   configuration and key management.

   The Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute indicates the name of the
   management access policy for this user.  Zero or one Management-
   Policy-Id (135) Attributes MAY be sent in an Access-Accept packet.
   Identifying a policy by name allows the policy to be used on
   different NASes without regard to implementation details.

   Multiple forms of management access rules may be expressed by the
   underlying named policy, the definition of which is beyond the scope
   of this document.  The management access policy MAY be applied
   contextually, based on the nature of the management access method.
   For example, some named policies may only be valid for application to
   NAS-Prompt (7) services and some other policies may only be valid for
   SNMP.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5607">RFC 5607</a>          RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization          July 2009</span>


   The management access policy named in this attribute, received in an
   Access-Accept packet, MUST be applied to the session authorized by
   the Access-Accept.  If the NAS supports this attribute, but the
   policy name is unknown, or if the RADIUS client is able to determine
   that the policy rules are incorrectly formatted, the NAS MUST treat
   the Access-Accept packet as if it had been an Access-Reject.

   No precedence relationship is defined for multiple occurrences of the
   Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute.  NAS behavior in such cases is
   undefined.  Therefore, two or more occurrences of this attribute
   SHOULD NOT be included in an Access-Accept or CoA-Request (Change-of-
   Authorization).  In the absence of further specification defining
   some sort of precedence relationship, it is not possible to guarantee
   multi-vendor interoperability when using multiple instances of this
   attribute in a single Access-Accept or CoA-Request packet.

   The content of the Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute is expected
   to be the name of a management access policy of local significance to
   the NAS, within a namespace of significance to the NAS.  In this
   regard, the behavior is similar to that for the Filter-Id (11)
   Attribute.  The policy names and rules are committed to the local
   configuration data-store of the NAS, and are provisioned by means
   beyond the scope of this document, such as via SNMP, NETCONF, or CLI.

   The namespace used in the Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute is
   simple and monolithic.  There is no explicit or implicit structure or
   hierarchy.  For example, in the text string "example.com", the "."
   (period or dot) is just another character.  It is expected that text
   string matching will be performed without parsing the text string
   into any sub-fields.

   Overloading or subdividing this simple name with multi-part
   specifiers (e.g., Access=remote, Level=7) is likely to lead to poor
   multi-vendor interoperability and SHOULD NOT be utilized.  If a
   simple, unstructured policy name is not sufficient, it is RECOMMENDED
   that a Vendor Specific (26) Attribute be used instead, rather than
   overloading the semantics of Management-Policy-Id.

         The Text field is one or more octets, and its contents are
         implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human
         readable and the contents MUST NOT be parsed by the receiver;

         policies.  It is RECOMMENDED that the message contain UTF-8
         encoded 10646 [<a href="./rfc3629" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>RFC3629</a>] characters.

   The Management-Privilege-Level (136) Attribute indicates the integer-
   valued privilege level to be assigned for management access for the
   authenticated user.  Many NASes provide the notion of differentiated
   management privilege levels denoted by an integer value.  The
   specific access rights conferred by each value are implementation
   dependent.  It MAY be used in both Access-Request and Access-Accept
   packets.

   The mapping of integer values for this attribute to specific
   collections of management access rights or permissions on the NAS is
   vendor and implementation specific.  Such mapping is often a user-
   configurable feature.  It's RECOMMENDED that greater numeric values
   imply greater privilege.  However, it would be a mistake to assume
   that this recommendation always holds.

   The management access level indicated in this attribute, received in
   an Access-Accept packet, MUST be applied to the session authorized by
   the Access-Accept.  If the NAS supports this attribute, but the
   privilege level is unknown, the NAS MUST treat the Access-Accept
   packet as if it had been an Access-Reject.

          6

       Value

          The Value field is a four-octet Integer, denoting a management
          privilege level.


   It is RECOMMENDED to limit use of the Management-Privilege-Level
   (136) Attribute to sessions where the Service-Type (6) Attribute has
   a value of NAS-Prompt (7) (not Administrative).  Typically, NASes
   treat NAS-Prompt as the minimal privilege CLI service and
   Administrative as full privilege.  Using the Management-Privilege-
   Level (136) Attribute with a Service-Type (6) Attribute having a
   value of NAS-Prompt (7) will have the effect of increasing the
   minimum privilege level.  Conversely, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use
   this attribute with a Service-Type (6) Attribute with a value of
   Administrative (6), which may require decreasing the maximum
   privilege level.

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use the Management-Privilege-Level (136)
   Attribute in combination with a Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute
   or for management access methods other than interactive CLI.  The
   behavior resulting from such an overlay of management access control
   provisioning is not defined by this document, and in the absence of
   further specification, is likely to lead to unexpected behaviors,
   especially in multi-vendor environments.

   It is entirely OPTIONAL for the NAS management authorization
   attributes specified in this document to be used in conjunction with
   Dynamic Authorization extensions to RADIUS [<a href="./rfc5176" title='"Dynamic Authorization Extensions to Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC5176</a>].  When such
   usage occurs, those attributes MAY be used as listed in the Table of
   Attributes in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   Some guidance on how to identify existing management sessions on a
   NAS for the purposes of Dynamic Authorization is useful.  The primary
   session identifiers SHOULD be User-Name (1) and Service-Type (6).  To
   accommodate instances when that information alone does not uniquely
   identify a session, a NAS supporting Dynamic Authorization SHOULD
   maintain one or more internal session identifiers that can be
   represented as RADIUS attributes.  Examples of such attributes
   include Acct-Session-Id (44), Acct-Multi-Session-Id (50), NAS-Port
   (5), or NAS-Port-Id (87).  In the case of a remote management
   session, common identifier values might include things such as the
   remote IP address and remote TCP port number, or the file descriptor
   value for use with the open socket.  Any such identifier is obviously
   transient in nature, and implementations SHOULD take care to avoid
   and/or properly handle duplicate or stale values.

   In order for the session identification attributes to be available to
   the Dynamic Authorization Client, a NAS supporting Dynamic
   Authorization for management sessions SHOULD include those session
   identification attributes in the Access-Request message for each such
   session.  Additional discussion of session identification attribute
   usage may be found in <a href="./rfc5176#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC5176]</a>.

   The attributes in this specification have no special translation
   requirements for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS to Diameter gateways;
   they are copied as is, except for changes relating to headers,
   alignment, and padding.  See also <a href="./rfc3588#section-4.1">[RFC3588], Section 4.1</a>, and
   <a href="./rfc4005#section-9">[RFC4005], Section 9</a>.

   What this specification says about the applicability of the
   attributes for RADIUS Access-Request packets applies in Diameter to
   AA-Request [<a href="./rfc4005" title='"Diameter Network Access Server Application"'>RFC4005</a>].

   What is said about Access-Accept applies in Diameter to AA-Answer
   messages that indicate success.

   (Note 1) When included within a CoA-Request, these attributes
     represent an authorization change request.  When one of these
     attributes is omitted from a CoA-Request, the NAS assumes that the
     attribute value is to remain unchanged.  Attributes included in a
     CoA-Request replace all existing values of the same attribute(s).

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

       0    This attribute MUST NOT be present in a packet.
       0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in
            a packet.
       0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in
            a packet.
       1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in
            a packet.

   application are described in [<a href="./rfc4005" title='"Diameter Network Access Server Application"'>RFC4005</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4072" title='"Diameter Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Application"'>RFC4072</a>].

   This document specifies new attributes that can be included in
   existing RADIUS packets, which may be protected as described in
   [<a href="./rfc3579" title='"RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) Support For Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)"'>RFC3579</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5176" title='"Dynamic Authorization Extensions to Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC5176</a>].  In Diameter, the attributes are protected
   as specified in [<a href="./rfc3588" title='"Diameter Base Protocol"'>RFC3588</a>].  See those documents for a more detailed
   description.

   The security mechanisms supported in RADIUS and Diameter are focused
   on preventing an attacker from spoofing packets or modifying packets
   in transit.  They do not prevent an authorized RADIUS/Diameter server
   or proxy from inserting attributes with malicious intent.

   A legacy NAS may not recognize the attributes in this document that
   supplement the provisioning of CLI management access.  If the value
   of the Service-Type Attribute is NAS-Prompt or Administrative, the
   legacy NAS may silently discard such attributes, while permitting the
   user to access the CLI management interface(s) of the NAS.  This can
   lead to users improperly receiving authorized management access to
   the NAS, or access with greater levels of access rights than were
   intended.  RADIUS servers SHOULD attempt to ascertain whether or not
   the NAS supports these attributes before sending them in an Access-
   Accept message that provisions CLI access.

   It is possible that certain NAS implementations may not be able to
   determine the protection properties of the underlying transport
   protocol as specified by the Management-Transport-Protection
   Attribute.  This may be a limitation of the standard application
   programming interface of the underlying transport implementation or
   of the integration of the transport into the NAS implementation.  In
   either event, NASes conforming to this specification, which cannot
   determine the protection state of the remote management connection,
   MUST treat an Access-Accept message containing a Management-
   Transport-Protection Attribute containing a value other than No-
   Protection (1) as if it were an Access-Reject message, unless
   specifically overridden by local policy configuration.

   Use of the No-Protection (1) option for the Management-Transport-
   Protection (134) Attribute is NOT RECOMMENDED in any deployment where
   secure management or configuration is required.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/12.2.%20%20RADIUS%20Proxy%20Operation%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.2" id="section-12.2">12.2</a>.  RADIUS Proxy Operation Considerations</span>

   The device management access authorization attributes presented in
   this document present certain considerations when used in RADIUS
   proxy environments.  These considerations are not different from
   those that exist in <a href="./rfc2865">RFC 2865</a> [<a href="./rfc2865" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>] with respect to the Service-
   Type Attribute values of Administrative and NAS-Prompt.

   Most RADIUS proxy environments are also multi-party environments.  In
   multi-party proxy environments it is important to distinguish which
   entities have the authority to provision management access to the
   edge devices, i.e., NASes, and which entities only have authority to
   provision network access services of various sorts.

   It may be important that operators of the NAS are able to ensure that
   access to the CLI, or other management interfaces of the NAS, is only
   provisioned to their own employees or contractors.  One way for the
   NAS to enforce this requirement is to use only local, non-proxy
   RADIUS servers for management access requests.  Proxy RADIUS servers
   could be used for non-management access requests, based on local
   policy.  This "bifurcation" of RADIUS authentication and
   authorization is a simple case of separate administrative realms.
   The NAS may be designed so as to maintain separate lists of RADIUS
   servers for management AAA use and for non-management AAA use.

   An alternate method of enforcing this requirement would be for the
   first-hop RADIUS proxy server, operated by the owner of the NAS, to
   filter out any RADIUS attributes that provision management access
   rights that originate from "up-stream" proxy servers not operated by
   the NAS owner.  Access-Accept messages that provision such locally
   unauthorized management access MAY be treated as if they were an
   Access-Reject by the first-hop proxy server.

   An additional exposure present in proxy deployments is that sensitive
   user credentials, e.g., passwords, are likely to be available in
   cleartext form at each of the proxy servers.  Encrypted or hashed
   credentials are not subject to this risk, but password authentication
   is a very commonly used mechanism for management access
   authentication, and in RADIUS passwords are only protected on a hop-
   by-hop basis.  Malicious proxy servers could misuse this sensitive
   information.

   These issues are not of concern when all the RADIUS servers, local
   and proxy, used by the NAS are under the sole administrative control
   of the NAS owner.
