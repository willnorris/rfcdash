  <span class="h1">Implementation Advice for IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard)</span>

Abstract

   The IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) mechanism is commonly
   employed to mitigate attack vectors based on forged ICMPv6 Router
   Advertisement messages.  Many existing IPv6 deployments rely on
   RA-Guard as the first line of defense against the aforementioned
   attack vectors.  However, some implementations of RA-Guard have been
   found to be prone to circumvention by employing IPv6 Extension
   Headers.  This document describes the evasion techniques that affect
   the aforementioned implementations and formally updates <a href="./rfc6105">RFC 6105</a>,
   such that the aforementioned RA-Guard evasion vectors are eliminated.

   IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) is a mitigation technique
   for attack vectors based on ICMPv6 Router Advertisement [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>]
   messages.  [<a href="./rfc6104" title='"Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement Problem Statement"'>RFC6104</a>] describes the problem statement of "Rogue IPv6
   Router Advertisements", and [<a href="./rfc6105" title='"IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard"'>RFC6105</a>] specifies the "IPv6 Router
   Advertisement Guard" functionality.

   The concept behind RA-Guard is that a Layer-2 (L2) device filters
   ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages, according to a number of
   different criteria.  The most basic filtering criterion is that
   Router Advertisement messages are discarded by the L2 device unless
   they are received on a specified port of the L2 device.  Clearly, the
   effectiveness of RA-Guard relies on the ability of the L2 device to
   identify ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages.

   Some popular RA-Guard implementations have been found to be easy to
   circumvent by employing IPv6 Extension Headers [<a href="#ref-CPNI-IPv6" title='"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)"'>CPNI-IPv6</a>].  This

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7113">RFC 7113</a>             RA-Guard Implementation Advice        February 2014</span>


   document describes such evasion techniques and provides advice to
   RA-Guard implementers such that the aforementioned evasion vectors
   can be eliminated.

   It should be noted that the previously mentioned techniques could
   also be exploited to evade network monitoring tools such as NDPMon
   [<a href="#ref-NDPMon" title='"NDPMon - IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol Monitor"'>NDPMon</a>], ramond [<a href="#ref-ramond" title='"ramond"'>ramond</a>], and rafixd [<a href="#ref-rafixd" title='"rafixd"'>rafixd</a>], and could probably be
   exploited to perform stealth DHCPv6 [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>] attacks.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Evasion%20Techniques%20for%20Some%20RA-Guard%20Implementations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Evasion Techniques for Some RA-Guard Implementations</span>

   The following subsections describe two different vectors that have
   been found to be effective for the evasion of popular implementations
   of RA-Guard.  <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> describes an attack vector based on the use
   of IPv6 Extension Headers with ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages,
   which may be used to circumvent the RA-Guard protection of those
   implementations that fail to process an entire IPv6 header chain when
   trying to identify the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages.
   <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a> describes an attack method based on the use of IPv6
   fragmentation, possibly in conjunction with the use of IPv6 Extension
   Headers.  This later vector has been found to be effective against
   all existing implementations of RA-Guard.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Attack%20Vector%20Based%20on%20IPv6%20Extension%20Headers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Attack Vector Based on IPv6 Extension Headers</span>

   While there is currently no legitimate use for IPv6 Extension Headers
   in ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages, Neighbor Discovery [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>]
   implementations allow the use of Extension Headers with these
   messages, by simply ignoring the received options.  Some RA-Guard
   implementations try to identify ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages
   by simply looking at the "Next Header" field of the fixed IPv6
   header, rather than following the entire header chain.  As a result,
   such implementations fail to identify any ICMPv6 Router Advertisement
   messages that include any Extension Headers (for example, a Hop-by-
   Hop Options header, a Destination Options header, etc.), and can be
   easily circumvented.

   The following figure illustrates the structure of ICMPv6 Router
   Advertisement messages that implement this evasion technique:

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Attack%20Vector%20Based%20on%20IPv6%20Fragmentation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Attack Vector Based on IPv6 Fragmentation</span>

   This section presents a different attack vector, which has been found
   to be effective against all implementations of RA-Guard.  The basic
   idea behind this attack vector is that if the forged ICMPv6 Router
   Advertisement is fragmented into at least two fragments, the L2
   device implementing RA-Guard would be unable to identify the attack
   packet and would thus fail to block it.

   A first variant of this attack vector would be an original ICMPv6
   Router Advertisement message preceded with a Destination Options
   header, which results in two fragments.  The following figure
   illustrates the "original" attack packet, prior to fragmentation, and
   the two resulting fragments that are actually sent as part of the
   attack.

       Original Packet:

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |NH=60|       |NH=58|                           |           |

       +             +                                 +           +
       |             |                                 |           |

       First Fragment:

       +             +             +                       +
       |             |             |                       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Second Fragment:

       | IPv6 Header |   Frag Hdr  | Dst Opt Hdr | ICMPv6 RA |
       +             +             +             +           +
       |             |             |             |           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   It should be noted that the "Hdr Ext Len" field of the Destination
   Options header is present in the First Fragment (rather than the
   second).  Therefore, it is impossible for a device processing only
   the second fragment to locate the ICMPv6 header contained in that
   fragment, since it is unknown how many bytes should be "skipped" to
   get to the next header following the Destination Options header.

   Thus, by leveraging the use of the Fragment Header together with the
   use of the Destination Options header, the attacker is able to
   conceal the type and contents of the ICMPv6 message he is sending (an
   ICMPv6 Router Advertisement in this example).  Unless the L2 device
   were to implement IPv6 fragment reassembly, it would be impossible
   for the device to identify the ICMPv6 type of the message.

      An L2 device could, however, at least detect that an ICMPv6
      message (of some type) is being sent, since the "Next Header"
      field of the Destination Options header contained in the First
      Fragment is set to "58" (ICMPv6).

   This idea can be taken further, such that it is also impossible for
   the L2 device to detect that the attacker is sending an ICMPv6
   message in the first place.  This can be achieved with an original
   ICMPv6 Router Advertisement message preceded with two Destination
   Options headers that results in two fragments.  The following figure
   illustrates the "original" attack packet, prior to fragmentation, and
   the two resulting packets that are actually sent as part of the
   attack.

    Original Packet:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-//+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    First Fragment:

    Second Fragment:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |NH=44|       |NH=60|       |           |NH=58|       |           |
    +-+-+-+       +-+-+-+       +           +-+-+-+       +           +
    | IPv6 header |   Frag Hdr  | Dst O Hdr | Dst Opt Hdr | ICMPv6 RA |
    +             +             +           +             +           +
    |             |             |           |             |           |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In this variant, the "Next Header" field of the Destination Options
   header contained in the First Fragment is set to "60" (Destination
   Options header); thus, it is impossible for a device processing only
   the First Fragment to detect that an ICMPv6 message is being sent in
   the first place.

   The second fragment presents the same challenges as the second
   fragment of the previous variant.  That is, it would be impossible
   for a device processing only the second fragment to locate the second
   Destination Options header (and hence the ICMPv6 header), since the
   "Hdr Ext Len" field of the first Destination Options header is
   present in the First Fragment (rather than the second).

   The following filtering rules must be implemented as part of an
   RA-Guard implementation on ports that face interfaces that are not
   allowed to send ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages, such that the
   vulnerabilities discussed in this document are eliminated:

   1.  If the IPv6 Source Address of the packet is not a link-local
       address (fe80::/10), RA-Guard must pass the packet.

          RATIONALE: This prevents RA-Guard from dedicating processing
          cycles to filtering packets that originate off-net and that,
          if they are RA's, would not be accepted by the host.  <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.1.2">Section</a>
          <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.1.2">6.1.2 of [RFC4861]</a> requires nodes to discard Router
          Advertisement messages if their IPv6 Source Address is not a
          link-local address.

   2.  If the Hop Limit is not 255, RA-Guard must pass the packet.

          RATIONALE: This prevents RA-Guard from dedicating processing
          cycles to filtering packets that originate off-net and that,
          if they are RA's, would not be accepted by the destination
          host.  <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.1.2">Section 6.1.2 of [RFC4861]</a> requires nodes to discard
          Router Advertisement messages if their Hop Limit is not 255.




<span class="grey">Gont                          Informational                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7113">RFC 7113</a>             RA-Guard Implementation Advice        February 2014</span>


   3.  RA-Guard must parse the entire IPv6 header chain present in the
       packet, to identify whether the packet is a Router Advertisement
       message.

          NOTE: RA-Guard implementations must not enforce a limit on the
          number of bytes they can inspect (starting from the beginning
          of the IPv6 packet), since this could introduce false
          positives: legitimate packets could be dropped simply because
          the RA-Guard device does not parse the entire IPv6 header
          chain present in the packet.  An implementation that has such
          an implementation-specific limit must not claim compliance
          with this specification, and must pass the packet when such
          implementation-specific limit is reached.

   4.  When parsing the IPv6 header chain, if the packet is a First
       Fragment (i.e., a packet containing a Fragment Header with the
       Fragment Offset set to 0) and it fails to contain the entire IPv6
       header chain (i.e., all the headers starting from the IPv6 header
       up to, and including, the upper-layer header), RA-Guard must drop
       the packet and should log the packet drop event in an
       implementation-specific manner as a security fault.

          RATIONALE: [<a href="./rfc7112" title='"Implications of Oversized IPv6 Header Chains"'>RFC7112</a>] specifies that the First Fragment (i.e.,
          the fragment with the Fragment Offset set to 0) must contain
          the entire IPv6 header chain, and allows intermediate systems
          such as routers to drop those packets that fail to comply with
          this requirement.

          NOTE: This rule should only be applied to IPv6 fragments with
          a Fragment Offset of 0 (non-First Fragments can be safely
          passed, since they will never reassemble into a complete
          datagram if they are part of a Router Advertisement received
          on a port where such packets are not allowed).

   5.  When parsing the IPv6 header chain, if the packet is identified
       to be an ICMPv6 Router Advertisement message or the packet
       contains an unrecognized Next Header value [<a href="#ref-IANA-IP-PROTO" title='"Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers"'>IANA-IP-PROTO</a>],
       RA-Guard must drop the packet, and should log the packet drop
       event in an implementation-specific manner as a security fault.
       RA-Guard must provide a configuration knob that controls whether

          whether packets with unrecognized headers are forwarded, and
          allows the default behavior to be that such packets be
          dropped.

   6.  In all other cases, RA-Guard must pass the packet as usual.

      NOTE: For the purpose of enforcing the RA-Guard filtering policy,
      an Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>] should be
      considered to be an "upper-layer protocol" (that is, it should be
      considered the last header in the IPv6 header chain).  This means
      that packets employing ESP would be passed by the RA-Guard device
      to the intended destination.  If the destination host does not
      have a security association with the sender of the aforementioned
      IPv6 packet, the packet would be dropped.  Otherwise, if the
      packet is considered valid by the IPsec implementation at the
      receiving host and encapsulates a Router Advertisement message, it
      is up to the receiving host what to do with such a packet.

   If a packet is dropped due to this filtering policy, then the packet
   drop event should be logged in an implementation-specific manner as a
   security fault.  The logging mechanism should include a drop counter
   dedicated to RA-Guard packet drops.

   In order to protect current end-node IPv6 implementations, Rule #4
   has been defined as a default rule to drop packets that cannot be
   positively identified as not being Router Advertisement (RA) messages
   (because the packet is a fragment that fails to include the entire
   IPv6 header chain).  This means that, at least in theory, RA-Guard
   could result in false-positive blocking of some legitimate non-RA
   packets that could not be positively identified as being non-RA.  In
   order to reduce the likelihood of false positives, Rule #1 and Rule
   #2 require that packets that would not pass the required validation
   checks for RA messages (<a href="./rfc4861#section-6.1.2">Section 6.1.2 of [RFC4861]</a>) be passed without
   further inspection.  In any case, as noted in [<a href="./rfc7112" title='"Implications of Oversized IPv6 Header Chains"'>RFC7112</a>], IPv6 packets
   that fail to include the entire IPv6 header chain are virtually
   impossible to police with state-less filters and firewalls and,
   hence, are unlikely to survive in real networks.  [<a href="./rfc7112" title='"Implications of Oversized IPv6 Header Chains"'>RFC7112</a>] requires
   that hosts employing fragmentation include the entire IPv6 header
   chain in the First Fragment (the fragment with the Fragment Offset
   set to 0), thus eliminating the aforementioned false positives.

   This filtering policy assumes that host implementations require that
   the IPv6 Source Address of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages be a
   link-local address and that they discard the packet if this check
   fails, as required by the current IETF specifications [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].
   Additionally, it assumes that hosts require the Hop Limit of Neighbor
   Discovery messages to be 255, and that they discard those packets
   otherwise.

   The aforementioned filtering rules implicitly handle the case of
   fragmented packets: if the RA-Guard device fails to identify the
   upper-layer protocol as a result of the use of fragmentation, the
   corresponding packets would be dropped.

   Finally, we note that IPv6 implementations that allow overlapping
   fragments (i.e., that do not comply with [<a href="./rfc5722" title='"Handling of Overlapping IPv6 Fragments"'>RFC5722</a>]) might still be
   subject of RA-based attacks.  However, a recent assessment of IPv6
   implementations [<a href="#ref-SI6-FRAG" title='"IPv6 NIDS evasion and improvements in IPv6 fragmentation/reassembly"'>SI6-FRAG</a>] with respect to their fragment reassembly
   policy seems to indicate that most current implementations comply
   with [<a href="./rfc5722" title='"Handling of Overlapping IPv6 Fragments"'>RFC5722</a>].

   A similar concept to that of RA-Guard has been implemented for
   protecting against forged DHCPv6 messages.  Such protection can be
   circumvented with the same techniques discussed in this document, and
   the countermeasures for such evasion attack are analogous to those
   described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of this document.

      [<a id="ref-DHCPv6-Shield">DHCPv6-Shield</a>] specifies a mechanism to protect against rogue
      DHCPv6 servers, while taking into consideration the evasion
      techniques discussed in this document.

   This document describes a number of techniques that have been found
   to be effective to circumvent popular RA-Guard implementations and
   provides advice to RA-Guard implementers such that those evasion
   vulnerabilities are eliminated.

      As noted in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, IPv6 implementations that allow overlapping
      fragments (i.e., that do not comply with [<a href="./rfc5722" title='"Handling of Overlapping IPv6 Fragments"'>RFC5722</a>]) might still be
      subject of RA-based attacks.  However, most current
      implementations seem to comply with [<a href="./rfc5722" title='"Handling of Overlapping IPv6 Fragments"'>RFC5722</a>].

   We note that if an attacker sends a fragmented ICMPv6 Router
   Advertisement message on a port not allowed to send such packets, the
   First Fragment would be dropped, and the rest of the fragments would
   be passed.  This means that the victim node would tie memory buffers
   for the aforementioned fragments, which would never reassemble into a
   complete datagram.  If a large number of such packets were sent by an
   attacker, and the victim node failed to implement proper resource
   management for the IPv6 fragment reassembly buffer, this could lead
   to a Denial of Service (DoS).  However, this does not really
   introduce a new attack vector, since an attacker could always perform
   the same attack by sending forged fragmented datagrams in which at

   least one of the fragments is missing.  [<a href="#ref-CPNI-IPv6" title='"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)"'>CPNI-IPv6</a>] discusses some
   resource management strategies that could be implemented for the IPv6
   fragment reassembly buffer.

   We note that the most effective and efficient mitigation for these
   attacks would rely on the prohibiting the use of IPv6 fragmentation
   with Router Advertisement messages (as specified by [<a href="./rfc6980" title='"Security Implications of IPv6 Fragmentation with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery"'>RFC6980</a>]), such
   that the RA-Guard functionality is easier to implement.  However,
   since such mitigation would require an update to existing
   implementations, it cannot be relied upon in the short or near term.

   Finally, we note that RA-Guard only mitigates attack vectors based on
   ICMPv6 Router advertisement messages.  Protection against similar
   attacks based on other messages (such as DCHPv6) is considered out of
   the scope of this document and is left for other documents (e.g.,
   [<a href="#ref-DHCPv6-Shield" title='"DHCPv6- Shield: Protecting Against Rogue DHCPv6 Servers"'>DHCPv6-Shield</a>]).
