<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Background</span>

   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as defined in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>1</a>] is
   now used as an integral part of the network management framework for
   TCP/IP-based internets.  Together with its companions standards,
   which define the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>2</a>,<a href="#ref-3" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>3</a>], and
   the Management Information Base (MIB) [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based Internets"'>4</a>], the SNMP has received
   widespread deployment in many operational networks running the
   Internet suite of protocols.

   It should not be surprising that many of these sites might acquire
   OSI capabilities and may wish to leverage their investment in SNMP
   technology towards managing those OSI components.  This memo
   addresses these concerns by defining a framework for running the SNMP
   in an environment which supports the OSI connectionless-mode
   transport service.

   However, as noted in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"SNMP Communications Services"'>5</a>], the preferred mapping for SNMP is onto the
   UDP [<a href="#ref-6" title='"User Datagram Protocol"'>6</a>].  This specification is intended for use in environments
   where UDP transport is not available.  No aspect of this
   specification should be construed as a suggestion that, in a

   heterogeneous transport environment, a managed agent should support
   more than one mapping.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Mapping%20onto%20the%20CLTS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Mapping onto the CLTS</span>

   Mapping the SNMP onto the CLTS [<a href="#ref-7" title="International Organization for Standardization. International Standard 8072/AD 1">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8" title="International Organization for Standardization. International Standard 8602">8</a>] is straight-forward.  The
   elements of procedure are identical to that of using the UDP.  Note
   that the CLTS and the service offered by the UDP both transmit
   packets of information which contain full addressing information.
   Thus, mapping the SNMP onto the CLTS, a "transport address" in the
   context of [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>1</a>], is simply a transport-selector and network address.

   It should be noted that the mapping of SNMP onto a connectionless-
   mode transport service is wholly consistent with SNMP's architectural
   principles, as described in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>1</a>,<a href="#ref-5" title='"SNMP Communications Services"'>5</a>].  However, the CLTS itself can be
   realized using either a connectionless-mode or a connection-oriented
   network service.  The mapping described in this mapping allows for
   either realization.  (When both network services are available, the
   CLNS should be used as the basis of realization.)

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Well-known%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Well-known Addresses</span>

   Unlike the Internet suite of protocols, OSI does not use well-known
   ports.  Rather,
    demultiplexing occurs on the basis of "selectors", opaque strings of
   octets which have local significance.  In order to foster
   interoperable implementations of the SNMP over the CLTS, it is
   necessary define four selectors for this purpose.

   When the CLTS is used to provide the transport backing for the SNMP,
   and the CLTS uses a connectionless-mode network service, then
   transport selector used shall be "snmp-l" which consists of six ASCII
   characters; and, SNMP traps are, by convention, sent to an SNMP
   manager listening on the transport selector "snmpt-l" which consists
   of seven ASCII characters.

   When the CLTS is used to provide the transport backing for the SNMP,
   and the CLTS uses a connection-oriented network service, then
   transport selector used shall be "snmp-o" which consists of six ASCII
   characters; and, SNMP traps are, by convention, sent to an SNMP
   manager listening on the transport selector "snmpt-o" which consists
   of seven ASCII characters.

   When SNMP traps are sent over the CLTS, the agent-addr field in the
   Trap-PDU contains the IP-address "0.0.0.0" An SNMP manager may
   ascertain the source of the trap based on information provided by the

   An entity implementing SNMP over OSI must be prepared to accept
   messages whose size is at least 484 octets.  Implementation of larger
   values is encouraged whenever possible.
