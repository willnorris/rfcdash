Abstract

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework
   supporting multiple types of authentication methods.

   The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) specifies extensions to EAP
   and the EAP keying hierarchy to support an EAP method-independent
   protocol for efficient re-authentication between the peer and an EAP
   re-authentication server through any authenticator.

   Authenticated Anticipatory Keying (AAK) is a method by which
   cryptographic keying material may be established upon one or more
   Candidate Attachment Points (CAPs) prior to handover.  AAK uses the
   AAA infrastructure for key transport.

   This document specifies the extensions necessary to enable AAK
   support in ERP.

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [<a href="./rfc3748" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)"'>RFC3748</a>] is a generic
   framework supporting multiple types of authentication methods.  In
   systems where EAP is used for authentication, it is desirable not to
   repeat the entire EAP exchange with another authenticator.  The EAP
   Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) [<a href="./rfc5296" title='"EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)"'>RFC5296</a>] specifies extensions to
   EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support an EAP method-independent
   protocol for efficient re-authentication between the EAP
   re-authentication peer and an EAP re-authentication server through
   any authenticator.  The re-authentication server may be in the home
   network or in the local network to which the mobile host (i.e., the
   EAP re-authentication peer) is connecting.

   Authenticated Anticipatory Keying (AAK) [<a href="./rfc5836" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Early Authentication Problem Statement"'>RFC5836</a>] is a method by
   which cryptographic keying material may be established upon one or
   more Candidate Attachment Points (CAPs) prior to handover.  AAK
   utilizes the AAA infrastructure for key transport.

   This document specifies the extensions necessary to enable AAK
   support in ERP.

   ERP/AAK is intended to allow (upon request by the peer) the
   establishment of cryptographic keying materials on a single Candidate
   Attachment Point prior to the arrival of the peer at the Candidate
   Access Network (CAN).

   In this document, ERP/AAK support by the peer is assumed.  Also, it
   is assumed that the peer has previously completed full EAP
   authentication and that either the peer or the SAP knows the
   identities of neighboring attachment points.  Note that the behavior
   of a peer that does not support the ERP-AAK scheme defined in this
   specification is out of the scope of this document.  Figure 1 shows
   the general protocol exchange by which the keying material is
   established on the CAP.

                  Figure 2: Key Distribution for ERP/AAK

   ERP/AAK reuses the packet format defined by ERP, but specifies a new
   flag to differentiate EAP early authentication from EAP
   re-authentication.  The peer initiates ERP/AAK without an external
   trigger, or initiates ERP/AAK in response to an EAP-Initiate/
   Re-Auth-Start message from the SAP.

   In the latter case, the SAP MAY send the identity of one or more
   Candidate Attachment Points to which the SAP is adjacent to the peer
   in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message (see step a in Figure 1).
   The peer SHOULD override the identity of CAP(s) carried in the
   EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message by sending EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
   with the E flag set if it knows to which CAP it will move.  If the
   EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start packet is not supported by the peer, it
   MUST be silently discarded.

   If the peer initiates ERP/AAK, the peer MAY send an early-
   authentication request message (EAP-Initiate/Re-auth with the E flag
   set) containing the keyName-NAI, the CAP-Identifier, rIK, and
   sequence number (see step b in Figure 1).  The realm in the keyName-
   NAI field is used to locate the peer's ERP/AAK server.  The CAP-
   Identifier is used to identify the CAP.  The re-authentication
   Integrity Key (rIK) is defined by Narayanan &amp; Dondeti in [<a href="./rfc5296" title='"EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)"'>RFC5296</a>]
   and is used to protect the integrity of the message.  The sequence
   number is used for replay protection.

   The SAP SHOULD verify the integrity of this message at step b.  If
   this verification fails, the SAP MUST send an EAP-Finish/Re-auth
   message with the Result flag set to '1' (Failure).  If the

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6630">RFC 6630</a>                         ERP/AAK                       June 2012</span>


   verification succeeds, the SAP SHOULD encapsulate the early-
   authentication message into a AAA message and send it to the peer's
   ERP/AAK server in the realm indicated in the keyName-NAI field (see
   step c in Figure 1).

   Upon receiving the message, the ERP/AAK server MUST first use the
   keyName indicated in the keyName-NAI to look up the rIK and check the
   integrity and freshness of the message.  Then, the ERP/AAK server
   MUST verify the identity of the peer by checking the username portion
   of the KeyName-NAI.  If any of the checks fail, the server MUST send
   an early-authentication finish message (EAP-Finish/Re-auth with E
   flag set) with the Result flag set to '1'.  Next, the server MUST
   authorize the CAP specified in the CAP-Identifier TLV.  In the
   success case, the server MUST derive a pMSK from the pRK for the CAP
   carried in the CAP-Identifier field using the sequence number
   associated with CAP-Identifier as an input to the key derivation.
   (see step d in Figure 1).

   Then, the ERP/AAK server MUST transport the pMSK to the authorized
   CAP via AAA (see <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>) as illustrated above (see steps e.1 and
   e.2 in Figure 2).  Note that key distribution in Figure 2 is one part
   of step d in Figure 1.

   Finally, in response to the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message, the ERP/AAK
   server SHOULD send the early-authentication finish message (EAP--
   -Finish/Re-auth with E flag set) containing the identity of the
   authorized CAP to the peer via the SAP along with the lifetime of the
   pMSK.  If the peer also requests the rRK Lifetime, the ERP/AAK server

   ERP/AAK uses a key hierarchy similar to that of ERP.  The ERP/AAK
   pre-established Root Key (pRK) is derived from either the EMSK or the
   DSRK as specified below (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).  In general, the pRK is
   derived from the EMSK if the peer is located in the home AAA realm
   and derived from the DSRK if the peer is in a visited realm.  The
   DSRK is delivered from the EAP server to the ERP/AAK server as
   specified in [<a href="#ref-KEYTRAN" title='"Diameter Attribute- Value Pairs for Cryptographic Key Transport"'>KEYTRAN</a>].  If the peer has previously been
   authenticated by means of ERP or ERP/AAK, the DSRK SHOULD be directly
   reused.

   Similarly, the pre-established Master Session Key (pMSK) is derived
   from the pRK.  The pMSK is established for the CAP when the peer
   early authenticates to the network.  The hierarchy relationship is
   illustrated Figure 4, below.

   The rRK is derived as specified in [<a href="./rfc5295" title='"Specification for the Derivation of Root Keys from an Extended Master Session Key (EMSK)"'>RFC5295</a>].

   pRK = KDF (K, S), where

      K = EMSK or K = DSRK and

      S = pRK Label | "\0" | length

   The pRK Label is an IANA-assigned 8-bit ASCII string:

      EAP Early-Authentication Root Key@ietf.org

   assigned from the "User Specific Root Keys (USRK) Key Labels" name
   space in accordance with Salowey, et al. [<a href="./rfc5295" title='"Specification for the Derivation of Root Keys from an Extended Master Session Key (EMSK)"'>RFC5295</a>].  The KDF and
   algorithm agility for the KDF are also defined in <a href="./rfc5295">RFC 5295</a>.  The KDF
   algorithm is indicated in the cryptosuite field or list of
   cryptosuites TLV payload as specified in Sections <a href="#section-5.2">5.2</a> and <a href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.

   The pMSK uses the same KDF as pRK and is derived as follows:

   pMSK = KDF (K, S), where

      K = pRK and

      S = pMSK label | "\0" | SEQ | length

   names defined in [<a href="./rfc5890" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Definitions and Document Framework"'>RFC5890</a>].

   CAP-Identifier: Carried in a TLV payload.  The Type is 11.  This
   field is used to indicate the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of a
   CAP.  The value field MUST be encoded as specified in <a href="./rfc3315#section-8">SectionÂ 8 of
   [RFC3315]</a>.  Exactly one instance of the CAP-Identifier TLV MUST be
   present in the ERP/AAK-Key TLV.

   Sequence number: The Type is 7.  The value field is a 16-bit field
   and used in the derivation of the pMSK for a CAP.

   Cryptosuite

   This field indicates the integrity algorithm used for ERP/AAK.  Key
   lengths and output lengths are either indicated or obvious from the
   cryptosuite name, e.g., HMAC-SHA256-128 denotes Hashed Message
   Authentication Code (HMAC) computed using the SHA-256 function
   [<a href="./rfc4868" title='"Using HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA- 384, and HMAC-SHA-512 with IPsec"'>RFC4868</a>] with 256-bit key length and the output truncated to 128

   0-1  RESERVED

   2    HMAC-SHA256-128

   3    HMAC-SHA256-256

   HMAC-SHA256-128 is REQUIRED to implement, and it SHOULD be enabled in
   the default configuration.

   Authentication Tag

   This field contains an integrity checksum over the ERP/AAK packet
   from the first bit of the Code field to the last bit of the
   Cryptosuite field, excluding the Authentication Tag field itself.
   The value field is calculated using the integrity algorithm indicated
   in the Cryptosuite field and rIK specified in [<a href="./rfc5296" title='"EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)"'>RFC5296</a>] as the secret
   key.  The length of the field is indicated by the Cryptosuite.

   The peer uses the Authentication Tag to determine the validity of the
   EAP-Finish/Re-auth message from the server.

   Similar to ERP, some lower-layer specifications may need to be
   revised to support ERP/AAK; refer to <a href="./rfc5296#section-6">SectionÂ 6 of [RFC5296]</a> for
   additional guidance.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20AAA%20Transport%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  AAA Transport Considerations</span>

   The AAA transport of ERP/AAK messages is the same as that of the ERP
   message [<a href="./rfc5296" title='"EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)"'>RFC5296</a>].  In addition, this document requires AAA transport
   of the ERP/AAK keying materials delivered by the ERP/AAK server to
   the CAP.  Hence, a new AAA message for the ERP/AAK application should
   be specified to transport the keying materials.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This section provides an analysis of the protocol in accordance with
   the AAA key management requirements specified in [<a href="./rfc4962" title='"Guidance for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Key Management"'>RFC4962</a>].

   o  Cryptographic algorithm independence: ERP-AAK satisfies this
      requirement.  The algorithm chosen by the peer for calculating the
      authentication tag is indicated in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
      message.  If the chosen algorithm is unacceptable, the EAP server
      returns an EAP-Finish/Re-auth message with a Failure indication.

   o  Strong, fresh session keys: ERP-AAK results in the derivation of
      strong, fresh keys that are unique for the given CAP.  A pMSK is
      always derived on demand when the peer requires a key with a new
      CAP.  The derivation ensures that the compromise of one pMSK does
      not result in the compromise of a different pMSK at any time.

   o  Limit key scope: The scope of all the keys derived by ERP-AAK is
      well defined.  The pRK is used to derive the pMSK for the CAP.
      Different sequence numbers for each CAP MUST be used to derive a
      unique pMSK.

   o  Replay detection mechanism: For replay protection, a sequence
      number associated with the pMSK is used.  The peer increments the
      sequence number by one after it sends an ERP/AAK message.  The
      server sets the expected sequence number to the received sequence
      number plus one after verifying the validity of the received
      message, and it responds to the message.

   o  Authenticate all parties: The EAP Re-authentication Protocol
      provides mutual authentication of the peer and the server.  The
      peer and SAP are authenticated via ERP.  The CAP is authenticated
      and trusted by the SAP.

   o  Peer and authenticator authorization: The peer and authenticator
      demonstrate possession of the same keying material without
      disclosing it, as part of the lower-layer secure authentication
      protocol.

   o  Keying material confidentiality: The peer and the server derive
      the keys independently using parameters known to each entity.

   o  Uniquely named keys: All keys produced within the ERP context can
      be referred to uniquely as specified in this document.

   o  Prevent the domino effect: Different sequence numbers for each CAP
      MUST be used to derive the unique pMSK so that the compromise of
      one pMSK does not hurt any other CAP.

   o  Bind key to its context: The pMSKs are bound to the context in
      which the sequence numbers are transmitted.

   o  Confidentiality of identity: This is the same as with ERP
      [<a href="./rfc5296" title='"EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)"'>RFC5296</a>].

   o  Authorization restriction: All the keys derived are limited in
      lifetime by that of the parent key or by server policy.  Any
      domain-specific keys are further restricted to be used only in the
      domain for which the keys are derived.  Any other restrictions of
      session keys may be imposed by the specific lower layer and are
      out of scope for this specification.

   This document reuses the cryptosuites that were created for
   "Re-authentication Cryptosuites" in [<a href="./rfc5296" title='"EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)"'>RFC5296</a>].

   Further, IANA has added a new label in the "User Specific Root Keys
   (USRK) Key Labels" sub-registry of the "Extended Master Session Key
   (EMSK) Parameters" registry, as follows:

      EAP Early-Authentication Root Key@ietf.org

   message called the "EAP Initiate/Re-auth-Start Flags" has been
   created and a new flag (E) has been assigned as follows:

      (E) 0x80

   The rest of the values in the 8-bit field are reserved.  New values
   can be assigned by Standards Action or IESG Approval [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].

   A new registry for the flags in the EAP Initiate/Re-auth message
   called the "EAP Initiate/Re-auth Flags" has also been created.  The
   following flags are reserved:

      (R) 0x80 [<a href="./rfc5296" title='"EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)"'>RFC5296</a>]

      (B) 0x40 [<a href="./rfc5296" title='"EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)"'>RFC5296</a>]

      (L) 0x20 [<a href="./rfc5296" title='"EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)"'>RFC5296</a>]

   This document assigns a new flag (E) as follows:

      (E) 0x10

   The rest of the values in the 8-bit field are reserved.  New values
   can be assigned by Standards Action or IESG Approval.

   Further, this document creates a new registry for the flags in the
   EAP Finish/Re-auth message called the "EAP Finish/Re-auth Flags".
   The following values are assigned.
