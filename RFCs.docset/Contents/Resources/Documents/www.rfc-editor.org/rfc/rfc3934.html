Abstract

   This document is an update to <a href="./rfc2418">RFC 2418</a> that gives WG chairs explicit

   gives WG chairs the authority to temporarily suspend the mailing list
   posting privileges of disruptive individuals.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3934">RFC 3934</a>             Mailing List Management Update         October 2004</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   As written, <a href="./rfc2418">RFC 2418</a> [<a href="./rfc2418" title='"IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures"'>RFC2418</a>] gives WG chairs more authority to
   manage face-to-face discussions than to manage mailing list
   discussions.  In face-to-face meetings, the WG chair has the
   authority "to refuse to grant the floor to any individual who is
   unprepared or otherwise covering inappropriate material, or who, in
   the opinion of the Chair, is disrupting the WG process."  However,
   <a href="./rfc2418">RFC 2418</a> does not give the WG Chair the authority to suspend the
   mailing list posting privileges of an individual who is similarly
   disrupting WG mailing list discussions.  <a href="./rfc2418">RFC 2418</a> explicitly requires
   full IESG approval for this action.

   This document is an update to <a href="./rfc2418#section-3.2">RFC 2418, section 3.2</a>.  It gives WG
   chairs the authority to temporarily suspend the posting privileges of
   disruptive individuals without IESG approval.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Specific%20Changes%20to%20RFC%202418"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Specific Changes to <a href="./rfc2418">RFC 2418</a></span>

   The following paragraphs supersede the last paragraph of <a href="./rfc2418#section-3.2">RFC 2418,
   section 3.2</a>:

   As in face-to-face sessions, occasionally one or more individuals may
   engage in behavior on a mailing list that, in the opinion of the WG
   chair, is disruptive to the WG process.  Unless the disruptive
   behavior is severe enough that it must be stopped immediately, the WG
   chair should attempt to discourage the disruptive behavior by
   communicating directly with the offending individual.  If the
   behavior persists, the WG chair should send at least one public
   warning on the WG mailing list.  As a last resort and typically after
   one or more explicit warnings and consultation with the responsible
   Area Director, the WG chair may suspend the mailing list posting
   privileges of the disruptive individual for a period of not more than
   30 days.  Even while posting privileges are suspended, the individual
   must not be prevented from receiving messages posted to the list.
   Like all other WG chair decisions, any suspension of posting
   privileges is subject to appeal, as described in <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a> [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>].

   This mechanism is intended to permit a WG chair to suspend posting
   privileges of a disruptive individual for a short period of time.
   This mechanism does not permit WG chairs to suspend an individual's
   posting privileges for a period longer than 30 days regardless of the
   type or severity of the disruptive incident.  However, further
   disruptive behavior by the same individual will be considered
   separately and may result in further warnings or suspensions.  Other
   methods of mailing list control, including longer suspensions, must
