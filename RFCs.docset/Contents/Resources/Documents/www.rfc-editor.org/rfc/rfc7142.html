   IS-IS is the "OSI Intermediate system to Intermediate system intra-
   domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction
   with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode Network
   Service (ISO 8473)", otherwise known as ISO/IEC 10589.  It has been
   extended for use with IP by <a href="./rfc1195">RFC 1195</a> [<a href="./rfc1195" title='"Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP and dual environments"'>RFC1195</a>] and subsequently
   enhanced by many other RFCs.

   <a href="./rfc1142">RFC 1142</a> [<a href="./rfc1142" title='"OSI IS-IS Intra-domain Routing Protocol"'>RFC1142</a>] was a republication of ISO DP 10589 originally
   provided as a service to the Internet community.  However, ISO DP
   10589 was an ISO "Draft Proposal", which differed in a considerable
   number of significant respects from the final standardized version
   published as ISO/IEC 10589 [<a href="#ref-ISO10589-First-Edition">ISO10589-First-Edition</a>], and subsequently
   revised as ISO/IEC 10589 Second Edition [<a href="#ref-ISO10589-Second-Edition">ISO10589-Second-Edition</a>].
   It has been an ongoing source of confusion when <a href="./rfc1142">RFC 1142</a> has been
   unwittingly quoted or referenced in place of ISO/IEC 10589 itself.

   All references to IS-IS should be to the latest edition of the IS-IS
   standard (currently ISO/IEC 10589:2002, Second Edition), and <a href="./rfc1142">RFC 1142</a>
   is only of historic interest.

   This memo explains why <a href="./rfc1142">RFC 1142</a>, "OSI IS-IS Intra-domain Routing
   Protocol", is reclassified to Historic status.  This memo also
   obsoletes <a href="./rfc1142">RFC 1142</a>.

   Reclassifying <a href="./rfc1142">RFC 1142</a> has no security considerations.
