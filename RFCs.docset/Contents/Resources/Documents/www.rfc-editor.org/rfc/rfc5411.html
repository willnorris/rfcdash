Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the subject of numerous
   specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can be
   difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the set
   of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  This specification serves
   as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It lists a current snapshot of the
   specifications under the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and
   groups them into categories.

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] is the subject of
   numerous specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can
   be difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the
   set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  "Don't Panic!"  [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>]
   This specification serves as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It is a
   current snapshot of the specifications under the SIP umbrella at the
   time of publication.  It is anticipated that this document itself
   will be regularly updated as SIP specifications mature.  Furthermore,
   it references many specifications, which, at the time of publication
   of this document, were not yet finalized, and may eventually be
   completed or abandoned.  Therefore, the enumeration of specifications
   here is a work-in-progress and subject to change.

   For each specification, a paragraph or so description is included
   that summarizes the purpose of the specification.  Each specification
   also includes a letter that designates its category in the Standards
   Track [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>].  These values are:

   S: Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or Standard)

   E: Experimental

   B: Best Current Practice

   I: Informational

   The specifications are grouped together by topic.  The topics are:

   Core:  The SIP specifications that are expected to be utilized for
      each session or registration an endpoint participates in.

   Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Interop:  Specifications
      related to interworking with the telephone network.

   General Purpose Infrastructure:  General purpose extensions to SIP,
      SDP (Session Description Protocol), and MIME, but ones that are
      not expected to always be used.

   NAT Traversal:  Specifications to deal with firewall and NAT
      traversal.

   Call Control Primitives:  Specifications for manipulating SIP dialogs
      and calls.

   Event Framework:  Definitions of the core specifications for the SIP
      event framework, providing for pub/sub capability.

   Event Packages:  Packages that utilize the SIP event framework.

   Quality of Service:  Specifications related to multimedia quality of
      service (QoS).

   Operations and Management:  Specifications related to configuration
      and monitoring of SIP deployments.

   SIP Compression:  Specifications to facilitate usage of SIP with the
      Signaling Compression (Sigcomp) framework.

   SIP Service URIs:  Specifications on how to use SIP URIs to address
      multimedia services.

   Minor Extensions:  Specifications that solve a narrow problem space
      or provide an optimization.

   Security Mechanisms:  Specifications providing security functionality
      for SIP.

   Conferencing:  Specifications for multimedia conferencing.

   Instant Messaging, Presence, and Multimedia:  SIP extensions related
      to IM, presence, and multimedia.  This covers only the SIP
      extensions related to these topics.  See [<a href="#ref-SIMPLE" title='"SIMPLE made Simple: An Overview of the IETF Specifications for Instant Messaging and Presence using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>SIMPLE</a>] for a full
      treatment of SIP for IM and Presence (SIMPLE).

   Emergency Services:  SIP extensions related to emergency services.
      See [<a href="#ref-ECRIT-FRAME" title='"Framework for Emergency Calling using Internet Multimedia"'>ECRIT-FRAME</a>] for a more complete treatment of additional
      functionality related to emergency services.

   Typically, SIP extensions fit naturally into topic areas, and
   implementors interested in a particular topic often implement many or
   all of the specifications in that area.  There are some
   specifications that fall into multiple topic areas, in which case
   they are listed more than once.

   Do not print all the specs cited here at once, as they might share
   the fate of the rules of Brockian Ultracricket when bound together:
   collapse under their own gravity and form a black hole [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>].

   This document itself is not an update to <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> or an extension to
   SIP.  It is an informational document, meant to guide newcomers,
   implementors, and deployers to the many specifications associated
   with SIP.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5411">RFC 5411</a>                Hitchhiker's Guide to SIP           January 2009</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Scope%20of%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Scope of This Document</span>

   It is very difficult to enumerate the set of SIP specifications.
   This is because there are many protocols that are intimately related
   to SIP and used by nearly all SIP implementations, but are not
   formally SIP extensions.  As such, this document formally defines a
   "SIP specification" as:

   o  <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> and any specification that defines an extension to it,
      where an extension is a mechanism that changes or updates in some
      way a behavior specified there.

   o  The basic SDP specification [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] and any specification that
      defines an extension to SDP whose primary purpose is to support
      SIP.

   o  Any specification that defines a MIME object whose primary purpose
      is to support SIP.

   Excluded from this list are requirements, architectures, registry
   definitions, non-normative frameworks, and processes.  Best Current
   Practices are included when they normatively define mechanisms for
   accomplishing a task, or provide significant description of the usage
   of the normative specifications, such as call flows.

   The SIP change process [<a href="./rfc3427" title='"Change Process for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3427</a>] defines two types of extensions to
   SIP: normal extensions and the so-called P-headers (where P stands
   for "preliminary", "private", or "proprietary", and the "P-" prefix
   is included in the header field name), which are meant to be used in
   areas of limited applicability.  P-headers cannot be defined in the
   Standards Track.  For the most part, P-headers are not included in
   the listing here, with the exception of those that have seen general
   usage despite their P-header status.

   This document includes specifications, which have already been
   approved by the IETF and granted an RFC number, in addition to
   Internet Drafts, which are still under development within the IETF
   and will eventually finish and get an RFC number.  Inclusion of
   Internet Drafts here helps encourage early implementation and
   demonstrations of interoperability of the protocol, and thus aids in
   the standards-setting process.  Inclusion of these also identifes
   where the IETF is targetting a solution at a particular problem
   space.  Note that final IANA assignment of codepoints (such as option
   tags and header field names) does not take place until shortly before
   publication as an RFC, and thus codepoint assignments may change.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5411">RFC 5411</a>                Hitchhiker's Guide to SIP           January 2009</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Core%20SIP%20Specifications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Core SIP Specifications</span>

   The core SIP specifications represent the set of specifications whose
   functionality is broadly applicable.  An extension is broadly
   applicable if it fits into one of the following categories:

   o  For specifications that impact SIP session management, the
      extension would be used for almost every session initiated by a
      user agent.

   o  For specifications that impact SIP registrations, the extension
      would be used for almost every registration initiated by a user
      agent.

   o  For specifications that impact SIP subscriptions, the extension
      would be used for almost every subscription initiated by a user
      agent.

   In other words, these are not specifications that are used just for
   some requests and not others; they are specifications that would
   apply to each and every request for which the extension is relevant.
   In the galaxy of SIP, these specifications are like towels [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>].

   <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>, The Session Initiation Protocol (S):  [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] is the core
      SIP protocol itself.  <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> obsoletes [<a href="./rfc2543" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC2543</a>].  It is the
      president of the galaxy [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>] as far as the suite of SIP
      specifications is concerned.

   <a href="./rfc3263">RFC 3263</a>, Locating SIP Servers (S):  [<a href="./rfc3263" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP Servers"'>RFC3263</a>] provides DNS
      procedures for taking a SIP URI and determining a SIP server that
      is associated with that SIP URI.  <a href="./rfc3263">RFC 3263</a> is essential for any
      implementation using SIP with DNS.  <a href="./rfc3263">RFC 3263</a> makes use of both DNS
      SRV records [<a href="./rfc2782" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC2782</a>] and NAPTR records [<a href="./rfc3401" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS"'>RFC3401</a>].

   <a href="./rfc3264">RFC 3264</a>, An Offer/Answer Model with the Session Description Protocol
   (S):  [<a href="./rfc3264" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] defines how the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
      [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] is used with SIP to negotiate the parameters of a media
      session.  It is in widespread usage and an integral part of the
      behavior of <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.

   <a href="./rfc3265">RFC 3265</a>, SIP-Specific Event Notification (S):  [<a href="./rfc3265" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)- Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>] defines the
      SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods.  These two methods provide a general
      event notification framework for SIP.  To actually use the
      framework, extensions need to be defined for specific event
      packages.  An event package defines a schema for the event data
      and describes other aspects of event processing specific to that
      schema.  An <a href="./rfc3265">RFC 3265</a> implementation is required when any event
      package is used.

   <a href="./rfc3325">RFC 3325</a>, Private Extensions to SIP for Asserted Identity within
   Trusted Networks (I):  Though its P-header status implies that it has
      limited applicability, [<a href="./rfc3325" title='"Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks"'>RFC3325</a>], which defines the P-Asserted-
      Identity header field, has been widely deployed.  It is used as
      the basic mechanism for providing network-asserted caller ID
      services.  Its intended update, [<a href="#ref-UPDATE-PAI" title='"Updates to Asserted Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>UPDATE-PAI</a>], clarifies its usage
      for connected party identification as well.

   <a href="./rfc3327">RFC 3327</a>, SIP Extension Header Field for Registering Non-Adjacent
   Contacts (S):  [<a href="./rfc3327" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension Header Field for Registering Non-Adjacent Contacts"'>RFC3327</a>] defines the Path header field.  This field
      is inserted by proxies between a client and their registrar.  It
      allows inbound requests towards that client to traverse these
      proxies prior to being delivered to the user agent.  It is
      essential in any SIP deployment that has edge proxies, which are
      proxies between the client and the home proxy or SIP registrar.

   <a href="./rfc3581">RFC 3581</a>, An Extension to SIP for Symmetric Response Routing (S):
      [<a href="./rfc3581" title='"An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Symmetric Response Routing"'>RFC3581</a>] defines the rport parameter of the Via header.  It
      allows SIP responses to traverse NAT.  It is one of several
      specifications that are utilized for NAT traversal (see
      <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>).

   <a href="./rfc3840">RFC 3840</a>, Indicating User Agent Capabilities in SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc3840" title="and P. Kyzivat">RFC3840</a>]
      defines a mechanism for carrying capability information about a
      user agent in REGISTER requests and in dialog-forming requests
      like INVITE.  It has found use with conferencing (the isfocus
      parameter declares that a user agent is a conference server) and
      with applications like push-to-talk.

   <a href="./rfc4320">RFC 4320</a>, Actions Addressing Issues Identified with the Non-INVITE
   Transaction in SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc4320" title="&quot;Actions Addressing Identified Issues with the Session Initiation Protocol's (SIP) Non- INVITE Transaction&quot;">RFC4320</a>] formally updates <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> and
      modifies some of the behaviors associated with non-INVITE
      transactions.  This addresses some problems found in timeout and
      failure cases.

   <a href="./rfc4474">RFC 4474</a>, Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in SIP
   (S):  [<a href="./rfc4474" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>] defines a mechanism for providing a cryptographically
      verifiable identity of the calling party in a SIP request.  Known
      as "SIP Identity", this mechanism provides an alternative to <a href="./rfc3325">RFC</a>
      <a href="./rfc3325">3325</a>.  It has seen little deployment so far, but its importance as
      a key construct for anti-spam techniques and new security
      mechanisms makes it a core part of the SIP specifications.

   GRUU, Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent Identifiers
   (GRUU) in SIP (S):  [<a href="#ref-GRUU" title='"Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>GRUU</a>] defines a mechanism for directing requests
      towards a specific UA instance.  GRUU is essential for features
      like transfer and provides another piece of the SIP NAT traversal
      story.

   OUTBOUND, Managing Client Initiated Connections through SIP (S):
      [<a href="#ref-OUTBOUND" title='"Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>OUTBOUND</a>], also known as SIP outbound, defines important changes
      to the SIP registration mechanism that enable delivery of SIP
      messages towards a UA when it is behind a NAT.  This specification
      is the cornerstone of the SIP NAT traversal strategy.

   <a href="./rfc4566">RFC 4566</a>, Session Description Protocol (S):  [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] defines a
      format for representing multimedia sessions.  SDP objects are
      carried in the body of SIP messages and, based on the offer/answer
      model, are used to negotiate the media characteristics of a
      session between users.

   SDP-CAP, SDP Capability Negotiation (S):  [<a href="#ref-SDP-CAP" title='"SDP Capability Negotiation"'>SDP-CAP</a>] defines a set of
      extensions to SDP that allows for capability negotiation within
      SDP.  Capability negotiation can be used to select between
      different profiles of RTP (secure vs. unsecure) or to negotiate
      codecs such that an agent has to select one amongst a set of
      supported codecs.

   ICE, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) (S):  [<a href="#ref-ICE" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>ICE</a>] defines
      a technique for NAT traversal of media sessions for protocols that
      make use of the offer/answer model.  This specification is the
      IETF-recommended mechanism for NAT traversal for SIP media
      streams, and is meant to be used even by endpoints that are
      themselves never behind a NAT.  A SIP option tag and media feature
      tag [<a href="#ref-OPTION-TAG" title='"Indicating Support for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>OPTION-TAG</a>] (also a core specification) have been defined for
      use with ICE.

   <a href="./rfc3605">RFC 3605</a>, Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) Attribute in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc3605" title='"Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) attribute in Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3605</a>] defines a way to
      explicitly signal, within an SDP message, the IP address and port
      for RTCP, rather than using the port+1 rule in the Real Time
      Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  It is needed for devices
      behind NAT, and the specification is required by ICE.

   <a href="./rfc4916">RFC 4916</a>, Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   (S):  [<a href="./rfc4916" title='"Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4916</a>] formally updates <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.  It defines an extension
      to SIP that allows a calling user to determine the identity of the
      final called user (connected party).  Due to forwarding and
      retargeting services, this may not be the same as the user that
      the caller was originally trying to reach.  The mechanism works in
      tandem with the SIP identity specification [<a href="./rfc4474" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>] to provide
      signatures over the connected party identity.  It can also be used
      if a party identity changes mid-call due to third-party call
      control actions or PSTN behavior.

   <a href="./rfc3311">RFC 3311</a>, The SIP UPDATE Method (S):  [<a href="./rfc3311" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) UPDATE Method"'>RFC3311</a>] defines the UPDATE
      method for SIP.  This method is meant as a means for updating
      session information prior to the completion of the initial INVITE
      transaction.  It can also be used to update other information,
      such as the identity of the participant [<a href="./rfc4916" title='"Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4916</a>], without
      involving an updated offer/answer exchange.  It was developed
      initially to support [<a href="./rfc3312" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>], but has found other uses.  In
      particular, its usage with <a href="./rfc4916">RFC 4916</a> means it will typically be
      used as part of every session, to convey a secure, connected
      identity.

   SIPS-URI, The Use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) (S):  [<a href="#ref-SIPS-URI" title='"The Use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>SIPS-URI</a>] is intended to update <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.  It
      revises the processing of the SIPS URI, originally defined in <a href="./rfc3261">RFC</a>
      <a href="./rfc3261">3261</a>, to fix many errors and problems that have been encountered
      with that mechanism.

   <a href="./rfc3665">RFC 3665</a>, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Basic Call Flow Examples
   (B):  [<a href="./rfc3665" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Basic Call Flow Examples"'>RFC3665</a>] contains best-practice call flow examples for basic
      SIP interactions -- call establishment, termination, and
      registration.

   Essential Corrections to SIP:  A collection of fixes to SIP that
      address important bugs and vulnerabilities.  These include a fix
      requiring loop detection in any proxy that forks [<a href="#ref-LOOP-FIX" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>LOOP-FIX</a>], a
      clarification on how record-routing works [<a href="#ref-RECORD-ROUTE" title='"Addressing Record-Route issues in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RECORD-ROUTE</a>], and a
      correction to the IPv6 BNF [<a href="#ref-ABNF-FIX" title='"Essential correction for IPv6 ABNF in RFC3261"'>ABNF-FIX</a>].

   Numerous extensions and usages of SIP are related to interoperability
   and communications with or through the PSTN.

   <a href="./rfc2848">RFC 2848</a>, The PINT Service Protocol (S):  [<a href="./rfc2848" title='"The PINT Service Protocol: Extensions to SIP and SDP for IP Access to Telephone Call Services"'>RFC2848</a>] is one of the
      earliest extensions to SIP.  It defines procedures for using SIP
      to invoke services that actually execute on the PSTN.  Its main
      application is for third-party call control, allowing an IP host
      to set up a call between two PSTN endpoints.  PINT (PSTN/Internet
      Interworking) has a relatively narrow focus and has not seen
      widespread deployment.

   <a href="./rfc3910">RFC 3910</a>, The SPIRITS Protocol (S):  Continuing the trend of naming
      PSTN-related extensions with alcohol references, SPIRITS (Services
      in PSTN Requesting Internet Services) [<a href="./rfc3910" title='"The SPIRITS (Services in PSTN requesting Internet Services) Protocol"'>RFC3910</a>] defines the
      inverse of PINT.  It allows a switch in the PSTN to ask an IP
      element how to proceed with call waiting.  It was developed
      primarily to support Internet Call Waiting (ICW).  Perhaps the
      next specification will be called the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster

      [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>].

   <a href="./rfc3372">RFC 3372</a>, SIP for Telephones (SIP-T): Context and Architectures (I):
      SIP-T [<a href="./rfc3372" title='"Session Initiation Protocol for Telephones (SIP-T): Context and Architectures"'>RFC3372</a>] defines a mechanism for using SIP between pairs of
      PSTN gateways.  Its essential idea is to tunnel ISDN User Part
      (ISUP) signaling between the gateways in the body of SIP messages.
      SIP-T motivated the development of INFO [<a href="./rfc2976" title='"The SIP INFO Method"'>RFC2976</a>].  SIP-T has seen
      widespread implementation for the limited deployment model that it
      addresses.  As ISUP endpoints disappear from the network, the need
      for this mechanism will decrease.

   <a href="./rfc3398">RFC 3398</a>, ISUP to SIP Mapping (S):  [<a href="./rfc3398" title='"Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) User Part (ISUP) to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Mapping"'>RFC3398</a>] defines how to do
      protocol mapping from the SS7 ISDN User Part (ISUP) signaling to
      SIP.  It is widely used in SS7 to SIP gateways and is part of the
      SIP-T framework.

   <a href="./rfc4497">RFC 4497</a>, Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   and QSIG (B):  [<a href="./rfc4497" title='"Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and QSIG"'>RFC4497</a>] defines how to do protocol mapping from
      Q.SIG, used for Private Branch Exchange (PBX) signaling, to SIP.

   <a href="./rfc3578">RFC 3578</a>, Mapping of ISUP Overlap Signaling to SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc3578" title='"Mapping of Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) User Part (ISUP) Overlap Signalling to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3578</a>]
      defines a mechanism to map overlap dialing into SIP.  This
      specification is widely regarded as the ugliest SIP specification,
      as the introduction to the specification itself advises that it
      has many problems.  Overlap signaling (the practice of sending
      digits into the network as dialed instead of waiting for complete
      collection of the called party number) is largely incompatible
      with SIP at some fairly fundamental levels.  That said, <a href="./rfc3578">RFC 3578</a>
      is mostly harmless and has seen some usage.

   <a href="./rfc3960">RFC 3960</a>, Early Media and Ringtone Generation in SIP (I):  [<a href="./rfc3960" title='"Early Media and Ringing Tone Generation in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3960</a>]
      defines some guidelines for handling early media -- the practice
      of sending media from the called party or an application server
      towards the caller prior to acceptance of the call.  Early media
      is often generated from the PSTN.  Early media is a complex topic,
      and this specification does not fully address the problems
      associated with it.

   <a href="./rfc3959">RFC 3959</a>, Early Session Disposition Type for the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc3959" title='"The Early Session Disposition Type for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3959</a>] defines a new session disposition type
      for use with early media.  It indicates that the SDP in the body
      is for a special early media session.  This has seen little usage.

   <a href="./rfc3204">RFC 3204</a>, MIME Media Types for ISUP and QSIG Objects (S):  [<a href="./rfc3204" title='"MIME media types for ISUP and QSIG Objects"'>RFC3204</a>]
      defines MIME objects for representing SS7 and QSIG signaling
      messages.  SS7 signaling messages are carried in the body of SIP
      messages when SIP-T is used.  QSIG signaling messages can be
      carried in a similar way.

   <a href="./rfc3666">RFC3666</a>, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Public Switched Telephone
   Network (PSTN) Call Flows (B):  [<a href="./rfc3666" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Call Flows"'>RFC3666</a>] provides best practice call
      flows around interworking with the PSTN.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20General%20Purpose%20Infrastructure%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  General Purpose Infrastructure Extensions</span>

   These extensions are general purpose enhancements to SIP, SDP, and
   MIME that can serve a wide variety of uses.  However, they are not
   used for every session or registration, as the core specifications
   are.

   <a href="./rfc3262">RFC 3262</a>, Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP (S):  SIP
      defines two types of responses to a request: final and
      provisional.  Provisional responses are numbered from 100 to 199.
      In SIP, these responses are not sent reliably.  This choice was
      made in <a href="./rfc2543">RFC 2543</a> since the messages were meant to just be truly
      informational and rendered to the user.  However, subsequent work
      on PSTN interworking demonstrated a need to map provisional
      responses to PSTN messages that needed to be sent reliably.
      [<a href="./rfc3262" title='"Reliability of Provisional Responses in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3262</a>] was developed to allow reliability of provisional
      responses.  The specification defines the PRACK method, used for
      indicating that a provisional response was received.  Though it
      provides a generic capability for SIP, <a href="./rfc3262">RFC 3262</a> implementations
      have been most common in PSTN interworking devices.  However,
      PRACK brings a great deal of complication for relatively small
      benefit.  As such, it has seen only moderate levels of deployment.

   <a href="./rfc3323">RFC 3323</a>, A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc3323" title='"A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3323</a>] defines the Privacy header field, used by
      clients to request anonymity for their requests.  Though it
      defines several privacy services, the only one broadly used is the
      one that supports privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity header field
      [<a href="./rfc3325" title='"Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks"'>RFC3325</a>].

   UA-PRIVACY, UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP (S):  [<a href="#ref-UA-PRIVACY" title='"UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP"'>UA-PRIVACY</a>]
      defines a mechanism for achieving anonymous calls in SIP.  It is
      an alternative to [<a href="./rfc3323" title='"A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3323</a>], and instead places more intelligence
      in the endpoint to craft anonymous messages by directly accessing
      network services.

   <a href="./rfc2976">RFC 2976</a>, The INFO Method (S):  [<a href="./rfc2976" title='"The SIP INFO Method"'>RFC2976</a>] was defined as an extension
      to <a href="./rfc2543">RFC 2543</a>.  It defines a method, INFO, used to transport mid-
      dialog information that has no impact on SIP itself.  Its driving
      application was the transport of PSTN-related information when
      using SIP between a pair of gateways.  Though originally conceived
      for broader use, it only found standardized usage with SIP-T
      [<a href="./rfc3372" title='"Session Initiation Protocol for Telephones (SIP-T): Context and Architectures"'>RFC3372</a>].  It has been used to support numerous proprietary and
      non-interoperable extensions due to its poorly defined scope.

   <a href="./rfc3326">RFC 3326</a>, The Reason Header Field for SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc3326" title='"The Reason Header Field for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3326</a>] defines the
      Reason header field.  It is used in requests, such as BYE, to
      indicate the reason that the request is being sent.

   <a href="./rfc3388">RFC 3388</a>, Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol
   (S):  <a href="./rfc3388">RFC 3388</a> [<a href="./rfc3388" title='"Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3388</a>] defines a framework for grouping together
      media streams in an SDP message.  Such a grouping allows
      relationships between these streams, such as which stream is the
      audio for a particular video feed, to be expressed.

   <a href="./rfc3420">RFC 3420</a>, Internet Media Type message/sipfrag (S):  [<a href="./rfc3420" title='"Internet Media Type message/sipfrag"'>RFC3420</a>] defines
      a MIME object that contains a SIP message fragment.  Only certain
      header fields and parts of the SIP message are present.  For
      example, it is used to report back on the responses received to a
      request sent as a consequence of a REFER.

   <a href="./rfc3608">RFC 3608</a>, SIP Extension Header Field for Service Route Discovery
   During Registration (S):  [<a href="./rfc3608" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension Header Field for Service Route Discovery During Registration"'>RFC3608</a>] allows a client to determine,
      from a REGISTER response, a path of proxies to use in requests it
      sends outside of a dialog.  It can also be used by proxies to
      verify the Route header in client-initiated requests.  In many
      respects, it is the inverse of the Path header field, but has seen
      less usage since default outbound proxies have been sufficient in
      many deployments.

   <a href="./rfc3841">RFC 3841</a>, Caller Preferences for SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc3841" title='"Caller Preferences for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3841</a>] defines a set of
      headers that a client can include in a request to control the way
      in which the request is routed downstream.  It allows a client to
      direct a request towards a UA with specific capabilities, which a
      UA indicates using [<a href="./rfc3840" title="and P. Kyzivat">RFC3840</a>].

   <a href="./rfc4028">RFC 4028</a>, Session Timers in SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc4028" title='"Session Timers in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4028</a>] defines a keepalive
      mechanism for SIP signaling.  It is primarily meant to provide a
      way to clean up old state in proxies that are holding call state
      for calls from failed endpoints that were never terminated
      normally.  Despite its name, the session timer is not a mechanism
      for detecting a network failure mid-call.  Session timers
      introduce a fair bit of complexity for relatively little gain, and
      have seen moderate deployment.

   <a href="./rfc4168">RFC 4168</a>, SCTP as a Transport for SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc4168" title='"The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4168</a>] defines how to
      carry SIP messages over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
      (SCTP) [<a href="./rfc4960" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol"'>RFC4960</a>].  SCTP has seen very limited usage for SIP
      transport.

      [<a href="./rfc4244" title='"An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Request History Information"'>RFC4244</a>] defines the History-Info header field, which indicates
      information on how and why a call came to be routed to a
      particular destination.

   <a href="./rfc4145">RFC 4145</a>, TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc4145" title='"TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC4145</a>] defines an extension to SDP for
      setting up TCP-based sessions between user agents.  It defines who
      sets up the connection and how its lifecycle is managed.  It has
      seen relatively little usage due to the small number of media
      types to date that use TCP.

   <a href="./rfc4091">RFC 4091</a>, The Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics for
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework (S):
      [<a href="./rfc4091" title='"The Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework"'>RFC4091</a>] defines a mechanism for including both IPv4 and IPv6
      addresses for a media session as alternates.  This mechanism has
      been deprecated in favor of ICE [<a href="#ref-ICE" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>ICE</a>].

   SDP-MEDIA, SDP Media Capabilities Negotiation (S):  [<a href="#ref-SDP-MEDIA" title='"SDP media capabilities Negotiation"'>SDP-MEDIA</a>]
      defines an extension to the SDP capability negotiation framework
      [<a href="#ref-SDP-CAP" title='"SDP Capability Negotiation"'>SDP-CAP</a>] for negotiating codecs, codec parameters, and media
      streams.

   BODY-HANDLING, Message Body Handling in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP):  [<a href="#ref-BODY-HANDLING" title='"Message Body Handling in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>BODY-HANDLING</a>] clarifies handling of bodies in SIP,
      focusing primarily on multi-part behavior, which was under-
      specified in SIP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20NAT%20Traversal"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  NAT Traversal</span>

   These SIP extensions are primarily aimed at addressing NAT traversal
   for SIP.

   ICE, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) (S):  [<a href="#ref-ICE" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>ICE</a>] defines
      a technique for NAT traversal of media sessions for protocols that
      make use of the offer/answer model.  This specification is the
      IETF-recommended mechanism for NAT traversal for SIP media
      streams, and is meant to be used even by endpoints that are
      themselves never behind a NAT.  A SIP option tag and media feature
      tag [<a href="#ref-OPTION-TAG" title='"Indicating Support for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>OPTION-TAG</a>] have been defined for use with ICE.

   ICE-TCP, TCP Candidates with Interactive Connectivity Establishment
   (ICE) (S):  [<a href="#ref-ICE-TCP" title='"TCP Candidates with Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)"'>ICE-TCP</a>] specifies the usage of ICE for TCP streams.
      This allows for selection of RTP-based voice on top of TCP only
      when NAT or firewalls would prevent UDP-based voice from working.

   <a href="./rfc3605">RFC 3605</a>, Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) Attribute in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc3605" title='"Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) attribute in Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3605</a>] defines a way to
      explicitly signal, within an SDP message, the IP address and port
      for RTCP, rather than using the port+1 rule in the Real Time
      Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  It is needed for devices
      behind NAT, and the specification is required by ICE.

   OUTBOUND, Managing Client Initiated Connections through SIP (S):
      [<a href="#ref-OUTBOUND" title='"Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>OUTBOUND</a>], also known as SIP outbound, defines important changes
      to the SIP registration mechanism that enable delivery of SIP
      messages towards a UA when it is behind a NAT.

   <a href="./rfc3581">RFC 3581</a>, An Extension to SIP for Symmetric Response Routing (S):
      [<a href="./rfc3581" title='"An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Symmetric Response Routing"'>RFC3581</a>] defines the rport parameter of the Via header.  It
      allows SIP responses to traverse NAT.

   GRUU, Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent Identifiers
   (GRUU) in SIP (S):  [<a href="#ref-GRUU" title='"Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>GRUU</a>] defines a mechanism for directing requests
      towards a specific UA instance.  GRUU is essential for features
      like transfer and provides another piece of the SIP NAT traversal
      story.

   Numerous SIP extensions provide a toolkit of dialog- and call-
   management techniques.  These techniques have been combined together
   to build many SIP-based services.

   <a href="./rfc3515">RFC 3515</a>, The REFER Method (S):  REFER [<a href="./rfc3515" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Refer Method"'>RFC3515</a>] defines a mechanism
      for asking a user agent to send a SIP request.  It's a form of SIP
      remote control, and is the primary tool used for call transfer in
      SIP.  Beware that not all potential uses of REFER (neither for all
      methods nor for all URI schemes) are well defined.  Implementors
      should only use the well-defined ones, and should not second guess
      or freely assume behavior for the others to avoid unexpected
      behavior of remote UAs, interoperability issues, and other bad
      surprises.

   <a href="./rfc3725">RFC 3725</a>, Best Current Practices for Third Party Call Control (3pcc)
   (B):  [<a href="./rfc3725" title='"Best Current Practices for Third Party Call Control (3pcc) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3725</a>] defines a number of different call flows that allow
      one SIP entity, called the controller, to create SIP sessions
      amongst other SIP user agents.

   <a href="./rfc3911">RFC 3911</a>, The SIP Join Header Field (S):  [<a href="./rfc3911" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "'>RFC3911</a>] defines the Join

      join the resulting dialog into a conference with another dialog in
      progress.

   <a href="./rfc3265">RFC 3265</a>, SIP-Specific Event Notification (S):  [<a href="./rfc3265" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)- Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>] defines the
      SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods.  These two methods provide a general
      event notification framework for SIP.  To actually use the
      framework, extensions need to be defined for specific event
      packages.  An event package defines a schema for the event data
      and describes other aspects of event processing specific to that
      schema.  An <a href="./rfc3265">RFC 3265</a> implementation is required when any event
      package is used.

   <a href="./rfc3903">RFC 3903</a>, SIP Extension for Event State Publication (S):  [<a href="./rfc3903" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication"'>RFC3903</a>]
      defines the PUBLISH method.  It is not an event package, but is
      used by all event packages as a mechanism for pushing an event
      into the system.

   Extension for Resource Lists (S):  [<a href="./rfc4662" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>] defines an extension to
      <a href="./rfc3265">RFC 3265</a> that allows a client to subscribe to a list of resources
      using a single subscription.  The server, called a Resource List
      Server (RLS), will "expand" the subscription and subscribe to each
      individual member of the list.  It has found applicability
      primarily in the area of presence, but can be used with any event
      package.

   SUBNOT-ETAGS, An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)
   Events for Conditional Event Notification (S):  [<a href="#ref-SUBNOT-ETAGS" title='"An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Events for Conditional Event Notification"'>SUBNOT-ETAGS</a>]
      defines an extension to <a href="./rfc3265">RFC 3265</a> to optimize the performance of
      notifications.  When a client subscribes, it can indicate what
      version of a document it has so that the server can skip sending a
      notification if the client is up-to-date.  It is applicable to any
      event package.

   These are event packages defined to utilize the SIP events framework.
   Many of these are also listed elsewhere in their respective areas.

   <a href="./rfc3680">RFC 3680</a>, A SIP Event Package for Registrations (S):  [<a href="./rfc3680" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Registrations"'>RFC3680</a>]
      defines an event package for finding out about changes in
      registration state.

   GRUU-REG (S):  [<a href="#ref-GRUU-REG" title='"Registration Event Package Extension for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs)"'>GRUU-REG</a>] is an extension to the registration event
      package [<a href="./rfc3680" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Registrations"'>RFC3680</a>] that allows user agents to learn about their
      GRUUs.  It is particularly useful in helping to synchronize a
      client and its registrar with their currently valid temporary
      GRUU.

   <a href="./rfc3842">RFC 3842</a>, A Message Summary and Message Waiting Indication Event
   Package for SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc3842" title='"A Message Summary and Message Waiting Indication Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3842</a>] defines a way for a user agent to
      find out about voicemails and other messages that are waiting for
      it.  Its primary purpose is to enable the voicemail waiting lamp
      on most business telephones.

   RTCP-SUM, SIP Event Package for Voice Quality Reporting  (S):
      [<a href="#ref-RTCP-SUM" title='"Session Initiation Protocol Package for Voice Quality Reporting Event"'>RTCP-SUM</a>] defines a SIP event package that enables the collection
      and reporting of metrics that measure the quality for Voice over
      Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.

   SESSION-POLICY, A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Session Policies (S):  [<a href="#ref-SESSION-POLICY" title='"A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Session Policies"'>SESSION-POLICY</a>] defines a framework for
      session policies.  In this framework, policy servers are used to
      tell user agents about the media characteristics required for a
      particular session.  The session policy framework has not been
      widely implemented.

   POLICY-PACK, A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for
   Session-Specific Session Policies (S):  [<a href="#ref-POLICY-PACK" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Session-Specific Session Policies."'>POLICY-PACK</a>] defines a SIP
      event package used in conjunction with the session policy
      framework [<a href="#ref-SESSION-POLICY" title='"A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Session Policies"'>SESSION-POLICY</a>].

   <a href="./rfc5362">RFC 5362</a>, The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Pending Additions
   Event Package (S):  [<a href="./rfc5362" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Pending Additions Event Package"'>RFC5362</a>] defines a SIP event package that allows
      a UA to learn whether consent has been given for the addition of

   Several specifications concern themselves with the interactions of
   SIP with network Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms.

   <a href="./rfc3312">RFC 3312</a>, Integration of Resource Management and SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc3312" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>],
      updated by [<a href="./rfc4032" title='"Update to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Preconditions Framework"'>RFC4032</a>], defines a way to make sure that the phone of
      the called party doesn't ring until a QoS reservation has been
      installed in the network.  It does so by defining a general
      preconditions framework, which defines conditions that must be
      true in order for a SIP session to proceed.

   QoS-ID, Quality of Service (QoS) Mechanism Selection in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) (S):  [<a href="#ref-QoS-ID" title="and G. Camarillo">QoS-ID</a>] defines a way for user
      agents to negotiate what type of end-to-end QoS mechanism to use
      for a session.  At this time, there are two that can be used: the
      Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) and Next Steps in Signaling
      (NSIS).  This negotiation is done through an SDP extension.  Due
      to limited deployment of RSVP and even more limited deployment of
      NSIS, this extension has not been widely used.

   <a href="./rfc3313">RFC 3313</a>, Private SIP Extensions for Media Authorization (I):

      only granted if a client has made a SIP call through the same
      provider's network.  This specification is sometimes referred to
      as the SIP walled-garden specification by the truly paranoid
      androids in the SIP community.  This is because it requires
      coupling of signaling and the underlying IP network.

   <a href="./rfc3524">RFC 3524</a>, Mapping of Media Streams to Resource Reservation Flows
   (S):  [<a href="./rfc3524" title='"Mapping of Media Streams to Resource Reservation Flows"'>RFC3524</a>] defines a usage of the SDP grouping framework for
      indicating that a set of media streams should be handled by a
      single resource reservation.

   Several specifications have been defined to support operations and
   management of SIP systems.  These include mechanisms for
   configuration and network diagnostics.

   CONFIG-FRAME, A Framework for SIP User Agent Profile Delivery (S):
      [<a href="#ref-CONFIG-FRAME" title='"A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol User Agent Profile Delivery"'>CONFIG-FRAME</a>] defines a mechanism that allows a SIP user agent to
      bootstrap its configuration from the network and receive updates
      to its configuration, should it change.  This is considered an
      essential piece of deploying a usable SIP network.

   RTCP-SUM, SIP Event Package for Voice Quality Reporting  (S):
      [<a href="#ref-RTCP-SUM" title='"Session Initiation Protocol Package for Voice Quality Reporting Event"'>RTCP-SUM</a>] defines a SIP event package that enables the collection
      and reporting of metrics that measure the quality for Voice over

   Sigcomp [<a href="./rfc3320" title='"Signaling Compression (SigComp)"'>RFC3320</a>] [<a href="./rfc4896" title='"Signaling Compression (SigComp) Corrections and Clarifications"'>RFC4896</a>] was defined to allow compression of SIP
   messages over low bandwidth links.  Sigcomp is not formally part of
   SIP.  However, usage of Sigcomp with SIP has required extensions to
   SIP.

   <a href="./rfc3486">RFC 3486</a>, Compressing SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc3486" title='"Compressing the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3486</a>] defines a SIP URI parameter
      that can be used to indicate that a SIP server supports Sigcomp.

   <a href="./rfc5049">RFC 5049</a>, Applying Signaling Compression (SigComp) to the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc5049" title='"Applying Signaling Compression (SigComp) to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5049</a>] defines how to apply

   Several extensions define well-known services that can be invoked by
   constructing requests with specific structures for the Request URI,
   resulting in specific behaviors at the User Agent Server (UAS).

      [<a href="./rfc3087" title='"Control of Service Context using SIP Request-URI"'>RFC3087</a>] introduced the context of using Request URIs, encoded
      appropriately, to invoke services.

   <a href="./rfc4662">RFC 4662</a>, A SIP Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists (S):
      [<a href="./rfc4662" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>] defines a resource called a Resource List Server (RLS).
      A client can send a subscribe to this server.  The server will
      generate a series of subscriptions, compile the resulting
      information, and send it back to the subscriber.  The set of
      resources that the RLS will subscribe to is a property of the
      request URI in the SUBSCRIBE request.

   <a href="./rfc5363">RFC 5363</a>, Framework and Security Considerations for Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)-List
   Services (S):  [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI-List Services"'>RFC5363</a>] defines the framework for list services in
      SIP.  In this framework, a UA can include an XML list object in
      the body of various requests and the server will provide list-
      oriented services as a consequence.  For example, a SUBSCRIBE with
      a list subscribes to the URI in the list.

   <a href="./rfc5367">RFC 5367</a>, Subscriptions To Request-Contained Resource Lists in SIP
   (S):  [<a href="./rfc5367" title='"Subscriptions to Request-Contained Resource Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5367</a>] uses the URI-list framework [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI-List Services"'>RFC5363</a>] and allows a
      client to subscribe to a resource called a Resource List Server.
      This server will generate subscriptions to the URI in the list,
      compile the resulting information, and send it back to the
      subscriber.

   <a href="./rfc5365">RFC 5365</a>, Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests in SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc5365" title='"Multiple- Recipient MESSAGE Requests in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5365</a>]
      uses the URI-list framework [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI-List Services"'>RFC5363</a>] and allows a client to send
      a MESSAGE to a number of recipients.

   <a href="./rfc5366">RFC 5366</a>, Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in
   SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc5366" title='"Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5366</a>] uses the URI-list framework [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI-List Services"'>RFC5363</a>].  It allows
      a client to ask the server to act as a conference focus and send
      an invitation to each recipient in the list.

   <a href="./rfc4240">RFC 4240</a>, Basic Network Media Services with SIP (I):  [<a href="./rfc4240" title="and A. Spitzer">RFC4240</a>]
      defines a way for SIP application servers to invoke announcement
      and conferencing services from a media server.  This is
      accomplished through a set of defined URI parameters that tell the
      media server what to do, such as what file to play and what
      language to render it in.

   <a href="./rfc4458">RFC 4458</a>, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URIs for Applications

   These SIP extensions don't fit easily into a single specific use
   case.  They have somewhat general applicability, but they solve a
   relatively small problem or provide an optimization.

   <a href="./rfc4488">RFC 4488</a>, Suppression of the SIP REFER Implicit Subscription (S):
      [<a href="./rfc4488" title='"Suppression of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER Method Implicit Subscription"'>RFC4488</a>] defines an enhancement to REFER.  REFER normally creates
      an implicit subscription to the target of the REFER.  This
      subscription is used to pass back updates on the progress of the
      referral.  This extension allows that implicit subscription to be
      bypassed as an optimization.

   <a href="./rfc4538">RFC 4538</a>, Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in SIP
   (S):  [<a href="./rfc4538" title='"Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4538</a>] provides a mechanism that allows a UAS to authorize a
      request because the requestor proves it knows a dialog that is in
      progress with the UAS.  The specification is useful in conjunction
      with the SIP application interaction framework [<a href="#ref-INTERACT-FRAME" title='"A Framework for Application Interaction in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>INTERACT-FRAME</a>].

   <a href="./rfc4508">RFC 4508</a>, Conveying Feature Tags with the REFER Method in SIP (S):
      [<a href="./rfc4508" title='"Conveying Feature Tags with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER Method"'>RFC4508</a>] defines a mechanism for carrying <a href="./rfc3840">RFC 3840</a> feature tags
      in REFER.  It is useful for informing the target of the REFER
      about the characteristics of the intended target of the referred
      request.

   <a href="./rfc5373">RFC 5373</a>, Requesting Answer Modes for SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc5373" title='"Requesting Answering Modes for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5373</a>] defines an
      extension for indicating to the called party whether or not the
      phone should ring and/or be answered immediately.  This is useful
      for push-to-talk and for diagnostic applications.

   <a href="./rfc5079">RFC 5079</a>, Rejecting Anonymous Requests in SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc5079" title='"Rejecting Anonymous Requests in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5079</a>] defines
      a mechanism for a called party to indicate to the calling party
      that a call was rejected since the caller was anonymous.  This is
      needed for implementation of the Anonymous Call Rejection (ACR)
      feature in SIP.

   <a href="./rfc5368">RFC 5368</a>, Referring to Multiple Resources in SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc5368" title='"Referring to Multiple Resources in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5368</a>]
      allows a UA sending a REFER to ask the recipient of the REFER to
      generate multiple SIP requests, not just one.  This is useful for
      conferencing, where a client would like to ask a conference server
      to eject multiple users.

   <a href="./rfc4483">RFC 4483</a>, A Mechanism for Content Indirection in Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) Messages (S):  [<a href="./rfc4483" title='"A Mechanism for Content Indirection in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Messages"'>RFC4483</a>] defines a mechanism for
      content indirection.  Instead of carrying an object within a SIP
      body, a URL reference is carried instead, and the recipient
      dereferences the URL to obtain the object.  The specification has
      potential applicability for sending large instant messages, but

      that allows for the description of the bandwidth for a media
      session that is independent of the underlying transport mechanism.

   <a href="./rfc4583">RFC 4583</a>, Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor
   Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams (S):  [<a href="./rfc4583" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams"'>RFC4583</a>] defines a mechanism

      for push-to-talk and conference floor control.

   CONNECT-PRECON, Connectivity Preconditions for Session Description
   Protocol Media Streams (S):  [<a href="#ref-CONNECT-PRECON" title='"Connectivity Preconditions for Session Description Protocol Media Streams"'>CONNECT-PRECON</a>] defines a usage of the

      of a media stream.  Examples include a slide view, the speaker, a
      sign language feed, and so on.

   IPv6-TRANS, IPv6 Transition in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   (S):  [<a href="#ref-IPv6-TRANS" title='"IPv6 Transition in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>IPv6-TRANS</a>] defines practices for interworking between IPv6
      and IPv6 user agents.  This is done through multi-homed proxies
      that interwork IPv4 and IPv6, along with ICE [<a href="#ref-ICE" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>ICE</a>] for media
      traversal.  The specification includes some minor extensions and
      clarifications to SDP in order to cover some additional cases.

   CONNECT-REUSE, Connection Reuse in the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) (S):  [<a href="#ref-CONNECT-REUSE" title='"Connection Reuse in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>CONNECT-REUSE</a>] defines an extension to SIP that allows a
      Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection between servers to be
      reused for requests in both directions.  Normally, two connections
      are set up between a pair of servers, one for requests in each
      direction.

   Several extensions provide additional security features to SIP.

   <a href="./rfc4474">RFC 4474</a>, Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in SIP
   (S):  [<a href="./rfc4474" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>] defines a mechanism for providing a cryptographically
      verifiable identity of the calling party in a SIP request.  Known
      as "SIP Identity", this mechanism provides an alternative to <a href="./rfc3325">RFC</a>
      <a href="./rfc3325">3325</a>.  It has seen little deployment so far, but its importance as
      a key construct for anti-spam techniques and new security
      mechanisms makes it a core part of the SIP specifications.

   <a href="./rfc4916">RFC 4916</a>, Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   (S):  [<a href="./rfc4916" title='"Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4916</a>] formally updates <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.  It defines an extension
      to SIP that allows a calling user to determine the identity of the
      final called user (connected party).  Due to forwarding and
      retargeting services, this may not be the same as the user that
      the caller was originally trying to reach.  The mechanism works in
      tandem with the SIP identity specification [<a href="./rfc4474" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>] to provide
      signatures over the connected party identity.  It can also be used
      if a party identity changes mid call due to third party call
      control actions or PSTN behavior.

   SIPS-URI, The Use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) (S):  [<a href="#ref-SIPS-URI" title='"The Use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>SIPS-URI</a>] is intended to update <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.  It
      revises the processing of the SIPS URI, originally defined in <a href="./rfc3261">RFC</a>
      <a href="./rfc3261">3261</a>, to fix many errors and problems that have been encountered
      with that mechanism.

   DOMAIN-CERTS, Domain Certificates in the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) (B):  [<a href="#ref-DOMAIN-CERTS" title='"Domain Certificates in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>DOMAIN-CERTS</a>] clarifies the usage of SIP over TLS with
      regards to certificate handling, and defines additional procedures
      needed for interoperability.

   <a href="./rfc3323">RFC 3323</a>, A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc3323" title='"A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3323</a>] defines the Privacy header field, used by
      clients to request anonymity for their requests.  Though it
      defines several privacy services, the only one broadly used is the
      one that supports privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity header field
      [<a href="./rfc3325" title='"Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks"'>RFC3325</a>].

   <a href="./rfc4567">RFC 4567</a>, Key Management Extensions for Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc4567" title='"Key Management Extensions for Session Description Protocol (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)"'>RFC4567</a>] defines
      extensions to SDP that allow tunneling of a key management
      protocol, namely MIKEY [<a href="./rfc3830" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>], through offer/answer exchanges.
      This mechanism is one of three Secure Realtime Transport Protocol
      (SRTP) keying techniques specified for SIP, with Datagram
      Transport Layer Security (DTLS)-SRTP [<a href="#ref-SRTP-FRAME" title='"Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using DTLS"'>SRTP-FRAME</a>] having been
      selected as the final solution.

   <a href="./rfc4568">RFC 4568</a>, Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions
   for Media Streams (S):  [<a href="./rfc4568" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions for Media Streams"'>RFC4568</a>] defines extensions to SDP that
      allow for the negotiation of keying material directly through
      offer/answer, without a separate key management protocol.  This
      mechanism, sometimes called sdescriptions, has the drawback that
      the media keys are available to any entity that has visibility to
      the SDP.  It is one of three SRTP keying techniques specified for
      SIP, with DTLS-SRTP [<a href="#ref-SRTP-FRAME" title='"Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using DTLS"'>SRTP-FRAME</a>] having been selected as the final
      solution.

   SRTP-FRAME, Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using
   DTLS (S):  [<a href="#ref-SRTP-FRAME" title='"Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using DTLS"'>SRTP-FRAME</a>] defines the overall framework and SDP and SIP
      processing required to perform key management for RTP using
      Datagram TLS (DTLS) [<a href="./rfc4347" title='"Datagram Transport Layer Security"'>RFC4347</a>] directly between endpoints, over the
      media path.  It is one of three SRTP keying techniques specified
      for SIP, with DTLS-SRTP [<a href="#ref-SRTP-FRAME" title='"Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using DTLS"'>SRTP-FRAME</a>] having been selected as the
      final solution.

   <a href="./rfc3853">RFC 3853</a>, S/MIME Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Requirement for
   SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc3853" title='"S/MIME Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Requirement for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3853</a>] formally updates <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.  It is a brief
      specification that updates the cryptography mechanisms used in SIP
      S/MIME.  However, SIP S/MIME has seen very little deployment.

   CERTS, Certificate Management Service for the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) (S):  [<a href="#ref-CERTS" title='"Certificate Management Service for The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>CERTS</a>] defines a certificate service for SIP
      whose purpose is to facilitate the deployment of S/MIME.  The
      certificate service allows clients to store and retrieve their own
      certificates, in addition to obtaining the certificates for other
      users.

   <a href="./rfc3893">RFC 3893</a>, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Authenticated Identity
   Body (AIB) Format (S):  [<a href="./rfc3893" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Authenticated Identity Body (AIB) Format"'>RFC3893</a>] defines a SIP message fragment that
      can be signed in order to provide an authenticated identity over a
      request.  It was an early predecessor to [<a href="./rfc4474" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>], and
      consequently AIB has seen no deployment.

   SAML, SIP SAML Profile and Binding (S):  [<a href="#ref-SAML" title='"SIP SAML Profile and Binding"'>SAML</a>] defines the usage of
      the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) within SIP, and
      describes how to use it in conjunction with SIP identity [<a href="./rfc4474" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>]
      to provide authenticated assertions about a user's role or
      attributes.

   <a href="./rfc5360">RFC 5360</a>, A Framework for Consent-Based Communications in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc5360" title='"A Framework for Consent-Based Communications in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5360</a>] defines several extensions
      to SIP, including the Trigger-Consent and Permission-Missing
      header fields.  These header fields, in addition to the other
      procedures defined in the document, define a way to manage
      membership on "SIP mailing lists" used for instant messaging or
      conferencing.  In particular, it helps avoid the problem of using
      such amplification services for the purposes of an attack on the
      network by making sure a user authorizes the addition of their
      address onto such a service.

   <a href="./rfc5361">RFC 5361</a>, A Document Format for Requesting Consent (S):  [<a href="./rfc5361" title='"A Document Format for Requesting Consent"'>RFC5361</a>]
      defines an XML object used by the consent framework.  Consent
      documents are sent from SIP "mailing list servers" to users to
      allow them to manage their membership on lists.

   <a href="./rfc5362">RFC 5362</a>, The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Pending Additions
   Event Package (S):  [<a href="./rfc5362" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Pending Additions Event Package"'>RFC5362</a>] defines a SIP event package that allows
      a UA to learn whether consent has been given for the addition of
      an address to a SIP "mailing list".  It is used in conjunction
      with the SIP framework for consent [<a href="./rfc5360" title='"A Framework for Consent-Based Communications in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5360</a>].

   <a href="./rfc3329">RFC 3329</a>, Security Mechanism Agreement for SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc3329" title='"Security Mechanism Agreement for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3329</a>]
      defines a mechanism to prevent bid-down attacks in conjunction
      with SIP authentication.  The mechanism has seen very limited
      deployment.  It was defined as part of the 3GPP IP Multimedia
      Subsystem (IMS) specification suite [<a href="#ref-3GPP.24.229" title='"Internet Protocol (IP) multimedia call control protocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP); Stage 3"'>3GPP.24.229</a>], and is needed
      only when there is a multiplicity of security mechanisms deployed
      at a particular server.  In practice, this has not been the case.

   <a href="./rfc4572">RFC 4572</a>, Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) (S):  [<a href="./rfc4572" title='"Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC4572</a>] specifies a mechanism for signaling TLS-based
      media streams between endpoints.  It expands the TCP-based media
      signaling parameters defined in [<a href="./rfc4145" title='"TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC4145</a>] to include fingerprint
      information for TLS streams so that TLS can operate between end
      hosts using self-signed certificates.

   <a href="./rfc5027">RFC 5027</a>, Security Preconditions for Session Description Protocol
   Media Streams (S):  [<a href="./rfc5027" title='"Security Preconditions for Session Description Protocol (SDP) Media Streams"'>RFC5027</a>] defines a precondition for use with the
      preconditions framework [<a href="./rfc3312" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>].  The security precondition
      prevents a session from being established until a security media
      stream is set up.

   <a href="./rfc3310">RFC 3310</a>, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication
   Using Authentication and Key Agreement (S):  [<a href="./rfc3310" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication Using Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA)"'>RFC3310</a>] defines an
      extension to digest authentication to allow it to work with the
      credentials stored in cell phones.  Though technically it is an
      extension to HTTP digest, its primary application is SIP.  This
      extension is useful primarily to implementors of IMS.

   <a href="./rfc4169">RFC 4169</a>, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication
   Using Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) Version-2 (S):
      [<a href="./rfc4169" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication Using Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) Version-2"'>RFC4169</a>] is an enhancement to [<a href="./rfc3310" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication Using Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA)"'>RFC3310</a>] that further improves
      security of the authentication.

   <a href="./rfc4574">RFC 4574</a>, The SDP (Session Description Protocol) Label Attribute
   (S):  [<a href="./rfc4574" title='"The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Label Attribute"'>RFC4574</a>] defines an SDP attribute for providing an opaque
      label for media streams.  These labels can be referred to by
      external documents, and in particular, by conference policy
      documents.  This allows a UA to tie together documents it may
      obtain through conferencing mechanisms to media streams to which
      they refer.

   <a href="./rfc3911">RFC 3911</a>, The SIP Join Header Field (S):  [<a href="./rfc3911" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "'>RFC3911</a>] defines the Join
      header field.  When sent in an INVITE, it causes the recipient to
      join the resulting dialog into a conference with another dialog in
      progress.

   <a href="./rfc4575">RFC 4575</a>, A SIP Event Package for Conference State (S):  [<a href="./rfc4575" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State"'>RFC4575</a>]
      defines a mechanism for learning about changes in conference
      state, including conference membership.

   <a href="./rfc5368">RFC 5368</a>, Referring to Multiple Resources in SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc5368" title='"Referring to Multiple Resources in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5368</a>]
      allows a UA sending a REFER to ask the recipient of the REFER to
      generate multiple SIP requests, not just one.  This is useful for
      conferencing, where a client would like to ask a conference server
      to eject multiple users.

   <a href="./rfc5366">RFC 5366</a>, Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in
   SIP (S):  [<a href="./rfc5366" title='"Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5366</a>] is similar to [<a href="./rfc5367" title='"Subscriptions to Request-Contained Resource Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5367</a>].  However, instead of
      subscribing to the resource, an INVITE request is sent to the
      resource, and it will act as a conference focus and generate an
      invitation to each recipient in the list.

   <a href="./rfc4579">RFC4579</a>, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Call Control -
   Conferencing for User Agents (B):  [<a href="./rfc4579" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Call Control - Conferencing for User Agents"'>RFC4579</a>] defines best practice
      procedures and call flows for conferencing.  This includes
      conference creation, joining, and dial out, amongst other
      capabilities.

   <a href="./rfc4583">RFC 4583</a>, Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor
   Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams (S):  [<a href="./rfc4583" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams"'>RFC4583</a>] defines a mechanism

      [<a href="./rfc3857" title='"A Watcher Information Event Template-Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3857</a>], also known as winfo, provides a mechanism for a user
      agent to find out what subscriptions are in place for a particular
      event package.  Its primary usage is with presence, but it can be
      used with any event package.
