Abstract

   This document defines the topology naming conventions that are to be
   used in reference to Internet Emergency Preparedness (IEPREP) phone
   calls.  These naming conventions should be used to focus the IEPREP
   Working Group during discussions and when writing requirements, gap
   analysis and other solutions documents.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document defines the topology naming conventions that are to be
   used in reference to IEPREP phone calls.  These naming conventions
   should be used to focus the IEPREP Working Group (WG) during
   discussions and  when writing requirements, gap analysis and other
   solutions documents.

   There has been much confusion on the IEPREP list as well as within
   each meeting about the topologies IEPREP is considering.  Hopefully
   this document will give each reader and author a reference set of
   named architectures.

   This memo attempts to be agnostic with regard to IP signaling or
   control protocols (SIP, MEGACO, etc), as well as any underlying
   Quality of Service (QOS) mechanisms (Diffserv, RSVP, NSIS, etc).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1%20Motivation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a> Motivation</span>

   Simply put, to get everyone referencing the same (named) topologies
   in order to have useful and less confusing dialog to further this
   working group's efforts.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2%20Terms%20and%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a> Terms and Definitions</span>

   The following acronyms need to be exploded for clarity:

      CSN = Circuit Switched Network

      GW  = Gateway (CSN to IP, or IP to CSN)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20IEPREP%20Topologies"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  IEPREP Topologies</span>

   There are 4 often mentioned, but very little documented topologies
   discussed within this WG's efforts so far.  The following subsections
   name and describe each of the topologies.

   The 4 topologies are (quickly):

      Topology "IP Bridging"

      Topology "IP at the Start"

      Topology "IP at the End"

      Topology "End-to-End IP"

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3523">RFC 3523</a>                        IEPREP                        April 2003</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1%20Topology%20%22IP%20Bridging%22"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a> Topology "IP Bridging"</span>

   This topology is sometimes known as "IP in the Middle" of two CSNs.
   In this topology, a CSN phone of any type initiates (dials) a call to
   another CSN phone with an IP core between the two CSNs.

   This topology should simplistically look like this:

    Circuit                      Internet                    Circuit
    Switched         IP            or              IP        Switched
    Network        Ingress      IP Segment       Egress      Network
   -----------+              +--------------+              +-----------
              |    +----+    |     IP       |    +----+    |
      CSN     |    |    |    |              |    |    |    |     CSN
     Phone -------&gt;| GW |-----------------------&gt;| GW |--------&gt;Phone
              |    |    |    |              |    |    |    |
              |    +----+    |              |    +----+    |
   -----------+              +--------------+              +-----------

   This topology has the initiating party placing (dialing) the call
   from an IP Phone (PDA or computer), and the called party residing in
   the CSN.

        Internet                             Circuit

   This topology has the calling party placing the call from a CSN
   phone, and the called party being in an IP network.

     Circuit                               Internet

                    Figure 4. Topology "End to End IP"

   Although shown as one large IP cloud here, the Internet is composed
   of a series of loosely connected IP domains.  An End-to-End IP call
   will likely traverse a number of these domains and/or multiple
   network providers, which may impact the call.
