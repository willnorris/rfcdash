Abstract

   This document specifies the gopher Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme that was originally specified in <a href="./rfc1738">RFC 1738</a>.  The purpose of
   this document is to allow <a href="./rfc1738">RFC 1738</a> to be made obsolete while keeping
   the information about the scheme on standards track.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   URIs were previously defined in <a href="./rfc2396">RFC 2396</a> [<a href="./rfc2396" title='"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC2396</a>], which was updated
   by <a href="./rfc3986">RFC 3986</a> [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].  Those documents also specify how to define
   schemes for URIs.

   The first definition for many URI schemes appeared in <a href="./rfc1738">RFC 1738</a>
   [<a href="./rfc1738" title='"Uniform Resource Locators (URL)"'>RFC1738</a>].  Because that document has been made obsolete, this
   document copies the gopher URI scheme from it to allow that material
   to remain on standards track.

   The gopher URL scheme is used to designate Internet resources
   accessible using the Gopher protocol.

   The base Gopher protocol is described in <a href="./rfc1436">RFC 1436</a> [<a href="./rfc1436" title='"The Internet Gopher Protocol (a distributed document search and retrieval protocol)"'>RFC1436</a>] and
   supports items and collections of items (directories).  The Gopher+
   protocol is a set of upward-compatible extensions to the base Gopher
   protocol and is described in [Gopher+].  Gopher+ supports associating

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4266">RFC 4266</a>                 The gopher URI Scheme             November 2005</span>


   arbitrary sets of attributes and alternate data representations with
   Gopher items.  Gopher URLs accommodate both Gopher and Gopher+ items
   and item attributes.

   Historical note: The Gopher protocol was widely implemented in the
   early 1990s, but few Gopher servers are in use today.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Gopher%20URL%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Gopher URL Syntax</span>

   A Gopher URL takes the form:

      gopher://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;gopher-path&gt;

   where &lt;gopher-path&gt; is one of:

      &lt;gophertype&gt;&lt;selector&gt;
      &lt;gophertype&gt;&lt;selector&gt;%09&lt;search&gt;
      &lt;gophertype&gt;&lt;selector&gt;%09&lt;search&gt;%09&lt;gopher+_string&gt;

   If :&lt;port&gt; is omitted, the port defaults to 70. &lt;gophertype&gt; is a
   single-character field to denote the Gopher type of the resource to
   which the URL refers.  The entire &lt;gopher-path&gt; may also be empty, in
   which case the delimiting "/" is also optional and the &lt;gophertype&gt;
   defaults to "1".

   &lt;selector&gt; is the Gopher selector string.  In the Gopher protocol,
   Gopher selector strings are a sequence of octets that may contain any
   octets except 09 hexadecimal (US-ASCII HT or tab), 0A hexadecimal
   (US-ASCII character LF), and 0D (US-ASCII character CR).

   Gopher clients specify which item to retrieve by sending the Gopher
   selector string to a Gopher server.

   Within the &lt;gopher-path&gt;, no characters are reserved.

   Note that some Gopher &lt;selector&gt; strings begin with a copy of the
   &lt;gophertype&gt; character, in which case that character will occur twice
   consecutively.  The Gopher selector string may be an empty string;
   this is how Gopher clients refer to the top-level directory on a
   Gopher server.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Specifying%20URLs%20for%20Gopher%20Search%20Engines"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Specifying URLs for Gopher Search Engines</span>

   If the URL refers to a search to be submitted to a Gopher search
   engine, the selector is followed by an encoded tab (%09) and the
   search string.  To submit a search to a Gopher search engine, the
   Gopher client sends the &lt;selector&gt; string (after decoding), a tab,
   and the search string to the Gopher server.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4266">RFC 4266</a>                 The gopher URI Scheme             November 2005</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20URL%20Syntax%20for%20Gopher%2B%20Items"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  URL Syntax for Gopher+ Items</span>

   Historical note: Gopher+ was uncommon even when Gopher was popular.

   URLs for Gopher+ items have a second encoded tab (%09) and a Gopher+
   string.  Note that in this case, the %09&lt;search&gt; string must be
   supplied, although the &lt;search&gt; element may be the empty string.

   The &lt;gopher+_string&gt; is used to represent information required for
   retrieval of the Gopher+ item.  Gopher+ items may have alternate
   views and arbitrary sets of attributes, and they may have electronic
   forms associated with them.

   To retrieve the data associated with a Gopher+ URL, a client will
   connect to the server and send the Gopher selector, followed by a tab
   and the search string (which may be empty), followed by a tab and the
   Gopher+ commands.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20Default%20Gopher%2B%20Data%20Representation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Default Gopher+ Data Representation</span>

   When a Gopher server returns a directory listing to a client, the
   Gopher+ items are tagged with either a "+" (denoting Gopher+ items)
   or a "?" (denoting Gopher+ items that have a +ASK form associated
   with them).  A Gopher URL with a Gopher+ string consisting of only a
   "+" refers to the default view (data representation) of the item, and
   a Gopher+ string containing only a "?" refers to an item with a
   Gopher electronic form associated with it.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.%20%20Gopher%2B%20Items%20with%20Electronic%20Forms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5" id="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Gopher+ Items with Electronic Forms</span>

   Gopher+ items that have a +ASK associated with them (i.e., Gopher+
   items tagged with a "?") require the client to fetch the item's +ASK
   attribute to get the form definition, and then ask the user to fill
   out the form and return the user's responses along with the selector
   string to retrieve the item.  Gopher+ clients know how to do this but
   depend on the "?" tag in the Gopher+ item description to know when to
   handle this case.  The "?" is used in the Gopher+ string to be
   consistent with Gopher+ protocol's use of this symbol.

   To refer to the Gopher+ attributes of an item, the Gopher URL's
   Gopher+ string consists of "!" or "$". "!" refers to all of a Gopher+
   item's attributes. "$" refers to all the item attributes for all
   items in a Gopher directory.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4266">RFC 4266</a>                 The gopher URI Scheme             November 2005</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.7.%20%20Referring%20to%20Specific%20Gopher%2B%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7" id="section-2.7">2.7</a>.  Referring to Specific Gopher+ Attributes</span>

   To refer to specific attributes, the URL's gopher+_string is
   "!&lt;attribute_name&gt;" or "$&lt;attribute_name&gt;".  For example, to refer to
   the attribute containing the abstract of an item, the gopher+_string
   would be "!+ABSTRACT".

   To refer to several attributes, the gopher+_string consists of the
   attribute names separated by coded spaces.  For example,
   "!+ABSTRACT% 20+SMELL" refers to the +ABSTRACT and +SMELL attributes
   of an item.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.8.%20%20URL%20Syntax%20for%20Gopher%2B%20Alternate%20Views"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.8" id="section-2.8">2.8</a>.  URL Syntax for Gopher+ Alternate Views</span>

   Gopher+ allows for optional alternate data representations (alternate
   views) of items.  To retrieve a Gopher+ alternate view, a Gopher+
   client sends the appropriate view and language identifier (found in
   the item's +VIEW attribute).  To refer to a specific Gopher+
   alternate view, the URL's Gopher+ string would be in the form:

      +&lt;view_name&gt;%20&lt;language_name&gt;

   For example, a Gopher+ string of "+application/postscript%20Es_ES"
   refers to the Spanish language postscript alternate view of a Gopher+
   item.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.9.%20%20URL%20Syntax%20for%20Gopher%2B%20Electronic%20Forms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.9" id="section-2.9">2.9</a>.  URL Syntax for Gopher+ Electronic Forms</span>

   The gopher+_string for a URL that refers to an item referenced by a
   Gopher+ electronic form (an ASK block) filled out with specific
   values is a coded version of what the client sends to the server.
   The gopher+_string is of the form:

      +%091%0D%0A+-1%0D%0A&lt;ask_item1_value&gt;%0D%0A
      &lt;ask_item2_value&gt;%0D%0A.%0D%0A

   To retrieve this item, the Gopher client sends the following text to
   the Gopher server.

      &lt;a_gopher_selector&gt;&lt;tab&gt;+&lt;tab&gt;1&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;
      +-1&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;
      &lt;ask_item1_value&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;
      &lt;ask_item2_value&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;
      .&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;

   There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
   [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].  The Gopher protocol uses passwords in the clear for
   authentication, and offers no privacy, both of which are considered
   extremely unsafe in current practice.
