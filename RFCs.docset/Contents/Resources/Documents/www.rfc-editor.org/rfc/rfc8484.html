<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document defines a specific protocol, DNS over HTTPS (DoH), for
   sending DNS [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>] queries and getting DNS responses over HTTP
   [<a href="./rfc7540" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>] using https [<a href="./rfc2818" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>RFC2818</a>] URIs (and therefore TLS [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>]
   security for integrity and confidentiality).  Each DNS query-response
   pair is mapped into an HTTP exchange.

   The described approach is more than a tunnel over HTTP.  It
   establishes default media formatting types for requests and responses
   but uses normal HTTP content negotiation mechanisms for selecting
   alternatives that endpoints may prefer in anticipation of serving new
   use cases.  In addition to this media type negotiation, it aligns
   itself with HTTP features such as caching, redirection, proxying,
   authentication, and compression.

   The integration with HTTP provides a transport suitable for both
   existing DNS clients and native web applications seeking access to
   the DNS.

   Two primary use cases were considered during this protocol's
   development.  These use cases are preventing on-path devices from
   interfering with DNS operations, and also allowing web applications
   to access DNS information via existing browser APIs in a safe way
   consistent with Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [<a href="#ref-FETCH" title='"Fetch Living Standard"'>FETCH</a>].  No
   special effort has been taken to enable or prevent application to
   other use cases.  This document focuses on communication between DNS
   clients (such as operating system stub resolvers) and recursive
   resolvers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   A server that supports this protocol is called a "DoH server" to
   differentiate it from a "DNS server" (one that only provides DNS
   service over one or more of the other transport protocols
   standardized for DNS).  Similarly, a client that supports this
   protocol is called a "DoH client".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8484">RFC 8484</a>              DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)          October 2018</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Selection%20of%20DoH%20Server"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Selection of DoH Server</span>

   The DoH client is configured with a URI Template [<a href="./rfc6570" title='"URI Template"'>RFC6570</a>], which
   describes how to construct the URL to use for resolution.
   Configuration, discovery, and updating of the URI Template is done
   out of band from this protocol.  Note that configuration might be
   manual (such as a user typing URI Templates in a user interface for
   "options") or automatic (such as URI Templates being supplied in
   responses from DHCP or similar protocols).  DoH servers MAY support
   more than one URI Template.  This allows the different endpoints to
   have different properties, such as different authentication
   requirements or service-level guarantees.

   A DoH client uses configuration to select the URI, and thus the DoH
   server, that is to be used for resolution.  [<a href="./rfc2818" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>RFC2818</a>] defines how
   HTTPS verifies the DoH server's identity.

   A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI simply because it was
   discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through
   HTTP/2 server push) or because a server offers an unsolicited
   response that appears to be a valid answer to a DNS query.  This
   specification does not extend DNS resolution privileges to URIs that
   are not recognized by the DoH client as configured URIs.  Such
   scenarios may create additional operational, tracking, and security
   hazards that require limitations for safe usage.  A future
   specification may support this use case.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20HTTP%20Exchange"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The HTTP Exchange</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20The%20HTTP%20Request"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  The HTTP Request</span>

   A DoH client encodes a single DNS query into an HTTP request using
   either the HTTP GET or POST method and the other requirements of this
   section.  The DoH server defines the URI used by the request through
   the use of a URI Template.

   The URI Template defined in this document is processed without any
   variables when the HTTP method is POST.  When the HTTP method is GET,
   the single variable "dns" is defined as the content of the DNS
   request (as described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>), encoded with base64url
   [<a href="./rfc4648" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>RFC4648</a>].

   Future specifications for new media types for DoH MUST define the
   variables used for URI Template processing with this protocol.

   DoH servers MUST implement both the POST and GET methods.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8484">RFC 8484</a>              DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)          October 2018</span>


   When using the POST method, the DNS query is included as the message
   body of the HTTP request, and the Content-Type request header field
   indicates the media type of the message.  POSTed requests are
   generally smaller than their GET equivalents.

   Using the GET method is friendlier to many HTTP cache
   implementations.

   The DoH client SHOULD include an HTTP Accept request header field to
   indicate what type of content can be understood in response.
   Irrespective of the value of the Accept request header field, the
   client MUST be prepared to process "application/dns-message" (as
   described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>) responses but MAY also process other DNS-
   related media types it receives.

   In order to maximize HTTP cache friendliness, DoH clients using media
   formats that include the ID field from the DNS message header, such
   as "application/dns-message", SHOULD use a DNS ID of 0 in every DNS
   request.  HTTP correlates the request and response, thus eliminating
   the need for the ID in a media type such as "application/dns-
   message".  The use of a varying DNS ID can cause semantically
   equivalent DNS queries to be cached separately.

   DoH clients can use HTTP/2 padding and compression [<a href="./rfc7540" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>] in the
   same way that other HTTP/2 clients use (or don't use) them.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.1.%20%20HTTP%20Request%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1" id="section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  HTTP Request Examples</span>

   These examples use HTTP/2-style formatting from [<a href="./rfc7540" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>].

   These examples use a DoH service with a URI Template of
   "https://dnsserver.example.net/dns-query{?dns}" to resolve IN A
   records.

   The requests are represented as bodies with media type "application/
   dns-message".

   The first example request uses GET to request "www.example.com".

   :method = GET
   :scheme = https
   :authority = dnsserver.example.net
   :path = /dns-query?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dwdleGFtcGxlA2NvbQAAAQAB
   accept = application/dns-message

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8484">RFC 8484</a>              DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)          October 2018</span>


   The same DNS query for "www.example.com", using the POST method would
   be:

   :method = POST
   :scheme = https
   :authority = dnsserver.example.net
   :path = /dns-query
   accept = application/dns-message
   content-type = application/dns-message
   content-length = 33

   &lt;33 bytes represented by the following hex encoding&gt;
   00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 03 77 77 77
   07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65  03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00
   01

   In this example, the 33 bytes are the DNS message in DNS wire format
   [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>], starting with the DNS header.

   Finally, a GET-based query for "a.62characterlabel-makes-base64url-
   distinct-from-standard-base64.example.com" is shown as an example to
   emphasize that the encoding alphabet of base64url is different than
   regular base64 and that padding is omitted.

   The DNS query, expressed in DNS wire format, is 94 bytes represented
   by the following:

   00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 01 61 3e 36
   32 63 68 61 72 61 63 74  65 72 6c 61 62 65 6c 2d

   61 6d 70 6c 65 03 63 6f  6d 00 00 01 00 01

   :method = GET
   :scheme = https
   :authority = dnsserver.example.net
   :path = /dns-query? (no space or Carriage Return (CR))

   The only response type defined in this document is "application/dns-
   message", but it is possible that other response formats will be
   defined in the future.  A DoH server MUST be able to process
   "application/dns-message" request messages.

   Different response media types will provide more or less information
   from a DNS response.  For example, one response type might include
   information from the DNS header bytes while another might omit it.
   The amount and type of information that a media type gives are solely
   up to the format, which is not defined in this protocol.

   Each DNS request-response pair is mapped to one HTTP exchange.  The
   responses may be processed and transported in any order using HTTP's
   multi-streaming functionality (see <a href="./rfc7540#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC7540]</a>).

   <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> discusses the relationship between DNS and HTTP response
   caching.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.1.%20%20Handling%20DNS%20and%20HTTP%20Errors"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1" id="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Handling DNS and HTTP Errors</span>

   DNS response codes indicate either success or failure for the DNS
   query.  A successful HTTP response with a 2xx status code (see
   <a href="./rfc7231#section-6.3">Section 6.3 of [RFC7231]</a>) is used for any valid DNS response,
   regardless of the DNS response code.  For example, a successful 2xx
   HTTP status code is used even with a DNS message whose DNS response
   code indicates failure, such as SERVFAIL or NXDOMAIN.

   HTTP responses with non-successful HTTP status codes do not contain
   replies to the original DNS question in the HTTP request.  DoH
   clients need to use the same semantic processing of non-successful
   HTTP status codes as other HTTP clients.  This might mean that the
   DoH client retries the query with the same DoH server, such as if
   there are authorization failures (HTTP status code 401; see
   <a href="./rfc7235#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC7235]</a>).  It could also mean that the DoH client
   retries with a different DoH server, such as for unsupported media
   types (HTTP status code 415; see <a href="./rfc7231#section-6.5.13">Section 6.5.13 of [RFC7231]</a>), or
   where the server cannot generate a representation suitable for the
   client (HTTP status code 406; see <a href="./rfc7231#section-6.5.6">Section 6.5.6 of [RFC7231]</a>), and so
   on.

   A DoH exchange can pass through a hierarchy of caches that include
   both HTTP- and DNS-specific caches.  These caches may exist between
   the DoH server and client, or they may exist on the DoH client
   itself.  HTTP caches are generic by design; that is, they do not
   understand this protocol.  Even if a DoH client has modified its
   cache implementation to be aware of DoH semantics, it does not follow
   that all upstream caches (for example, inline proxies, server-side
   gateways, and content delivery networks) will be.

   As a result, DoH servers need to carefully consider the HTTP caching
   metadata they send in response to GET requests (responses to POST
   requests are not cacheable unless specific response header fields are
   sent; this is not widely implemented and is not advised for DoH).

   In particular, DoH servers SHOULD assign an explicit HTTP freshness
   lifetime (see <a href="./rfc7234#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of [RFC7234]</a>) so that the DoH client is
   more likely to use fresh DNS data.  This requirement is due to HTTP
   caches being able to assign their own heuristic freshness (such as
   that described in <a href="./rfc7234#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]</a>), which would take
   control of the cache contents out of the hands of the DoH server.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8484">RFC 8484</a>              DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)          October 2018</span>


   The assigned freshness lifetime of a DoH HTTP response MUST be less
   than or equal to the smallest TTL in the Answer section of the DNS
   response.  A freshness lifetime equal to the smallest TTL in the
   Answer section is RECOMMENDED.  For example, if a HTTP response
   carries three RRsets with TTLs of 30, 600, and 300, the HTTP
   freshness lifetime should be 30 seconds (which could be specified as
   "Cache-Control: max-age=30").  This requirement helps prevent expired
   RRsets in messages in an HTTP cache from unintentionally being
   served.

   If the DNS response has no records in the Answer section, and the DNS
   response has an SOA record in the Authority section, the response
   freshness lifetime MUST NOT be greater than the MINIMUM field from
   that SOA record (see [<a href="./rfc2308" title='"Negative Caching of DNS Queries (DNS NCACHE)"'>RFC2308</a>]).

   The stale-while-revalidate and stale-if-error Cache-Control
   directives [<a href="./rfc5861" title='"HTTP Cache-Control Extensions for Stale Content"'>RFC5861</a>] could be well suited to a DoH implementation
   when allowed by server policy.  Those mechanisms allow a client, at
   the server's discretion, to reuse an HTTP cache entry that is no
   longer fresh.  In such a case, the client reuses either all of a
   cached entry or none of it.

   DoH servers also need to consider HTTP caching when generating
   responses that are not globally valid.  For instance, if a DoH server
   customizes a response based on the client's identity, it would not
   want to allow global reuse of that response.  This could be
   accomplished through a variety of HTTP techniques, such as a Cache-
   Control max-age of 0, or by using the Vary response header field (see
   <a href="./rfc7231#section-7.1.4">Section 7.1.4 of [RFC7231]</a>) to establish a secondary cache key (see
   <a href="./rfc7234#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of [RFC7234]</a>).

   DoH clients MUST account for the Age response header field's value
   [<a href="./rfc7234" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching"'>RFC7234</a>] when calculating the DNS TTL of a response.  For example,
   if an RRset is received with a DNS TTL of 600, but the Age header
   field indicates that the response has been cached for 250 seconds,
   the remaining lifetime of the RRset is 350 seconds.  This requirement
   applies to both DoH client HTTP caches and DoH client DNS caches.

   DoH clients can request an uncached copy of a HTTP response by using
   the "no-cache" request Cache-Control directive (see <a href="./rfc7234#section-5.2.1.4">Section 5.2.1.4
   of [RFC7234]</a>) and similar controls.  Note that some caches might not
   honor these directives, either due to configuration or interaction
   with traditional DNS caches that do not have such a mechanism.

   HTTP conditional requests [<a href="./rfc7232" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests"'>RFC7232</a>] may be of limited value to DoH,
   as revalidation provides only a bandwidth benefit and DNS
   transactions are normally latency bound.  Furthermore, the HTTP
   response header fields that enable revalidation (such as "Last-

   Modified" and "Etag") are often fairly large when compared to the
   overall DNS response size and have a variable nature that creates
   constant pressure on the HTTP/2 compression dictionary [<a href="./rfc7541" title='"HPACK: Header Compression for HTTP/2"'>RFC7541</a>].
   Other types of DNS data, such as zone transfers, may be larger and
   benefit more from revalidation.

   HTTP/2 [<a href="./rfc7540" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>] is the minimum RECOMMENDED version of HTTP for use
   with DoH.

   The messages in classic UDP-based DNS [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>] are inherently
   unordered and have low overhead.  A competitive HTTP transport needs
   to support reordering, parallelism, priority, and header compression
   to achieve similar performance.  Those features were introduced to
   HTTP in HTTP/2 [<a href="./rfc7540" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>].  Earlier versions of HTTP are capable of
   conveying the semantic requirements of DoH but may result in very
   poor performance.

   Before using DoH response data for DNS resolution, the client MUST
   establish that the HTTP request URI can be used for the DoH query.
   For HTTP requests initiated by the DoH client, this is implicit in
   the selection of URI.  For HTTP server push (see <a href="./rfc7540#section-8.2">Section 8.2 of
   [RFC7540]</a>), extra care must be taken to ensure that the pushed URI is
   one that the client would have directed the same query to if the
   client had initiated the request (in addition to the other security
   checks normally needed for server push).

   In order to maximize interoperability, DoH clients and DoH servers
   MUST support the "application/dns-message" media type.  Other media
   types MAY be used as defined by HTTP Content Negotiation (see
   <a href="./rfc7231#section-3.4">Section 3.4 of [RFC7231]</a>).  Those media types MUST be flexible enough
   to express every DNS query that would normally be sent in DNS over
   UDP (including queries and responses that use DNS extensions, but not
   those that require multiple responses).

   The data payload for the "application/dns-message" media type is a

   Note that the wire format used in this media type is different than

   [<a id="ref-RFC7626">RFC7626</a>] discusses DNS privacy considerations in both "on the wire"
   (<a href="./rfc7626#section-2.4">Section 2.4 of [RFC7626]</a>) and "in the server" (<a href="./rfc7626#section-2.5">Section 2.5 of

   DoH encrypts DNS traffic and requires authentication of the server.
   This mitigates both passive surveillance [<a href="./rfc7258" title='"Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack"'>RFC7258</a>] and active attacks
   that attempt to divert DNS traffic to rogue servers (see
   <a href="./rfc7626#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1 of [RFC7626]</a>).  DNS over TLS [<a href="./rfc7858" title='"Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC7858</a>] provides similar
   protections, while direct UDP- and TCP-based transports are
   vulnerable to this class of attack.  An experimental effort to offer
   guidance on choosing the padding length can be found in [<a href="./rfc8467" title='"Padding Policies for Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))"'>RFC8467</a>].

   Additionally, the use of the HTTPS default port 443 and the ability
   to mix DoH traffic with other HTTPS traffic on the same connection
   can deter unprivileged on-path devices from interfering with DNS
   operations and make DNS traffic analysis more difficult.

   The DNS wire format [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>] contains no client identifiers;
   however, various transports of DNS queries and responses do provide
   data that can be used to correlate requests.  HTTPS presents new
   considerations for correlation, such as explicit HTTP cookies and
   implicit fingerprinting of the unique set and ordering of HTTP
   request header fields.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8484">RFC 8484</a>              DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)          October 2018</span>


   A DoH implementation is built on IP, TCP, TLS, and HTTP.  Each layer
   contains one or more common features that can be used to correlate
   queries to the same identity.  DNS transports will generally carry
   the same privacy properties of the layers used to implement them.
   For example, the properties of IP, TCP, and TLS apply to
   implementations of DNS over TLS.

   The privacy considerations of using the HTTPS layer in DoH are
   incremental to those of DNS over TLS.  DoH is not known to introduce
   new concerns beyond those associated with HTTPS.

   At the IP level, the client address provides obvious correlation
   information.  This can be mitigated by use of a NAT, proxy, VPN, or
   simple address rotation over time.  It may be aggravated by use of a
   DNS server that can correlate real-time addressing information with
   other personal identifiers, such as when a DNS server and DHCP server
   are operated by the same entity.

   DNS implementations that use one TCP connection for multiple DNS
   requests directly group those requests.  Long-lived connections have
   better performance behaviors than short-lived connections; however,
   they group more requests, which can expose more information to
   correlation and consolidation.  TCP-based solutions may also seek
   performance through the use of TCP Fast Open [<a href="./rfc7413" title='"TCP Fast Open"'>RFC7413</a>].  The cookies
   used in TCP Fast Open allow servers to correlate TCP sessions.

   TLS-based implementations often achieve better handshake performance
   through the use of some form of session resumption mechanism, such as
   <a href="./rfc8446#section-2.2">Section 2.2 of [RFC8446]</a>.  Session resumption creates trivial
   mechanisms for a server to correlate TLS connections together.

   HTTP's feature set can also be used for identification and tracking
   in a number of different ways.  For example, Authentication request
   header fields explicitly identify profiles in use, and HTTP cookies
   are designed as an explicit state-tracking mechanism between the
   client and serving site and often are used as an authentication
   mechanism.

   Additionally, the User-Agent and Accept-Language request header
   fields often convey specific information about the client version or
   locale.  This facilitates content negotiation and operational work-
   arounds for implementation bugs.  Request header fields that control
   caching can expose state information about a subset of the client's
   history.  Mixing DoH requests with other HTTP requests on the same
   connection also provides an opportunity for richer data correlation.

   The DoH protocol design allows applications to fully leverage the
   HTTP ecosystem, including features that are not enumerated here.
   Utilizing the full set of HTTP features enables DoH to be more than
   an HTTP tunnel, but it is at the cost of opening up implementations
   to the full set of privacy considerations of HTTP.

   Implementations of DoH clients and servers need to consider the
   benefit and privacy impact of these features, and their deployment
   context, when deciding whether or not to enable them.
   Implementations are advised to expose the minimal set of data needed
   to achieve the desired feature set.

   Determining whether or not a DoH implementation requires HTTP cookie
   [<a href="./rfc6265" title='"HTTP State Management Mechanism"'>RFC6265</a>] support is particularly important because HTTP cookies are
   the primary state tracking mechanism in HTTP.  HTTP cookies SHOULD
   NOT be accepted by DOH clients unless they are explicitly required by
   a use case.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Running DNS over HTTPS relies on the security of the underlying HTTP
   transport.  This mitigates classic amplification attacks for UDP-
   based DNS.  Implementations utilizing HTTP/2 benefit from the TLS
   profile defined in <a href="./rfc7540#section-9.2">Section 9.2 of [RFC7540]</a>.

   Session-level encryption has well-known weaknesses with respect to
   traffic analysis, which might be particularly acute when dealing with
   DNS queries.  HTTP/2 provides further advice about the use of
   compression (see <a href="./rfc7540#section-10.6">Section 10.6 of [RFC7540]</a>) and padding (see
   <a href="./rfc7540#section-10.7">Section 10.7 of [RFC7540]</a>).  DoH servers can also add DNS padding
   [<a href="./rfc7830" title='"The EDNS(0) Padding Option"'>RFC7830</a>] if the DoH client requests it in the DNS query.  An
   experimental effort to offer guidance on choosing the padding length
   can be found in [<a href="./rfc8467" title='"Padding Policies for Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))"'>RFC8467</a>].

   The HTTPS connection provides transport security for the interaction
   between the DoH server and client, but it does not provide the
   response integrity of DNS data provided by DNSSEC.  DNSSEC and DoH
   are independent and fully compatible protocols, each solving
   different problems.  The use of one does not diminish the need nor
   the usefulness of the other.  It is the choice of a client to either
   perform full DNSSEC validation of answers or to trust the DoH server
   to do DNSSEC validation and inspect the AD (Authentic Data) bit in
   the returned message to determine whether an answer was authentic or
   not.  As noted in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>, different response media types will
   provide more or less information from a DNS response, so this choice
   may be affected by the response media type.

   <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> describes the interaction of this protocol with HTTP
   caching.  An adversary that can control the cache used by the client
   can affect that client's view of the DNS.  This is no different than
   the security implications of HTTP caching for other protocols that
   use HTTP.

   In the absence of DNSSEC information, a DoH server can give a client
   invalid data in response to a DNS query.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> disallows the use
   of DoH DNS responses that do not originate from configured servers.
   This prohibition does not guarantee protection against invalid data,
   but it does reduce the risk.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.%20%20Operational%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" id="section-10">10</a>.  Operational Considerations</span>

   Local policy considerations and similar factors mean different DNS
   servers may provide different results to the same query, for
   instance, in split DNS configurations [<a href="./rfc6950" title='"Architectural Considerations on Application Features in the DNS"'>RFC6950</a>].  It logically
   follows that the server that is queried can influence the end result.
   Therefore, a client's choice of DNS server may affect the responses
   it gets to its queries.  For example, in the case of DNS64 [<a href="./rfc6147" title='"DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6147</a>],
   the choice could affect whether IPv6/IPv4 translation will work at
   all.

   The HTTPS channel used by this specification establishes secure two-
   party communication between the DoH client and the DoH server.
   Filtering or inspection systems that rely on unsecured transport of
   DNS will not function in a DNS over HTTPS environment due to the
   confidentiality and integrity protection provided by TLS.

   Some HTTPS client implementations perform real time third-party
   checks of the revocation status of the certificates being used by
   TLS.  If this check is done as part of the DoH server connection
   procedure and the check itself requires DNS resolution to connect to
   the third party, a deadlock can occur.  The use of Online Certificate
   Status Protocol (OCSP) [<a href="./rfc6960" title='"X.509 Internet Public Key Infrastructure Online Certificate Status Protocol - OCSP"'>RFC6960</a>] servers or Authority Information
   Access (AIA) for Certificate Revocation List (CRL) fetching (see
   <a href="./rfc5280#section-4.2.2.1">Section 4.2.2.1 of [RFC5280]</a>) are examples of how this deadlock can
   happen.  To mitigate the possibility of deadlock, the authentication
   given DoH servers SHOULD NOT rely on DNS-based references to external
   resources in the TLS handshake.  For OCSP, the server can bundle the
   certificate status as part of the handshake using a mechanism
   appropriate to the version of TLS, such as using <a href="./rfc8446#section-4.4.2.1">Section 4.4.2.1 of
   [RFC8446]</a> for TLS version 1.3.  AIA deadlocks can be avoided by
   providing intermediate certificates that might otherwise be obtained
   through additional requests.  Note that these deadlocks also need to
   be considered for servers that a DoH server might redirect to.

   A DoH client may face a similar bootstrapping problem when the HTTP
   request needs to resolve the hostname portion of the DNS URI.  Just
   as the address of a traditional DNS nameserver cannot be originally
   determined from that same server, a DoH client cannot use its DoH
   server to initially resolve the server's host name into an address.
   Alternative strategies a client might employ include 1) making the
   initial resolution part of the configuration, 2) IP-based URIs and
   corresponding IP-based certificates for HTTPS, or 3) resolving the
   DNS API server's hostname via traditional DNS or another DoH server
   while still authenticating the resulting connection via HTTPS.

   HTTP [<a href="./rfc7230" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>] is a stateless application-level protocol, and
   therefore DoH implementations do not provide stateful ordering
   guarantees between different requests.  DoH cannot be used as a
   transport for other protocols that require strict ordering.

   A DoH server is allowed to answer queries with any valid DNS
   response.  For example, a valid DNS response might have the TC
   (truncation) bit set in the DNS header to indicate that the server
   was not able to retrieve a full answer for the query but is providing
   the best answer it could get.  A DoH server can reply to queries with
   an HTTP error for queries that it cannot fulfill.  In this same
   example, a DoH server could use an HTTP error instead of a non-error
   response that has the TC bit set.

   Many extensions to DNS, using [<a href="./rfc6891" title='"Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))"'>RFC6891</a>], have been defined over the
   years.  Extensions that are specific to the choice of transport, such
   as [<a href="./rfc7828" title='"The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option"'>RFC7828</a>], are not applicable to DoH.

   This appendix describes the requirements used to design DoH.  These
   requirements are listed here to help readers understand the current
   protocol, not to limit how the protocol might be developed in the
   future.  This appendix is non-normative.

   The protocol described in this document based its design on the
   following protocol requirements:

   o  The protocol must use normal HTTP semantics.

   o  The queries and responses must be able to be flexible enough to
      express every DNS query that would normally be sent in DNS over
      UDP (including queries and responses that use DNS extensions, but
      not those that require multiple responses).

   o  The protocol must permit the addition of new formats for DNS
      queries and responses.

   o  The protocol must ensure interoperability by specifying a single
      format for requests and responses that is mandatory to implement.
      That format must be able to support future modifications to the
      DNS protocol including the inclusion of one or more EDNS options
      (including those not yet defined).

   o  The protocol must use a secure transport that meets the
      requirements for HTTPS.

   The following were considered non-requirements:

   o  Supporting network-specific DNS64 [<a href="./rfc6147" title='"DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6147</a>]

   o  Supporting other network-specific inferences from plaintext DNS
      queries

   o  Supporting insecure HTTP
