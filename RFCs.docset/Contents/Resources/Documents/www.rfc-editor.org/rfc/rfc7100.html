Abstract

   This document updates <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a> to no longer use STD 1 as a summary of
   "Internet Official Protocol Standards".  It obsoletes <a href="./rfc5000">RFC 5000</a> and
   requests the IESG to move <a href="./rfc5000">RFC 5000</a> (and therefore STD 1) to Historic
   status.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7100">RFC 7100</a>                   Retirement of STD 1             December 2013</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Retiring%20STD%201"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Retiring STD 1</span>

   <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a> [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>] and its predecessors call for the publication of
   an RFC describing the status of IETF protocols:

      The RFC Editor shall publish periodically an "Internet Official
      Protocol Standards" RFC [1], summarizing the status of all
      Internet protocol and service specifications.

   The "Internet Official Protocol Standards" document, now as <a href="./rfc5000">RFC 5000</a>
   [<a href="./rfc5000" title='"Internet Official Protocol Standards"'>RFC5000</a>], has always been listed in the Internet Standard series as
   STD 1.  However, the document has not been kept up to date in recent
   years, and it has fallen out of use in favor of the online list
   produced by the RFC Editor [<a href="#ref-STDS-TRK" title='"Official Internet Protocol Standards"'>STDS-TRK</a>].  The IETF no longer sees the
   need for the document to be maintained.  Therefore, this document
   updates <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a> [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>], effectively removing the above-mentioned
   paragraph from <a href="#section-6.1.3">Section 6.1.3</a>, along with the paragraph from
   <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> that states:

      The status of Internet protocol and service specifications is
      summarized periodically in an RFC entitled "Internet Official
      Protocol Standards" [1].  This RFC shows the level of maturity and
      other helpful information for each Internet protocol or service
      specification (see <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>).

   and the paragraph from <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> that states:

      The "Official Protocol Standards" RFC (STD1) lists a general
      requirement level for each TS, using the nomenclature defined in
      this section.  This RFC is updated periodically.  In many cases,
      more detailed descriptions of the requirement levels of particular
      protocols and of individual features of the protocols will be
      found in appropriate ASs.

   Additionally, this document obsoletes <a href="./rfc5000">RFC 5000</a> [<a href="./rfc5000" title='"Internet Official Protocol Standards"'>RFC5000</a>], the current
   incarnation of that document, and requests that the IESG move that
   document (and therefore STD 1) to Historic status.

   Finally, <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a> <a href="./rfc2026#section-6.1.3">[RFC2026] Section 6.1.3</a> also calls for the
   publication of an "official summary of standards actions completed
   and pending" in the Internet Society's newsletter.  This has also not
   been done in recent years, and the "publication of record" for
   standards actions has for some time been the minutes of the IESG
   [<a href="#ref-IESG-MINUTES" title='"IESG Telechat Minutes"'>IESG-MINUTES</a>].  Therefore, that paragraph is also effectively
   removed from <a href="#section-6.1.3">Section 6.1.3</a>.
