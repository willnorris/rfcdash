Abstract

   The existing IMAP URL specification (<a href="./rfc5092">RFC 5092</a>) lists several &lt;access&gt;
   identifiers and &lt;access&gt; identifier prefixes that can be used to
   restrict access to URLAUTH-generated URLs.  However, these
   identifiers do not provide facilities for new services such as
   streaming.  This document proposes a set of new &lt;access&gt; identifiers
   as well as an IANA mechanism to register new &lt;access&gt; identifiers for
   future applications.

   This document updates <a href="./rfc5092">RFC 5092</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IMAP URL specification [<a href="./rfc5092" title='"IMAP URL Scheme"'>RFC5092</a>] provides a way to carry
   authorization information in IMAP URLs.  Several authorization
   &lt;access&gt; identifiers are specified in the document that allow
   URLAUTH-authorized URLs to be used only by anonymous users,
   authenticated users, or message submission entities.  However, there
   is no mechanism defined to create new &lt;access&gt; identifiers, and
   overloading the existing mechanisms has security as well as
   administrative implications.

   This document describes a new &lt;access&gt; identifier, "stream", to be
   used by message streaming entities (as described in [<a href="#ref-STREAMING" title='"Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments"'>STREAMING</a>]), and
   defines an IANA registration template, which can be used to register
   new &lt;access&gt; identifiers for future applications.  IANA definitions
   for the existing access identifiers and prefixes from <a href="./rfc5092">RFC 5092</a> are
   also defined in this document -- this document updates <a href="./rfc5092">RFC 5092</a> and
   should be taken as the master in the event of any differences or
   discrepancies.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5593">RFC 5593</a>               IMAP URL Access Identifier              June 2009</span>


   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server, respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then some of the line breaks between those lines are
   for editorial clarity only and may not be part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Additional%20Authorized%20Access%20Identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Additional Authorized Access Identifiers</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Existing%20Access%20Identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Existing Access Identifiers</span>

   The IMAP URL specification [<a href="./rfc5092" title='"IMAP URL Scheme"'>RFC5092</a>] specifies the following
   authorized &lt;access&gt; identifiers:

   o  "authuser" - Indicates that use of this URL is limited to
      authenticated IMAP sessions that are logged in as any non-
      anonymous user.

   o  "anonymous" - Indicates that use of this URL is not restricted by
      session authorization identity.

   Additionally, the following &lt;access&gt; identifier prefixes are defined
   in [<a href="./rfc5092" title='"IMAP URL Scheme"'>RFC5092</a>]:

   o  "submit+" - Followed by a userid, indicates that only a userid
      authorized as a message submission entity on behalf of the
      specified userid is permitted to use this URL.

   o  "user+" - Followed by a userid, indicates that use of this URL is
      limited to IMAP sessions that are logged in as the specified
      userid.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Requirement%20for%20Additional%20Access%20Identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Requirement for Additional Access Identifiers</span>

   The existing &lt;access&gt; identifiers are suitable for user-based
   authorization, but only the "submit+" &lt;access&gt; identifier prefix is
   suitable for entities acting on behalf of a user.  Generic support
   for external entities acting on behalf of users is required for new
   services such as streaming [<a href="#ref-STREAMING" title='"Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments"'>STREAMING</a>].

   The "submit+" &lt;access&gt; identifier prefix is not suitable for use as a
   general mechanism to grant access to entities acting on behalf of
   users, for reasons that include:

   o  Security - The IMAP server maintains a list of submission server
      entities that are entitled to retrieve IMAP URLs specifying the
      "submit+" &lt;access&gt; identifier prefix.  If this list is extended to
      include the set of all external entities that could act on behalf
      of users, then the attack surface would be increased.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5593">RFC 5593</a>               IMAP URL Access Identifier              June 2009</span>


   o  Administration - When URLAUTH-style IMAP URLs are presented to an
      IMAP server by entities acting on behalf of users, the server
      administrator has no way of determining the intended use of that
      URL from the server logs.

   o  Resourcing - Without a mechanism to distinguish between the
      application for which an IMAP URL is to be used, the IMAP server
      has no way to prioritize resources for particular applications.
      For example, the server could prioritize "submit+" URL fetch
      requests over other access identifiers.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Additional%20Access%20Identifier%20Specification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Additional Access Identifier Specification</span>

   The previous section establishes that additional access identifiers
   are required to support applications, such as streaming [<a href="#ref-STREAMING" title='"Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments"'>STREAMING</a>],
   that require entities to retrieve URLAUTH URLs on behalf of users.
   This section describes the scope and meaning of any additional
   &lt;access&gt; identifiers that are created.

   Additional &lt;access&gt; identifiers MUST take one of two forms (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>
   gives the formal ABNF syntax):

   o  &lt;access&gt; identifier - The name of the application, e.g.,
      "exampleapp".

   o  &lt;access&gt; identifier prefix - The name of the application, e.g.,
      "exampleapp3", followed by a "+" and then a userid.  For example,
      consider "exampleapp3+testuser".

   Note that an &lt;access&gt; identifier name can also be registered as an
   &lt;access&gt; identifier prefix.  However, this would require 2 separate
   IANA registrations.

   In both cases, the semantics are the same as those for "submit+",
   i.e., the &lt;access&gt; identifier or &lt;access&gt; identifier prefix (which
   MUST be followed by a userid) indicates that only a userid authorized
   as an application entity for the specified application is permitted
   to use this URL.  In the case of &lt;access&gt; identifier prefixes, the
   IMAP server SHALL NOT validate the specified userid but MUST validate
   that the IMAP session has an authorization identity that is
   authorized as an application entity for the specified application.










<span class="grey">Cook                        Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5593">RFC 5593</a>               IMAP URL Access Identifier              June 2009</span>


   The application entity itself MAY choose to perform validation on any
   specified userid before attempting to retrieve the URL.

   The authorization granted by any &lt;access&gt; identifiers used as
   described above is self-describing, and so requires that the IMAP
   server provide an extensible mechanism for associating userids with
   new applications.  For example, imagine a new application, "foo", is
   created that requires application entities to retrieve URLs on behalf
   of users.  In this case, the IMAP server would need to provide a way
   to register the new application "foo" and to associate the set of
   userids to be used by those entities with the application "foo".  Any
   attempt to retrieve URLs containing the &lt;access&gt; identifier "foo"
   would be checked for authorization against the list of userids
   associated with the application "foo".

   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> provides the template required to register new &lt;access&gt;
   identifiers or prefixes with IANA.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Defining%20an%20Access%20Identifier%20for%20Streaming"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Defining an Access Identifier for Streaming</span>

   One application that makes use of URLAUTH-authorized URLs is that of
   streaming multimedia files that are received as internet-messaging
   attachments.  This application is described in [<a href="#ref-STREAMING" title='"Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments"'>STREAMING</a>].

   See <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a> for the IANA registration template for the "stream"
   &lt;access&gt; identifier.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Formal%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Formal Syntax</span>

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper- or lower-case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

   The ABNF specified below updates the formal syntax of &lt;access&gt;
   identifiers as defined in IMAP URL [<a href="./rfc5092" title='"IMAP URL Scheme"'>RFC5092</a>].

   IANA created a new registry for IMAP URLAUTH access identifiers and
   prefixes.

   Access identifiers and prefixes MUST be registered using the "IETF
   Review" policy [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  This section gives the IANA registration
   entries for the existing access identifiers and prefixes from <a href="./rfc5092">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc5092">5092</a> as well as the entry for the "stream" application.

   The extension to &lt;access&gt; identifiers specified in this document
   provides a mechanism for extending the semantics of the "submit+"
   &lt;access&gt; prefix to arbitrary applications.  The use of such
   additional &lt;access&gt; identifiers and prefixes is primarily for
   security purposes, i.e., to prevent the overloading of "submit+" as a
   generic mechanism to allow entities to retrieve IMAP URLs on behalf
