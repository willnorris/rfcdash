   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it defines managed object
   types as experimental extensions to the generic interfaces structure
   of MIB-II.

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
      and naming objects for the purpose of management.  <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a>

      defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
      consistent with the SMI.

      <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
      the Internet suite of protocols.  <a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a>, defines MIB-II, an
      evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
      operational requirements.

      <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
      access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Objects</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-7" title=" International Organization for Standardization">7</a>]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>3</a>] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-8" title=" International Standard 8825">8</a>],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> contains the specification of all object types in this
   section of the MIB.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions specified in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>9</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1229">RFC 1229</a>                Interface MIB Extensions                May 1991</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Overview</span>

   The Internet Standard MIB [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>4</a>,<a href="#ref-6" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>6</a>] contains a group of management
   objects pertaining to a network device's generic network
   interface(s).  These objects are generic in the sense that they apply
   to all network interfaces, irrespective of the type of communication
   media and protocols used on such interfaces.  This has proved to be
   necessary but not sufficient; there are efforts underway to define
   additional MIB objects which are specific to particular media and
   lower-level (subnetwork-layer and below) protocol stacks.

   However, some of these efforts have identified objects which are
   required (or at least useful), but are not specific to the
   interface-type on which the effort is focusing.  In order to avoid
   redundancy, it is better that such objects be defined as extensions
   to the generic interface group, rather than defined in multiple
   specific-interface-type MIBs.

   This memo defines the resultant extensions to the generic interface
   group.  These extensions are spread over three tables: the generic
   Interface Extension table, the generic Interface Test table, and the
   generic Receive Address table.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Generic%20Interface%20Extension%20Table"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Generic Interface Extension Table</span>

   This table consists of new objects applicable to all types of
   subnetwork interface.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Generic%20Interface%20Test%20Table"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Generic Interface Test Table</span>

   This section defines objects which allow a network manager to
   instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults.  A few
   common types of tests are defined in this document but most will be
   defined elsewhere, dependent on the particular type of interface.
   After testing, the object ifExtnsTestResult can be read to determine
   the outcome.  If an agent cannot perform the test, ifExtnsTestResult
   is set to so indicate.  The object ifExtnsTestCode can be used to
   provide further test-specific or interface-specific (or even
   enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test.
   Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
   If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second
   test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is
   active on another interface.

   When a test is invoked, the identity of the originator of the request
   and the request-id are saved by the agent in the objects
   ifExtnsTestRequestId and ifExtnsTestCommunity.  These values remain
   set until the next test is invoked.  In the (rare) event that the

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1229">RFC 1229</a>                Interface MIB Extensions                May 1991</span>


   invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then
   there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be
   overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results
   being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be detected by a network
   manager retrieving ifExtnsTestCommunity, and ifExtnsTestRequestId at
   the same time as the test results are retrieved, and ensuring that
   the results are for the desired request.

   In general, a Management station must not retransmit a request to
   invoke a test for which it does not receive a response; instead, it
   properly inspects an agent's MIB to determine if the invocation was
   successful.  The invocation request is retransmitted only if the
   invocation was unsuccessful.

   Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line or may even
   require the agent to be rebooted after completion of the test.  In
   these circumstances, communication with the management station
   invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the test.
   The agent should make every effort to transmit a response to the
   request that invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When
   the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the test are
   properly made available in the appropriate objects.  Note that this
   requires that the ifIndex value assigned to an interface must be
   unchanged even if the test causes a reboot.  An agent must reject any
   test for which it cannot, perhaps due to resource constraints, make
   available at least the minimum amount of information after that test
   completes.

                          they will continue to exist after the next
                          restart.  Entries having the value invalid(2)
                          are invalid and do not represent an address
                          for which an interface accepts frames.
                              Setting an object instance to one of
                          the values other(1), volatile(3), or
                          nonVolatile(4) causes the corresponding
                          entry to exist or continue to exist, and
                          to take on the respective status as regards
                          the next restart of the managed system.
                              Setting an object instance to the value
                          invalid(2) causes the corresponding entry
                          to become invalid or cease to exist.
                              It is an implementation-specific matter
                          as to whether the agent removes an
                          invalidated entry from the table.
                          Accordingly, management stations must be
                          prepared to receive tabular information
                          from agents that corresponds to entries not
                          currently in use.  Proper interpretation of
                          such entries requires examination of the
                          relevant ifExtnsRcvAddrStatus object
                          instance."
