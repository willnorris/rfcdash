<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document relaxes the IANA rules for the Protocol for Carrying
   Authentication for Network Access (PANA) [<a href="./rfc5191" title='"Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)"'>RFC5191</a>].  Rules for the
   following protocol fields, all defined in [<a href="./rfc5191" title='"Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)"'>RFC5191</a>], are affected:

   o  Message Types

   o  Message Flags

   o  Attribute-Value Pair (AVP) Flags

   o  Result-Code AVP Values

   o  Termination-Cause AVP Values

   The rationale for this update is that there can be situations in
   which it makes sense to grant an allocation under special
   circumstances.  At the time of this writing, the IETF is in the
   process of approving one such allocation.  By changing the current
   IANA rules to allow for IESG Approval [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>] as well, it has
   become possible for the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) to
   consider an allocation request, even if it does not fulfill the
   default rule.  For instance, an experimental protocol extension could
   perhaps deserve an allocation from a field of reserved bits, as long
   as a sufficient number of bits still remain for other purposes, and
   the PANA community is happy with such allocation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has updated the registries related to PANA Message Types,
   Message Flags, AVP Flags, Result-Code AVP Values, and Termination-
   Cause AVP Values, as specified below.  All other PANA IANA registries
   are to remain unchanged.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Message%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Message Types</span>

   The Message Types namespace is used to identify PANA messages.  Value
   0 is not used and is not assigned by IANA.  The range of values from
   1 - 65,519 are for permanent, standard Message Types, allocated by
   IETF Review or IESG Approval [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  Previously, the rule for
   this range was allocation by IETF Review only.  [<a href="./rfc5191" title='"Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)"'>RFC5191</a>] defined the
   range of values from 1 - 4.  The same Message Type is used for both
   the request and the answer messages, except for type 1.  The Request
   bit distinguishes requests from answers.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5872">RFC 5872</a>                     PANA IANA Rules                    May 2010</span>


   The range of values from 65,520 - 65,535 (hexadecimal values 0xfff0 -
   0xffff) is reserved for experimental messages.  As these codes are
   only for experimental and testing purposes, no guarantee is made for
   interoperability between the communicating PANA Client (PaC) and PANA
   Authentication Agent (PAA) using experimental commands, as outlined
   in [<a href="./rfc3692" title='"Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful"'>RFC3692</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Message%20Flags"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Message Flags</span>

   There are 16 bits in the Flags field of the PANA message header.
   <a href="./rfc5191#section-6.2">Section 6.2 of [RFC5191]</a> assigned bit 0 ('R'), 1 ('S'), 2 ('C'), 3
   ('A'), 4 ('P'), and 5 ('I').  Allocations from the remaining free
   bits in the PANA header Flag field are made via Standards Action or
   IESG Approval [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  Previously, the rule for these bits was
   allocation by Standards Action only.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20AVP%20Flags"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  AVP Flags</span>

   There are 16 bits in the AVP Flags field of the AVP header, defined
   in <a href="./rfc5191#section-6.3">Section 6.3 of [RFC5191]</a>.  That RFC also assigned bit 0 ('V').
   The remaining bits are assigned via Standards Action or IESG Approval
   [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  Previously, the rule for these bits was allocation by
   Standards Action only.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20Result-Code%20AVP%20Values"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Result-Code AVP Values</span>

   As defined in <a href="./rfc5191#section-8.7">Section 8.7 of [RFC5191]</a>, the Result-Code AVP (AVP
   Code 7) defines the values from 0 - 2.

   All remaining values are available for assignment via IETF Review or
   IESG Approval [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  Previously, the rule for these values was
   allocation by IETF Review only.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.%20%20Termination-Cause%20AVP%20Values"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5" id="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Termination-Cause AVP Values</span>

   As defined in <a href="./rfc5191#section-8.9">Section 8.9 of [RFC5191]</a>, the Termination-Cause AVP
   (AVP Code 9) defines the values 1, 4, and 8.

   All remaining values are available for assignment via IETF Review or
   IESG Approval [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  Previously, the rule for these values was
   allocation by IETF Review only.

   This specification does not change the security properties of PANA.

   However, a few words are necessary about the use of the experimental
   code points defined in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>.  Potentially harmful side effects
   from the use of the experimental values need to be carefully
   evaluated before deploying any experiment across networks that the
   owner of the experiment does not entirely control.  Guidance given in
   [<a href="./rfc3692" title='"Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful"'>RFC3692</a>] about the use of experimental values needs to be followed.
