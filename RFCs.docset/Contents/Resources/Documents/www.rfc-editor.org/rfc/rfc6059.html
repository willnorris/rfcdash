       <span class="h1">Simple Procedures for Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6</span>

Abstract

   Detecting Network Attachment allows hosts to assess if its existing
   addressing or routing configuration is valid for a newly connected
   network.  This document provides simple procedures for Detecting
   Network Attachment in IPv6 hosts, and procedures for routers to
   support such services.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Hosts require procedures to simply and reliably identify if they have
   moved to a network to which they had been recently connected.  In
   order to detect reconnection to a previously visited network, router
   and neighbor discovery messages are used to collect reachability and
   configuration information.  This information is used to detect if the
   host has attached to a link for which it may still have valid address
   and other configuration information, and which it can use until it
   receives confirmation through either the Neighbor Discovery protocol
   or DHCPv6.

   This document incorporates feedback from host and router operating
   systems implementors, which seeks to make implementation and adoption
   of IPv6 change detection procedures simple for general use.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Goals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Goals</span>

   The goal of this document is to specify a simple procedure for
   Detecting Network Attachment (Simple DNA) that has the following
   characteristics.

   o  Routers do not have to be modified to support this scheme.

   o  The most common use cases are optimized.

   o  In the worst case, detection latency is equal to that of standard
      neighbor discovery so that performance is never degraded.

   o  False positives are not acceptable.  A host must not wrongly
      conclude that it has reattached to a previously visited network.

   o  False negatives are acceptable.  A host may fail to identify a
      previously visited link correctly and attempt to acquire fresh
      addressing and configuration information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Applicability</span>

   The Simple DNA protocol provides substantial benefits over standard
   neighbor discovery procedures [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] in some scenarios and does
   not provide any benefit at all in certain other scenarios.  This is
   intentional as Simple DNA was designed for simplicity rather than
   completeness.  In particular, the Simple DNA protocol provides
   maximum benefits when a host moves between a small set of known
   links.  When a host moves to a completely new link that is previously
   unknown, the performance of the Simple DNA protocol will be identical
   to that using standard neighbor discovery procedures [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  In
   this case, the main benefit of the Simple DNA protocol is to

   immediately flush out the inoperable addresses and configuration
   instead of timing them out.  The Simple DNA procedure provides
   support for addresses configured using either IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration [<a href="./rfc4862" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>] or DHCPv6 [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>].  It does not support
   manually configured addresses since they are not widely used and can
   cause unpredictable results and/or aggressive probing behavior (see
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.3.%20%20Link%20Identification%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" id="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Link Identification Model</span>

   Earlier methods of Detecting Network Attachment, e.g., the procedure
   defined in [<a href="#ref-DNA-PROTOCOL" title='"Design Alternative for Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6 Networks (DNAv6 Design Alternative)"'>DNA-PROTOCOL</a>], relied on detecting whether the host was
   still connected to the same link.  If the host was attached to the
   same link, all information related to the link such as the routers,
   prefixes, and configuration parameters was considered to be valid.
   The Simple DNA protocol follows an alternate approach where it relies
   on probing each previously known router to determine whether to use
   information learnt from THAT router.  This allows Simple DNA to probe
   routers learnt from multiple earlier attachments to optimize movement
   between a known set of links.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.4.%20%20DNA%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" id="section-1.4">1.4</a>.  DNA Overview</span>

   Detecting Network Attachment is performed by hosts after detecting a
   link-layer "up" indication.  The host uses a combination of unicast
   Neighbor Solicitations (NSs) and multicast Router Solicitations (RSs)
   in order to determine whether previously encountered routers are
   present on the link, in which case an existing configuration can be
   reused.  If previously encountered routers are not present, then
   either IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration and/or DHCPv6 is used
   for configuration.

   Hosts implementing Simple DNA may also send DHCPv6 packets, as
   described in <a href="#section-5.5.4">Section 5.5.4</a>.  Since Simple DNA does not modify the
   DHCPv6 protocol or state machine, the operation of DHCPv6 is
   unchanged.

   Routers that follow the standard neighbor discovery procedure
   described in [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] will delay the router advertisement (RA) by a
   random period between 0 and MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME (defined to be 500 ms)
   as described in <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.2.6">SectionÂ 6.2.6 of [RFC4861]</a>.  In addition, consecutive
   RAs sent to the all-nodes multicast address are rate limited to no
   more than one advertisement every MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS (defined to
   be 3 seconds).  This will result in a worst-case delay of 3.5 seconds
   in the absence of any packet loss.

   Hosts implementing Simple DNA can detect the presence of a previously
   encountered router using unicast Neighbor Solicitations.  As a
   result, where the host with a valid configuration is returning to a
   previously encountered link, delays in the sending of a Router
   Advertisement (RA) will not delay configuration as long as NS probing
   is successful.  However, in situations where the host is attaching to
   a link for the first time, or where it does not have a valid IP
   address on the link, it will be dependent on the receipt of an RA for
   stateless autoconfiguration.  In these situations, delays in the
   receipt of an RA can be significant and may result in service
   disruption.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.5.%20%20Working%20Assumptions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.5" id="section-1.5">1.5</a>.  Working Assumptions</span>

   There are a series of assumptions about the network environment that
   underpin these procedures.

   o  The combination of the link-layer address and the link-local IPv6
      address of a router is unique across links.

   o  Hosts receive indications when a link layer comes up.  Without
      this, they would not know when to commence the DNA procedure.

   If these assumptions do not hold, host change detection systems will
   not function optimally.  In that case, they may occasionally detect
   change spuriously or experience some delay in Detecting Network
   Attachment.  The delays so experienced will be no longer than those
   caused by following the standard neighbor discovery procedure
   described in [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20Simple%20DNA%20Address%20Table%20%28SDAT%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The Simple DNA Address Table (SDAT)</span>

   In order to correctly perform the procedure described in this
   document, the host needs to maintain a data structure called the
   Simple DNA address table (SDAT).  The host needs to maintain this
   data structure for each interface on which it performs Simple DNA.
   Each entry in the SDAT table will be indexed by the router identifier
   (link-local + link-layer address of the router) and consists of at
   least the following parameters.  Fields tagged as [S] are used for
   addresses configured using SLAAC.  Fields tagged as [D] are used for
   addresses obtained using DHCPv6.  Fields tagged as [S+D] are used in
   both cases.

   o  [S+D] Link-local IPv6 address of the router(s)

   o  [S+D] Link-layer (MAC) address of the router(s)

   o  [S+D] Flag indicating whether the address was obtained using SLAAC
      or DHCPv6.  (The D-Flag)

   o  [S+D] IPv6 address and its related parameters like valid lifetime,
      preferred lifetime, etc.

   o  [S] Prefix from which the address was formed.

   o  [S] Flag indicating whether SEND was used.  (The S-Flag)

   o  [D] DHCP-specific information in case DHCPv6 [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>] was used to
      acquire the address.  This information includes the DUID, the
      IAID, a flag indicating IA_NA/IA_TA, and configuration information
      such as DNS server address, NTP server address, etc.

   o  [S+D] Flag indicating whether the address is operable.  (The
      O-Flag)

   On connecting to a new point of attachment, the host performs the
   Detecting Network Attachment procedure in order to determine whether
   the existing addressing and configuration information are still
   valid.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20On%20Receipt%20of%20a%20Router%20Advertisement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  On Receipt of a Router Advertisement</span>

   When the host receives a Router Advertisement and the router
   identifier of the sending router is not present in the SDAT, the host
   processes the Router Advertisement as specified in <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.3.4">SectionÂ 6.3.4 of
   [RFC4861]</a>.  Additionally, the host performs the following operations.

   If the Router Advertisement is protected by SEND, the S-Flag MUST be
   set to 1 in the SDAT entries created/modified by this RA.

   o  The host configures addresses out of the autoconfigurable prefixes
      advertised in the RA, as specified in [<a href="./rfc4862" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>].  The host MUST
      add an SDAT entry (indexed by this router identifier) for each
      such address the host configures.

   o  The host might have already configured addresses out of the
      autoconfigurable prefixes advertised in the RA.  This could be a
      result of receiving the prefix in an RA from another router on the
      same link.  The host MUST add an SDAT entry (indexed by this
      router identifier) for each such address the host had already
      configured.

   o  The host might have DHCPv6-assigned addresses that are known to be
      operable on the link.  The host MUST add an SDAT entry (indexed by
      this router identifier) for each such DHCPv6 address.

   After the host is assigned an address by a DHCPv6 server, it needs to
   associate the address with the routers on link.  The host MUST create
   one SDAT entry for each of the on-link routers associated with the
   DHCPv6-assigned address.

   The steps involved in basic detection of network attachment are:

   o  Link-layer indication

   o  Sending of neighbor discovery probes

   o  Response gathering and assessment

   These steps are described below.

   In order to start detection of network attachment procedures, a host
   typically requires a link-layer indication that the medium has become
   available [<a href="./rfc4957" title='"Link-Layer Event Notifications for Detecting Network Attachments"'>RFC4957</a>].

   After the indication is received, the host MUST mark all currently
   configured (non-tentative) IP addresses as inoperable until the
   change detection process completes.  It MUST also set all Neighbor

   Cache (NC) entries for the routers on its Default Router List to
   STALE.  This is done to speed up the acquisition of a new default
   router in case the host attaches to a previously unvisited link.

   When a host receives a link-layer "up" indication, it SHOULD
   immediately send a Router Solicitation (as specified in <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.3.7">SectionÂ 6.3.7
   of [RFC4861]</a>).  The Router Solicitation is sent to the all-routers
   multicast address using a link-local address as the source address
   [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  Even if the host is in possession of more than one valid
   IPv6 address, it MUST send only one router solicitation using a valid
   link-local address as the source address.

   The host iterates through the SDAT to identify a set of candidate
   routers for NS-based probing.  Each router in the SDAT that is
   associated with at least one valid address is added to the candidate
   router set exactly once.  For each router in the candidate router
   set, the host MUST send a unicast Neighbor Solicitation to the
   router's link-local address it obtained from the lookup on the SDAT.
   The host MUST set the link-layer destination address in each of these
   neighbor solicitations to the link-layer address of the router stored
   in the SDAT.  The host MUST NOT send unicast Neighbor Solicitations
   to a router that is not associated to a valid address in the SDAT.
   If at least one entry in the SDAT for a given router had the S-Flag
   set, the host SHOULD use SEND to secure the NS probe being sent to
   the router.

   The host SHOULD send the Neighbor-Solicitation-based unicast probes
   in parallel with the multicast Router Solicitation.  Since sending
   NSs is just an optimization, doing the NSs and the RS in parallel
   ensures that the procedure does not run slower than it would if it
   only used a Router Solicitation.

   NOTE: A Simple DNA implementation SHOULD limit its NS-based probing
   to at most six previously seen routers.

   On receiving a link-layer "up" indication, the host will initiate a
   DHCPv6 exchange (with the timing and protocol as specified in
   [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>]) in order to verify whether the addresses and configuration

   When a Neighbor Advertisement is received from a router in response
   to an NS probe, the host MUST verify that both the IPv6 and link-
   layer (MAC) addresses of the router match the expected values before
   utilizing the configuration associated with the detected network
   (prefixes, MTU, etc.).  The host MUST then go through the SDAT and
   mark the addresses (both SLAAC and DHCPv6 acquired) associated with
   the router as operable.

   secured using SEND and the Router Advertisement was not, the host
   MUST wait for SEND_NA_GRACE_TIME to see if a SEND-secured RA is

   Operations subsequent to Detecting Network Attachment depend upon
   whether or not the host has reconnected to a previously visited
   network.

   After confirming the reachability of the associated router using an
   NS/NA pair, the host performs the following steps.

   o  The host SHOULD rejoin any solicited nodes' multicast groups for
      addresses it continues to use.

   o  The host SHOULD select a default router as described in <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.3.6">Section</a>
      <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.3.6">6.3.6 of [RFC4861]</a>.

   If the host has determined that it has reattached to a previously
   visited link, it SHOULD NOT perform duplicate address detection on
   the addresses that have been confirmed to be operable.

   If the NS-based probe with a router did not complete or if the RS-
   based probe on the same router completed with different prefixes than
   the ones in the SDAT, the host MUST begin address configuration
   techniques, as indicated in a received Router Advertisement [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>]
   [<a href="./rfc4862" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>].

   A host usually maintains SDAT entries from some number of previously
   visited networks.  When the host attaches to a previously unknown
   network, it MAY need to discard some older SDAT entries.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.10.%20%20Periodic%20Maintenance%20of%20the%20SDAT"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.10" id="section-5.10">5.10</a>.  Periodic Maintenance of the SDAT</span>

   The host SHOULD maintain the SDAT table by removing entries when the
   valid lifetime for the prefix and address expires, that is, at the
   same time that the prefix is removed from the Prefix List in
   [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  The host SHOULD also remove a router from an SDAT entry
   when that router stops advertising a particular prefix.  When three
   consecutive RAs from a particular router have not included a prefix,
   then the router should be removed from the corresponding SDAT entry.
   Likewise, if a router starts advertising a prefix for which there
   already exists an SDAT entry,then that router should be added to the
   SDAT entry.

   Where the NS probe does not complete successfully, it usually implies
   that the host is not attached to the network whose configuration is
   being tested.  In such circumstances, there is typically little value
   in aggressively retransmitting unicast neighbor solicitations that do
   not elicit a response.

   Where unicast Neighbor Solicitations and Router Solicitations are
   sent in parallel, one strategy is to forsake retransmission of
   Neighbor Solicitations and to allow retransmission only of Router
   Solicitations or DHCPv6.  In order to reduce competition between
   unicast Neighbor Solicitations and Router Solicitations and DHCPv6

   DNAv4 [<a href="./rfc4436" title='"Detecting Network Attachment in IPv4 (DNAv4)"'>RFC4436</a>] specifies a set of steps that optimize the (common)
   case of reattachment to an IPv4 network that a host has been
   connected to previously by attempting to reuse a previous (but still
   valid) configuration.  This document shares the same goal as DNAv4
   (that of minimizing the handover latency in moving between points of
   attachment) but differs in the steps it performs to achieve this
   goal.  Another difference is that this document supports stateless
   autoconfiguration of addresses in addition to addresses configured
   using DHCPv6.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   A host may receive Router Advertisements from non-SEND devices, after
   receiving a link-layer indication.  While it is necessary to assess
   quickly whether a host has moved to another network, it is important
   that the host's current secured SEND [<a href="./rfc3971" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC3971</a>] router information is
   not replaced by an attacker that spoofs an RA and purports to change
   the link.

   As such, the host SHOULD send a Neighbor Solicitation to the existing
   SEND router upon link-up indication as described above in
   <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>.  The host SHOULD then ensure that unsecured router

   information does not cause deletion of existing SEND state, within
   MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS, in order to allow for a present SEND router to
   respond.

   If the current default router is a SEND-secured router, the host
   SHOULD wait SEND_NA_GRACE_TIME after transmission before adopting a
   new default router.

   Even if SEND signatures on RAs are used, it may not be immediately
   clear if the router is authorized to make such advertisements.  As
   such, a host SHOULD NOT treat such devices as secure until and unless
   authorization delegation discovery is successful.

   Unless SEND or another form of secure address configuration is used,
   the DNA procedure does not in itself provide positive, secure
   authentication of the router(s) on the network, or authentication of
   the network itself, as would be provided, e.g., by mutual
   authentication at the link layer.  Therefore, when such assurance is
   not available, the host MUST NOT make any security-sensitive
   decisions based on the DNA procedure alone.  In particular, it MUST
   NOT decide that it has moved from an untrusted to a trusted network,
   and MUST NOT make any security decisions that depend on the
   determination that such a transition has occurred.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Issues%20with%20Confirming%20Manually%20Assigned%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Issues with Confirming Manually Assigned Addresses</span>

   Even though DNAv4 [<a href="./rfc4436" title='"Detecting Network Attachment in IPv4 (DNAv4)"'>RFC4436</a>] supports verification of manually
   assigned addresses, this feature of DNAv4 has not been widely
   implemented or used.  There are two major issues that come up with
   confirming manually assigned addresses using Simple DNA.

   o  When DHCPv6 or SLAAC addresses are used for probing, there is no
      need to aggressively retransmit lost probes.  This is because the
      address configuration falls back to vanilla DHCPv6 or SLAAC, and
      the host will eventually obtain an address.  This is not the case
      with manually assigned addresses.  If the probes are lost, the
      host runs the risk of ending up with no addresses at all.  Hence,
      aggressive retransmissions are necessary.

   o  Another issue comes up when the host moves between two networks,
      one where manual addressing is being used (say, NET1) and the
      other where dynamic addressing (stateless autoconfiguration or
      DHCPv6) is being used (say, NET2).  Since the host can obtain a
      dynamic address in some situations, it will need to send Simple
      DNA probes and may also engage in a DHCPv6 exchange.  In a
      situation where the host moves to NET1 and the NS probes are lost
      and in addition an RA is not received, the host will not be able
      to confirm that it attached to NET1, and therefore that it should
      use the manual configuration for that network.  As a result, if
      DHCPv6 is enabled on NET1, then the host could mistakenly obtain a
      dynamic address and configuration instead of using the manual
      configuration.  To prevent this problem, Simple DNA probing needs
      to continue even after the DHCPv6 exchange has completed, and DNA
      probes need to take precedence over DHCPv6, contrary to the advice
      provided in <a href="#section-5.7.3">Section 5.7.3</a>.

   Given these issues, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use manual addressing
   with Simple DNA.
