   This document defines basic IPv6 features for a residential or small-
   office router, referred to as an IPv6 CE router.  Typically, these
   routers also support IPv4.

   Mixed environments of dual-stack hosts and IPv6-only hosts (behind
   the CE router) can be more complex if the IPv6-only devices are using
   a translator to access IPv4 servers [<a href="./rfc6144" title='"Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation"'>RFC6144</a>].  Support for such
   mixed environments is not in scope of this document.

   This document specifies how an IPv6 CE router automatically
   provisions its WAN interface, acquires address space for provisioning
   of its LAN interfaces, and fetches other configuration information
   from the service provider network.  Automatic provisioning of more
   complex topology than a single router with multiple LAN interfaces is
   out of scope for this document.

   See [<a href="./rfc4779" title='"ISP IPv6 Deployment Scenarios in Broadband Access Networks"'>RFC4779</a>] for a discussion of options available for deploying
   IPv6 in service provider access networks.

   End-User Network          one or more links attached to the IPv6 CE
                             router that connect IPv6 hosts.

   IPv6 Customer Edge Router a node intended for home or small-office
                             use that forwards IPv6 packets not
                             explicitly addressed to itself.  The IPv6
                             CE router connects the end-user network to
                             a service provider network.

   IPv6 Host                 any device implementing an IPv6 stack
                             receiving IPv6 connectivity through the
                             IPv6 CE router.

   LAN Interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link in
                             the end-user network.  Examples are
                             Ethernets (simple or bridged), 802.11
                             wireless, or other LAN technologies.  An
                             IPv6 CE router may have one or more
                             network-layer LAN interfaces.

   Service Provider          an entity that provides access to the
                             Internet.  In this document, a service
                             provider specifically offers Internet
                             access using IPv6, and may also offer IPv4
                             Internet access.  The service provider can
                             provide such access over a variety of
                             different transport methods such as DSL,
                             cable, wireless, and others.

   WAN Interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link
                             used to provide connectivity to the service
                             provider network; example link technologies
                             include Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP
                             links, Frame Relay, or ATM networks, as
                             well as Internet-layer (or higher-layer)
                             "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or
                             IPv6 itself.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Current%20IPv4%20End-User%20Network%20Architecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Current IPv4 End-User Network Architecture</span>

   An end-user network will likely support both IPv4 and IPv6.  It is
   not expected that an end-user will change their existing network
   topology with the introduction of IPv6.  There are some differences
   in how IPv6 works and is provisioned; these differences have
   implications for the network architecture.  A typical IPv4 end-user
   network consists of a "plug and play" router with NAT functionality
   and a single link behind it, connected to the service provider
   network.

   A typical IPv4 NAT deployment by default blocks all incoming
   connections.  Opening of ports is typically allowed using a Universal
   Plug and Play Internet Gateway Device (UPnP IGD) [<a href="#ref-UPnP-IGD">UPnP-IGD</a>] or some
   other firewall control protocol.

   Another consequence of using private address space in the end-user
   network is that it provides stable addressing; i.e., it never changes
   even when you change service providers, and the addresses are always
   there even when the WAN interface is down or the customer edge router
   has not yet been provisioned.

   Rewriting addresses on the edge of the network also allows for some
   rudimentary multihoming, even though using NATs for multihoming does
   not preserve connections during a fail-over event [<a href="./rfc4864" title='"Local Network Protection for IPv6"'>RFC4864</a>].

   Many existing routers support dynamic routing, and advanced end-users
   can build arbitrary, complex networks using manual configuration of
   address prefixes combined with a dynamic routing protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20IPv6%20End-User%20Network%20Architecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  IPv6 End-User Network Architecture</span>

   The end-user network architecture for IPv6 should provide equivalent
   or better capabilities and functionality than the current IPv4
   architecture.

   The end-user network is a stub network.  Figure 1 illustrates the
   model topology for the end-user network.

            Figure 1: An Example of a Typical End-User Network

   This architecture describes the:

   o  Basic capabilities of an IPv6 CE router

   o  Provisioning of the WAN interface connecting to the service
      provider

   o  Provisioning of the LAN interfaces

   For IPv6 multicast traffic, the IPv6 CE router may act as a Multicast
   Listener Discovery (MLD) proxy [<a href="./rfc4605" title='"Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) / Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)-Based Multicast Forwarding ("'>RFC4605</a>] and may support a dynamic
   multicast routing protocol.

   The IPv6 CE router may be manually configured in an arbitrary
   topology with a dynamic routing protocol.  Automatic provisioning and
   configuration are described for a single IPv6 CE router only.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6204">RFC 6204</a>               IPv6 CE Router Requirements            April 2011</span>


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.1.%20%20Local%20Communication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1" id="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Local Communication</span>

   Link-local IPv6 addresses are used by hosts communicating on a single
   link.  Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs) [<a href="./rfc4193" title='"Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses"'>RFC4193</a>] are used
   by hosts communicating within the end-user network across multiple
   links, but without requiring the application to use a globally
   routable address.  The IPv6 CE router defaults to acting as the
   demarcation point between two networks by providing a ULA boundary, a
   multicast zone boundary, and ingress and egress traffic filters.

   A dual-stack host is multihomed to IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  The IPv4
   and IPv6 topologies may not be congruent, and different addresses may
   have different reachability, e.g., ULAs.  A host stack has to be able
   to quickly fail over and try a different source address and
   destination address pair if communication fails, as outlined in
   [<a href="#ref-HAPPY-EYEBALLS">HAPPY-EYEBALLS</a>].

   At the time of this writing, several host implementations do not
   handle the case where they have an IPv6 address configured and no
   IPv6 connectivity, either because the address itself has a limited
   topological reachability (e.g., ULA) or because the IPv6 CE router is
   not connected to the IPv6 network on its WAN interface.  To support
   host implementations that do not handle multihoming in a multi-prefix
   environment [<a href="#ref-MULTIHOMING-WITHOUT-NAT">MULTIHOMING-WITHOUT-NAT</a>], the IPv6 CE router should not,
   as detailed in the requirements below, advertise itself as a default
   router on the LAN interface(s) when it does not have IPv6
   connectivity on the WAN interface or when it is not provisioned with
   IPv6 addresses.  For local IPv6 communication, the mechanisms
   specified in [<a href="./rfc4191" title='"Default Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes"'>RFC4191</a>] are used.

   ULA addressing is useful where the IPv6 CE router has multiple LAN
   interfaces with hosts that need to communicate with each other.  If
   the IPv6 CE router has only a single LAN interface (IPv6 link), then
   link-local addressing can be used instead.

   In the event that more than one IPv6 CE router is present on the LAN,
   then coexistence with IPv4 requires all of them to conform to these
   recommendations, especially requirements ULA-5 and L-4 below.

   The IPv6 CE router is responsible for implementing IPv6 routing; that
   is, the IPv6 CE router must look up the IPv6 destination address in
   its routing table to decide to which interface it should send the
   packet.

   In this role, the IPv6 CE router is responsible for ensuring that
   traffic using its ULA addressing does not go out the WAN interface,
   and does not originate from the WAN interface.

   G-1:  An IPv6 CE router is an IPv6 node according to the IPv6 Node
         Requirements [<a href="./rfc4294" title='"IPv6 Node Requirements"'>RFC4294</a>] specification.

   G-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST implement ICMP according to [<a href="./rfc4443" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC4443</a>].
         In particular, point-to-point links MUST be handled as
         described in <a href="./rfc4443#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC4443]</a>.

   G-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST NOT forward any IPv6 traffic between
         its LAN interface(s) and its WAN interface until the router has
         successfully completed the IPv6 address acquisition process.

   G-4:  By default, an IPv6 CE router that has no default router(s) on
         its WAN interface MUST NOT advertise itself as an IPv6 default
         router on its LAN interfaces.  That is, the "Router Lifetime"
         field is set to zero in all Router Advertisement messages it
         originates [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

   G-5:  By default, if the IPv6 CE router is an advertising router and
         loses its IPv6 default router(s) on the WAN interface, it MUST
         explicitly invalidate itself as an IPv6 default router on each
         of its advertising interfaces by immediately transmitting one
         or more Router Advertisement messages with the "Router
         Lifetime" field set to zero [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20WAN-Side%20Configuration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  WAN-Side Configuration</span>

   The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one or more
   access network architectures.  This document describes an IPv6 CE
   router that is not specific to any particular architecture or service
   provider and that supports all commonly used architectures.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and DHCPv6 protocols operate over any type of
   IPv6-supported link layer, and there is no need for a link-layer-
   specific configuration protocol for IPv6 network-layer configuration
   options as in, e.g., PPP IP Control Protocol (IPCP) for IPv4.  This
   section makes the assumption that the same mechanism will work for
   any link layer, be it Ethernet, the Data Over Cable Service Interface
   Specification (DOCSIS), PPP, or others.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6204">RFC 6204</a>               IPv6 CE Router Requirements            April 2011</span>


   WAN-side requirements:

   W-1:  When the router is attached to the WAN interface link, it MUST
         act as an IPv6 host for the purposes of stateless [<a href="./rfc4862" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>] or
         stateful [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>] interface address assignment.

   W-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST generate a link-local address and
         finish Duplicate Address Detection according to [<a href="./rfc4862" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>] prior
         to sending any Router Solicitations on the interface.  The
         source address used in the subsequent Router Solicitation MUST
         be the link-local address on the WAN interface.

   W-3:  Absent other routing information, the IPv6 CE router MUST use
         Router Discovery as specified in [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] to discover a
         default router(s) and install default route(s) in its routing
         table with the discovered router's address as the next hop.

   W-4:  The router MUST act as a requesting router for the purposes of
         DHCPv6 prefix delegation ([<a href="./rfc3633" title='"IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"'>RFC3633</a>]).

   W-5:  DHCPv6 address assignment (IA_NA) and DHCPv6 prefix delegation
         (IA_PD) SHOULD be done as a single DHCPv6 session.

   W-6:  The IPv6 CE router MUST use a persistent DHCP Unique Identifier
         (DUID) for DHCPv6 messages.  The DUID MUST NOT change between
         network interface resets or IPv6 CE router reboots.

   Link-layer requirements:

   WLL-1:  If the WAN interface supports Ethernet encapsulation, then
           the IPv6 CE router MUST support IPv6 over Ethernet [<a href="./rfc2464" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks"'>RFC2464</a>].

   WLL-2:  If the WAN interface supports PPP encapsulation, the IPv6 CE
           router MUST support IPv6 over PPP [<a href="./rfc5072" title='"IP Version 6 over PPP"'>RFC5072</a>].

   WLL-3:  If the WAN interface supports PPP encapsulation, in a dual-
           stack environment with IPCP and IPV6CP running over one PPP
           logical channel, the Network Control Protocols (NCPs) MUST be
           treated as independent of each other and start and terminate
           independently.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6204">RFC 6204</a>               IPv6 CE Router Requirements            April 2011</span>


   Address assignment requirements:

   WAA-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support Stateless Address
           Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [<a href="./rfc4862" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>].

   WAA-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST follow the recommendations in <a href="./rfc5942#section-4">Section</a>
           <a href="./rfc5942#section-4">4 of [RFC5942]</a>, and in particular the handling of the L flag
           in the Router Advertisement Prefix Information option.

   WAA-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>] client
           behavior.

   WAA-4:  The IPv6 CE router MUST be able to support the following
           DHCPv6 options: IA_NA, Reconfigure Accept [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>], and
           DNS_SERVERS [<a href="./rfc3646" title='"DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3646</a>].

   WAA-5:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support the DHCPv6 Simple Network
           Time Protocol (SNTP) option [<a href="./rfc4075" title='"Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Configuration Option for DHCPv6"'>RFC4075</a>] and the Information
           Refresh Time option [<a href="./rfc4242" title='"Information Refresh Time Option for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC4242</a>].

   WAA-6:  If the IPv6 CE router receives a Router Advertisement message
           (described in [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>]) with the M flag set to 1, the IPv6
           CE router MUST do DHCPv6 address assignment (request an IA_NA
           option).

   WAA-7:  If the IPv6 CE router is unable to assign address(es) through
           SLAAC, it MAY do DHCPv6 address assignment (request an IA_NA
           option) even if the M flag is set to 0.

   WAA-8:  If the IPv6 CE router does not acquire global IPv6
           address(es) from either SLAAC or DHCPv6, then it MUST create
           global IPv6 address(es) from its delegated prefix(es) and
           configure those on one of its internal virtual network
           interfaces.

   WAA-9:  As a router, the IPv6 CE router MUST follow the weak host
           (Weak ES) model [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>].  When originating packets from an
           interface, it will use a source address from another one of
           its interfaces if the outgoing interface does not have an
           address of suitable scope.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6204">RFC 6204</a>               IPv6 CE Router Requirements            April 2011</span>


   Prefix delegation requirements:

   WPD-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 prefix delegation
           requesting router behavior as specified in [<a href="./rfc3633" title='"IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"'>RFC3633</a>] (IA_PD
           option).

   WPD-2:  The IPv6 CE router MAY indicate as a hint to the delegating
           router the size of the prefix it requires.  If so, it MUST
           ask for a prefix large enough to assign one /64 for each of
           its interfaces, rounded up to the nearest nibble, and MUST be
           configurable to ask for more.

   WPD-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST be prepared to accept a delegated
           prefix size different from what is given in the hint.  If the
           delegated prefix is too small to address all of its
           interfaces, the IPv6 CE router SHOULD log a system management
           error.

   WPD-4:  The IPv6 CE router MUST always initiate DHCPv6 prefix
           delegation, regardless of the M and O flags in a received
           Router Advertisement message.

   WPD-5:  If the IPv6 CE router initiates DHCPv6 before receiving a
           Router Advertisement, it MUST also request an IA_NA option in
           DHCPv6.

   WPD-6:  If the delegated prefix(es) are aggregate route(s) of
           multiple, more-specific routes, the IPv6 CE router MUST
           discard packets that match the aggregate route(s), but not
           any of the more-specific routes.  In other words, the next
           hop for the aggregate route(s) should be the null
           destination.  This is necessary to prevent forwarding loops
           when some addresses covered by the aggregate are not
           reachable [<a href="./rfc4632" title='"Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan"'>RFC4632</a>].

           (a)  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD send an ICMPv6 Destination
                Unreachable message in accordance with <a href="./rfc4443#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of
                [RFC4443]</a> back to the source of the packet, if the
                packet is to be dropped due to this rule.

   WPD-7:  If the IPv6 CE router requests both an IA_NA and an IA_PD
           option in DHCPv6, it MUST accept an IA_PD option in DHCPv6
           Advertise/Reply messages, even if the message does not
           contain any addresses.

   WPD-8:  By default, an IPv6 CE router MUST NOT initiate any dynamic
           routing protocol on its WAN interface.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6204">RFC 6204</a>               IPv6 CE Router Requirements            April 2011</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20LAN-Side%20Configuration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  LAN-Side Configuration</span>

   The IPv6 CE router distributes configuration information obtained
   during WAN interface provisioning to IPv6 hosts and assists IPv6
   hosts in obtaining IPv6 addresses.  It also supports connectivity of
   these devices in the absence of any working WAN interface.

   An IPv6 CE router is expected to support an IPv6 end-user network and
   IPv6 hosts that exhibit the following characteristics:

   1.  Link-local addresses may be insufficient for allowing IPv6
       applications to communicate with each other in the end-user
       network.  The IPv6 CE router will need to enable this
       communication by providing globally scoped unicast addresses or
       ULAs [<a href="./rfc4193" title='"Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses"'>RFC4193</a>], whether or not WAN connectivity exists.

   2.  IPv6 hosts should be capable of using SLAAC and may be capable of
       using DHCPv6 for acquiring their addresses.

   3.  IPv6 hosts may use DHCPv6 for other configuration information,
       such as the DNS_SERVERS option for acquiring DNS information.

   Unless otherwise specified, the following requirements apply to the
   IPv6 CE router's LAN interfaces only.

   ULA requirements:

   ULA-1:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD be capable of generating a ULA
           prefix [<a href="./rfc4193" title='"Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses"'>RFC4193</a>].

   ULA-2:  An IPv6 CE router with a ULA prefix MUST maintain this prefix
           consistently across reboots.

   ULA-3:  The value of the ULA prefix SHOULD be user-configurable.

   ULA-4:  By default, the IPv6 CE router MUST act as a site border
           router according to <a href="./rfc4193#section-4.3">Section 4.3 of [RFC4193]</a> and filter
           packets with local IPv6 source or destination addresses
           accordingly.

   ULA-5:  An IPv6 CE router MUST NOT advertise itself as a default
           router with a Router Lifetime greater than zero whenever all
           of its configured and delegated prefixes are ULA prefixes.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6204">RFC 6204</a>               IPv6 CE Router Requirements            April 2011</span>


   LAN requirements:

   L-1:   The IPv6 CE router MUST support router behavior according to
          Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

   L-2:   The IPv6 CE router MUST assign a separate /64 from its
          delegated prefix(es) (and ULA prefix if configured to provide
          ULA addressing) for each of its LAN interfaces.

   L-3:   An IPv6 CE router MUST advertise itself as a router for the
          delegated prefix(es) (and ULA prefix if configured to provide
          ULA addressing) using the "Route Information Option" specified
          in <a href="./rfc4191#section-2.3">Section 2.3 of [RFC4191]</a>.  This advertisement is
          independent of having or not having IPv6 connectivity on the
          WAN interface.

   L-4:   An IPv6 CE router MUST NOT advertise itself as a default
          router with a Router Lifetime [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] greater than zero if
          it has no prefixes configured or delegated to it.

   L-5:   The IPv6 CE router MUST make each LAN interface an advertising
          interface according to [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

   L-6:   In Router Advertisement messages, the Prefix Information
          option's A and L flags MUST be set to 1 by default.

   L-7:   The A and L flags' settings SHOULD be user-configurable.

   L-8:   The IPv6 CE router MUST support a DHCPv6 server capable of
          IPv6 address assignment according to [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>] OR a stateless
          DHCPv6 server according to [<a href="./rfc3736" title='"Stateless Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Service for IPv6"'>RFC3736</a>] on its LAN interfaces.

   L-9:   Unless the IPv6 CE router is configured to support the DHCPv6
          IA_NA option, it SHOULD set the M flag to 0 and the O flag to
          1 in its Router Advertisement messages [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

   L-10:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support providing DNS information in
          the DHCPv6 DNS_SERVERS and DOMAIN_LIST options [<a href="./rfc3646" title='"DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3646</a>].

   L-11:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support providing DNS information in
          the Router Advertisement Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) and DNS
          Search List (DNSSL) options as specified in [<a href="./rfc6106" title='"IPv6 Router Advertisement Options for DNS Configuration"'>RFC6106</a>].

   L-12:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD make available a subset of DHCPv6
          options (as listed in <a href="./rfc3736#section-5.3">Section 5.3 of [RFC3736]</a>) received from
          the DHCPv6 client on its WAN interface to its LAN-side DHCPv6
          server.

   L-13:  If the delegated prefix changes, i.e., the current prefix is
          replaced with a new prefix without any overlapping time
          period, then the IPv6 CE router MUST immediately advertise the
          old prefix with a Preferred Lifetime of zero and a Valid
          Lifetime of the lower of the current Valid Lifetime and 2
          hours (which must be decremented in real time) in a Router
          Advertisement message as described in <a href="#section-5.5.3">Section 5.5.3</a>, (e) of
          [<a href="./rfc4862" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>].

   L-14:  The IPv6 CE router MUST send an ICMP Destination Unreachable
          message, code 5 (Source address failed ingress/egress policy)
          for packets forwarded to it that use an address from a prefix
          that has been deprecated.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" id="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   It is considered a best practice to filter obviously malicious
   traffic (e.g., spoofed packets, "Martian" addresses, etc.).  Thus,
   the IPv6 CE router ought to support basic stateless egress and
   ingress filters.  The CE router is also expected to offer mechanisms
   to filter traffic entering the customer network; however, the method
   by which vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond
   the scope of this document.

   Security requirements:

   S-1:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support [<a href="./rfc6092" title='"Recommended Simple Security Capabilities in Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) for Providing Residential IPv6 Internet Service"'>RFC6092</a>].  In particular,
         the IPv6 CE router SHOULD support functionality sufficient for
         implementing the set of recommendations in <a href="./rfc6092#section-4">[RFC6092],
         Section 4</a>.  This document takes no position on whether such
         functionality is enabled by default or mechanisms by which
         users would configure it.

   S-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support ingress filtering in accordance
         with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp38">BCP 38</a> [<a href="./rfc2827" title='"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing"'>RFC2827</a>].
