Abstract

   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a very simple TRIVIAL
   protocol that has been in use on the Internet for quite a long time.
   While this document discourages its continued use, largely due to
   security concerns, we do define a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme, as well as discuss the protocol's applicability.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) has been around for quite
   some time.  Its common uses are to initially configure devices or to
   load new versions of operating system code [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The TFTP Protocol (Revision 2)"'>1</a>].  As devices begin to
   adopt use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and Uniform Resource
   Locators (URLs), for completeness we specify a way to reference files
   that is still quite common.  Use of a URI is a convenient way to
   indicate underlying mechanism, server name or address, and file name.

   WHILE WE DEFINE THE TFTP URI TYPE, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THE
   CONTINUED USE OF TFTP, FOR REASONS LISTED IN <a href="#section-5">SECTION 5</a> (amongst
   others).  The definition of a URI merely allows tools that currently
   use protocols such as TFTP to have a standard name space and
   structure where one can understand the process used to resolve that
   name.  Indeed it is hoped that the definition of this URI will ease
   transition to modern file transfer mechanisms.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Syntax%20of%20a%20TFTP%20URI"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Syntax of a TFTP URI</span>

   A TFTP URI has the following ABNF syntax [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>2</a>]:

   tftpURI         = "tftp://" host "/" file [ mode ]
   mode            = ";"  "mode=" ( "netascii" / "octet" )
   file            = *( unreserved / escaped )
   host            = &lt;as specified by <a href="./rfc2732">RFC 2732</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title="&quot;Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's&quot;">3</a>]&gt;
   unreserved      = &lt;as specified in <a href="./rfc2396">RFC 2396</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax"'>4</a>]&gt;
   escaped         = &lt;as specified in <a href="./rfc2396">RFC 2396</a>&gt;

   A TFTP URI specifies a file that is to be found or placed on a TFTP
   server.  The "mode" option is an option indicating how the file is to
   be transferred.  If left unspecified, the mode is assumed to be
   "octet".  A third "mail" mode was deprecated at the time <a href="./rfc1350">RFC 1350</a> was
   adopted, and is not specified.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Encoding%20Rules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Encoding Rules</span>

   Aside from syntax as described above, the TFTP protocol does not
   specify length limits to either file names or file sizes.  In the
   case of file names, they may contain any character so long as those
   characters are properly escaped as described above.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Semantics%20and%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Semantics and Operations</span>

   As previously stated the TFTP URI is a reference to a file.  The
   allowed operations on a TFTP URI are read and write.  When a TFTP URI
   is read the underlying mechanisms retrieve the named file via the
   TFTP protocol from the specified host with the optionally specified
   mode.  When a TFTP URI is written the underlying mechanisms transmit
   a file via TFTP to a specified server to either the specified file
   using the optionally specified mode.  No other operations are
   supported.

   Note that it is not possible to retrieve file size information prior
   to retrieval, nor is it possible to determine file existence or
   permissions prior to transfer.  Files transferred may or may not
   arrive intact, as there is no guarantee of reliability or even
   completeness.  See the TFTP standard for more details.  For more
   robust file transfer, consider using either FTP or HTTP [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>5</a>, <a href="#ref-6" title='"File Transfer Protocol"'>6</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Examples</span>

      tftp://example.com/myconfigurationfile;mode=netascii

   This example references file "myconfigurationfile" on server
   "example.com" and requests that the transfer occur in netascii mode.

      tftp://example.com/mystartupfile

   This file references file "mystartupfile" on server "example.com".
   The transfer should occur in octet mode, since no other mode was
   specified.

   Use of TFTP has been historically limited to those devices where a
   more full protocol stack is impractical due to either memory or CPU
   constraints.  While this still may be the case with a toaster, it is
   unlikely to be the case for even the simplest piece of network
   support hardware, such as simple routers or switches.  There are a
   myriad of reasons to use some protocol other than TFTP, only a few of
   which are listed below.

   TFTP has no mechanism for access control within the protocol, and
   there is no protection from a man in the middle attack.
   Implementations are left to their own devices in this area.  Because
   TFTP has no way to determine file sizes in advance, implementations
   should be prepared to properly check the bounds of transfers so that
   neither memory nor disk limitations are exceeded.

   TFTP is not well suited to large files for the following reasons.
   TFTP has no inherent integrity check.  There is no way to determine
   what one side sent is what the other received.  There is no way to
   restart TFTP transfers from anywhere other than the beginning.  TFTP
   is a lock step protocol.  Only one packet may be in flight at any one
   time.  There is no slow start or smart backoff mechanism in TFTP, but
   very simple timeouts.

   TFTP is not well suited to file transfers across administrative
   domains.  For one thing, TFTP utilizes UDP, and many NATs will not
   either support or allow TFTP transfers.  More likely firewalls will
   prohibit transfers.

   There are no caching semantics within TFTP.  There is no safe way to
   cache information using the TFTP protocol.

   In summary, use of TFTP is strongly discouraged except in the most
   limited of circumstances where memory and CPU are at the highest
   premium.
