   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is emerging as an attractive
   public-key cryptosystem that provides security equivalent to
   currently popular public-key mechanisms such as RSA and DSA with
   smaller key sizes [<a href="#ref-LENSTRA" title='"Selecting Cryptographic Key Sizes"'>LENSTRA</a>] [<a href="#ref-NISTSP80057" title='"Recommendation on Key Management"'>NISTSP80057</a>].

   Currently, [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>] permits the use of ECC algorithms but it does
   not specify how ECC parameters are chosen or how to derive the shared
   key for key delivery using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE1363" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>IEEE1363</a>] [<a href="#ref-X9.63" title='"Public Key Cryptography for the Financial Services Industry: Key Agreement and Key Transport using Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>X9.63</a>].

   This document describes how to use Elliptic Curve certificates,
   Elliptic Curve signature schemes, and ECDH with [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>].  However,
   it should be noted that there is no syntactic or semantic change to
   the existing [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>] messages.  Both the client and the Key
   Distribution Center (KDC) contribute one ECDH key pair using the key
   agreement protocol described in this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Schemes"></a>    Schemes</span>

   ECC certificates and signature schemes can be used in the
   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [<a href="./rfc3852" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC3852</a>] [<a href="./rfc3278" title='"Use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Algorithms in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC3278</a>] content type
   'SignedData'.

   X.509 certificates [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>] that contain ECC public keys or are
   signed using ECC signature schemes MUST comply with [<a href="./rfc3279" title='"Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC3279</a>].

   The signatureAlgorithm field of the CMS data type 'SignerInfo' can
   contain one of the following ECC signature algorithm identifiers:

      ecdsa-with-Sha1   [<a href="./rfc3279" title='"Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC3279</a>]
      ecdsa-with-Sha256 [<a href="#ref-X9.62" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>X9.62</a>]
      ecdsa-with-Sha384 [<a href="#ref-X9.62" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>X9.62</a>]
      ecdsa-with-Sha512 [<a href="#ref-X9.62" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>X9.62</a>]

   The corresponding digestAlgorithm field contains one of the following
   hash algorithm identifiers respectively:

      id-sha1           [<a href="./rfc3279" title='"Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC3279</a>]

   Namely, id-sha1 MUST be used in conjunction with ecdsa-with-Sha1,

   id-sha512 MUST be used in conjunction with ecdsa-with-Sha512.

   Implementations of this specification MUST support ecdsa-with-Sha256
   and SHOULD support ecdsa-with-Sha1.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Using%20the%20ECDH%20Key%20Exchange"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Using the ECDH Key Exchange</span>

   This section describes how ECDH can be used as the Authentication
   Service (AS) reply key delivery method [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>].  Note that the
   protocol description here is similar to that of Modular Exponential
   Diffie-Hellman (MODP DH), as described in [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>].

   If the client wishes to use the ECDH key agreement method, it encodes
   its ECDH public key value and the key's domain parameters [<a href="#ref-IEEE1363" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>IEEE1363</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-X9.63" title='"Public Key Cryptography for the Financial Services Industry: Key Agreement and Key Transport using Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>X9.63</a>] in clientPublicValue of the PA-PK-AS-REQ message [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>].

   As described in [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>], the ECDH domain parameters for the
   client's public key are specified in the algorithm field of the type
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo [<a href="./rfc3279" title='"Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC3279</a>] and the client's ECDH public key value
   is mapped to a subjectPublicKey (a BIT STRING) according to
   [<a href="./rfc3279" title='"Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC3279</a>].

   The following algorithm identifier is used to identify the client's
   choice of the ECDH key agreement method for key delivery.

        id-ecPublicKey  (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman [<a href="./rfc3279" title='"Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC3279</a>])

   If the domain parameters are not accepted by the KDC, the KDC sends
   back an error message [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] with the code
   KDC_ERR_DH_KEY_PARAMETERS_NOT_ACCEPTED [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>].  This error message
   contains the list of domain parameters acceptable to the KDC.  This
   list is encoded as TD-DH-PARAMETERS [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>], and it is in the KDC's
   decreasing preference order.  The client can then pick a set of
   domain parameters from the list and retry the authentication.

   Both the client and the KDC MUST have local policy that specifies
   which set of domain parameters are acceptable if they do not have a
   priori knowledge of the chosen domain parameters.  The need for such
   local policy is explained in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.




<span class="grey">Zhu, et al.                  Informational                      [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5349">RFC 5349</a>                 ECC Support for PKINIT           September 2008</span>


   If the ECDH domain parameters are accepted by the KDC, the KDC sends
   back its ECDH public key value in the subjectPublicKey field of the
   PA-PK-AS-REP message [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>].

   As described in [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>], the KDC's ECDH public key value is encoded
   as a BIT STRING according to [<a href="./rfc3279" title='"Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC3279</a>].

   Note that in the steps above, the client can indicate to the KDC that
   it wishes to reuse ECDH keys or it can allow the KDC to do so, by
   including the clientDHNonce field in the request [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>]; the KDC
   can then reuse the ECDH keys and include the serverDHNonce field in
   the reply [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>].  This logic is the same as that of the Modular
   Exponential Diffie-Hellman key agreement method [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>].

   If ECDH is negotiated as the key delivery method, then the
   PA-PK-AS-REP and AS reply key are generated as in <a href="./rfc4556#section-3.2.3.1">Section 3.2.3.1 of
   [RFC4556]</a> with the following difference: The ECDH shared secret value
   (an elliptic curve point) is calculated using operation ECSVDP-DH as
   described in Section 7.2.1 of [<a href="#ref-IEEE1363" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>IEEE1363</a>].  The x-coordinate of this
   point is converted to an octet string using operation FE2OSP as
   described in Section 5.5.4 of [<a href="#ref-IEEE1363" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>IEEE1363</a>].  This octet string is the
   DHSharedSecret.

   Both the client and KDC then proceed as described in [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>].

   Lastly, it should be noted that ECDH can be used with any
   certificates and signature schemes.  However, a significant advantage
   of using ECDH together with ECC certificates and signature schemes is
   that the ECC domain parameters in the client certificates or the KDC
   certificates can be used.  This obviates the need of locally
   preconfigured domain parameters as described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Choosing%20the%20Domain%20Parameters%20and%20the%20Key%20Size"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Choosing the Domain Parameters and the Key Size</span>

   The domain parameters and the key size should be chosen so as to
   provide sufficient cryptographic security [<a href="./rfc3766" title='"Determining Strengths For Public Keys Used For Exchanging Symmetric Keys"'>RFC3766</a>].  The following
   table, based on table 2 on page 63 of NIST SP800-57 part 1
   [<a href="#ref-NISTSP80057" title='"Recommendation on Key Management"'>NISTSP80057</a>], gives approximate comparable key sizes for symmetric-
   and asymmetric-key cryptosystems based on the best-known algorithms
   for attacking them.

                   128        |  256 - 383 |   3072
                   192        |  384 - 511 |   7680
                   256        |  512+      |  15360

                Table 1: Comparable key sizes (in bits)

   Thus, for example, when securing a 128-bit symmetric key, it is
   prudent to use 256-bit Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), e.g., group
   P-256 (secp256r1) as described below.

   A set of ECDH domain parameters is also known as a "curve".  A curve
   is a "named curve" if the domain parameters are well known and can be
   identified by an Object Identifier; otherwise, it is called a "custom
   curve".  [<a href="./rfc4556" title='"Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)"'>RFC4556</a>] supports both named curves and custom curves, see
   <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> on the tradeoffs of choosing between named curves and
   custom curves.

   The named curves recommended in this document are also recommended by
   the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)[<a href="#ref-FIPS186-2" title='"Digital Signature Standard"'>FIPS186-2</a>].
   These fifteen ECC curves are given in the following table [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-2" title='"Digital Signature Standard"'>FIPS186-2</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-SEC2" title='"SEC 2 - Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters"'>SEC2</a>].

   Implementations conforming to this specification MUST support curve
   P-256 and P-384.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   When using ECDH key agreement, the recipient of an elliptic curve
   public key should perform the checks described in IEEE P1363, Section
   A16.10 [<a href="#ref-IEEE1363" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>IEEE1363</a>].  It is especially important, if the recipient is
   using a long-term ECDH private key, to check that the sender's public
   key is a valid point on the correct elliptic curve; otherwise,
   information may be leaked about the recipient's private key, and
   iterating the attack will eventually completely expose the
   recipient's private key.

   Kerberos error messages are not integrity protected; as a result, the
   domain parameters sent by the KDC as TD-DH-PARAMETERS can be tampered
   with by an attacker so that the set of domain parameters selected
   could be either weaker or not mutually preferred.  Local policy can
   configure sets of domain parameters that are acceptable locally or
   can disallow the negotiation of ECDH domain parameters.

   Beyond elliptic curve size, the main issue is elliptic curve
   structure.  As a general principle, it is more conservative to use
   elliptic curves with as little algebraic structure as possible.
   Thus, random curves are more conservative than special curves (such
   as Koblitz curves), and curves over F_p with p random are more
   conservative than curves over F_p with p of a special form.  (Also,
   curves over F_p with p random might be considered more conservative
   than curves over F_2^m, as there is no choice between multiple fields
   of similar size for characteristic 2.)  Note, however, that algebraic
   structure can also lead to implementation efficiencies, and
   implementors and users may, therefore, need to balance conservatism
   against a need for efficiency.  Concrete attacks are known against
   only very few special classes of curves, such as supersingular
   curves, and these classes are excluded from the ECC standards such as
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE1363" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>IEEE1363</a>] and [<a href="#ref-X9.62" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>X9.62</a>].

   Another issue is the potential for catastrophic failures when a
   single elliptic curve is widely used.  In this case, an attack on the
   elliptic curve might result in the compromise of a large number of
   keys.  Again, this concern may need to be balanced against efficiency
   and interoperability improvements associated with widely used curves.
   Substantial additional information on elliptic curve choice can be
