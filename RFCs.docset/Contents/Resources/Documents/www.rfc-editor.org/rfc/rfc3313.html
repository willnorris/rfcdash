Abstract

   This document describes the need for Quality of Service (QoS) and
   media authorization and defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   extension that can be used to integrate QoS admission control with
   call signaling and help guard against denial of service attacks.  The
   use of this extension is only applicable in administrative domains,
   or among federations of administrative domains with previously
   agreed-upon policies, where both the SIP proxy authorizing the QoS,
   and the policy control of the underlying network providing the QoS,
   belong to that administrative domain or federation of domains.

   This document defines a SIP extension that can be used to integrate
   QoS admission control with call signaling and help guard against
   denial of service attacks.  The use of this extension is only
   applicable in administrative domains, or among federations of
   administrative domains with previously agreed-upon policies, where
   both the SIP proxy authorizing the QoS, and the policy control of the
   underlying network providing the QoS, belong to that administrative
   domain or federation of domains.  Furthermore, the mechanism is
   generally incompatible with end-to-end encryption of message bodies
   that describe media sessions.

   This is in contrast with general Internet principles, which separate
   data transport from applications.  Thus, the solution described in
   this document is not applicable to the Internet at large.  Despite
   these limitations, there are sufficiently useful specialized
   deployments that meet the assumptions described above, and can accept
   the limitations that result, to warrant informational publication of
   this mechanism.  An example deployment would be a closed network,

   Current IP telephony systems assume a perfect world in which there is
   either an unlimited amount of bandwidth, or network layer Quality of
   Service (QoS) is provided without any kind of policy control.
   However, the reality is that end-to-end bandwidth is not unlimited
   and uncontrolled access to QoS, in general, is unlikely.  The primary
   reason for this is that QoS provides preferential treatment of one
   flow, at the expense of another.  Consequently, it is important to
   have policy control over whether a given flow should have access to
   QoS.  This will not only enable fairness in general, but can also
   prevent denial of service attacks.

   In this document, we are concerned with providing QoS for media
   streams established via the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [<a href="#ref-3" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>3</a>].
   We assume an architecture that integrates call signaling with media
   authorization, as illustrated in the Figure below.  The solid lines
   (A and B) show interfaces, whereas the dotted line (C) illustrates
   the QoS enabled media flow:

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3313">RFC 3313</a>         SIP Extensions for Media Authorization     January 2003</span>


   In this architecture, we assume a SIP UA connected to a QoS enabled
   network with an edge router acting as a Policy Enforcement Point
   (PEP) [<a href="#ref-6" title='"A Framework for Policy-based Admission Control"'>6</a>].  We further assume that a SIP UA that wishes to obtain QoS
   initiates sessions through a proxy which can interface with the QoS
   policy control for the data network being used.  We will refer to
   such a proxy as a QoS enabled proxy.  We assume that the SIP UA needs
   to present an authorization token to the network in order to obtain
   Quality of Service (C).  The SIP UA obtains this authorization token
   via SIP (A) from the QoS enabled proxy by means of an extension SIP
   header, defined in this document.  The proxy, in turn, communicates
   either directly with the edge router or with a Policy Decision Point
   (PDP - not shown) [<a href="#ref-6" title='"A Framework for Policy-based Admission Control"'>6</a>] in order to obtain a suitable authorization
   token for the UA.

   Examples of access data networks, where such a QoS enabled proxy
   could be used, include DOCSIS based cable networks and 3rd generation
   (3G) wireless networks.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Overview</span>

   A session that needs to obtain QoS for the media streams in
   accordance with our basic architecture described above goes through
   the following steps.

   The SIP UA sends an INVITE to the QoS enabled proxy, which for each
   resulting dialog includes one or more media authorization tokens in
   all unreliable provisional responses (except 100), the first reliable
   1xx or 2xx response, and all retransmissions of that reliable
   response for the dialog.  When the UA requests QoS, it includes the
   media authorization tokens with the resource reservation.

   A SIP UA may also receive an INVITE from its QoS enabled proxy which
   includes one or more media authorization tokens.  In that case, when
   the UA requests QoS, it includes the media authorization tokens with
   the resource reservation.  The resource reservation mechanism is not
   part of SIP and is not described within the scope of this document.

   This document defines a private SIP header extension to support a
   media authorization scheme.  In this architecture, a QoS enabled SIP
   proxy supplies the UA with one or more authorization tokens which are
   to be used in QoS requests.  The extension defined allows network QoS
   resources to be authorized by the QoS enabled SIP proxy.

   A new P-Media-Authorization general header field is defined.  The P-
   Media-Authorization header field contains one or more media
   authorization tokens which are to be included in subsequent resource
   reservations for the media flows associated with the session, that
   is, passed to an independent resource reservation mechanism, which is
   not specified here.  The media authorization tokens are used for
   authorizing QoS for the media stream(s).  The P-Media-Authorization
   header field is described by the following ABNF [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>4</a>]:

      P-Media-Authorization   = "P-Media-Authorization" HCOLON
                                  P-Media-Authorization-Token
                                  *(COMMA P-Media-Authorization-Token)

      P-Media-Authorization-Token = 1*HEXDIG

   Table 1 below is an extension of tables 2 and 3 in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>3</a>] for the new
   header field defined here.  For informational purposes, this table

   The P-Media-Authorization header field can be used only in SIP
   requests or responses that can carry a SIP offer or answer.  This
   naturally keeps the scope of this header field narrow.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.1%20User%20Agent%20Client%20%28UAC%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.1" id="section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a> User Agent Client (UAC)</span>

   The initial SIP INVITE message, mid-call messages that result in
   network QoS resource changes, and mid-call changes in call
   destination should be authorized.  These SIP messages are sent
   through the QoS enabled proxies to receive this authorization.  In
   order to authorize QoS, the QoS enabled SIP proxy MAY need to inspect
   message bodies that describe the media streams (e.g., SDP).  Hence,
   it is recommended (as may be appropriate within the applicability
   scope in <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> of this document) that such message bodies not be
   encrypted end-to-end.

   The P-Media-Authorization-Token, which is contained in the P-Media-
   Authorization header, is included for each dialog in all unreliable
   provisional responses (except 100), the first reliable 1xx or 2xx
   response, and all retransmissions of that reliable response for the
   dialog sent by the QoS enabled SIP proxy to the UAC.

   The UAC should use all the P-Media-Authorization-Tokens from the most
   recent request/response that contained the P-Media-Authorization
   header when requesting QoS for the associated media stream(s).  This
   applies to both initial and subsequent refresh reservation messages
   (for example, in an RSVP-based reservation system).  A reservation
   function within the UAC should convert each string of hex digits into
   binary, and utilize each result as a Policy-Element, as defined in
   <a href="./rfc2750">RFC 2750</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"RSVP Extensions for Policy Control"'>5</a>] (excluding Length, but including P-Type which is
   included in each token).  These Policy-Elements would typically
   contain the authorizing entity and credentials, and be used in an
   RSVP request for media data stream QoS resources.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.2%20User%20Agent%20Server%20%28UAS%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.2" id="section-5.2.2">5.2.2</a> User Agent Server (UAS)</span>

   The User Agent Server receives the P-Media-Authorization-Token in an
   INVITE (or other) message from the QoS enabled SIP proxy.  If the
   response contains a message body that describes media streams for
   which the UA desires QoS, it is recommended (as may be appropriate
   within the applicability scope in <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> of this document) that
   this message body not be encrypted end-to-end.

   The UAS should use all the P-Media-Authorization-Tokens from the most
   recent request/response that contained the P-Media-Authorization
   header when requesting QoS for the associated media stream(s).  This
   applies both to initial and subsequent refresh reservation messages
   (for example, in an RSVP-based reservation system).  A reservation
   function within the UAS should convert each string of hex digits into
   binary, and utilize each result as a Policy-Element, as defined in
   <a href="./rfc2750">RFC 2750</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"RSVP Extensions for Policy Control"'>5</a>] (excluding Length, but including P-Type which is

   contain the authorizing entity and credentials, and be used in an
   RSVP request for media data stream QoS resources.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.3%20Originating%20Proxy%20%28OP%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.3" id="section-5.2.3">5.2.3</a> Originating Proxy (OP)</span>

   When the originating QoS enabled proxy (OP) receives an INVITE (or
   other) message from the UAC, the proxy authenticates the caller, and
   verifies that the caller is authorized to receive QoS.

   In cooperation with an originating Policy Decision Point (PDP-o), the
   OP obtains and/or generates one or more media authorization tokens.
   These contain sufficient information for the UAC to get the
   authorized QoS for the media streams.  Each media authorization token
   is formatted as a Policy-Element, as defined in <a href="./rfc2750">RFC 2750</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"RSVP Extensions for Policy Control"'>5</a>]
   (excluding Length, but including P-Type which is included in each
   token), and then converted to a string of hex digits to form a P-
   Media-Authorization-Token.  The proxy's resource management function
   may inspect message bodies that describe the media streams (e.g.,
   SDP), in both requests and responses in order to decide what QoS to
   authorize.

   For each dialog that results from the INVITE (or other) message
   received from the UAC, the originating proxy must add a P-Media-
   Authorization header with the P-Media-Authorization-Token in all
   unreliable provisional responses (except 100), the first reliable 1xx
   or 2xx response, and all retransmissions of that reliable response
   the proxy sends to the UAC, if that response may result in network
   QoS changes.  A response with an SDP may result in such changes.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.4%20Destination%20Proxy%20%28DP%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.4" id="section-5.2.4">5.2.4</a> Destination Proxy (DP)</span>

   The Destination QoS Enabled Proxy (DP) verifies that the called party
   is authorized to receive QoS.

   In cooperation with a terminating Policy Decision Point (PDP-t), the
   DP obtains and/or generates a media authorization token that contains
   sufficient information for the UAS to get the authorized QoS for the
   media streams.  The media authorization token is formatted as a
   Policy-Element, as defined in <a href="./rfc2750">RFC 2750</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"RSVP Extensions for Policy Control"'>5</a>] (excluding Length, but
   including P-Type which is included in each token), and then converted
   to a string of hex digits to form a P-Media-Authorization-Token.  The
   proxy's resource management function may inspect message bodies that
   describe the media streams (e.g., SDP), in both requests and
   responses in order to decide what QoS to authorize.

   The Destination Proxy must add the P-Media-Authorization header with
   the P-Media-Authorization-Token in the INVITE (or other) request that
   it sends to the UAS if that message may result in network QoS
   changes.  A message with an SDP body may result in such changes.

   Below we provide an example of how the P-Media-Authorization header
   field can be used in conjunction with the Resource Reservation
   Protocol (RSVP) [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1 Functional Specification"'>7</a>].  The example assumes that an offer arrives in
   the initial INVITE and an answer arrives in a reliable provisional
   response [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Reliability of Provisional Responses in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>9</a>], which contains an SDP description of the media flow.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.1%20User%20Agent%20Client%20Side"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1.1" id="section-6.1.1">6.1.1</a> User Agent Client Side</span>

   Figure 2 presents a high-level overview of a basic call flow with
   media authorization from the viewpoint of the UAC.  Some policy
   interactions have been omitted for brevity.

   When a user goes off-hook and dials a telephone number, the UAC
   collects the dialed digits and sends the initial (1)INVITE message to
   the originating SIP proxy.

   The originating SIP proxy (OP) authenticates the user/UAC and
   forwards the (2)INVITE message to the proper SIP proxy.

   Assuming the call is not forwarded, the terminating end-point sends a
   (3)18x response to the initial INVITE via OP.  Included in this
   response is an indication of the negotiated bandwidth requirement for
   the connection (in the form of an SDP description [<a href="#ref-8" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>8</a>]).

   When OP receives the (3)18x, it has sufficient information regarding
   the end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange.
   It initiates a Policy-Setup message to PDP-o, (4)AuthProfile.

   The PDP-o stores the authorized media description in its local store,
   generates an authorization token that points to this description, and
   returns the authorization token to the OP, (5)AuthToken.

             Figure 2 - Media Authorization with RSVP (UAC)

   The OP includes the authorization token in the P-Media-Authorization
   header extension of the (6)18x message.






<span class="grey">Marshall, Ed.                Informational                      [Page 9]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3313">RFC 3313</a>         SIP Extensions for Media Authorization     January 2003</span>


   Upon receipt of the (6)18x message, the UAC stores the media
   authorization token from the P-Media-Authorization header.  Also, the
   UAC acknowledges the 18x message by sending a (7)PRACK message, which
   is responded to with (10) 200.

   Before sending any media, the UAC requests QoS by sending an
   (11)RSVP-PATH message, which includes the previously stored P-Media-
   Authorization-Token as a Policy-Element.

   ER-o, upon receipt of the (11)RSVP-PATH message, checks the
   authorization through a PDP-o COPS message exchange, (12)REQ.  PDP-o
   checks the authorization using the stored authorized media
   description that was linked to the authorization token it returned to
   OP.  If authorization is successful, PDP-o returns an "install"
   Decision, (13)DEC.

   ER-o checks the admissibility for the request, and if admission
   succeeds, it forwards the (14)RSVP-PATH message.

   Once UAC receives the (15)RSVP-PATH message from UAS, it sends the
   (16)RSVP-RESV message to reserve the network resources.

   ER-o, upon receiving the (16)RSVP-RESV message checks the
   authorization through a PDP-o COPS message exchange, (17)REQ.  PDP-o
   checks the authorization using the stored authorized media
   description that was linked to the authorization token it returned to
   OP.  If authorization is successful, PDP-o returns an "install"
   Decision, (18)DEC.

   ER-o checks the admissibility for the request, and if admission
   succeeds, it forwards the (19)RSVP-RESV message.

   Upon receiving the (20)RSVP-RESV message, network resources have been
   reserved in both directions.

   Figure 3 presents a high-level overview of a call flow with media
   authorization from the viewpoint of the UAS.  Some policy
   interactions have been omitted for brevity.

   Since the destination SIP proxy (DP) has sufficient information
   regarding the endpoints, bandwidth, and characteristics of the media
   exchange, it initiates a Policy-Setup message to the terminating
   Policy Decision Point (PDP-t) on receipt of the (1)INVITE.

              Figure 3 - Media Authorization with RSVP (UAS)

   PDP-t stores the authorized media description in its local store,
   generates an authorization token that points to this description, and
   returns the authorization token to DP.  The token is placed in the
   (4)INVITE message and forwarded to the UAS.




<span class="grey">Marshall, Ed.                Informational                     [Page 11]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3313">RFC 3313</a>         SIP Extensions for Media Authorization     January 2003</span>


   Assuming that the call is not forwarded, the UAS sends a (5)18x
   response to the initial INVITE message, which is forwarded back to
   UAC.  At the same time, the UAS sends a (7)RSVP-PATH message which
   includes the previously stored P-Media-Authorization-Token as a
   Policy-Element.

   ER-t, upon receiving the (7)RSVP-PATH message checks the
   authorization through a PDP-t COPS message exchange.  PDP-t checks
   the authorization using the stored authorized media description that
   was linked to the authorization token it returned to DP.  If
   authorization is successful, PDP-t returns an "install" Decision,
   (9)DEC.

   ER-t checks the admissibility for the request, and if admission
   succeeds, it forwards the (10)RSVP-PATH message.

   Once the UAS receives the (11)RSVP-PATH message, it sends the
   (12)RSVP-RESV message to reserve the network resources.

   ER-t, upon reception of the (12)RSVP-RESV message, checks the
   authorization through a PDP-t COPS message exchange.  PDP-t checks
   the authorization using the stored authorized media description that
   was linked to the authorization token that it returned to DP.  If
   authorization is successful, PDP-t returns an "install" Decision,
   (14)DEC.

   ER-t checks the admissibility for the request and if admission
   succeeds, it forwards the (15)RSVP-RESV message.

   Upon receiving the (16)RSVP-RESV message, network resources have been
   reserved in both directions.

   For completeness, we show the (17)PRACK message for the (5) 18x
   response and the resulting (19) 200 response acknowledging the PRACK.

   The use of media authorization makes it possible to control the usage
   of network resources.  In turn, this makes IP Telephony more robust
   against denial of service attacks and various kinds of service
   frauds.  By using the authorization capability, the number of flows,
   and the amount of network resources reserved can be controlled,
   thereby making the IP Telephony system dependable in the presence of
   scarce resources.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   In order to control access to QoS, a QoS enabled proxy should
   authenticate the UA before providing it with a media authorization
   token.  Both the method and policy associated with such
   authentication are outside the scope of this document, however it
   could, for example, be done by using standard SIP authentication
   mechanisms, as described in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>3</a>].

   Media authorization tokens sent in the P-Media-Authorization header
   from a QoS enabled proxy to a UA MUST be protected from eavesdropping
   and tampering.  This can, for example, be done through a mechanism
   such as IPSec or TLS.  However, this will only provide hop-by-hop
   security.  If there is one or more intermediaries (e.g., proxies),
   between the UA and the QoS enabled proxy, these intermediaries will
   have access to the P-Media-Authorization header field value, thereby
   compromising confidentiality and integrity.  This will enable both
   theft-of-service and denial-of-service attacks against the UA.
   Consequently, the P-Media-Authorization header field MUST NOT be
   available to any untrusted intermediary in the clear or without
   integrity protection.  There is currently no mechanism defined in SIP
   that would satisfy these requirements.  Until such a mechanism
   exists, proxies MUST NOT send P-Media-Authorization headers through
   untrusted intermediaries, which might reveal or modify the contents
   of this header.  (Note that S/MIME-based encryption in SIP is not
   available to proxy servers, as proxies are not allowed to add message
   bodies.)

   QoS enabled proxies may need to inspect message bodies describing
   media streams (e.g., SDP).  Consequently, such message bodies should
   not be encrypted.  In turn, this will prevent end-to-end
   confidentiality of the said message bodies, which lowers the overall
   security possible.

   This document defines a new private SIP header for media
   authorization, "P-Media-Authorization".  This header has been
   registered by the IANA in the SIP header registry, using the RFC
   number of this document as its reference.
