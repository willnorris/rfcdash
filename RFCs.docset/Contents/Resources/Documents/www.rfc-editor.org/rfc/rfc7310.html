   This document specifies the payload format for packetization of audio
   data encoded with the Standard apt-X or Enhanced apt-X audio coding
   algorithms into the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].

   The document outlines some conventions, a brief description of the
   operating principles of the audio codecs, and the payload format
   capabilities.  The RTP payload format is detailed, and a relevant
   example of the format is provided.  The media type, its mappings to
   SDP [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>], and its usage in the SDP offer/answer model are also
   specified.  Finally, some security considerations are outlined.

   This document registers a media type (audio/aptx) for the RTP payload
   format for the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X audio codecs.

   This document uses the normal IETF bit-order representation.  Bit
   fields in figures are read left to right and then down.  The leftmost
   bit in each field is the most significant.  The numbering starts from
   0 and ascends, where bit 0 will be the most significant.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Standard%20apt-X%20and%20Enhanced%20apt-X%20Codecs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X Codecs</span>

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X are proprietary audio coding
   algorithms, which can be licensed from CSR plc. and are widely
   deployed in a variety of audio processing equipment.  For commercial
   reasons, the detailed internal operations of these algorithms are not
   described in standards or reference documents.  However, the data
   interfaces to implementations of these algorithms are very simple and
   allow easy RTP packetization of data coded with the algorithms
   without detailed knowledge of the actual coded audio stream syntax.

   Both the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coding algorithms are
   based on Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation principles.
   They produce a constant coded bit rate that is scaled according to
   the sample frequency of the uncoded audio.  This constant rate is 1/4
   of the bit rate of the uncoded audio, irrespective of the resolution
   (number of bits) used to represent an uncoded audio sample.  For
   example, a 1.536-Mbit/s stereo audio stream composed of two channels
   of 16-bit Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) audio that is sampled at a
   frequency of 48 kHz is encoded at 384 kbit/s.

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X do not enforce a coded frame
   structure, and the coded data forms a continuous coded sample stream
   with each coded sample capable of regenerating four PCM samples when
   decoded.  The Standard apt-X algorithm encodes four successive 16-bit
   PCM samples from each audio channel into a single 16-bit coded sample
   per audio channel.  The Enhanced apt-X algorithm encodes four
   successive 16-bit or 24-bit PCM samples from each audio channel and
   respectively produces a single 16-bit or 24-bit coded sample per
   channel.  The same RTP packetization rules apply for each of these
   algorithmic variations.

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coded data streams can optionally
   carry synchronization information and an auxiliary data channel
   within the coded audio data without additional overhead.  These
   mechanisms can, for instance, be used when the IP system is cascaded
   with another transportation system and the decoder is acting as a

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7310">RFC 7310</a>                    apt-X RTP Format                   July 2014</span>


   simple bridge between the two systems.  Since auxiliary data channel
   and synchronization information are carried within the coded audio
   data without additional overhead, RTP payload format rules do not
   change if they are present.  Out-of-band signaling is required,
   however, to notify the receiver end when autosync and auxiliary data
   have been embedded in the apt-X stream.

   Embedded auxiliary data is typically used to transport non-audio data
   and timecode information for synchronization with video.  The bit
   rate of the auxiliary data channel is 1/4 of the sample frequency.
   For example, with a single audio channel encoded at Fs = 48 kHz, an
   auxiliary data bit rate of 12 kbit/s can be embedded.

   apt-X further provides a means of stereo-pairing apt-X channels so
   that the embedded autosync and auxiliary data channel can be shared
   across the channel pair.  In the case of a 1.536-Mbit/s stereo audio
   stream composed of two channels of 16-bit PCM audio that is sampled
   at 48 kHz, a byte of auxiliary data would typically be fed into the
   Standard apt-X or Enhanced apt-X encoder once every 32 uncoded left
   channel samples.  By default, apt-X channel-pairing is not enabled.
   Out-of-band signaling is required to notify the receiver when the
   option is being used.

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X decoders that have not been set up
   with the correct embedded autosync, auxiliary data, and
   stereo-pairing information will play out uncoded PCM samples with a
   loss of decoding quality.  In the case of Standard apt-X, the loss of
   quality can be significant.

   Further details on the algorithm operation can be obtained from
   CSR plc.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7310">RFC 7310</a>                    apt-X RTP Format                   July 2014</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Payload%20Format%20Capabilities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Payload Format Capabilities</span>

   This RTP payload format carries an integer number of Standard apt-X
   or Enhanced apt-X coded audio samples.  When multiple related audio
   channels are being conveyed within the payload, each channel
   contributes the same integer number of apt-X coded audio samples to
   the total carried by the payload.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Use%20of%20Forward%20Error%20Correction%20%28FEC%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC)</span>

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X do not inherently provide any
   mechanism for adding redundancy or error-control coding into the
   coded audio stream.  Generic schemes for RTP, such as forward error
   correction as described in <a href="./rfc5109">RFC 5109</a> [<a href="./rfc5109" title='"RTP Payload Format for Generic Forward Error Correction"'>RFC5109</a>] and <a href="./rfc2733">RFC 2733</a> [<a href="./rfc2733" title='"An RTP Payload Format for Generic Forward Error Correction"'>RFC2733</a>],
   can be used to add redundant information to Standard apt-X and
   Enhanced apt-X RTP packet streams, making them more resilient to
   packet losses at the expense of a higher bit rate.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Payload%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Payload Format</span>

   The Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X algorithms encode four
   successive PCM samples from each audio channel and produce a single
   compressed sample for each audio channel.  The encoder MUST be
   presented with an integer number S of input audio samples, where S is
   an arbitrary multiple of 4.  The encoder will produce exactly S/4
   coded audio samples.  Since each coded audio sample is either 16 or
   24 bits, the amount of coded audio data produced upon each invocation
   of the encoding process will be an integer number of bytes.  RTP
   packetization of the encoded data SHALL be on a byte-by-byte basis.

   Utilization of the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coding
   algorithms does not create any special requirements with respect to
   the contents of the RTP packet header.  Other RTP packet header
   fields are defined as follows.

   The RTP payload data for Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X MUST be
   structured as follows.

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coded samples are packed
   contiguously into payload octets in "network byte order", also known
   as big-endian order, and starting with the most significant bit.
   Coded samples are packed into the packet in time sequence, beginning
   with the oldest coded sample.  An integer number of coded samples
   MUST be within the same packet.

   When multiple channels of Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coded
   audio, such as in a stereo program, are multiplexed into a single RTP
   stream, the coded samples from each channel, at a single sampling
   instant, are interleaved into a coded sample block according to the
   following standard audio channel ordering [<a href="./rfc3551" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>].  Coded sample
   blocks are then packed into the packet in time sequence beginning
   with the oldest coded sample block.

   For the two-channel encoding example, the sample sequence is (left
   channel, first sample), (right channel, first sample), (left channel,
   second sample), (right channel, second sample).  Coded samples for
   all channels, belonging to a single coded sampling instant, MUST be
   contained in the same packet.  All channels in the same RTP stream
   MUST be sampled at the same frequency.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.%20%20Default%20Packetization%20Interval"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Default Packetization Interval</span>

   The default packetization interval MUST have a duration of
   4 milliseconds.  When an integer number of coded samples per channel
   cannot be contained within this 4-millisecond interval, the default
   packet interval MUST be rounded down to the nearest packet interval
   that can contain a complete integer set of coded samples.  For
   example, when encoding audio with either Standard apt-X or Enhanced
   apt-X, sampled at 11025 Hz, 22050 Hz, or 44100 Hz, the packetization
   interval MUST be rounded down to 3.99 milliseconds.

   The packetization interval sets limits on the end-to-end delay;
   shorter packets minimize the audio delay through a system at the
   expense of increased bandwidth, while longer packets introduce less
   header overhead but increase delay and make packet loss more
   noticeable.  A default packet interval of 4 milliseconds maintains an
   acceptable ratio of payload to header bytes and minimizes the
   end-to-end delay to allow viable interactive applications based on
   apt-X.  All implementations MUST support this default packetization
   interval.

   An application implementing this payload format MUST understand all
   the payload parameters that are defined in this specification.  Any
   mapping of these parameters to a signaling protocol MUST support all
   parameters.  Implementations can always decide whether they are
   capable of communicating based on the entities defined in this
   specification.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.5.%20%20Payload%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.5" id="section-5.5">5.5</a>.  Payload Example</span>

   As an example payload format, consider the transmission of an
   arbitrary 5.1 audio signal consisting of six channels of 24-bit PCM
   data, sampled at a rate of 48 kHz and packetized on an RTP packet
   interval of 4 milliseconds.  The total bit rate before audio coding
   is 6 * 24 * 48000 = 6.912 Mbit/s.  Applying Enhanced apt-X coding
   with a coded sample size of 24 bits results in a transmitted coded
   bit rate of 1/4 of the uncoded bit rate, i.e., 1.728 Mbit/s.  On
   packet intervals of 4 milliseconds, packets contain 864 bytes of
   encoded data that contain 48 Enhanced apt-X coded samples per
   channel.

   For the example format, the diagram below shows how coded samples
   from each channel are packed into a sample block and how sample
   blocks 1, 2, and 48 are subsequently packed into the RTP packet.

      C:
      Channel index: Left (l) = 1, left center (lc) = 2,
      center (c) = 3, right (r) = 4, right center (rc) = 5,
      and surround (S) = 6.

      T:
      Sample Block time index: The first sample block is 1; the final
      sample is 48.

      S(C)(T):
      The Tth sample from channel C.

   Type name: audio

   Subtype name: aptx

   Required parameters:

      rate:
      RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sampling rate
      in Hz.  RECOMMENDED values for rate are 8000, 11025, 16000,
      22050, 24000, 32000, 44100, and 48000 samples per second.  Other
      values are permissible.

      channels:
      The number of logical audio channels that are present in the
      audio stream.

      variant:
      The variant of apt-X (i.e., Standard or Enhanced) that is being
      used.  The following variants can be signaled:

         variant=standard
         variant=enhanced

      bitresolution:
      The number of bits used by the algorithm to encode four PCM
      samples.  This value MAY only be set to 16 for Standard apt-X
      and 16 or 24 for Enhanced apt-X.

   Optional parameters:

      ptime:
      The recommended length of time (in milliseconds) represented by
      the media in a packet.  Defaults to 4 milliseconds.
      See <a href="./rfc4566#section-6">SectionÂ 6 of [RFC4566]</a>.

      maxptime:
      The maximum amount of media that can be encapsulated in each
      packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  See <a href="./rfc4566#section-6">SectionÂ 6 of
      [RFC4566]</a>.

      stereo-channel-pairs:
      Defines audio channels that are stereo paired in the stream.
      See <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  Each pair of audio channels is defined as two
      comma-separated values that correspond to channel numbers in
      the range 1..channels.  Each stereo channel pair is preceded
      by a '{' and followed by a '}'.  Pairs of audio channels are
      separated by a comma.  A channel MUST NOT be paired with more
      than one other channel.  The absence of this parameter signals
      that each channel has been independently encoded.

      embedded-autosync-channels:
      Defines channels that carry embedded autosync.
      Embedded-autosync-channels is defined as a list of
      comma-separated values that correspond to channel numbers in
      the range 1..channels.  When a channel is stereo paired, embedded
      autosync is shared across channels in the pair.  The first channel
      as defined in stereo-channel-pairs MUST be specified in the
      embedded-autosync-channels list.

      embedded-aux-channels:
      Defines channels that carry embedded auxiliary data.
      Embedded-aux-channels is defined as a list of comma-separated
      values that correspond to channel numbers in the range
      1..channels.  When a channel is stereo paired, embedded auxiliary
      data is shared across channels in the pair.  The second channel
      as defined in stereo-channel-pairs MUST be specified in the
      embedded-aux-channels list.

   Encoding considerations: This media type is framed in RTP and
      contains binary data; see <a href="./rfc6838#section-4.8">SectionÂ 4.8 of [RFC6838]</a>.

   Security considerations: See <a href="./rfc4855#section-5">SectionÂ 5 of [RFC4855]</a> and <a href="./rfc4856#section-4">SectionÂ 4
      of [RFC4856]</a>.

   Interoperability considerations: none

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] that is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP
   is used to describe sessions, the media type mappings are as follows.

   o  The type name ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The subtype name ("aptx") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
      name.

   o  The parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as the clock rate.

   o  The parameter "channels" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as the channel
      count.

   o  The parameter "maxptime", when present, MUST be included in the
      SDP "a=maxptime" attribute.

   o  The required parameters "variant" and "bitresolution" MUST be
      included in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute.

   o  The optional parameters "stereo-channel-pairs",
      "embedded-autosync-channels", and "embedded-aux-channels", when
      present, MUST be included in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute.

   o  The parameter "ptime", when present, goes in a separate SDP
      attribute field and is signaled as "a=ptime:&lt;value&gt;", where

   Some example SDP session descriptions utilizing apt-X encodings
   follow.  In these examples, long "a=fmtp" lines are folded to meet
   the column width constraints of this document.

   Example 1: A Standard apt-X stream that encodes two independent
   44.1-kHz 16-bit PCM channels into a 4-millisecond RTP packet.

      m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 aptx/44100/2
      a=fmtp:98 variant=standard; bitresolution=16;
      a=ptime:4

   Example 2: An Enhanced apt-X stream that encodes two 48-kHz 24-bit
   stereo channels into a 4-millisecond RTP packet and carries both an
   embedded autosync and auxiliary data channel.

      m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 aptx/48000/2
      a=fmtp:98 variant=enhanced; bitresolution=24;
      stereo-channel-pairs={1,2}; embedded-autosync-channels=1;
      embedded-aux-channels=2
      a=ptime:4

   Example 3: An Enhanced apt-X stream that encodes six 44.1-kHz 24-bit
   channels into a 6-millisecond RTP packet.  Channels 1,2 and 3,4 are
   stereo pairs.  Both stereo pairs carry both an embedded autosync and
   auxiliary data channel.

      m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 aptx/44100/6
      a=fmtp:98 variant=enhanced; bitresolution=24;

   The only negotiable parameter is the delivery method.  All other

   may contain a large number of delivery methods per single fmtp
   attribute.  The answerer MUST remove every delivery method and
   configuration URI that is not supported.  Apart from this exceptional
   case, all parameters MUST NOT be altered on answer.

   One media type (audio/aptx) has been registered in the "Media Types"
   registry.  See <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and any appropriate RTP profile (for example,
   [<a href="./rfc3551" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>]).  This implies that confidentiality of the media streams
   is achieved by encryption.  Because the audio coding used with this
   payload format is applied end to end, encryption may be performed
   after audio coding so there is no conflict between the two
   operations.  A potential denial-of-service threat exists for audio
   coding techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end computational
   load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams into the stream
   that are complex to decode and cause the receiver to be overloaded.
   However, the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X audio coding
   algorithms do not exhibit any significant non-uniformity.  As with
   any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may be
   overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either desired
   or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to discard
   packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of the
   authentication itself may be too high.  In a multicast environment,
   pruning of specific sources may be implemented in future versions of
   IGMP [<a href="./rfc3376" title='"Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3"'>RFC3376</a>] and in multicast routing protocols to allow a receiver
   to select which sources are allowed to reach it.  [<a href="./rfc6562" title='"Guidelines for the Use of Variable Bit Rate Audio with Secure RTP"'>RFC6562</a>] has
   highlighted potential security vulnerabilities of Variable Bit Rate
   (VBR) codecs using Secure RTP transmission methods.  As the Standard
   apt-X and Enhanced apt-X codecs are Constant Bit Rate (CBR) codecs,
   this security vulnerability is therefore not applicable.
