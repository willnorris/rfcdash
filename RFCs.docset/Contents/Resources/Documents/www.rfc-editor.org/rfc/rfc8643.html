   <span class="h1">An Opportunistic Approach for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol</span>
                                <span class="h1">(OSRTP)</span>

Abstract

   Opportunistic Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (OSRTP) is an
   implementation of the Opportunistic Security mechanism, as defined in
   <a href="./rfc7435">RFC 7435</a>, applied to the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  OSRTP
   allows encrypted media to be used in environments where support for
   encryption is not known in advance and is not required.  OSRTP does
   not require Session Description Protocol (SDP) extensions or features
   and is fully backwards compatible with existing implementations using
   encrypted and authenticated media and implementations that do not
   encrypt or authenticate media packets.  OSRTP is not specific to any
   key management technique for Secure RTP (SRTP).  OSRTP is a
   transitional approach useful for migrating existing deployments of
   real-time communications to a fully encrypted and authenticated
   state.

   Opportunistic Security (OS) [<a href="./rfc7435" title='"Opportunistic Security: Some Protection Most of the Time"'>RFC7435</a>] is an approach to security that
   defines a third mode for security between "cleartext" and
   "comprehensive protection" that allows encryption and authentication
   of media to be used if supported but will not result in failures if
   it is not supported.  In the context of the transport of secure media
   streams using RTP and its secured derivatives, cleartext is
   represented by an RTP [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] media stream that is negotiated with
   the RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) [<a href="./rfc3551" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>] or the RTP/AVPF profile
   [<a href="./rfc4585" title='"Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"'>RFC4585</a>], whereas comprehensive protection is represented by a
   Secure RTP [<a href="./rfc3711" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>] stream negotiated with a secure profile, such as
   SAVP or SAVPF [<a href="./rfc5124" title='"Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"'>RFC5124</a>].  OSRTP allows SRTP to be negotiated with the
   RTP/AVP profile, with fallback to RTP if SRTP is not supported.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8643">RFC 8643</a>                          OSRTP                      August 2019</span>


   There have been some extensions to SDP to allow profiles to be
   negotiated, such as SDP Capabilities Negotiation (SDPCapNeg)
   [<a href="./rfc5939" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Capability Negotiation"'>RFC5939</a>].  However, these approaches are complex and have very
   limited deployment in communication systems.  Other key management
   protocols for SRTP that have been developed, such as ZRTP [<a href="./rfc6189" title='"ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP"'>RFC6189</a>],
   use OS by design.  This approach for OSRTP is based on [<a href="#ref-Kaplan06" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Negotiation For Best-Effort Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol"'>Kaplan06</a>]
   where it was called "best effort SRTP".  [<a href="#ref-Kaplan06" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Negotiation For Best-Effort Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol"'>Kaplan06</a>] has a full
   discussion of the motivation and requirements for opportunistic
   secure media.

   OSRTP uses the presence of SRTP keying-related attributes in an SDP
   offer to indicate support for opportunistic secure media.  The
   presence of SRTP keying-related attributes in the SDP answer
   indicates that the other party also supports OSRTP and that encrypted
   and authenticated media will be used.  OSRTP requires no additional
   extensions to SDP or new attributes and is defined independently of
   the key agreement mechanism used.  OSRTP is only usable when media is
   negotiated using the Offer/Answer protocol [<a href="./rfc3264" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>].

   OSRTP is a transitional approach that provides a migration path from
   unencrypted communication (RTP) to fully encrypted communication
   (SRTP).  It is only to be used in existing deployments that are
   attempting to transition to fully secure communications.  New
   applications and new deployments will not use OSRTP.

   This section defines the SDP offer/answer considerations for
   opportunistic security.

   The procedures are for a specific "m=" section describing RTP-based
   media.  If an SDP offer or answer contains multiple such "m="
   sections, the procedures are applied to each "m=" section
   individually.

   "Initial OSRTP offer" refers to the offer in which opportunistic
   security is offered for an "m=" section for the first time within an
   SDP session.



<span class="grey">Johnston, et al.              Informational                     [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8643">RFC 8643</a>                          OSRTP                      August 2019</span>


   It is important to note that OSRTP makes no changes to and has no
   effect on media sessions in which the offer contains a secure profile
   of RTP, such as SAVP or SAVPF.  As discussed in [<a href="./rfc7435" title='"Opportunistic Security: Some Protection Most of the Time"'>RFC7435</a>], that is
   the "comprehensive protection" for media mode.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Generating%20the%20Initial%20OSRTP%20Offer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Generating the Initial OSRTP Offer</span>

   To indicate support for OSRTP in an SDP offer, the offerer uses the
   RTP/AVP profile [<a href="./rfc3551" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>] or the RTP/AVPF profile [<a href="./rfc4585" title='"Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"'>RFC4585</a>] but
   includes SRTP keying attributes.  OSRTP is not specific to any key
   management technique for SRTP, and multiple key management techniques
   can be included on the SDP offer.  For example:

      If the offerer supports DTLS-SRTP key agreement [<a href="./rfc5763" title='"Framework for Establishing a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) Security Context Using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"'>RFC5763</a>], then an
      "a=fingerprint" attribute will be present.  Or:

      If the offerer supports SDP Security Descriptions key agreement
      [<a href="./rfc4568" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions for Media Streams"'>RFC4568</a>], then an "a=crypto" attribute will be present.  Or:

      If the offerer supports ZRTP key agreement [<a href="./rfc6189" title='"ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP"'>RFC6189</a>], then an
      "a=zrtp-hash" attribute will be present.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Generating%20the%20Answer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Generating the Answer</span>

   To accept OSRTP, an answerer receiving an offer indicating support
   for OSRTP generates an SDP answer containing SRTP keying attributes
   that match one of the keying methods in the offer.  The answer MUST
   NOT contain attributes from more than one keying method, even if the
   offer contained multiple keying method attributes.  The selected SRTP
   key management approach is followed, and SRTP media is used for this
   session.  If the SRTP key management fails for any reason, the media
   session MUST fail.  To decline OSRTP, the answerer generates an SDP
   answer omitting SRTP keying attributes, and the media session
   proceeds with RTP with no encryption or authentication used.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Offerer%20Processing%20the%20Answer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Offerer Processing the Answer</span>

   If the offerer of OSRTP receives an SDP answer that does not contain
   SRTP keying attributes, then the media session proceeds with RTP.  If
   the SDP answer contains SRTP keying attributes, then the associated
   SRTP key management approach is followed and SRTP media is used for
   this session.  If the SRTP key management fails, the media session
   MUST fail.

   When an offerer generates a subsequent SDP offer, it should do so
   following the principles of [<a href="./rfc6337" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Usage of the Offer/Answer Model"'>RFC6337</a>], meaning that the decision to
   create the new SDP offer should not be influenced by what was
   previously negotiated.  For example, if a previous OSRTP offer did
   not result in SRTP being established, the offerer may try again and
   generate a new OSRTP offer as specified in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations of [<a href="./rfc4568" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions for Media Streams"'>RFC4568</a>] apply to OSRTP, as well as
   the security considerations of the particular SRTP key agreement
   approach used.  However, the authentication requirements of a
   particular SRTP key agreement approach are relaxed when that key
   agreement is used with OSRTP, which is consistent with the
   Opportunistic Security approach described in [<a href="./rfc7435" title='"Opportunistic Security: Some Protection Most of the Time"'>RFC7435</a>].  For example:

      For DTLS-SRTP key agreement [<a href="./rfc5763" title='"Framework for Establishing a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) Security Context Using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"'>RFC5763</a>], an authenticated signaling
      channel does not need to be used with OSRTP if it is not
      available.

      For SDP Security Descriptions key agreement [<a href="./rfc4568" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions for Media Streams"'>RFC4568</a>], an
      authenticated signaling channel does not need to be used with
      OSRTP if it is not available, although an encrypted signaling
      channel MUST still be used.

      For ZRTP key agreement [<a href="./rfc6189" title='"ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP"'>RFC6189</a>], the security considerations are
      unchanged, since ZRTP does not rely on the security of the
      signaling channel.

   While OSRTP does not require authentication of the key agreement
   mechanism, it does need to avoid exposing SRTP keys to eavesdroppers,
   since this could enable passive attacks against SRTP.  <a href="./rfc4568#section-8.3">Section 8.3 of
   [RFC4568]</a> requires that any messages that contain SRTP keys be
   encrypted, and further says that encryption SHOULD provide end-to-end
   confidentiality protection if intermediaries that could inspect the
   SDP message are present.  At the time of this writing, it is
   understood that the requirement in [<a href="./rfc4568" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions for Media Streams"'>RFC4568</a>] for end-to-end
   confidentiality protection is commonly ignored.  Therefore, if OSRTP
   is used with SDP Security Descriptions, any such intermediaries
   (e.g., SIP proxies) must be assumed to have access to the SRTP keys.

   As discussed in [<a href="./rfc7435" title='"Opportunistic Security: Some Protection Most of the Time"'>RFC7435</a>], OSRTP is used in cases where support for
   encryption by the other party is not known in advance and is not
   required.  For cases where it is known that the other party supports
   SRTP or SRTP needs to be used, OSRTP MUST NOT be used.  Instead, a
   secure profile of RTP is used in the offer.
