   <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> currently specifies 3DES as the mandatory-to-implement
   ciphersuite for implementations of S/MIME in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP).  This document updates the normative guidance of <a href="./rfc3261">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3261">3261</a> to require the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for S/MIME.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3853">RFC 3853</a>             S/MIME AES Requirement for SIP            July 2004</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) specification (<a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>1</a>])
   currently details optional support (a normative MAY) for the use of
   secure MIME, or S/MIME (<a href="./rfc2633">RFC 2633</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"S/MIME Version 3.1 Message Specification"'>8</a>]).  Since <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> was published,
   the S/MIME specification and the underlying Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS, <a href="./rfc3369">RFC 3369</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>3</a>]) have undergone some revision.  Ongoing
   work has identified AES as a algorithm that might be used for content
   encryption in S/MIME.

   The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)."'>6</a>]) is widely believed to be
   faster than Triple-DES (3DES, which has previously been mandated for
   usage with S/MIME) and to be comparably secure.  AES is also believed
   to have comparatively low memory requirements, which makes it
   suitable for use in mobile or embedded devices, an important use-case
   for SIP.

   As an additional consideration, the SIP specification has a
   recommendation (normative SHOULD) for support of Transport Layer
   Security (TLS, <a href="./rfc2246">RFC 2246</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>7</a>]).  TLS support in SIP requires the usage
   of AES.  That means that currently, implementations that support both
   TLS and S/MIME must support both 3DES and AES.  A similar duplication
   of effort exists with DSS in S/MIME as a digital signature algorithm
   (the mandatory TLS ciphersuite used by SIP requires RSA).  Unifying
   the ciphersuite and signature algorithm requirements for TLS and
   S/MIME would simplify security implementations.

   It is therefore desirable to bring the S/MIME requirement for SIP
   into parity with ongoing work on the S/MIME standard, as well as to
   unify the algorithm requirements for TLS and S/MIME.  To date, S/MIME
   has not yet seen widespread deployment in SIP user agents, and
   therefore the minimum ciphersuite for S/MIME could be updated without
   obsoleting any substantial deployments of S/MIME for SIP (in fact,
   these changes will probably make support for S/MIME easier).  This
   document therefore updates the normative requirements for S/MIME in
   <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.

   Note that work on these revisions in the S/MIME working group is
   still in progress.  This document will continue to track that work as
   it evolves.  By initiating this process in the SIP WG now, we provide
   an early opportunity for input into the proposed changes and give
   implementers some warning that the S/MIME requirements for SIP are
   potentially changing.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to indicate requirement levels"'>2</a>] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant SIP implementations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20S%2FMIME%20Ciphersuite%20Requirements%20for%20SIP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  S/MIME Ciphersuite Requirements for SIP</span>

   The following updates the text of <a href="./rfc3261#section-23.3">RFC 3261 SectionÂ 23.3</a>, specifically
   the fifth bullet point.  The text currently reads:

   o  S/MIME implementations MUST at a minimum support SHA1 as a digital
      signature algorithm, and 3DES as an encryption algorithm.  All
      other signature and encryption algorithms MAY be supported.
      Implementations can negotiate support for these algorithms with
      the "SMIMECapabilities" attribute.

   This text is updated with the following:

   S/MIME implementations MUST at a minimum support RSA as a digital
   signature algorithm and SHA1 as a digest algorithm [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms"'>5</a>], and AES as an
   encryption algorithm (as specified in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Encryption Algorithm in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>4</a>].  For key transport, S/MIME
   implementations MUST support RSA key transport as specified in
   section 4.2.1. of [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms"'>5</a>].  S/MIME implementations of AES MUST support
   128-bit AES keys, and SHOULD support 192 and 256-bit keys.  Note that
   the S/MIME specification [<a href="#ref-8" title='"S/MIME Version 3.1 Message Specification"'>8</a>] mandates support for 3DES as an
   encryption algorithm, DH for key encryption and DSS as a signature
   algorithm.  In the SIP profile of S/MIME, support for 3DES, DH and
   DSS is RECOMMENDED but not required.  All other signature and
   encryption algorithms MAY be supported.  Implementations can
   negotiate support for algorithms with the "SMIMECapabilities"
   attribute.

   Since SIP is 8-bit clean, all implementations MUST use 8-bit binary
   Content-Transfer-Encoding for S/MIME in SIP.  Implementations MAY
   also be able to receive base-64 Content-Transfer-Encoding.

   The migration of the S/MIME requirement from Triple-DES to AES is not
   known to introduce any new security considerations.
