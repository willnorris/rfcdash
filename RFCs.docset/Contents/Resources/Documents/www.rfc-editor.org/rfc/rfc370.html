                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

     This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from July 17
to July 28.

     On Tuesday, July 18, the new IMP software was released.

     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing as
they are presently intended to be users only. Included here are the
Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, RADC,
NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, ARPA, and BBN*).  This category also
includes the Network Control Center computer (Network address 5) which
is used solely for gathering statistics from the Network. Finally,
included among these Hosts are the following:

       Network
       Address               Site               Computer
       -------               ----               --------

           7                 Rand               IBM-360/65
          73                 Harvard            PDP-1
         138                 Lincoln            TSP
          12                 Illinois           PDP-11
          19                 NBS                PDP-11
          23                 USC                IBM-360/44

     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status
for this period.

*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and
as such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being
used to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

where

D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)

F = Full (Destination Host opened a connection, informed user that all
    Network ports were in use, and immediately closed the connection.)

H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)

R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
    connection within 60 seconds.)
