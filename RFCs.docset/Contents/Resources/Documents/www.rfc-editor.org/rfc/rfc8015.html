<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8015">RFC 8015</a>                RTCP XR Burst/Gap Discard          November 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Independent%20Burst%2FGap%20Discard%20Metrics%20Block"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Independent Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block</span>

   This document defines a new block type that extends the metrics
   defined in [<a href="./rfc7003" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Burst/Gap Discard Metric Reporting"'>RFC7003</a>].  The new block type reports the proportion of
   packets discarded in a burst by the de-jitter buffer at the receiver.
   The number of packets discarded depends on the de-jitter buffer
   algorithm implemented by the endpoint.

   The new report block defined in this document is different from the
   one defined in [<a href="./rfc7003" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Burst/Gap Discard Metric Reporting"'>RFC7003</a>].  The metrics in [<a href="./rfc7003" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Burst/Gap Discard Metric Reporting"'>RFC7003</a>] depend on the
   metrics in the burst/gap loss metric defined in [<a href="./rfc6958" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Burst/Gap Loss Metric Reporting"'>RFC6958</a>].
   Consequently, an endpoint that sends a Burst/Gap Discard Metrics
   Block [<a href="./rfc7003" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Burst/Gap Discard Metric Reporting"'>RFC7003</a>] also needs to send a Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block
   [<a href="./rfc6958" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Burst/Gap Loss Metric Reporting"'>RFC6958</a>].  The combined usage is useful when an endpoint observes
   correlated packet losses and discard.  However, when the burst of
   packet losses and discards do not occur simultaneously, the
   application could prefer to send a concise report block that just
   reports the burst/gap of discarded packets.  The report block in this
   document provides the complete information and does not require
   additional report blocks.  That is, this block reports the total
   number of packets discarded, the total burst duration, and the total
   number of bursts.  All of these metrics are missing in [<a href="./rfc7003" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Burst/Gap Discard Metric Reporting"'>RFC7003</a>].

   This block provides information on transient network issues.  Burst/
   gap metrics are typically used in cumulative reports; however, they
   can also be used in interval reports (see the Interval Metric flag in
   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).  The variation in the number of packet discards in a
   burst affects the user experience.  Based on the metrics reported in
   the block, the sending endpoint can change the packetization
   interval, vary the bitrate, etc.  The report can additionally be used
   for diagnostics [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].  The metric belongs to the class of
   transport-related end-system metrics defined in [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

   The definitions of "burst", "gap", "loss", and "discard" are
   consistent with the definitions in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].  To accommodate a range
   of de-jitter buffer algorithms and packet discard logic that can be
   used by implementers, the method used to distinguish between bursts
   and gaps uses an equivalent method to that defined in <a href="./rfc3611#section-4.7.2">Section 4.7.2
   of [RFC3611]</a>.  Note that reporting the specific de-jitter buffer
   algorithm and/or the packet discard logic is out of the scope of this
   document.

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].

   The Performance Metrics Framework [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Framework [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>] provides guidelines for reporting the
   block format using RTCP XR.  The metrics block described in this
   document is in accordance with the guidelines in [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications that
   contain de-jitter buffers at the receiver to smooth variation in
   packet-arrival time and don't use stream repair means, e.g., Forward
   Error Correction (FEC) [<a href="#ref-FLEX_FEC">FLEX_FEC</a>] and/or retransmission [<a href="./rfc4588" title='"RTP Retransmission Payload Format"'>RFC4588</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Received, Lost, and Discarded

      A packet is regarded as "lost" if it fails to arrive within an
      implementation-specific time window.  A packet that arrives within
      this time window but is too early to be played out, too late to be
      played out, or thrown away before playout due to packet
      duplication or redundancy is be recorded as "discarded".  A packet
      SHALL NOT be regarded as "discarded" if it arrives within this
      time window but is dropped during decoding by some higher-layer
      decoder, e.g., due to a decoding error.  Each packet is classified
      as one of "received" (or "OK"), "discarded", or "lost".  The
      metric "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>]
      reports a count of packets lost from the media stream (single
      synchronization source (SSRC) within a single RTP session).
      Similarly, the metric "number of packets discarded" defined in
      [<a href="./rfc7002" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Discard Count Metric Reporting"'>RFC7002</a>] reports a count of packets discarded from the media
      stream (single SSRC within a single RTP session) arriving at the

      receiver.  Another metric, defined in [<a href="./rfc5725" title='"Post-Repair Loss RLE Report Block Type for RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs)"'>RFC5725</a>], is available to
      report on packets that are not recovered by any repair techniques
      that are in use.  Note that the term "discard" defined here builds
      on the "discard" definition in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>] but extends the concept
      to take into account packet duplication and reports different
      types of discard counts [<a href="./rfc7002" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Discard Count Metric Reporting"'>RFC7002</a>].

   Bursts and Gaps

      The terms "burst" and "gap" are used in a manner consistent with
      that of RTCP XR [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].  RTCP XR views an RTP stream as being
      divided into bursts, which are periods during which the discard
      rate is high enough to cause noticeable quality degradation
      (generally a discard rate over 5 percent), and gaps, which are
      periods during which discarded packets are infrequent, and hence
      quality is generally acceptable.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Independent%20Burst%2FGap%20Discard%20Metrics%20Block"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Independent Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block</span>

   Metrics in this block report on burst/gap discard in the stream
   arriving at the RTP system.  Measurements of these metrics are made
   at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances of this metrics
   block use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Information Block [<a href="./rfc6776" title='"Measurement Identity and Information Reporting Using a Source Description (SDES) Item and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block"'>RFC6776</a>], which describes
   measurement periods in use (see <a href="./rfc6776#section-4.2">[RFC6776], Section 4.2</a>).

   This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
   Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report.
   Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   Measurement Information Block.  Receivers MUST verify that the
   measurement period is received in the same compound RTCP packet as
   this metrics block.  If not, this metrics block MUST be discarded.

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits

      An Independent Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block is identified by
      the constant 35.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the burst/gap discard
      metrics are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>]:

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

      In this document, burst/gap discard metrics can only be measured
      over definite intervals and cannot be sampled.  Also, the value
      I=00 is reserved for future use.  Senders MUST NOT use the values
      I=00 or I=01.  If a block is received with I=00 or I=01, the
      receiver MUST discard the block.

   Reserved (resv): 6 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers (see <a href="./rfc6709#section-4.2">[RFC6709], Section 4.2</a>).

      The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>], i.e., the number
      of successive packets that have to be received prior to, and
      following, a discarded packet in order for that discarded packet
      to be regarded as part of a gap.  Note that the Threshold is set
      in accordance with the Gmin calculation defined in <a href="./rfc3611#section-4.7.2">Section 4.7.2
      of [RFC3611]</a>.

   Sum of Burst Durations (ms): 24 bits

      The total duration of bursts of discarded packets in the period of
      the report (Interval or Cumulative).

      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE MUST be reported to indicate
      an over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the
      value 0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.

   Packets Discarded in Bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts, as
      defined in <a href="./rfc7002#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of [RFC7002]</a>.

   Number of Bursts: 16 bits

      The number of discard bursts in the period of the report (Interval
      or Cumulative).

      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an
      over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the
      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

   Total Packets Expected in Bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets expected during the discard bursts
      (that is, the sum of received packets and lost packets).  The
      metric is defined in [<a href="./rfc7003" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for Burst/Gap Discard Metric Reporting"'>RFC7003</a>].

   Discard Count: 32 bits

      Number of packets discarded over the period (Interval or
      Cumulative) covered by this report, as defined in <a href="./rfc7002#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of
      [RFC7002]</a>.

   The metrics described here are intended to be used in conjunction
   with information from the Measurement Information Block [<a href="./rfc6776" title='"Measurement Identity and Information Reporting Using a Source Description (SDES) Item and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block"'>RFC6776</a>].

   These metrics provide the following information relevant to
   statistical parameters (depending on cumulative of interval
   measures), for example:

   o  The average discarded burst size, which can be calculated by
      dividing the metric "Packets Discarded in Bursts" by the "Number
      of Bursts".

   o  The average burst duration, which can be calculated by dividing
      the metric "Sum of Burst Durations (ms)" by the "Number of
      Bursts".

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8015">RFC 8015</a>                RTCP XR Burst/Gap Discard          November 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Considerations%20for%20Voice-over-IP%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Considerations for Voice-over-IP Applications</span>

   This metrics block is applicable to a broad range of RTP
   applications.  Where the metric is used with a Voice-over-IP (VoIP)
   application and the stream repair means is not available, the
   following considerations apply.

   RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
   during which the discard rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
   quality degradation (generally a discard rate over 5 percent) and
   gaps, which are periods during which discarded packets are
   infrequent, and hence call quality is generally acceptable.

   If voice activity detection is used, the burst/gap duration is
   determined as if silence packets had been sent, i.e., a period of
   silence in excess of Gmin packets will terminate a burst condition.

   The RECOMMENDED value for the threshold Gmin in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>] results in
   a burst being a period of time during which the call quality is
   degraded to a similar extent to a typical pulse code modulation (PCM)
   severely errored second.

   This block does not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>, paragraph 3 of [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>]
   does not apply.  However, the gap indicated within this block could
   be used to detect the timing of other events on the path between the
   sender and receiver.  For example, a competing multimedia stream
   might cause a discard burst for the duration of the stream, allowing
   the receiver of this block to know when the competing stream was
   active.  This risk is not a significant threat since the only
   information leaked is the timing of the discard, not the cause.

   Where this is a concern, the implementation SHOULD apply encryption
   and authentication to this report block.  For example, this can be
   achieved by using the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF)
   profile together with the Secure RTP profile, as defined in
   [<a href="./rfc3711" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>]; an appropriate combination of those two profiles ("SAVPF")
   is specified in [<a href="./rfc5124" title='"Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"'>RFC5124</a>].  Besides this, it is believed that this
   RTCP XR block introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   described in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].
