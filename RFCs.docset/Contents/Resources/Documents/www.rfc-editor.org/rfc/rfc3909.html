Abstract

   This specification describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) extended operation to cancel (or abandon) an outstanding
   operation.  Unlike the LDAP Abandon operation, but like the X.511
   Directory Access Protocol (DAP) Abandon operation, this operation has
   a response which provides an indication of its outcome.

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [<a href="./rfc3377" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Technical Specification"'>RFC3377</a>] provides
   an Abandon operation [<a href="./rfc2251" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)"'>RFC2251</a>] which clients may use to cancel other
   operations.  The Abandon operation does not have a response and
   requires no response from the abandoned operation.  These semantics
   provide the client with no clear indication of the outcome of the
   Abandon operation.

   The X.511 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [<a href="#ref-X.511" title='"The Directory: Abstract Service Definition"'>X.511</a>] provides an Abandon
   operation which has a response and also requires the abandoned
   operation to return a response indicating it was canceled.  The LDAP
   Cancel operation is modeled after the DAP Abandon operation.

   The LDAP Cancel operation SHOULD be used instead of the LDAP Abandon
   operation when the client needs an indication of the outcome.  This
   operation may be used to cancel both interrogation and update
   operations.

   The Cancel operation is defined as an LDAP Extended Operation
   [RFC2251, <a href="#section-4.12">Section 4.12</a>] identified by the object identifier
   1.3.6.1.1.8.  This section details the syntax of the Cancel request
   and response messages and defines additional LDAP resultCodes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Cancel%20Request"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Cancel Request</span>

   The Cancel request is an ExtendedRequest with the requestName field
   containing 1.3.6.1.1.8 and a requestValue field which contains a
   BER-encoded cancelRequestValue value.

      cancelRequestValue ::= SEQUENCE {
          cancelID        MessageID
                          -- MessageID is as defined in [<a href="./rfc2251" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)"'>RFC2251</a>]
      }

   The cancelID field contains the message ID associated with the
   operation to be canceled.

   A Cancel response is an ExtendedResponse where the responseName and
   response fields are absent.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3909">RFC 3909</a>                 LDAP Cancel Operation              October 2004</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Operational%20Semantics"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Operational Semantics</span>

   The function of the Cancel Operation is to request that the server
   cancel an outstanding operation issued within the same session.

   The client requests the cancelation of an outstanding operation by
   issuing a Cancel Response with a cancelID set to the message ID of
   the outstanding operation.  The Cancel Request itself has a distinct
   message ID.  Clients SHOULD NOT request the cancelation of an
   operation multiple times.

   If the server is willing and able to cancel the outstanding operation
   identified by the cancelId, the server SHALL return a Cancel Response
   with a success resultCode, and the canceled operation SHALL fail with
   canceled resultCode.  Otherwise the Cancel Response SHALL have a
   non-success resultCode and SHALL NOT have an impact upon the
   outstanding operation (if it exists).

   The protocolError resultCode is returned if the server is unable to
   parse the requestValue or the requestValue is absent,

   The noSuchOperation resultCode is returned if the server has no
   knowledge of the operation requested for cancelation.

   The cannotCancel resultCode is returned if the identified operation
   does not support cancelation or the cancel operation could not be
   performed.  The following classes of operations are not cancelable:

   -  operations which have no response,

   -  operations which create, alter, or destroy authentication and/or
      authorization associations,

   -  operations which establish, alter, or tear-down security services,
      and

   -  operations which abandon or cancel other operations.

   Specifically, the Abandon, Bind, Start TLS [<a href="./rfc2830" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Extension for Transport Layer Security"'>RFC2830</a>], Unbind, and
   Cancel operations are not cancelable.

   The Cancel operation cannot be abandoned.

   The tooLate resultCode is returned to indicate that it is too late to
   cancel the outstanding operation.  For example, the server may return
   tooLate for a request to cancel an outstanding modify operation which
   has already committed updates to the underlying data store.

   Servers SHOULD indicate their support for this extended operation by
   providing 1.3.6.1.1.8 as a value of the 'supportedExtension'
   attribute type in their root DSE.  A server MAY choose to advertise
   this extension only when the client is authorized to use it.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This operation is intended to allow a user to cancel operations they
   previously issued during the current LDAP association.  In certain
   cases, such as when the Proxy Authorization Control is in use,
   different outstanding operations may be processed under different
   LDAP associations.  Servers MUST NOT allow a user to cancel an
   operation belonging to another user.

   Some operations should not be cancelable for security reasons.  This
   specification disallows the cancelation of the Bind operation and
   Start TLS extended operation so as to avoid adding complexity to
   authentication, authorization, and security layer semantics.
   Designers of future extended operations and/or controls should
   disallow abandonment and cancelation when appropriate.
