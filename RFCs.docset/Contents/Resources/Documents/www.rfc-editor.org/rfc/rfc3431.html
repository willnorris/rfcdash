Abstract

   This document describes the RELATIONAL extension to the Sieve mail
   filtering language defined in <a href="./rfc3028">RFC 3028</a>.  This extension extends
   existing conditional tests in Sieve to allow relational operators.
   In addition to testing their content, it also allows for testing of
   the number of entities in header and envelope fields.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a> Introduction</span>

   Sieve [<a href="#ref-SIEVE" title='"Sieve: A Mail Filtering Language"'>SIEVE</a>] is a language for filtering e-mail messages at the time
   of final delivery.  It is designed to be implementable on either a
   mail client or mail server.  It is meant to be extensible, simple,
   and independent of access protocol, mail architecture, and operating
   system.  It is suitable for running on a mail server where users may
   not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, such as on black box
   Internet Messages Access Protocol (IMAP) servers, as it has no
   variables, loops, nor the ability to shell out to external programs.

   The RELATIONAL extension provides relational operators on the
   address, envelope, and header tests.  This extension also provides a
   way of counting the entities in a message header or address field.

   With this extension, the sieve script may now determine if a field is
   greater than or less than a value instead of just equivalent.  One
   use is for the x-priority field: move messages with a priority
   greater than 3 to the "work on later" folder.  Mail could also be
   sorted by the from address.  Those userids that start with 'a'-'m' go
   to one folder, and the rest go to another folder.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3431">RFC 3431</a>           Sieve Extension: Relational Tests       December 2002</span>


   The sieve script can also determine the number of fields in the
   header, or the number of addresses in a recipient field.  For
   example:  are there more than 5 addresses in the to and cc fields.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.

   Conventions for notations are as in [<a href="#ref-SIEVE" title='"Sieve: A Mail Filtering Language"'>SIEVE</a>] <a href="#section-1.1">section 1.1</a>, including
   the use of [KEYWORDS] and "Syntax:" label for the definition of
   action and tagged arguments syntax, and the use of [<a href="#ref-ABNF" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>ABNF</a>].

   The capability string associated with extension defined in this
   document is "relational".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3%20Comparators"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a> Comparators</span>

   This document does not define any comparators or exempt any
   comparators from the require clause.  Any comparator used, other than
   "i;octet" and "i;ascii-casemap", MUST be declared a require clause as
   defined in [<a href="#ref-SIEVE" title='"Sieve: A Mail Filtering Language"'>SIEVE</a>].

   The "i;ascii-numeric" comparator, as defined in [<a href="#ref-ACAP" title='"ACAP -- Application Configuration Access Protocol"'>ACAP</a>], MUST be
   supported for any implementation of this extension.  The comparator
   "i;ascii-numeric" MUST support at least 32 bit unsigned integers.

   Larger integers MAY be supported.  Note: the "i;ascii-numeric"
   comparator does not support negative numbers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4%20Match%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a> Match Type</span>

   This document defines two new match types.  They are the VALUE match
   type and the COUNT match type.

     The syntax is:

        MATCH-TYPE =/ COUNT / VALUE

        COUNT = ":count" relational-match

        VALUE = ":value" relational-match

        relational-match = DQUOTE ( "gt" / "ge" / "lt"
                                    / "le" / "eq" / "ne" ) DQUOTE

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3431">RFC 3431</a>           Sieve Extension: Relational Tests       December 2002</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1%20%20Match%20Type%20Value"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>  Match Type Value</span>

   The VALUE match type does a relational comparison between strings.

   The VALUE match type may be used with any comparator which returns
   sort information.

   Leading and trailing white space MUST be removed from the value of
   the message for the comparison.  White space is defined as

                             SP / HTAB / CRLF

   A value from the message is considered the left side of the relation.
   A value from the test expression, the key-list for address, envelope,
   and header tests, is the right side of the relation.

   If there are multiple values on either side or both sides, the test
   is considered true, if any pair is true.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2%20%20Match%20Type%20Count"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>  Match Type Count</span>

   The COUNT match type first determines the number of the specified
   entities in the message and does a relational comparison of the
   number of entities to the values specified in the test expression.

   The COUNT match type SHOULD only be used with numeric comparators.

   The Address Test counts the number of recipients in the specified
   fields.  Group names are ignored.

   The Envelope Test counts the number of recipients in the specified
   envelope parts.  The envelope "to" will always have only one entry,
   which is the address of the user for whom the sieve script is
   running.  There is no way a sieve script can determine if the message
   was actually sent to someone else using this test.  The envelope
   "from" will be 0 if the MAIL FROM is blank, or 1 if MAIL FROM is not
   blank.

   The Header Test counts the total number of instances of the specified
   fields.  This does not count individual addresses in the "to", "cc",
   and other recipient fields.

   In all cases, if more than one field name is specified, the counts
   for all specified fields are added together to obtain the number for
   comparison.  Thus, specifying ["to", "cc"] in an address COUNT test,
   comparing the total number of "to" and "cc" addresses; if separate
   counts are desired, they must be done in two comparisons, perhaps
   joined by "allof" or "anyof".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a> Security Considerations</span>

   Security considerations are discussed in [<a href="#ref-SIEVE" title='"Sieve: A Mail Filtering Language"'>SIEVE</a>].

   An implementation MUST ensure that the test for envelope "to" only
   reflects the delivery to the current user.  It MUST not be possible
   for a user to determine if this message was delivered to someone else
   using this test.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a> Example</span>

   Using the message:

      received: ...
      received: ...
      subject: example
      to: foo@example.com.invalid, baz@example.com.invalid
      cc: qux@example.com.invalid

   The test:

        address :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" ["to", "cc"]
      ["3"]

      would be true and the test

         anyof ( address :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                         ["to"] ["3"],
                 address :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                         ["cc"] ["3"] )

      would be false.

      To check the number of received fields in the header, the
      following test may be used:

         header :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                        ["received"] ["3"]

      This would return false.  But

         header :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                          ["received", "subject"] ["3"]

      would return true.

   The test:

         header :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                       ["to", "cc"] ["3"]

   will always return false on an <a href="./rfc2822">RFC 2822</a> compliant message [<a href="./rfc2822" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC2822</a>],
   since a message can have at most one "to" field and at most one "cc"
   field.  This test counts the number of fields, not the number of
   addresses.
