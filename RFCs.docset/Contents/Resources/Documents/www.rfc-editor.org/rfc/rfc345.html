     <span class="h1">INTEREST IN MIXED INTEGER PROGRAMMING (MPSX ON 360/91 AT CCN)</span>

     MPSX is a newer version of the IBM project MPS, used for integer
programming.  From what I've been told, MPSX outperforms the previous
package.  In addition, it has available a feature of mixed integer
programming.

     Since MPSX is an IBM product, an installation which uses it is
charged a fixed rental fee per month.  At the present time, CCN does
not have this processor with its system.  We are anticipating asking
them to install it, with the mixed integer programming option.  We
are looking for any other users from the Network who may need this
software in order to prorate the cost between several installations.
The initial estimate of the cost is $130/month, plus $225 for the
mixed integer programming feature.  A share of this cost would be
assigned to each user of the system.  I am told by Robert Bell of CCN
that they could take care of those details for us.

     If you have an interest in this, I urge you to contact me within
the month.  If you have questions about the mixed integer programming
feature of the MPSX system itself, you could contact:

     Of course, in the meantime, the system MPS is available on the
CCN system.
