Replication Requirements to provide an Internet Directory using X.500










Status of this Memo
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It
    does not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo
    is unlimited.
Abstract

    This RFCconsiders certain deficiencies of the 1988 X.500
    standard, which need to be addressed before an effective open
    Internet Directory can be established using these protocols and
    services [<a href="#ref-CCI88" title="models and services">CCI88</a>].  The only areas considered are primary
    problems, to which solutions must be found before a pilot can be
    deployed.  This RFCconcerns itself with deficiencies which can
    only be addressed by use of additional protocol or procedures for
    distributed operation.</pre>

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1%20%20Distributed%20Operation%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>  Distributed Operation Extensions</span>

The Internet Directory will operate DSAs over TCP/IP using <a href="./rfc1006">RFC 1006</a>
[<a href="#ref-RC87" title="Northrop Corporation Technology Center">RC87</a>], and DSAs over the an ISO Network Service.  Distributed
operation procedures should not require full connectivity.


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2%20%20Knowledge%20Replication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>  Knowledge Replication</span>

Knowledge information is critical to resolution of names, and
performing searches.  Knowledge information high up the tree needs to
be widely available.  Consider resolving a name below ``Country=US''.
To do this, a DSA needs to have full knowledge at this point.  Many
DSAs need to be able to do this, in order to give reasonable response
and availability.  It would be an unacceptable bottleneck to force
such resolution to a single or small number of DSAs.  To replicate
this knowledge widely, a systematic approach to replication is needed.


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3%20%20Data%20Replication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>  Data Replication</span>

Searches are often made at the root and country level, and this is a
vital service (e.g., an approximate match of an organisation name).
Data needs to be collected in such a way that this sort of searching
is reasonably efficient.  The usual X.500 approach of subordinate
references militates against this.  At a node in the DIT, subordinate
references to the entries below are held.  These entries will be in
many DSAs, each of which needs to be accessed in order to perform the
single level search.  It is suggested that replication of data is
necessary to achieve this.

The major requirement for this replication is high up the DIT, where
information must be replicated between different implementations.  At
lower levels of the DIT, it is reasonable for DSAs to be of the same
implementation and to use implementation specific techniques in order
to achieve performance and availability.


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4%20%20Alternate%20DSAs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>  Alternate DSAs</span>

When a DSA Referral is returned, only the master DSA is indicated.
This will lead to a single point of failure.  It seems important to
allow for additional references to slave copies, in order to get

better availability.  This needs to be solved in conjunction with the
problem described in the previous section.

To be effective, the replication specification needs to provide
guidelines for deployment in the pilot, in order to meet the desired
service criteria.

Most techniques for replication have scaling limits.  It is important
that mechanisms used do not stress the limits of the mechanism.  The
order of magnitude envisioned in the pilot is 100 000 non-leaf entries
and several million leaf entries.
