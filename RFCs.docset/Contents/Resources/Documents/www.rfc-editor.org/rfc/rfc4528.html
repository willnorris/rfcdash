Abstract

   This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) Assertion Control, which allows a client to specify that a
   directory operation should only be processed if an assertion applied
   to the target entry of the operation is true.  It can be used to
   construct "test and set", "test and clear", and other conditional
   operations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Overview</span>

   This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>] assertion control.  The assertion control allows the
   client to specify a condition that must be true for the operation to
   be processed normally.  Otherwise, the operation is not performed.
   For instance, the control can be used with the Modify operation
   [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] to perform atomic "test and set" and "test and clear"
   operations.

   The control may be attached to any update operation to support
   conditional addition, deletion, modification, and renaming of the
   target object.  The asserted condition is evaluated as an integral
   part the operation.

   The control may also be used with the search operation.  Here, the
   assertion is applied to the base object of the search before
   searching for objects that match the search scope and filter.

   The control may also be used with the compare operation.  Here, it
   extends the compare operation to allow a more complex assertion.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Terminology</span>

   Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-X.680" title='"Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) - Specification of Basic Notation"'>X.680</a>] with implicit
   tags.  The term "BER-encoded" means the element is to be encoded
   using the Basic Encoding Rules [<a href="#ref-X.690" title='"Specification of ASN.1 encoding rules: Basic Encoding Rules (BER), Canonical Encoding Rules (CER), and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)"'>X.690</a>] under the restrictions
   detailed in <a href="./rfc4511#section-5.1">SectionÂ 5.1 of [RFC4511]</a>.

   DSA stands for Directory System Agent (or server).
   DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20The%20Assertion%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  The Assertion Control</span>

   The assertion control is an LDAP Control [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] whose controlType
   is 1.3.6.1.1.12 and whose controlValue is a BER-encoded Filter
   [Protocol, <a href="#section-4.5.1">Section 4.5.1</a>].  The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.
   There is no corresponding response control.

   The control is appropriate for both LDAP interrogation and update
   operations [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>], including Add, Compare, Delete, Modify,
   ModifyDN (rename), and Search.  It is inappropriate for Abandon,
   Bind, Unbind, and StartTLS operations.



<span class="grey">Zeilenga                    Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4528">RFC 4528</a>                 LDAP Assertion Control                June 2006</span>


   When the control is attached to an LDAP request, the processing of
   the request is conditional on the evaluation of the Filter as applied
   against the target of the operation.  If the Filter evaluates to
   TRUE, then the request is processed normally.  If the Filter
   evaluates to FALSE or Undefined, then assertionFailed (122)
   resultCode is returned, and no further processing is performed.

   For Add, Compare, and ModifyDN operations, the target is indicated by
   the entry field in the request.  For Modify operations, the target is
   indicated by the object field.  For Delete operations, the target is
   indicated by the DelRequest type.  For Compare operations and all
   update operations, the evaluation of the assertion MUST be performed
   as an integral part of the operation.  That is, the evaluation of the
   assertion and the normal processing of the operation SHALL be done as
   one atomic action.

   For Search operations, the target is indicated by the baseObject
   field, and the evaluation is done after "finding" but before
   "searching" [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].  Hence, no entries or continuations references
   are returned if the assertion fails.

   Servers implementing this technical specification SHOULD publish the
   object identifier 1.3.6.1.1.12 as a value of the 'supportedControl'
   attribute [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>] in their root DSE.  A server MAY choose to
   advertise this extension only when the client is authorized to use
   it.

   Other documents may specify how this control applies to other LDAP
   operations.  In doing so, they must state how the target entry is
   determined.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The filter may, like other components of the request, contain
   sensitive information.  When it does, this information should be
   appropriately protected.

   As with any general assertion mechanism, the mechanism can be used to
   determine directory content.  Hence, this mechanism SHOULD be subject
   to appropriate access controls.

   Some assertions may be very complex, requiring significant time and
   resources to evaluate.  Hence, this mechanism SHOULD be subject to
   appropriate administrative controls.

   Security considerations for the base operations [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] extended by
   this control, as well as general LDAP security considerations
   [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>], generally apply to implementation and use of this
   extension.
