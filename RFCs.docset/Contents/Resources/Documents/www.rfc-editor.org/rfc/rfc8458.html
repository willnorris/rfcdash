     <span class="h1">Using National Bibliography Numbers as Uniform Resource Names</span>

Abstract

   National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs) are used by national libraries
   and other organizations in order to identify resources in their
   collections.  NBNs are usually applied to resources that are not
   catered for by established (standard) identifier systems such as
   International Standard Book Number (ISBN).

   A Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for NBNs was established in
   2001 in <a href="./rfc3188">RFC 3188</a>.  Since then, a number of European national
   libraries have implemented URN:NBN-based systems.

   This document replaces <a href="./rfc3188">RFC 3188</a> and defines how NBNs can be supported
   within the updated URN framework.  A revised namespace registration
   (version 4) compliant to <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a> is included.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   One of the basic permanent Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes
   (cf. [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>] and [<a href="#ref-IANA-URI" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes"'>IANA-URI</a>]) is Uniform Resource Name (URN).  URNs
   were originally defined in <a href="./rfc2141">RFC 2141</a> [<a href="./rfc2141" title='"URN Syntax"'>RFC2141</a>].  In 2017, a revision
   was adopted with new definitions and registration procedures
   [<a href="./rfc8141" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URNs)"'>RFC8141</a>].  Any traditional identifier, when used within the URN
   system, must have a namespace of its own that is registered with IANA
   [<a href="#ref-IANA-URN" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces"'>IANA-URN</a>].  National Bibliography Number (NBN) is one such
   namespace, specified in 2001 in <a href="./rfc3188">RFC 3188</a> [<a href="./rfc3188" title='"Using National Bibliography Numbers as Uniform Resource Names"'>RFC3188</a>].

   This document describes the syntax and usage of NBN URNs and updates
   the registration of the associated URN namespace.  This document
   additionally describes certain policy assumptions about how national
   libraries and their partner organizations partition, delegate, and
   manage the namespace.  Violation of those assumptions could impact
   the utility of the NBN URN namespace.

   URN:NBNs are in production use in several European countries
   including (in alphabetical order) Austria, Finland, Germany, Hungary,
   Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.  The URN:NBN
   namespace is collectively managed by these national libraries.  URN:
   NBNs have been applied to diverse content including Web archives,
   digitized materials, research data, and doctoral dissertations.  They
   can be used by national libraries and organizations cooperating with
   them.

   As a part of the initial development of the URN system in the late
   1990s, the IETF URN Working Group agreed that it was important to
   demonstrate that the URN syntax can accommodate existing identifier
   systems.  <a href="./rfc2288">RFC 2288</a> [<a href="./rfc2288" title='"Using Existing Bibliographic Identifiers as Uniform Resource Names"'>RFC2288</a>] investigated the feasibility of using
   ISBN, ISSN, and SICI (Serial Item and Contribution Identifier) as
   URNs, with positive results; however, it did not formally register
   corresponding URN namespaces.  (For further discussion of how these
   systems have evolved as URNs, see <a href="./rfc8254">RFC 8254</a> [<a href="./rfc8254" title='"Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Registration Transition"'>RFC8254</a>].)  This was in
   part due to the still-evolving process to formalize criteria for
   namespace definition documents and registration.  The criteria were
   consolidated later in the IETF, first in <a href="./rfc2611">RFC 2611</a> [<a href="./rfc2611" title='"URN Namespace Definition Mechanisms"'>RFC2611</a>], then <a href="./rfc3406">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3406">3406</a> [<a href="./rfc3406" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms"'>RFC3406</a>], and now <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a> [<a href="./rfc8141" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URNs)"'>RFC8141</a>].

   URN namespaces have been registered for NBN, ISBN, and ISSN in RFCs
   3188 [<a href="./rfc3188" title='"Using National Bibliography Numbers as Uniform Resource Names"'>RFC3188</a>], 3187 [<a href="./rfc3187" title='"Using International Standard Book Numbers as Uniform Resource Names"'>RFC3187</a>], and 3044 [<a href="./rfc3044" title='"Using The ISSN (International Serial Standard Number) as URN (Uniform Resource Names) within an ISSN-URN Namespace"'>RFC3044</a>], respectively.
   ISBN and ISSN namespaces were made compliant with <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a> [<a href="./rfc8141" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URNs)"'>RFC8141</a>]
   in 2017 by publishing revised ISSN [<a href="#ref-ISSN-namespace">ISSN-namespace</a>] and ISBN
   [<a href="#ref-ISBN-namespace">ISBN-namespace</a>] namespace registrations.

   The term "National Bibliography Number" encompasses persistent local
   identifier systems that national libraries and their partner
   organizations use in addition to the more formally (and
   internationally) established identifiers.  These partner
   organizations include universities and their libraries and other
   subsidiaries, other research institutions, plus governmental and
   public organizations.  Some national libraries maintain a significant
   number of these liaison relationships; for instance, the German
   National Library had almost 400 by early 2018 [<a href="#ref-NBN-Resolving">NBN-Resolving</a>].

   In practice, NBN differs from standard identifier systems such as
   ISBN and ISSN because it is not a single identifier system with
   standard-specified scope and syntax.  Each NBN implementer creates
   its own system with its own syntax and assignment rules.  Each user
   organization is also obliged to keep track of how NBNs are being
   used; however, within the generic framework set in this document,
   local NBN assignment policies may vary considerably.

   Historically, NBNs have been applied in the national bibliographies
   to identify the resources catalogued into them.  Prior to the
   emergence of bibliographic standard identifiers in the early 1970s,
   national libraries assigned NBNs to all catalogued publications.

   Since the late 1990s, the NBN scope has been extended to cover a vast
   range of resources, both originally digital and digitized.  Only a
   small subset of these resources is catalogued in the national
   bibliographies or other bibliographic databases.  Digitized resources
   and their component parts (such as still images in books or journal
   articles) are examples of resources that may get NBNs.

   It is possible to extend the scope of the NBN much further.  The
   National Library of Finland is using them in the Finnish National
   Ontology Service Finto to identify corporate names (see
   &lt;<a href="http://finto.fi/cn/en/">http://finto.fi/cn/en/</a>&gt;).  Using NBNs to identify metadata elements
   provides a stable basis for creation of linked data.

   Simple guidelines for using NBNs as URNs and the original namespace
   registration were published in <a href="./rfc3188">RFC 3188</a> [<a href="./rfc3188" title='"Using National Bibliography Numbers as Uniform Resource Names"'>RFC3188</a>].  The RFC at hand
   replaces <a href="./rfc3188">RFC 3188</a>; sections discussing the methods by which URN:NBNs
   should be resolved have been updated, unused features have been
   eliminated, and the text is compliant with the stipulations of the
   revised URN specification [<a href="./rfc8141" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URNs)"'>RFC8141</a>].

   "NBN" refers to any National Bibliography Number identifier system
   used by the national libraries (or equivalent organizations) and
   other institutions, which use these identifiers with national
   libraries' support and permission.

   In this memo, "URN:NBN" is used as a shorthand for "NBN-based URN".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   NBNs are widely used to identify both hand-held and digital resources
   in the collections of national libraries and other institutions that
   are responsible for preserving the cultural heritage of their
   constituents.  Resources in these collections are usually preserved
   for a long time (i.e., for centuries).  While the preferred methods
   for digital preservation may vary over time and depend on the
   content, the favorite one has been migration.  Whenever necessary, a
   resource in an outdated file format is migrated into a more modern
   file format.  To the extent possible, all old versions of the
   resource are also kept in order to alleviate the negative effects of
   partially successful migrations and the gradual loss of original look
   and feel that may accompany even fully successful migrations.  When
   NBN is used to identify manifestations and there are many of them for
   a single work, local policy can require that each manifestation ought
   to have its own NBN.

   NBNs are typically used to identify objects for which standard
   identifiers such as ISBN are not applicable.  However, NBNs can be
   used for component resources even when the resource as a whole
   qualifies for a standard identifier.  For instance, if a digitized
   book has an ISBN, JPEG image files of its pages might be assigned
   NBNs.  These URN:NBNs can be used as persistent links to the pages.

   The scope of standard identifier systems such as ISBN and ISSN is
   limited; they are applicable only to certain kinds of resources.  One
   of the roles of the NBN is to fill in the gaps left by the standard
   identifiers.  Collectively, these identifiers and NBNs cover all
   resources that national libraries and their partners need to include
   in their collections.

   National libraries are the key organizations providing persistent URN
   resolution services for resources identified with NBNs, independent
   of their form.  As coordinators of NBN usage, national libraries have
   allowed other organizations, such as university libraries or
   governmental organizations, to assign NBNs to the resources these
   organizations preserve for the long term.  In such case, the national
   library coordinates the use of NBNs at the national level.  National
   libraries can also provide URN resolution services and technical
   services to other NBN users.  These organizations are expected to
   either establish their own URN resolution services or use the
   technical infrastructure provided by the national library.  URN:NBNs
   are expected to be resolvable and support one or more resolution
   services.

   Although NBNs can be used to identify component resources, the NBN
   namespace does not specify a generic, intrinsic syntax for doing
   that.  However, there are at least two different ways in which
   component resources can be taken into account within the NBN
   namespace.

   The simplest and probably the most common approach is to assign a
   separate NBN for each component resource, such as a file containing a
   digitized page of a book, and make no provisions to make such NBNs
   discernible in a systematic way from others.

   Second, if the stipulations of the URI generic syntax [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>] and
   the Internet media type specification [<a href="./rfc2046" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>RFC2046</a>] are met, in
   accordance with the provisions in <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a> [<a href="./rfc8141" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URNs)"'>RFC8141</a>], the URN
   f-component can be attached to URN:NBNs in order to indicate the
   desired location within the resource supplied by URN resolution.

   From the library community point of view, it is important that the
   f-component is not a part of the Namespace-Specific String (NSS), and
   therefore f-component attachment does not mean that the relevant
   component part is identified.  Moreover, the resolution process still
   retrieves the entire resource even if there is an f-component.  The
   component part selection is applied by the resolution client (e.g.,
   browser) to the resource returned by the resolution process.  In
   other words, in this latter case the component parts are just logical
   and physical parts of the identified resource whereas in the former
   cases they are independently named entities.

   Resources identified by NBNs are not always available in the
   Internet.  If one is not, the URN:NBN can resolve to a surrogate such
   as a metadata record describing the identified resource.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> below, and particularly <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>, presents a detailed
   overview of the application of the URN:NBN namespace as well as the
   principles of, and systems used for, the resolution of NBN-based
   URNs.

   National Bibliography Number (NBN) is a generic term referring to a
   group of identifier systems administered by national libraries and
   institutions authorized by them.  The NBN assignment is typically
   performed by the organization hosting the resource.  National
   libraries are committed to permanent preservation of their deposit
   collections.

   Assignment of NBN-based URNs is controlled on a national level by the
   national library (or national libraries, if there is more than one).
   National guidelines can differ, but the identified resources
   themselves are usually persistent.

   Different national URN:NBN assignment policies have resulted in
   varying levels of control of the assignment process.  Manual URN:NBN
   assignment by the library personnel provides the tightest control,
   especially if the URN:NBNs cover only resources catalogued into the
   national bibliography.  In most national libraries, the scope of
   URN:NBN is already much broader than this.  Usage rules can vary
   within one country, from one URN:NBN sub-namespace to the next.

   Each national library uses NBNs independently of other national
   libraries; apart from this document, there are no guidelines that
   specify or control NBN usage.  As such, NBNs are unique only on the
   national level.  When used as URNs, base NBN strings MUST be
   augmented with a controlled prefix, which is the particular nation's
   ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 two-letter country code (referred to as "ISO
   country code" below) [<a href="#ref-ISO3166-1">ISO3166-1</a>].  These prefixes guarantee
   uniqueness of the URN:NBNs at the global scale [<a href="#ref-ISO3166MA">ISO3166MA</a>].

   National libraries using URN:NBNs usually specify local assignment
   policies for themselves.  Such policy can limit the URN:NBN usage to,
   e.g., the resources stored in the national library's digital
   collections or databases.  Although this specification does not

   URN:NBNs unless such policy can be justified.

   URN:NBN assignment policy can clarify, for instance, the local policy
   concerning identifier assignment to component parts of resources and
   can specify, with sufficient detail, the syntax of local component
   identifiers (if there is one as a discernible part of the NBNs).  The
   policy can also cover any employed extensions to the default NBN
   scope.

   NBNs as such are locally but not globally unique; two national
   libraries can assign the same NBN to different resources.  A prefix,
   based on the ISO country code as described above, guarantees the
   global uniqueness of URN:NBNs.  Once an NBN has been assigned to a
   resource, it MUST be persistent, and therefore URN:NBNs are
   persistent as well.

   A URN:NBN, once it has been generated from a NBN, MUST NOT be reused
   for another resource.

   Users of the URN:NBN namespace MUST ensure that they do not assign
   the same URN:NBN twice.  Different policies can be applied to
   guarantee this.  For instance, NBNs and corresponding URN:NBNs can be
   assigned sequentially by programs in order to avoid human mistakes.
   It is also possible to use printable representations of checksums
   such as SHA-1 [<a href="./rfc6234" title='"US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)"'>RFC6234</a>] as NBNs.

   The Namespace-Specific String (NSS) will consist of three parts:

   o  a prefix consisting of an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code and
      optional sub-namespace code(s) separated by a colon(s);

   o  a hyphen (-) as the delimiting character; and,

   o  an NBN string assigned by the national library or sub-delegated
      authority.

   The following formal definition uses ABNF [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].

    nbn-nss     = prefix "-" nbn-string

    prefix      = iso-cc *( ":" subspc )
                ; The entire prefix is case insensitive.

    iso-cc      = 2ALPHA
                ; Alpha-2 country code as assigned by part 1 of ISO 3166
                ; (identifies the national library to which the branch
                ; is delegated).

    subspc      = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
                ; As assigned by the respective national library.

    nbn-string  = path-rootless
                ; The "path-rootless" rule is defined in <a href="./rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>.
                ; Syntax requirements specified in <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a> MUST be
                ; taken into account.

   A colon SHOULD be used within the prefix only as a delimiting
   character between the ISO 3166-1 country code and sub-namespace
   code(s), which splits the national namespace into smaller parts.

   The structure (if any) of the nbn_string is determined by the
   authority for the prefix.  Whereas the prefix is regarded as case
   insensitive, NBN strings can be case sensitive at the preference of
   the assigning authority; parsers therefore MUST treat these as case
   sensitive, and any case mapping needed to introduce case
   insensitivity is the responsibility of the relevant resolution
   system.

   A hyphen SHOULD be used as the delimiting character between the
   prefix and the NBN string.  Within the NBN string, a hyphen MAY be
   used for separating different sections of the identifier from one
   another.

   All two-letter codes are reserved by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency
   for either existing or possible future ISO country codes (or for
   private use).

   Sub-namespace identifiers MUST be registered on the national level by
   the national library that assigned the identifier.  The list of such
   identifiers can be made publicly available via the Web.

   Note that because case mapping for ASCII letters is completely
   reversible and does not lose information, the case used in case-
   insensitive matching is a local matter.  Implementations can convert

   consistently.

   URN:NBN resolvers do not currently support the use of either
   r-component or q-component.

   Resolution services based on r-component can be implemented in the
   future when the r-component syntax and semantics have been specified.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.2.%20%20Usage%20of%20f-component"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.2" id="section-4.2.2">4.2.2</a>.  Usage of f-component</span>

   If URN:NBN resolves to the identified resource and the media type of
   the resource supports f-component usage, it can be used to indicate a
   location within the identified resource.  Persistence is achieved if
   the URN:NBN is assigned to one and only one version of a resource,
   such as a PDF/A version of a book.

   The URN:NBN namespace does not impose any restrictions of its own on
   f-component usage.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20Encoding%20Considerations%20and%20Lexical%20Equivalence"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Encoding Considerations and Lexical Equivalence</span>

   Expressing NBNs as URNs is usually straightforward, as normally only
   ASCII characters are used in NBN strings.  If this is not the case,
   non-ASCII characters in NBNs MUST be translated into canonical form
   as specified in <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a>.  If a national library uses NBNs that can
   contain percent-encoded characters higher than U+007F, the library
   needs to carefully define the canonical transformation from these
   NBNs into URNs, including normalization forms.

   When an NBN is used as a URN, the NSS MUST consist of three parts:

   o  a prefix, structured as a primary prefix, which is a two-letter
      ISO 3166-1 country code of the library's country, and zero or more
      secondary prefixes that are each indicated by a delimiting colon
      character (:) and a sub-namespace identifier;

   o  a hyphen (-) as a delimiting character; and,

   o  the NBN string.

   Different delimiting characters are not semantically equivalent.

   The syntax and roles of the three parts listed above are described in
   <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.

   If there are several national libraries in one country, these
   libraries MUST agree on how to divide the national namespace between
   themselves using this method before the URN:NBN assignment begins in
   any of these libraries.

   A national library MAY also assign URN:NBN sub-namespaces to trusted
   organizations such as universities or government institutions.  The
   sub-namespace MAY be further divided by the partner organization.
   All sub-namespace identifiers used within a country-code-based
   namespace MUST be registered on the national level by the national
   library that assigned the code.  The national register of these codes
   SHOULD be made available online.

   Being part of the prefix, sub-namespace identifier strings are case-
   insensitive.  They MUST NOT contain any colons or hyphens.

   Formally, two URN:NBNs are lexically equivalent if they are octet-
   by-octet equal after the following (conceptional) preprocessing:

   1.  convert all characters in the leading "urn:nbn:" token to a
       single case;

   2.  convert all characters in the prefix (country code and its
       optional sub-divisions) to a single case; and,

   3.  convert all characters embedded in any percent-encodings to a
       single case.

   Eventually, URNs might be resolved with the help of a Global Resolver
   Discovery Service (GRDS), and URN:NBN syntax makes it possible to
   locate the relevant resolver.  Since no GRDS system has been
   installed yet in the Internet, URN:NBNs are embedded in HTTP URIs in
   order to make them actionable in the present Internet.  In these HTTP
   URIs, the authority part must point to the appropriate URN resolution
   service.  For instance, in Finland, the address of the national URN
   resolver is &lt;<a href="http://urn.fi">http://urn.fi</a>&gt;.  Thus, the HTTP URI for the Finnish URN
   in the example above is &lt;<a href="http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201003181510">http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201003181510</a>&gt;.

   The country-code-based prefix part of the URN:NBN namespace-specific
   string will provide a hint needed to find the correct resolution
   service for URN:NBNs from the GRDS when it is established.

   There are three interrelated aspects of persistence that need to be
   discussed: persistence of the objects itself, persistence of the
   identifier, and persistence of the URN resolvers.

   NBNs have traditionally been assigned to printed resources, which
   tend to be persistent.  In contrast, digital resources require
   frequent migrations to guarantee accessibility.  Although it is
   impossible to estimate how often migrations are needed, hardware and
   software upgrades take place frequently, and a lifetime exceeding
   10-20 years can be considered as long.

   However, it is a common practice to keep also the original and
   previously migrated versions of resources.  Therefore, even outdated
   versions of resources can be available in digital archives, no matter
   how old or difficult to use they have become.

   If all versions of a resource are kept, a user who requires
   authenticity can retrieve the original version of the resource,
   whereas a user to whom the ease of use is a priority is likely to be
   satisfied with the latest version.  In order to enable the users to
   find the best match, a national library can link all manifestations
   of a resource to each other so as to make a user aware of them.

   Thus, even if specific versions of digital resources are not normally
   persistent, persistent identifiers such as URN:NBNs support
   information architectures that enable persistent access to any
   version of the resource, including ones that can only be utilized by
   using digital archaeology tools such as custom-made applications to
   render the resource.

   Persistence of URN resolvers themselves is mainly an organizational
   issue that is related to the persistence of organizations maintaining
   them.  As URN:NBN resolution services will be supplied (primarily) by
   the national libraries, these services are likely to be long lived.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.5.%20%20Additional%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" id="section-4.5">4.5</a>.  Additional Considerations</span>

   It is a good idea to apply URN:NBNs (or other persistent identifiers)
   to all resources that have been prioritized in the organization's
   digital preservation plan.

   Assignment of URN:NBNs to resources that are known to not be
   persistent should be considered carefully.  URN:NBNs can, however, be
   applied to resources that have a low-level preservation priority and
   will not be migrated to more modern file formats or preserved via
   emulation.

   If the identified version of a resource has disappeared, the
   resolution process can supply a surrogate if one exists.  A surrogate
   can be, for instance, a more modern digital version of the original
   electronic resource.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Number%20%28NBN%29"></a>    Number (NBN)</span>

   This URN namespace registration describes how National Bibliography
   Numbers (NBNs) can be supported within the URN framework; it uses the
   updated IANA template specified in <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a>.

   Namespace Identifier:  NBN
      This namespace ID was formally assigned to the National
      Bibliography Number in October 2001, when the namespace was
      registered officially [<a href="./rfc3188" title='"Using National Bibliography Numbers as Uniform Resource Names"'>RFC3188</a>].  Utilization of URN:NBNs had
      started in demo systems already in 1998.  Since 2001, tens of
      millions of URN:NBNs have been assigned.  The number of users of
      the namespace has grown in two ways: new national libraries have
      started using NBNs, and many national libraries using the system
      have formed new liaisons.

      The National Library of Finland registered the namespace on behalf
      of the Conference of the European National Librarians (CENL) and
      Conference of Directors of National Libraries (CDNL).  The NBN
      namespace is available for free for the national libraries.  They
      can allow other organizations to assign URN:NBNs and use the
      resolution services established by the library for free or for a
      fee.  The fees, if collected, can be based on, e.g., the
      maintenance costs of the system.

   Purpose:  See <a href="./rfc8458#section-3">Section 3 of RFC 8458</a>

   Syntax:  See <a href="./rfc8458#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of RFC 8458</a>

   Security and Privacy:  See <a href="./rfc8458#section-7">Section 7 of RFC 8458</a>

   Interoperability:
      National libraries and their partners usually apply URN:NBNs if a
      standard identifier such as ISBN is not applicable for the
      resource to be identified.  Some overlap with other URN namespaces
      is possible.

      URN:NBNs may contain characters which must be percent-encoded, but
      usually they consist of printable ASCII characters only.

   Resolution:  See <a href="./rfc8458#section-4.4">Section 4.4 of RFC 8458</a>

   Documentation:  <a href="./rfc8458">RFC 8458</a>

   Revision Information:
      This version of the URN:NBN namespace registration has been
      updated to use the revised definition of URN syntax from <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a>,
      although usage of r-components is not specified yet.  In addition,
      non-ISO 3166 (country code) based NBNs have been deleted due to
      lack of deployment.  The entire NBN prefix is now specified to be
      case insensitive in accordance with established practice.  This
      version also includes numerous clarifications based on actual
      usage of URN:NBNs.

   This document defines means of encoding NBNs as URNs.  A URN
   resolution service for NBN-based URNs is depicted but only at a
   generic level; thus, questions of secure or authenticated resolution
   mechanisms and authentication of users are out of scope of this
   document.

   Although no validation mechanisms are specified on the global level
   (beyond a routine check of those characters that require special
   encoding when employed in URIs), NBNs assigned by any given authority
   can have a well-specified and rich syntax (including, e.g., fixed
   length and checksum).  In such cases, it is possible to validate the
   correctness of NBNs programmatically.

   Issues regarding intellectual property rights associated with objects
   identified by the URN:NBNs are beyond the scope of this document, as
   are questions about rights to the databases that might be used to
   construct resolution services.

   Beyond the generic security considerations laid out in the underlying
   documents listed in the Normative References, no specific security
   threats have been identified for NBN-based URNs.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Significant%20Changes%20from%20RFC%203188"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Significant Changes from <a href="./rfc3188">RFC 3188</a></span>

   Numerous clarifications have been made based on a decade of
   experience with <a href="./rfc3188">RFC 3188</a>.

   NBNs that are not based on ISO 3166 (country codes) have been removed
   due to lack of usage.

   In accordance with established practice, the whole NBN prefix is now
   declared case insensitive.

   The document is based on the new URN syntax specification, <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a>.

   Use of query components and fragment components with this namespace
   is now specified in accordance with <a href="./rfc8141">RFC 8141</a>.
