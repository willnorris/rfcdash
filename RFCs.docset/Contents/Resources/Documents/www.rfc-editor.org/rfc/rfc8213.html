    <span class="h1">Security of Messages Exchanged between Servers and Relay Agents</span>

Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has no
   guidance for how to secure messages exchanged between servers and
   relay agents.  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
   (DHCPv6) states that IPsec should be used to secure messages
   exchanged between servers and relay agents but does not require
   encryption.  With recent concerns about pervasive monitoring and
   other attacks, it is appropriate to require securing relay-to-relay
   and relay-to-server communication for DHCPv6 and relay-to-server
   communication for DHCPv4.

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>]
   and the Bootstrap Protocol [<a href="./rfc1542" title='"Clarifications and Extensions for the Bootstrap Protocol"'>RFC1542</a>] have no guidance for how to
   secure messages exchanged between servers and relay agents.  The
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>]
   states that IPsec should be used to secure messages exchanged between
   servers and relay agents but does not recommend encryption.  With
   recent concerns about pervasive monitoring [<a href="./rfc7258" title='"Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack"'>RFC7258</a>], it is
   appropriate to require use of IPsec with encryption for relay-to-
   server communication for DHCPv4 and require use of IPsec with
   encryption for relay-to-relay and relay-to-server communication for
   DHCPv6.

   This document specifies the optional requirements for relay agent and
   server implementations to support IPsec authentication and encryption
   and recommends that operators enable this IPsec support.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP</a>

   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terminology from [<a href="./rfc1542" title='"Clarifications and Extensions for the Bootstrap Protocol"'>RFC1542</a>], [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>], and
   [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Security%20of%20Messages%20Exchanged%20between%20Servers%20and%20Relay%20Agents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Security of Messages Exchanged between Servers and Relay Agents</span>

   For DHCPv6 [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>], this specification REQUIRES relay and server
   implementations to support IPsec encryption of relay-to-relay and
   relay-to-server communication as documented below.  The remainder of
   this section replaces the text in <a href="./rfc3315#section-21.1">Section 21.1 of [RFC3315]</a> when this
   specification is followed.

   For DHCPv4 [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>], this specification REQUIRES relay and server
   implementations to support IPsec encryption of relay-to-server
   communication as documented below.

   This specification RECOMMENDS that operators enable IPsec for this
   communication.

   By using IPsec with encryption for this communication, potentially
   sensitive client message and relay included information, such as the
   DHCPv4 Relay Agent Information option (82) [<a href="./rfc3046" title='"DHCP Relay Agent Information Option"'>RFC3046</a>], vendor-specific
   information (for example, the options defined in [<a href="#ref-CableLabs-DHCP">CableLabs-DHCP</a>]),
   and Access-Network-Identifier option(s) [<a href="./rfc7839" title='"Access-Network-Identifier Option in DHCP"'>RFC7839</a>], are protected from
   pervasive monitoring and other attacks.

   Relay agents and servers MUST be able to exchange messages using the
   IPsec mechanisms described in [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>] with the conditions below.
   If a client message is relayed through multiple relay agents (relay
   chain), each of the relay agents MUST have established independent,
   pairwise trust relationships.  That is, if messages from client C
   will be relayed by relay agent A to relay agent B and then to the
   server, relay agents A and B MUST be configured to use IPsec for the
   messages they exchange, and relay agent B and the server MUST be
   configured to use IPsec for the messages they exchange.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8213">RFC 8213</a>               DHCP Relay/Server Security            August 2017</span>


   Relay agents and servers use IPsec with the following conditions:

   Selectors        Relay agents are manually configured with the
                    addresses of the relay agent or server to which DHCP
                    messages are to be forwarded.  Each relay agent and
                    server that will be using IPsec for securing DHCP
                    messages MUST also be configured with a list of the
                    relay agents to which messages will be returned.
                    The selectors for the relay agents and servers will
                    be the pairs of addresses defining relay agents and
                    servers and the direction of DHCP message exchange
                    on DHCPv4 UDP port 67 or DHCPv6 UDP port 547.

   Mode             Relay agents and servers MUST use IPsec in transport
                    mode and use Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).

   Encryption and authentication algorithms
                    This document REQUIRES combined mode algorithms for
                    ESP authenticated encryption, ESP encryption
                    algorithms, and ESP authentication algorithms as per
                    Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>, <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>, and <a href="#section-2.3">2.3</a> of [<a href="./rfc7321" title='"Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH)"'>RFC7321</a>],
                    respectively.  Encryption is required as relay
                    agents may forward unencrypted client messages as
                    well as include additional sensitive information,
                    such as vendor-specific information (for example,
                    the options defined in [<a href="#ref-CableLabs-DHCP">CableLabs-DHCP</a>]) and the
                    Access-Network-Identifier Option defined in
                    [<a href="./rfc7839" title='"Access-Network-Identifier Option in DHCP"'>RFC7839</a>].

   Key management   Because both relay agents and servers tend to be
                    managed by a single organizational entity, public
                    key schemes MAY be optional.  Manually configured
                    key management MAY suffice but does not provide
                    defense against replayed messages.  Accordingly,
                    Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
                    [<a href="./rfc7296" title='"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC7296</a>] with pre-shared secrets SHOULD be
                    supported.  IKEv2 with public keys MAY be supported.
                    Additional information on manual vs. automated key
                    management and when one should be used over the
                    other can be found in [<a href="./rfc4107" title='"Guidelines for Cryptographic Key Management"'>RFC4107</a>].

   Security policy  DHCP messages between relay agents and servers MUST
                    only be accepted from DHCP peers as identified in
                    the local configuration.

   Authentication   Shared keys, indexed to the source IP address of the
                    received DHCP message, are adequate in this
                    application.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8213">RFC 8213</a>               DHCP Relay/Server Security            August 2017</span>


   Note: As using IPsec with multicast has additional complexities (see
   [<a href="./rfc5374" title='"Multicast Extensions to the Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC5374</a>]), relay agents SHOULD be configured to forward DHCP
   messages to unicast addresses.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security model specified in this document is hop by hop.  For
   DHCPv6, there could be multiple relay agents between a client and
   server, and each of these hops needs to be secured.  For DHCPv4,
   there is no support for multiple relays.

   As this document only mandates securing messages exchanged between
   relay agents and servers, the message exchanges between clients and
   the first-hop relay agent or server are not secured.  Clients may
   follow the recommendations in [<a href="./rfc7844" title='"Anonymity Profiles for DHCP Clients"'>RFC7844</a>] to minimize what information
   they expose or make use of secure DHCPv6 [<a href="#ref-SEC-DHCPv6">SEC-DHCPv6</a>] to secure
   communication between the client and server.

   As mentioned in <a href="./rfc4552#section-14">Section 14 of [RFC4552]</a>, the following are known
   limitations of the usage of manual keys:

   o  As the sequence numbers cannot be negotiated, replay protection
      cannot be provided.  This leaves DHCP insecure against all the
      attacks that can be performed by replaying DHCP packets.

   o  Manual keys are usually long lived (changing them often is a
      tedious task).  This gives an attacker enough time to discover the
      keys.

   It should be noted that if the requirements in this document are
   followed, while the DHCP traffic on the wire between relays and
   servers is encrypted, the unencrypted data may still be available
   through other attacks on the DHCP servers, relays, and related
   systems.  Securing these systems and the data in databases and logs
   also needs to be considered on both the systems themselves and when
   transferred over a network (i.e., to network attached storage for
   backups or to operational support systems).

   Use of IPsec as described herein is also applicable to Lightweight
   DHCPv6 Relay Agents [<a href="./rfc6221" title='"Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent"'>RFC6221</a>], as they have a link-local address that
   can be used to secure communication with their next-hop relay(s).
