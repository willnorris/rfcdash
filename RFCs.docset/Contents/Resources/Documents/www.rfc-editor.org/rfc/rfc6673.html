                     <span class="h1">Round-Trip Packet Loss Metrics</span>

Abstract

   Many user applications (and the transport protocols that make them
   possible) require two-way communications.  To assess this capability,
   and to achieve test system simplicity, round-trip loss measurements
   are frequently conducted in practice.  The Two-Way Active Measurement
   Protocol specified in <a href="./rfc5357">RFC 5357</a> establishes a round-trip loss
   measurement capability for the Internet.  However, there is currently
   no round-trip packet loss metric specified according to the <a href="./rfc2330">RFC 2330</a>
   framework.

   This memo adds round-trip loss to the set of IP Performance Metrics
   (IPPM).

   This memo defines a metric to quantify an IP network's ability to
   transfer packets in both directions from one host to another host.
   Two-way communication is almost always needed; thus, failure to
   transfer a packet in either direction constitutes a round-trip packet
   loss.

   This memo defines a metric for round-trip packet loss on Internet
   paths.  It builds on the notions and conventions introduced in the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework [<a href="./rfc2330" title='"Framework for IP Performance Metrics"'>RFC2330</a>].  Also, the
   specifications of the one-way packet loss metric for IPPM [<a href="./rfc2680" title='"A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2680</a>]
   and the round-trip delay metric for IPPM [<a href="./rfc2681" title='"A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2681</a>] are frequently

   referenced and modified to match the round-trip circumstances
   addressed here.  However, this memo assumes that the reader is
   familiar with the references; thus, it does not repeat material as
   was done in [<a href="./rfc2681" title='"A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2681</a>].

   This memo uses the terms "two-way" and "round-trip" synonymously.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Motivation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Motivation</span>

   Many user applications and the transport protocols that make them
   possible require two-way communications.  For example, the TCP SYN-&gt;,
   &lt;-SYN-ACK, ACK-&gt; three-way handshake attempted billions of times each
   day cannot be completed without two-way connectivity in a near-
   simultaneous time interval.  Thus, measurements of Internet round-
   trip packet loss performance provide a basis to infer application
   performance more easily.

   Measurement system designers have also recognized advantages of
   system simplicity when one host simply echoes or reflects test
   packets to the sender.  Round-trip packet loss measurements are
   frequently conducted and reported in practice.  The ubiquitous "ping"
   tools allow the measurement of round-trip packet loss and delay but
   usually require ICMP Echo-Request/Reply support, and ICMP packets may
   encounter exceptional treatment on the measurement path (see
   <a href="./rfc2681#section-2.6">Section 2.6 of [RFC2681]</a>).  The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
   (TWAMP) specified in [<a href="./rfc5357" title='"A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"'>RFC5357</a>] establishes a round-trip packet loss
   measurement capability for the Internet.  However, there is currently
   no round-trip packet loss metric specified according to the [<a href="./rfc2330" title='"Framework for IP Performance Metrics"'>RFC2330</a>]
   framework.

   [<a id="ref-RFC2681">RFC2681</a>] indicates that round-trip measurements may sometimes
   encounter "asymmetric" paths.  When loss is observed using a round-
   trip measurement, there is often a desire to ascertain which of the
   two directional paths "lost" the packet.  Under some circumstances,
   it is possible to make this inference.  The round-trip measurement
   method raises a few complications when interpreting the embedded one-
   way results, and the user should be aware of them.

   [<a id="ref-RFC2681">RFC2681</a>] also points out that loss measurement conducted
   sequentially in both directions of a path and reported as a round-
   trip result may be exactly the desired metric.  On the other hand, it
   may be difficult to derive the state of round-trip packet loss from
   one-way measurements conducted in each direction unless a method to
   match the appropriate one-way measurements has been pre-arranged.

   Finally, many measurement systems report statistics on a conditional
   delay distribution, where the condition is packet arrival at the
   destination.  This condition is encouraged in [<a href="./rfc3393" title='"IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)"'>RFC3393</a>], [<a href="./rfc5481" title='"Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement"'>RFC5481</a>],

   and [<a href="./rfc6703" title='"Reporting IP Network Performance Metrics: Different Points of View"'>RFC6703</a>].  As a result, lost packets need to be reported
   separately, according to a standardized metric.  This memo defines
   such a metric.

   See <a href="./rfc2680#section-1.1">Section 1.1 of [RFC2680]</a> for additional motivation of the packet
   loss metric.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   This memo defines a round-trip packet loss metric using the
   conventions of the IPPM framework [<a href="./rfc2330" title='"Framework for IP Performance Metrics"'>RFC2330</a>].

   The memo defines a singleton metric, a sample metric, and a
   statistic, as per [<a href="./rfc2330" title='"Framework for IP Performance Metrics"'>RFC2330</a>].  The [<a href="./rfc2330" title='"Framework for IP Performance Metrics"'>RFC2330</a>] framework is for active
   measurement methods.  Although this metric MAY be applicable in
   passive measurement as well, discussion of additional considerations
   for the passive scenario are beyond the normative scope of this memo.

   The memo also investigates the topic of one-way loss inference from a
   two-way measurement and lists some key considerations.

   To reduce the redundant information presented in the detailed metrics

   o  Tf, a time (end of test interval)

   o  lambda, a rate in reciprocal seconds (for Poisson Streams)

   o  incT, the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit (for Periodic Streams)

      it leaves for Dst.

   o  TstampDst, the wire time of the packet as measured at MP(Dst),
      assigned to packets that arrive within a "reasonable" time (less
      than Tmax).

   o  Tmax, a maximum waiting time for packets to arrive at Src, set
      sufficiently long to disambiguate packets with long delays from
      packets that are discarded (lost).

   o  M, the total number of packets sent between T0 and Tf

   o  N, the total number of packets received at Dst (sent between T0
      and Tf)

   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss SHALL be represented by the binary logical
   values (or their equivalents) when the following conditions are met:

   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss = 0:

   o  Src sent the first bit of a Type-P packet to Dst at wire-time
      TstampSrc,

   o  that Dst received that packet,

   o  the Dst sent a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
      possible (certainly less than Tmax, and fast enough for the
      intended purpose), and

   o  that Src received the last bit of the reflected packet prior to
      wire-time TstampSrc + Tmax.

   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss = 1:

   o  Src sent the first bit of a Type-P packet to Dst at wire-time
      TstampSrc,

   o  that Src did not receive the last bit of the reflected packet
      before the waiting time lapsed at TstampSrc + Tmax.

   Possible causes for the Loss = 1 outcome are as follows:

   o  the Dst did not receive that packet,

   o  the Dst did not send a Type-P packet back to the Src, or

   o  the Src did not receive a reflected Type-P packet sent from
      the Dst.

   Following the precedent of <a href="./rfc2681#section-2.4">Section 2.4 of [RFC2681]</a>, we make the
   simplifying assertion that round-trip loss measured between two hosts
   is equal regardless of the host that originates the test:

   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss(Src-&gt;Dst-&gt;Src) =
   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss(Dst-&gt;Src-&gt;Dst)

   (and agree with the rationale presented there -- that the ambiguity
   introduced is a small price to pay for measurement efficiency).

   Therefore, each singleton can be represented by pairs of elements as
   follows:

   o  TstampSrc, the wire time of the packet at the Src (beginning the
      round-trip journey).

   o  L, either zero or one (or some logical equivalent), where L=1
      indicates loss and L=0 indicates successful round-trip arrival
      prior to TstampSrc + Tmax.

   See [<a href="./rfc2680" title='"A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2680</a>] and [<a href="./rfc2681" title='"A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2681</a>] for extensive discussion, methods of
   measurement, errors and uncertainties, and other fundamental
   considerations that need not be repeated here.

   We add the following guidance regarding the responder process to
   "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as possible".

   A response that was not generated within Tmax is inadequate for any
   realistic test, and the Src will discard such responses.  A responder
   that serves typical round-trip packet loss testing (which is relevant
   to higher-layer application performance) SHOULD produce a response in
   1 second or less.  A responder that is unable to satisfy this
   requirement SHOULD log the fact so that an operator can adjust the
   load and priorities as necessary.  Analysis of responder timestamps
   [<a href="./rfc5357" title='"A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"'>RFC5357</a>] that finds responses are not generated in a timely fashion
   SHOULD result in operator notification, and the operator SHOULD
   suspend tests to the responder, since it may be overloaded.
   Additional measurement considerations are described in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>
   below.

   Given the singleton metric Type-P-Round-trip-Loss, we now define one
   particular sample of such singletons.  The idea of the sample is to
   select a particular binding of the parameters Src, Dst, and Type-P,
   then define a sample of values of parameter TstampSrc.  This can be
   done in several ways, including the following:

   1.  Poisson: a pseudo-random Poisson process of rate lambda, whose
       values fall between T and Tf.  The time interval between

   See [<a href="./rfc2680" title='"A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2680</a>] and [<a href="./rfc2681" title='"A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2681</a>] for extensive discussion, methods of
   measurement, errors and uncertainties, and other fundamental
   considerations that need not be repeated here.  However, when these
   references were approved, the packet reordering metrics in [<a href="./rfc4737" title='"Packet Reordering Metrics"'>RFC4737</a>]
   had not yet been defined, nor had reordering been addressed in IPPM
   methodologies.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4737">RFC4737</a>] defines packets that arrive "late" with respect to their
   sending order as reordered -- for example, when packets arrive with
   sequence numbers 4, 7, 5, 6, then packets 5 and 6 are reordered, and
   they are obviously not lost because they have arrived within some
   reasonable waiting time threshold.  The presence of reordering on a
   round-trip path has several likely effects on the measurement.

   1.  Methods of measurement should continue to wait the specified time
       for packets and avoid prematurely declaring round-trip packet
       loss when a sequence gap or error is observed.

   2.  The time distribution of the singletons in the sample has been
       significantly changed.

   3.  Either the original packet stream or the reflected packet stream
       experienced path instability, and the original conditions may no
       longer be present.

   Measurement implementations MUST address the possibility of packet
   reordering and avoid related errors in their processes.

   Given a Type-P-Round-trip-Loss-&lt;Sample&gt;-Stream, the average of
   all the logical values, L, in the stream is the
   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss-&lt;Sample&gt;-Ratio.  This ratio is in units of
   lost packets per round-trip transmissions actually attempted.

   In addition, the Type-P-Round-trip-Loss-&lt;Sample&gt;-Ratio is undefined
   if the sample is empty.

   This section raises considerations for results collected using a
   round-trip measurement architecture, such as in TWAMP [<a href="./rfc5357" title='"A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"'>RFC5357</a>].

   The sampling process for the reverse path (Dst-&gt;Src) is a conditional
   process that depends on successful packet arrival at the Dst and
   correct operation at the Dst to generate the reflected packet.
   Therefore, the sampling process for the reverse path will be
   significantly affected when appreciable loss occurs on the Src-&gt;Dst
   path, making an attempt to assess the reverse path performance
   invalid (for loss or possibly any metric).

   Further, the sampling times for the reverse path (Dst-&gt;Src) are a
   random process that depends on the original sample times (TstampSrc),
   the one-way delay for successful packet arrival at the Dst, and time
   taken at the Dst to generate the reflected packet.  Therefore, the
   sampling process for the reverse path will be significantly affected
   when appreciable delay variation occurs on the Src-&gt;Dst path, making
   an attempt to assess the reverse path performance invalid (for loss
   or possibly any metric).

   As discussed above in <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>, packet reordering is always a
   possibility.  In addition to the severe delay variation that usually
   accompanies it, reordering on the Src-&gt;Dst path will cause a
   misalignment of sequence numbers applied at the Dst when compared to
   the sender numbers.  Measurement implementations MUST address this
   possible outcome.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Measurement%20Considerations%20and%20Calibration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Measurement Considerations and Calibration</span>

   Prior to conducting this measurement, the participating hosts MUST be
   configured to send and receive test packets of the chosen Type-P.
   Standard measurement protocols are capable of this task [<a href="./rfc5357" title='"A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"'>RFC5357</a>],
   but any reliable method is sufficient (e.g., if the issues with ICMP
   discussed in <a href="./rfc2681#section-2.6">Section 2.6 of [RFC2681]</a> can be alleviated, and the
   requirements of Sections <a href="#section-4.3">4.3</a> and <a href="#section-4.4">4.4</a> above are met, then ICMP could
   be used).

   Two key features of the host that receives test packets and returns
   them to the originating host are described in <a href="./rfc5357#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of
   [RFC5357]</a>.  Every received test packet MUST result in a responding
   packet, and the response MUST be generated as quickly as possible.
   This implies that interface buffers will be serviced promptly and
   that buffer discards will be extremely rare.  These features of the

   measurement equipment MUST be calibrated according to <a href="./rfc2679#section-3.7.3">Section 3.7.3
   of [RFC2679]</a> when operating under a representative measurement load
   (as defined by the user).  Both unexpected test packet discards, and
   the systematic and random errors and uncertainties, MUST be recorded.

   We note that <a href="./rfc5357#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5357]</a> specifies a method to collect
   all four significant timestamps needed to describe a packet's round-
   trip delay [<a href="./rfc2681" title='"A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2681</a>] and remove the processing time incurred at the
   responding host.  This information supports the measurement of the
   corresponding one-way delays encountered on the round-trip path,
   which can identify path asymmetry or unexpected processing time at
   the responding host.

   This metric requires a stream of packets sent from one host (source)
   to another host (destination) through intervening networks, and back.
   This method could be abused for denial-of-service attacks directed at
   the destination and/or the intervening network(s).

   Administrators of source, destination, and intervening network(s)
   should establish bilateral or multilateral agreements regarding the
   timing, size, and frequency of collection of sample metrics.  Use of
   this method in excess of the terms agreed upon by the participants
   may be cause for immediate rejection or discard of packets, or other
   escalation procedures as defined between the affected parties.

   Active use of this method generates packets for a sample, rather than
   taking samples based on user data, and does not threaten user data
   confidentiality.  Passive measurement must restrict attention to the
   headers of interest.  Since user payloads may be temporarily stored
   for length analysis, suitable precautions MUST be taken to keep this
   information safe and confidential.  In most cases, a hashing function
   will produce a value suitable for payload comparisons.

   It may be possible to identify that a certain packet or stream of
   packets is part of a sample.  With that knowledge at the destination
   and/or the intervening networks, it is possible to change the
   processing of the packets (e.g., increasing or decreasing delay) in a
   way that may distort the measured performance.  It may also be

   possible to generate additional packets that appear to be part of the
