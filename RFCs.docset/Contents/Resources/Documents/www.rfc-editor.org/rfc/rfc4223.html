Abstract

   This memo reclassifies <a href="./rfc1863">RFC 1863</a>, A BGP/IDRP Route Server alternative
   to a full mesh routing, to Historic status.  This memo also obsoletes
   <a href="./rfc1863">RFC 1863</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Reclassification%20of%20RFC%201863%20to%20Historic"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Reclassification of <a href="./rfc1863">RFC 1863</a> to Historic</span>

   <a href="./rfc1863">RFC 1863</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"A BGP/IDRP Route Server alternative to a full mesh routing"'>1</a>] describes the use of route servers as an alternative to
   BGP/IDRP full mesh routing.

   In the context of this document, the term "<a href="./rfc1863">RFC 1863</a> route server" is
   used to refer to a route server as specified in <a href="./rfc1863">RFC 1863</a>.  Other uses
   of the term "route server" are outside the scope of this document.

   Implementations of <a href="./rfc1863">RFC 1863</a> route servers do not exist and are not
   used as an alternative to full mesh routing.  Therefore, <a href="./rfc1863">RFC 1863</a> is
   reclassified to Historic status.

   Current techniques that serve as an alternative to full mesh routing
   include BGP Route Reflectors [<a href="#ref-2" title='"BGP Route Reflection - An Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP"'>2</a>], BGP Confederedations [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Autonomous System Confederations for BGP"'>3</a>], and the
   use of private AS numbers.  IDRP for IP has never been standardized
   by the IETF and can be considered obsolete.

   Other uses of (non-RFC1863) route servers, rather than as an
   alternative to full mesh routing as described by <a href="./rfc1863">RFC 1863</a>, are
   expected to continue to be used for multiple purposes, but are out of
   the scope of this memo.
