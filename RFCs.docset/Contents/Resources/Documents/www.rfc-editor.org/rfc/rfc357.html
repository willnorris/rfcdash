                <span class="h1">An Echoing Strategy For Satellite Links</span>

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/I.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-I" id="appendix-I">I</a>. Introduction</span>

   As mentioned in <a href="./rfc346">RFC 346</a> ("Satellite Considerations" by Jon Postel)
   those interactive systems which provide echoing for full-duplex
   terminals over the ARPANET become more awkward to use as transmission
   delays increase.  The reason, of course, is that a character's round
   trip time is added to the inherent echo delay of the server with the
   result that the terminal echoing appears extremely sluggish.

   For a terminal separated from its server by a single satellite link,
   the delay will be such that even if echoing at the server were
   instantaneous, the latency between keying and printing of an input
   character will be nearly half a second.  If, in addition, the
   character is routed thru a portion of the surface net, the delay will
   be of course increase.  It is estimated that echo delays of at least
   one second will not be uncommon.

   This document describes a strategy which will eliminate the delay
   associated with simple echoing and allow the transmission delay to be
   hidden in the cost of computation only.  This scheme is proposed as
   an optional addition to existing User TELNETs; its use requires the
   explicit support of a cooperating server process.

II.  Standard Echo Strategy

   Echoing for locally connected full-duplex terminals is normally
   provided at the server by a resident system task called the (e.g.)
   Terminal Handler.  The Terminal Handler echoes on a one-for-one or
   simple replacement basis and buffers all typed input on behalf of the
   user process.

   To let the user process operate most efficiently, the Terminal
   Handler should collect characters until a complete command or
   parameter (or whatever) has been typed.  Then, presumably, the
   process can do some significant computing.  Since the user process



<span class="grey">Davidson                                                        [Page 1]</span></pre>

   knows the syntax of the string it expects, it can specify to the
   Terminal Handler those characters which delimit completed parameters.
   Such characters are called 'Wakeup Characters' since the user process
   is awakened as they are echoed.

   Certain commands keyed by the user will require an output response
   from the process.  In order that the typed commands be followed by
   its response and be separated from succeeding commands, the Terminal
   Handler must suspend echoing of user type-ahead.  It can resume
   echoing (starting for type-ahead - with the unechoed characters in
   the buffer) as soon as the process has stated (implicitly or
   explicitly) that it has completed the output response.

   Characters which cause the Terminal Handler to suspend echoing are
   called 'break characters' They are specified by the user process
   based upon the syntax of the expected input.  Normally break
   characters are also wakeup characters.  As examples:

      1. A text editor may gobble up typed English sentences every time
         a period or question mark is echoed.  The two characters are
         wakeup characters only.  There is no need to suspend echoing.

      2. In some systems, an ESC character is used to invoke command
         recognition.  The user who types

               CO [ESC] ABC [ESC] XYZ

         should see as output

            COPY (FROM FILE) ABC (TO FILE) XYZ

         The ESC is both a break and a wakeup.  The printout should be
         the same no matter how fast the user types.

   The server must provide a means for each user process to communicate
   the following to the Terminal Handler:

      1. the set of wakeup characters,
      2. the set of break characters,
      3. which break characters should and which should not be echoed,
         (Some break characters - such as ESC in example 2 - should not
         be echoed).
      4. completion of an output response,
      5. whether or not to echo characters. (Not echoing is useful in
         "hide your input" applications.)






<span class="grey">Davidson                                                        [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc357">RFC 357</a>         An Echoing Strategy For Satellite Links        June 1972</span>


   As far as implementation, 1. and 2. could be communicated by allowing
   the user process to specify a 128-bit (for an ASCII device) table
   with 1's set for each wakeup character, and another table with 1's
   set for each break character.  This approach becomes fairly expensive
   in terms of core memory as the number of terminals becomes large; the
   system must store these bit tables itself since in most cases the
   user process will not be in core while echoing is being done by the
   Terminal Handler.

   To reduce the storage requirements, the system can make known to all
   its programmers a limited number, say 4, of supported break
   characters for his process from, for example:

      a. alphanumeric characters,
      b. punctuation characters,
      c. echoable control characters (including the bell and CR, etc.),
         or
      d. non-echoable control characters (Control-C, etc.),

   by specifying in a system call which break set(s) should be used.
   This requires no more than 4 bits of system storage per terminal, and
   a single table to identify the set(s) to which each of the 128
   possible ASCII characters belongs.

   For the user process to communicate (3) to the Terminal Handler
   (which break characters should and which should not have echoed), the
   process can specify another 4 bit field with 1's set for those break
   classes whose members should be echoed.  For the 4 classes above,
   only 3 bits would be required since members of class (d) are defined
   to be non-echoable.

   To communicate the completion of an output response (4), the user
   process could issue an explicit system call; or, the Terminal Handler
   could assume completion when the user process requests input of the
   first character following the break.

   "Hide your input" (5) would be communicated by a system call which
   specifies either:

     (a) "break on every character and don't echo any break characters",
         or, for example
     (b) "don't echo anything and break on punctuation, or any control
         character" for an alphanumeric password,

   depending on the syntax of the expression to be hidden.

III.  Definitions

   Several new terms need to be defined, some of which are direct
   extensions of the terms used in the "standard echo strategy"
   description.  There is no reason to insist that the four buffers
   presented all be implemented as individual constructs; they are
   logically separated for clarity in the discussions which follow.

   Remote Controlled Echoing (RCE)

      This is the name for the echo strategy described in this document.
      Echoing will be controlled by the (remote) server but performed by
      the User TELNET.

   Input Buffer

      This is a logical buffer used by a User TELNET to hold characters
      in sequence as they are received from the terminal keyboard (after
      they have been converted to NVT characters).

   Transmission Buffer

      This is a logical buffer used by a User TELNET to hold NVT
      characters which have been typed but have not yet been transmitted
      to the server.

   Output Buffer

      This is a logical buffer used by a User TELNET to hold the NVT
      characters received from the server.

   Print Buffer

      This is a logical buffer residing in the User TELNET from which
      characters will be sent in sequence to the terminal printer. (The
      output buffer contains NVT characters which may have to be
      converted to characters employed by the actual terminal.)

   Break Classes

      The 128 possible (7-bit) ASCII characters employed by the Network
      Virtual Terminal can be partitioned into several quasi-equivalence
      classes (for example alphabetic, numeric, punctuation characters,
      etc.). These classes can be defined so that each character is a
      member of at least one class, although it may belong to more than
      one.





<span class="grey">Davidson                                                        [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc357">RFC 357</a>         An Echoing Strategy For Satellite Links        June 1972</span>


      A server process may indicate to a User TELNET that certain of
      these classes (or all, or none) are to be considered break
      classes.  That is, a break class is an equivalence class which is
      of special significance to the server process.  In terms of the
      discussion of section II, the Server recognized 4 equivalence
      classes any combination of which might be designated as break
      class by a particular process.

      The RCE implementation will have more than 4 equivalence classes
      (perhaps as many as 8) to provide more flexibility in the choice
      of break character sets.

   Break Action

      Two break actions are possible:

      (1) a break character encountered in the input buffer IS moved to
          the print buffer at the appropriate time, or
      (2) a break character encountered in the input buffer IS NOT moved
          to the print buffer.

      The server process will specify which break action should be
      followed. (The two actions correspond to echoing or not echoing
      the break character.)

IV.  Description

   (This description is written in terms of the TIP which, of course,
   embodies a User TELNET.)

   Remote Controlled Echoing is an attempt to remove the echo
   responsibility from the Terminal Handler and push it off into the
   TIP; wakeup processing is still handled at the server.  The process'
   interface (system calls, etc.) to the server's Terminal Handler need
   not change, but the (abbreviated) Terminal Handler (actually a Server
   TELNET) must find a way to relay the process' echo requirements to
   the TIP.  It does this with TELNET commands and control information.
   System calls and echo parameters (break classes, etc.) peculiar to a
   particular serving Host must be interpreted by the Server Telnet
   commands.

   Character Flow

      Refer to figure 1.  A character received from a full-duplex
      terminal will be converted to its NVT equivalent and placed in
      both the transmission AND the input buffers.  The TIP's
      transmission strategy determines when it will be removed from the
      transmission buffer; the server's RCE control commands dictate



<span class="grey">Davidson                                                        [Page 5]</span></pre>

      when it will be removed from the input buffer.

      A character received from the server will be placed in the output
      buffer.

      Of the three labeled paths DISCARD, ECHO and OUTPUT, exactly one
      is enabled at all times.  RCE commands dictate which one.  Thus
      characters may

         (DISCARD:) be removed in sequence from the input buffer and
                    discarded,
         (ECHO:)    be removed in sequence from the input buffer and
                    placed in the print buffer, of
         (OUTPUT:)  be removed in sequence from the output buffer and
                    placed in the print buffer.

      From the print buffer they will be converted from NVT characters
      and be immediately send to the terminal's printer.

   Commands: Server to Host

      The following are the proposed TELNET commands sent by the server
      process to the TIP.  Commands (2) thru (5) should not be sent if
      RCE is not being used.

        (1) Use Remote Controlled Echoing.  The server asks the TIP to
            employ the echo strategy described in this document.  The
            TIP can respond either YES (I will use it) or NO. (It is
            suggested that the response YES also be "Use RCE" to
            eliminate race conditions.)

        (2) Set Break Action.  This is actually 2 commands.  The server
            can set the break action to echo or not echo a break
            character.

        (3) Set Break Classes.  This command specifies those equivalence
            classes which are to be considered break classes.  It will
            be a two (8-bit) byte command.

            Note: The envisioned implementation requires the TIP to have
            a table with one entry per ASCII character.  Each entry is
            formatted with one bit position for each equivalence class,
            and a bit is set or reset according as the given character
            is or is not a member of that class.  The server sends a
            "Set Break Classes" command (1st byte) followed by a
            formatted control word (2nd byte) to the TIP with bit
            positions set for those equivalence classes which represent
            break classes for the server process.

            When a (virtual) character is taken from the input buffer
            the TIP does a table look-up indexed by the character.  If a
            simple ANDing of the table entry with the terminal's control
            word yields a non-zero result, a break was received.
            (Receipt of a break character enables the OUTPUT path.)

        (4) Move to Break (MTB).  This command directs the TIP to move
            characters in sequence from the input buffer to the print
            buffer until a break character is encountered.  The break
            character will be moved or discarded depending on the
            previously-specified break action.  (Essentially, MTB
            enables the ECHO path.)

        (5) Delete to Break (DTB).  This command directs the TIP to move
            characters in sequence from the input buffer and discard
            them until a break character is encountered.  The break
            character will also be discarded.  This provides a
            convenient mechanism for hiding a user's input.  (DTB



<span class="grey">Davidson                                                        [Page 7]</span></pre>

            enables the DISCARD path.)

   Commands: User to Server

            The USER may send (via TIP) a request to the server process
            requesting that it "Use Remote Controlled Echoing" to which
            the server must respond "YES" or "NO".

   General Operation

      Very simply, the Remote Controlled Echoing strategy works as
      follows: The Server TELNET will tell the TIP to (essentially)

         (1) echo a message,
         (2) print the process' response to that message,
         (3) echo the next message
         (4) print the response to that message
                      . . .

      etc., to effect an orderly listing of inputs and responses much as
      would be imposed when using a half-duplex device.

      The actual interaction depends on the control commands.  When a
      terminal-serving process is invoked on behalf of a TIP user, the
      Server TELNET will send the "Use RCE" command; the TIP will
      respond "YES".  Then the Server TELNET will send the "Set Break
      Action" and "Set Break Classes" commands to properly reflect the
      break strategy requested by the terminal-serving process.  Lastly
      the Server TELNET will send an MTB command.  This enables the ECHO
      path.

      The TIP removes characters from the input buffer and places them
      in the print buffer.  When it encounters a break character, it
      performs the break action specified, and enables the OUTPUT path.

      Characters are then moved in sequence from the output buffer to
      the print buffer.  When an MTB (or, DTB) is encountered, it is
      discarded and the ECHO (DISCARD) path is enabled.

      Etcetera.

      The Server TELNET may change the break action or break classes
      after an interaction, but should normally do so prior to sending
      the MTB or DTB commands.  It should only send an MTB (DTB) after
      all process output from the previous message has been sent.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc357">RFC 357</a>         An Echoing Strategy For Satellite Links        June 1972</span>


   Why Does This Work?

      The RCE strategy described above produces the correct result at
      the user's terminal because it is in essence the same scheme used
      by the Terminal Handler which normally provides the echoing at the
      serving site.  Initially, the characters are echoed as they are
      typed; then a break character is keyed, echoing is suspended.  If
      the process produces any output response, it is printed before
      echoing of subsequent input.

      Echoing of the next command begins, if there is type-ahead, with
      the characters in the input buffer, and even if the input buffer
      is emptied immediate echoing of keyed input from the terminal is
      provided since the ECHO path remains enabled up to a break.

   An Example

      (In the following, we assume all break characters are also wakeup
      characters and (carelessly) treat the two interchangeably.)

      Suppose a TIP user attempts to login to a remote server with the
      properly formatted message

            LOG NAME PASSWORD [CR]

      and that the Server TELNET has requested the use of RCE.
      Presuming that the break (and wakeup) characters sets are
      appropriately defined to include space and CR (and that the break
      action specifies they should be echoed), the primary sequence of
      RCE commands which will drive the TIP to produce the correct
      printout at the user's terminal is:

         (1) MTB (to print "LOG "), and since the space is a break
            character,
         (2) MTB (to print "NAME "),
         (3) DTB (to delete "PASSWORD [CR]" (See section VI, number
            11)), and perhaps a message followed by
         (4) MTB (to reenable the echo path).

      We investigate in some detail how interaction at the
      process/Server TELNET interface causes these commands to be send
      to the TIP.

      When the EXEC is invoked, it issues a system call to set its break
      classes.  The Server TELNET interprets the system call in terms of
      the classes supported by RCE, and sends the appropriate two-byte
      "Set Break Classes" (SBC) command to the TIP.  A space is among
      the characters of the break set.

      The EXEC asks for input, so the Server TELNET send MTB ((1)
      above).  We presume the EXEC blocks until some input is available.

      The EXEC is awakened when the first space arrives; it recognizes
      the LOG command to be a call upon the LOGIN subsystem which it
      (promptly!) invokes.

      The LOGIN process issues a system call to set its break classes
      (this time both space and CR are included, and, as before, the
      Server TELNET forwards the command as an SBC).  Then it asks for
      input (so the Server TELNET sends MTB ((2) above)), and blocks
      until the second space arrives.

      When the LOGIN process has verified the existence of a user with
      name NAME, it issues a system call to suppress printing of the
      next parameter (the password).  In compliance, the Server TELNET
      sends DTB ((3) above).

      Once the password has been examined and verified, a message like

            [CR][LF] LOGIN COMPLETED [CR][LF]

      can be sent, followed by a request for input.  The Server TELNET
      thus forwards an MTB ((4) above) and the sequence is completed.

   Another example

      Suppose in the above example the user had typed

            LOG NAME[CR]

      When the LOGIN process regained control, it would have noted that
      the break was a CR instead of a space.  It then could have issued

            [LF]password =

      which the Server TELNET would follow (when LOGIN requests print
      suppression) with DTB.  When the TIP had finished its output, the
      DISCARD path would be enabled and the user's terminal would have
      printed:

            LOG NAME[CR]
            password =
                       ^

      with the cursor positioned just after the =.  The TIP will hide
      the characters of the password.

   Another Example

      Suppose a user were using a text editor, TEXT, to create a source
      file of English sentences.  The TEXT subprocess might allow only
      non-formatting control characters (e.g., "Control-C") as break
      characters.  The RCE strategy would allow the user to receive
      immediate echoing for all his input until he typed such a control
      character.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/V.%20Discussion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-V" id="appendix-V">V</a>. Discussion</span>

   The Remote Controlled Echoing Strategy is designed to provide echoing
   for a full-duplex terminal as if it were locally connected to its
   server.  The effect of the long transmission delays will only be
   evident as an increase in the processing performed at a break.  Only
   in the most interactive systems will such a delay be consistently
   noticeable.  For example if a user invokes a long FORTRAN
   compilation, the fact that its start is delayed for half a second
   will not normally be evident.

   Furthermore, users who are able to type several messages ahead may
   only notice a processing delay as a result of the first break-
   interaction; both transmission and processing of successive messages
   may occur during the printing of "echoes" and responses to previous
   messages.

   Transmission considerations:

      In the standard echoing scheme, characters are buffered at the
      same server as they are keyed.  But the user process does not see
      them until a wakeup character has been typed.  This means a TIP
      using RCE could buffer characters in the transmission buffer until
      a wakeup occurs and then send off the whole bunch.  Unfortunately
      we have chosen, for simplicity, to keep all knowledge of wakeup
      characters at the serving site.  This means that the TIP may
      buffer beyond a wakeup (if it is not also a break) and delay the
      process from doing some useful work.  However, since in this case
      no output is expected from the process, no noticeable delay is
      visible to the user, except that the next break interaction may
      take a little longer.

      If the TIP chooses to buffer input before transmission, it will
      transmit AT LEAST at every break character.  The SERVER should be
      able to instruct the TIP to transmit more often if it is
      appropriate.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc357">RFC 357</a>         An Echoing Strategy For Satellite Links        June 1972</span>


   An Example:

      Conversational output LINKING is an example where transmission
      strategy is separate from the break and wakeup strategies.
      Transmission should occur on every character so that the character
      can be promptly printed at each linked terminal, but no break or
      wakeup need occur until a special escape character is typed (this
      reawakens the EXEC, for example).

      Conversational output linking also introduces another funny:

   Unsolicited Output:

      What happens when the ECHO (or DISCARD) path is enabled, but the
      input buffer is empty (i.e. immediate echoing is occurring) and
      something arrives in the output buffer? This "something" cannot be
      a response to a previously keyed command, or the ECHO path would
      be disabled. (This proof is left to the reader!) It is most likely
      a system message like


         [CR][LF]SYSTEM WILL GO DOWN IN 5 MINUTES[CR][LF]

      or, a character arriving from another linked terminal.

      Since such output does not fit neatly into our RCE scheme, the
      following kludge is proposed.  Unsolicited output should cause the
      OUTPUT path to be enabled.  The occurrence of either an MTB (DTB)
      Or Empty Output Buffer will reenable the ECHO (DISCARD) path.

IV.  Orthogonal Issues

   Several other mechanisms may reasonably be incorporated within this
   proposed addition to TELNET.  The problems which need some further
   discussion include:

         1)  Some means should be provided for the server to clear the
             input, transmission, print and output buffers.
         2)  Some means should be provided for the user to immediately
             clear the output buffer (i.e. suppress printing of lengthy
             output).
         3)  The server may want to ask about the number of characters
             remaining to be printed.
         4)  A special tag character may be required to note where
             clearing of the input buffer occurred.
         5)  The TIP's transmission strategy should be specifiable by
             the server; perhaps a "Set Wakeup Classes" command should
             be implemented.



<span class="grey">Davidson                                                       [Page 12]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc357">RFC 357</a>         An Echoing Strategy For Satellite Links        June 1972</span>


         6)  The server should be able to cause the TIP to break on the
             n-th input character regardless of whatever a break
             character has been encountered.
         7)  Should the TIP or the server be responsible for properly
             echoing a formatting control character such as a TAB?
         8)  The proper equivalence classes of ASCII characters have to
             be finalized.
         9)  How should a CR be echoed?
         10) Should one-for-one echo replacement (e.g. "$" for ESC) or
             multi-character substitution (e.g. "^A" for Control-A) be
             provided by the TIP?
         11) The proposed DTB command directs the TIP to also discard
             the delimiting break character.  Should the break character
             discard rather be dependent on setting the Break Action to
             "don't echo" before sending the DTB?

   Several of these issues will be addressed in <a href="./rfc358">RFC 358</a>.

VII.  Conclusion

   This document has presented a proposed optional addition to the User
   TELNET.  The next step is to perform some simulations and to
   incorporate RCE into an experimental version of TELNET.

   No recommendation is made that the current TELNET be discarded.  For
   example RCE should not be used for those half-duplex devices which
   perform their own "echoing".  If RCE is adopted as an alternate means
   of echoing, changes to those TELNETs choosing not to implement it
   should be minimal.  Switching from RCE to the current echo mechanism
   is an immediate result of either user or server sending a "You Echo"
   (or "I'll Echo").

   Much of the machinery required to implement RCE already exists at the
   interface between the server process and its Terminal Handler or
   Server TELNET.  This means that no server process need be changed,
   but that the process' means of specifying break classes, break
   actions and echoing conventions must be interpreted by the Terminal
   Handler and reissued to the TIP in terms of the corresponding RCE
   commands.
