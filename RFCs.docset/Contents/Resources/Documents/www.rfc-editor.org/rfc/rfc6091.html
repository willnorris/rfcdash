  <span class="h1">Using OpenPGP Keys for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authentication</span>

Abstract

   This memo defines Transport Layer Security (TLS) extensions and
   associated semantics that allow clients and servers to negotiate the
   use of OpenPGP certificates for a TLS session, and specifies how to
   transport OpenPGP certificates via TLS.  It also defines the registry
   for non-X.509 certificate types.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IETF has two sets of standards for public key certificates: one
   set for the use of X.509 certificates [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>], and one for OpenPGP
   certificates [<a href="./rfc4880" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>RFC4880</a>].  At the time of this writing, TLS [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>]
   standards are defined to use X.509 certificates.  This document
   specifies a way to negotiate the use of OpenPGP certificates for a
   TLS session, and specifies how to transport OpenPGP certificates via
   TLS.  The proposed extensions are backward-compatible with the
   current TLS specification, so that existing client and server
   implementations that make use of X.509 certificates are not affected.

   These extensions are not backward-compatible with [<a href="./rfc5081" title='"Using OpenPGP Keys for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authentication"'>RFC5081</a>], and the
   major differences are summarized in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Although the OpenPGP
   CertificateType value is being reused by this memo with the same
   number as that specified in [<a href="./rfc5081" title='"Using OpenPGP Keys for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authentication"'>RFC5081</a>] but with different semantics,
   we believe that this causes no interoperability issues because the
   latter was not widely deployed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The term "OpenPGP key" is used in this document as in the OpenPGP
   specification [<a href="./rfc4880" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>RFC4880</a>].  We use the term "OpenPGP certificate" to
   refer to OpenPGP keys that are enabled for authentication.

   This document uses the same notation and terminology used in the TLS
   Protocol specification [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Changes%20to%20the%20Handshake%20Message%20Contents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Changes to the Handshake Message Contents</span>

   This section describes the changes to the TLS handshake message
   contents when OpenPGP certificates are to be used for authentication.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Client%20Hello"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Client Hello</span>

   In order to indicate the support of multiple certificate types,
   clients MUST include an extension of type "cert_type" to the extended
   client hello message.  The "cert_type" TLS extension is assigned the
   value of 9 from the TLS ExtensionType registry.  This value is used
   as the extension number for the extensions in both the client hello
   message and the server hello message.  The hello extension mechanism
   is described in [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>].

   This extension carries a list of supported certificate types the
   client can use, sorted by client preference.  This extension MUST be
   omitted if the client only supports X.509 certificates.  The
   "extension_data" field of this extension contains a
   CertificateTypeExtension structure.  Note that the
   CertificateTypeExtension structure is being used both by the client
   and the server, even though the structure is only specified once in
   this document.  Reusing a single specification for both client and
   server is common in other specifications, such as the TLS protocol
   itself [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>].

      enum { client, server } ClientOrServerExtension;

      enum { X.509(0), OpenPGP(1), (255) } CertificateType;

      struct {
         select(ClientOrServerExtension) {
            case client:
               CertificateType certificate_types&lt;1..2^8-1&gt;;
            case server:
               CertificateType certificate_type;
         }
      } CertificateTypeExtension;

   No new cipher suites are required to use OpenPGP certificates.  All
   existing cipher suites that support a key exchange method compatible
   with the key in the certificate can be used in combination with
   OpenPGP certificates.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Server%20Hello"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Server Hello</span>

   If the server receives a client hello that contains the "cert_type"
   extension and chooses a cipher suite that requires a certificate,
   then two outcomes are possible.  The server MUST either select a
   certificate type from the certificate_types field in the extended
   client hello or terminate the session with a fatal alert of type
   "unsupported_certificate".

   The certificate type selected by the server is encoded in a
   CertificateTypeExtension structure, which is included in the extended
   server hello message using an extension of type "cert_type".  Servers
   that only support X.509 certificates MAY omit including the
   "cert_type" extension in the extended server hello.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Server%20Certificate"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Server Certificate</span>

   The contents of the certificate message sent from server to client
   and vice versa are determined by the negotiated certificate type and
   the selected cipher suite's key exchange algorithm.

   If the OpenPGP certificate type is negotiated, then it is required to
   present an OpenPGP certificate in the certificate message.  The
   certificate must contain a public key that matches the selected key
   exchange algorithm, as shown below.

      Key Exchange Algorithm    OpenPGP Certificate Type

      RSA                       RSA public key that can be used for
                                encryption.

      DHE_DSS                   DSA public key that can be used for
                                authentication.

      DHE_RSA                   RSA public key that can be used for
                                authentication.

   An OpenPGP certificate appearing in the certificate message is sent
   using the binary OpenPGP format.  The certificate MUST contain all
   the elements required by <a href="./rfc4880#section-11.1">Section 11.1 of [RFC4880]</a>.

   OpenPGP certificates to be transferred are placed in the Certificate
   structure and tagged with the OpenPGPCertDescriptorType
   "subkey_cert".  Since those certificates might contain several
   subkeys, the subkey ID to be used for this session is explicitly






<span class="grey">Mavrogiannopoulos &amp; Gillmor   Informational                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

   specified in the OpenPGPKeyID field.  The key ID must be specified
   even if the certificate has only a primary key.  The peer, upon
   receiving this type, has to either use the specified subkey or
   terminate the session with a fatal alert of
   "unsupported_certificate".

   The option is also available to send an OpenPGP fingerprint, instead
   of sending the entire certificate, by using the
   "subkey_cert_fingerprint" tag.  This tag uses the
   OpenPGPSubKeyFingerprint structure and requires the primary key
   fingerprint to be specified, as well as the subkey ID to be used for
   this session.  The peer shall respond with a
   "certificate_unobtainable" fatal alert if the certificate with the
   given fingerprint cannot be found.  The "certificate_unobtainable"
   fatal alert is defined in <a href="./rfc6066#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC6066]</a>.

   Implementations of this protocol MUST ensure that the sizes of key
   IDs and fingerprints in the OpenPGPSubKeyCert and
   OpenPGPSubKeyFingerprint structures comply with [<a href="./rfc4880" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>RFC4880</a>].  Moreover,
   it is RECOMMENDED that the keys to be used with this protocol have
   the authentication flag (0x20) set.

   The process of fingerprint generation is described in <a href="./rfc4880#section-12.2">Section 12.2 of
   [RFC4880]</a>.

   The enumerated types "cert_fingerprint" and "cert" of
   OpenPGPCertDescriptorType that were defined in [<a href="./rfc5081" title='"Using OpenPGP Keys for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authentication"'>RFC5081</a>] are not used
   and are marked as obsolete by this document.  The "empty_cert" type
   has replaced "cert" and is a backward-compatible way to specify an
   empty certificate; "cert_fingerprint" MUST NOT be used with this
   updated specification, and hence that old alternative has been
   removed from the Certificate struct description.

   The semantics of this message remain the same as in the TLS
   specification.  However, if this message is sent, and the negotiated
   certificate type is OpenPGP, the "certificate_authorities" list MUST
   be empty.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.5.%20%20Client%20Certificate"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" id="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Client Certificate</span>

   This message is only sent in response to the certificate request
   message.  The client certificate message is sent using the same
   formatting as the server certificate message, and it is also required
   to present a certificate that matches the negotiated certificate
   type.  If OpenPGP certificates have been selected and no certificate
   is available from the client, then a certificate structure of type
   "empty_cert" that contains an OpenPGPEmptyCert value MUST be sent.
   The server SHOULD respond with a "handshake_failure" fatal alert if
   client authentication is required.

   All the other handshake messages are identical to the TLS
   specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   All security considerations discussed in [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>], [<a href="./rfc6066" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions: Extension Definitions"'>RFC6066</a>], and
   [<a href="./rfc4880" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>RFC4880</a>] apply to this document.  Considerations about the use of
   the web of trust or identity and certificate verification procedures
   are outside the scope of this document.  These are considered issues
   to be handled by the application layer protocols.

   The protocol for certificate type negotiation is identical in
   operation to cipher suite negotiation as described in the TLS
   specification [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>], with the addition of default values when the
   extension is omitted.  Since those omissions have a unique meaning
   and the same protection is applied to the values as with cipher
   suites, it is believed that the security properties of this
   negotiation are the same as with cipher suite negotiation.

   When using OpenPGP fingerprints instead of the full certificates, the
   discussion in <a href="./rfc6066#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC6066]</a> for "Client Certificate URLs"
   applies, especially when external servers are used to retrieve keys.
   However, a major difference is that although the
   "client_certificate_url" extension allows identifying certificates
   without including the certificate hashes, this is not possible in the
   protocol proposed here.  In this protocol, the certificates, when not
   sent, are always identified by their fingerprint, which serves as a
   cryptographic hash of the certificate (see <a href="./rfc4880#section-12.2">Section 12.2 of
   [RFC4880]</a>).

   The information that is available to participating parties and
   eavesdroppers (when confidentiality is not available through a
   previous handshake) is the number and the types of certificates they
   hold, plus the contents of the certificates.

   This document uses a registry and the "cert_type" extension
   originally defined in [<a href="./rfc5081" title='"Using OpenPGP Keys for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authentication"'>RFC5081</a>].  Existing IANA references have been
   updated to point to this document.

   In addition, the "TLS Certificate Types" registry established by
   [<a href="./rfc5081" title='"Using OpenPGP Keys for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authentication"'>RFC5081</a>] has been updated in the following ways:

   This document incorporates a major change in the "Server Certificate"
   and "Client Certificate" TLS messages that will make implementations
   following this protocol incompatible with those following [<a href="./rfc5081" title='"Using OpenPGP Keys for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authentication"'>RFC5081</a>].
   This change requires the subkey IDs used for TLS authentication to be
   marked explicitly in the handshake procedure.  This was decided in
   order to place no limitation on the OpenPGP certificates' contents
   that can be used with this protocol.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5081">RFC5081</a>] required that an OpenPGP key or subkey be marked with the
   authentication flag; thus, authentication would have failed if this
   flag was not set or if this flag was set in more than one subkey.
   The protocol in this memo has no such limitation.
