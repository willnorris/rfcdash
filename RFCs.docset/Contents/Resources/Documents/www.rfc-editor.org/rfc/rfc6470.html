      <span class="h1">Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Base Notifications</span>

Abstract

   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
   manipulate configuration datastores.  However, client applications
   often need to be aware of common events, such as a change in NETCONF
   server capabilities, that may impact management applications.
   Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the base
   system events within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a
   YANG module that allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for
   some common system events.

   The NETCONF protocol [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>] provides mechanisms to manipulate
   configuration datastores.  However, client applications often need to
   be aware of common events, such as a change in NETCONF server
   capabilities, that may impact management applications.  Standard
   mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the base system
   events within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a YANG
   module [<a href="./rfc6020" title='"YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6020</a>] that allows a NETCONF client to receive
   notifications for some common system events.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Overview</span>

   The YANG module defined within this document specifies a small number
   of event notification messages for use within the 'NETCONF' stream,
   and accessible to clients via the subscription mechanism described in
   [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>].  This module imports data types from the 'ietf-netconf'
   module defined in [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>] and 'ietf-inet-types' module defined in
   [<a href="./rfc6021" title='"Common YANG Data Types"'>RFC6021</a>].

   These notifications pertain to configuration and monitoring portions
   of the managed system, not the entire system.  A server MUST report
   events that are directly related to the NETCONF protocol.  A server
   MAY report events for non-NETCONF management sessions, using the
   'session-id' value of zero.

   This module defines the following notifications for the 'NETCONF'
   stream to notify a client application that the NETCONF server state
   has changed:

   netconf-config-change:
      Generated when the NETCONF server detects that the &lt;running&gt; or
      &lt;startup&gt; configuration datastore has been changed by a management
      session.  The notification summarizes the edits that have been
      detected.

   netconf-capability-change:
      Generated when the NETCONF server detects that the server
      capabilities have changed.  Indicates which capabilities have been
      added, deleted, and/or modified.  The manner in which a server
      capability is changed is outside the scope of this document.

   netconf-session-start:
      Generated when a NETCONF server detects that a NETCONF session has
      started.  A server MAY generate this event for non-NETCONF
      management sessions.  Indicates the identity of the user that
      started the session.

   netconf-session-end:
      Generated when a NETCONF server detects that a NETCONF session has
      terminated.  A server MAY optionally generate this event for
      non-NETCONF management sessions.  Indicates the identity of the
      user that owned the session, and why the session was terminated.

   netconf-confirmed-commit:
      Generated when a NETCONF server detects that a confirmed-commit
      event has occurred.  Indicates the event and the current state of
      the confirmed-commit procedure in progress.

   This document registers one module name in the 'YANG Module Names'
   registry, defined in [<a href="./rfc6020" title='"YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6020</a>].

      name: ietf-netconf-notifications
      prefix: ncn
      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-notifications
      RFC: 6470

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH, defined in [<a href="./rfc6242" title='"Using the NETCONF Protocol over Secure Shell (SSH)"'>RFC6242</a>].

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /netconf-config-change:
      Event type itself indicates that the system configuration has
      changed.  This event could alert an attacker that specific
      configuration data nodes have been altered.
   /netconf-config-change/changed-by:
      Indicates whether the server or a specific user management session
      made the configuration change.  Identifies the user name,
      session-id, and source host address associated with the
      configuration change, if any.
   /netconf-config-change/datastore:
      Indicates which datastore has been changed.  This data can be used
      to determine if the non-volatile startup configuration data has
      been changed.
   /netconf-config-change/edit:
      Identifies the specific edit operations and specific datastore
      subtree(s) that have changed.  This data could be used to
      determine if specific server vulnerabilities may now be present.

   /netconf-capability-change:
      Event type itself indicates that the system capabilities have
      changed, and may now be vulnerable to unspecified attacks.  An
      attacker will likely need to understand the content represented by
      specific capability URI strings.  For example, knowing that a
      packet capture monitoring capability has been added to the system
      might help an attacker identify the device for possible
      unauthorized eavesdropping.
   /netconf-capability-change/changed-by:
      Indicates whether the server or a specific user management session
      made the capability change.  Identifies the user name, session-id,
      and source host address associated with the capability change, if
      any.
   /netconf-capability-change/added-capability:
      Indicates the specific capability URIs that have been added.  This
      data could be used to determine if specific server vulnerabilities
      may now be present.
   /netconf-capability-change/deleted-capability:
      Indicates the specific capability URIs that have been deleted.
      This data could be used to determine if specific server
      vulnerabilities may now be present.
   /netconf-capability-change/modified-capability:
      Indicates the specific capability URIs that have been modified.
      This data could be used to determine if specific server
      vulnerabilities may now be present.

   /netconf-session-start:
      Event type itself indicates that a NETCONF or other management
      session may start altering the device configuration and/or state.
      It may be possible for an attacker to alter the configuration by
      somehow taking advantage of another session concurrently editing
      an unlocked datastore.
   /netconf-session-start/username:
      Indicates the user name associated with the session.
   /netconf-session-start/source-host:
      Indicates the source host address associated with the session.

   /netconf-session-end:
      Event type itself indicates that a NETCONF or other management
      session may be finished altering the device configuration.  This
      event could alert an attacker that a datastore may have been
      altered.
   /netconf-session-end/username:
      Indicates the user name associated with the session.
   /netconf-session-end/source-host:
      Indicates the source host address associated with the session.

   /netconf-confirmed-commit:
      Event type itself indicates that the &lt;running&gt; datastore may have
      changed.  This event could alert an attacker that the device
      behavior has changed.
   /netconf-confirmed-commit/username:
      Indicates the user name associated with the session.
   /netconf-confirmed-commit/source-host:
      Indicates the source host address associated with the session.
   /netconf-confirmed-commit/confirm-event:
      Indicates the specific confirmed-commit state change that
      occurred.  A value of 'complete' probably indicates that the
      &lt;running&gt; datastore has changed.
   /netconf-confirmed-commit/timeout:
      Indicates the number of seconds in the future when the &lt;running&gt;
      datastore may change, due to the server reverting to an older
      configuration.
