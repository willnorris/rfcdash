                          NETWORK HOST STATUS

   This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from February 28
   to March 10.  The ETAC Terminal IMP (Network address 148) was
   installed during this period.

   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These
   Hosts fall into two categories:

      1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network
         as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular
         basis for at least two weeks.  Included here are:

         Network
         Address          Site            Computer
         -------          ----            --------
         134              MIT-AI          PDP-10
          13              Case            PDP-10
          15              Ames/(Paoli)    ILLIAC/(B6500)

      2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included
         here are the Terminal IMP's which are presently in the Network
         (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN).  [The BBN Terminal IMP (Network
         Address 158) is a prototype and as such is frequently not
         connected to the Network, but being used to refine and debug
         the Terminal IMP programs.]  This category also includes the
         Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is
         used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.
         Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:

         Network
         Address          Site            Computer
         -------          ----            --------
          7               Rand            IBM-360/65
         73               Harvard         PDP-1
         12               Illinois        PDP-11
         19               NBS             PDP-11

   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this
   period.

   where

      D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to
      network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal
      IMP.)

      H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
      immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

      O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible
      to users.)

      R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

      T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open
      a connection within 60 seconds.)

   The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a
   Network Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not
   equipped to test NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection to
   the NETRJS logger indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
