   [<a id="ref-RFC3931">RFC3931</a>] defines a base protocol for Layer 2 Tunneling over IP
   networks.  This document defines the specifics necessary for
   tunneling Frame Relay over L2TPv3.  Such emulated circuits are
   referred to as Frame Relay Pseudowires (FRPWs).

   Protocol specifics defined in this document for L2TPv3 FRPWs
   operating in a "virtual circuit-to-virtual circuit" mode include
   those necessary for frame encapsulation, PVC creation and deletion,
   and status change notification.  Frame Relay traffic may also be
   transported in a "port-to-port" or "interface-to-interface" fashion
   using High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) Pseudowires as defined in
   [<a href="./rfc4349" title='"High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) Frames over Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC4349</a>].  Support for Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) and
   Switched/Soft Permanent Virtual Circuits (SPVCs) are outside the
   scope of this document.

   The reader is expected to be very familiar with the terminology and
   protocol constructs defined in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>].

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Control%20Connection%20Establishment"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Control Connection Establishment</span>

   In order to tunnel a Frame Relay circuit over IP using L2TPv3, an
   L2TPv3 Control Connection MUST first be established as described in
   [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>].  The L2TPv3 SCCRQ Control Message and corresponding SCCRP
   Control Message MUST include the Frame Relay Data Link Connection
   Identifier (DLCI) PW Type of 0x0001 (see IANA Considerations), in the
   Pseudowire Capabilities List, as defined in <a href="./rfc3931#section-5.4.3">SectionÂ 5.4.3 of
   [RFC3931]</a>.  This identifies the control connection as able to
   establish L2TP sessions to support Frame Relay Pseudowires (FRPWs).

   An LCCE MUST be able to identify itself uniquely in the SCCRQ and
   SCCRP messages via a globally unique value.  By default, this is
   advertised via the structured Router ID Attribute Value Pairs (AVP)
   [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>], though the unstructured Hostname AVP [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] MAY be used
   to identify LCCEs as well.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20PVC%20Status%20Notification%20and%20Session%20Establishment"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  PVC Status Notification and Session Establishment</span>

   This section specifies how the status of a PVC is reported between
   two LCCEs.  This includes what should happen when a PVC is created,
   deleted or when it changes state between ACTIVE and INACTIVE.  When
   emulating a Frame Relay service, if the procedures for PVC status
   management defined in [<a href="#ref-Q933" title='"Signalling specifications for frame mode switched and permanent virtual connection control and status monitoring"'>Q933</a>] Annex A are being used between an LCCE
   and the attached Remote System, an LCCE MUST participate in them (see
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4591">RFC 4591</a>                Frame Relay over L2TPv3                July 2006</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20L2TPv3%20Session%20Establishment"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  L2TPv3 Session Establishment</span>

   PVC creation (provisioning) results in establishment of an L2TP
   session via the standard three-way handshake described in <a href="./rfc3931#section-3.4.1">Section</a>
   <a href="./rfc3931#section-3.4.1">3.4.1 of [RFC3931]</a>.  An LCCE MAY initiate the session immediately
   upon PVC creation or wait until the PVC state transitions to ACTIVE
   before attempting to establish a session for the PVC.  Waiting until
   the PVC transitions to ACTIVE may be preferred, as it delays
   allocation of L2TP resources until it is absolutely necessary.

   The Pseudowire Type AVP defined in <a href="./rfc3931#section-5.4.4">SectionÂ 5.4.4 of [RFC3931]</a>,
   Attribute Type 68, MUST be present in the Incoming-Call-Request
   (ICRQ) messages and MUST include the Frame Relay DLCI PW Type of
   0x0001 for FRPWs.

   The Circuit Status AVP (see <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>) MUST be present in the ICRQ
   and Incoming-Call-Reply (ICRP) messages and MAY be present in the Set
   Link Info (SLI) message for FRPWs.

   The Frame Relay Header Length AVP (see <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>) MAY be present in
   the ICRQ and ICRP messages.

   The following is an example of the L2TP messages exchanged for an
   FRPW that is initiated after a new PVC is provisioned and becomes
   ACTIVE.

         LCCE (LAC) A                     LCCE (LAC) B
      ------------------               ------------------
      FR PVC Provisioned
                                       FR PVC Provisioned
      FR PVC ACTIVE

                   ICRQ (status = 0x03) ----&gt;

                                       FR PVC ACTIVE

                   &lt;---- ICRP (status = 0x03)

      L2TP session established,
      OK to send data into tunnel

                       ICCN -----&gt;
                                    L2TP session established,
                                    OK to send data into tunnel

   In the example above, an ICRQ is sent after the PVC is created and
   becomes ACTIVE.  The Circuit Status AVP indicates that this PVC is
   ACTIVE and New (0x03).  The Remote End ID AVP [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] MUST be

<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4591">RFC 4591</a>                Frame Relay over L2TPv3                July 2006</span>


   present in the ICRQ in order to identify the PVC (together with the
   identity of the LCCE itself, as defined in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) to associate
   the L2TP session with.  The Remote End ID AVP, defined in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>],
   is of opaque form and variable length, though one MUST at a minimum
   support use of an unstructured four-octet value that is known to both
   LCCEs (either by direct configuration, or some other means).  The
   exact method of how this value is configured, retrieved, discovered,
   or otherwise determined at each LCCE is outside the scope of this
   document.

   As with the ICRQ, the ICRP is sent only after the FR PVC transitions
   to ACTIVE as well.  If LCCE B had not been provisioned for the PVC
   identified in the ICRQ, a Call-Disconnect-Notify (CDN) would have
   been immediately returned indicating that the circuit was not
   provisioned or available at this LCCE.  LCCE A SHOULD then exhibit a
   periodic retry mechanism.  If so, the period and maximum number of
   retries MUST be configurable.

   An Implementation MAY send an ICRQ or ICRP before a PVC is ACTIVE, as
   long as the Circuit Status AVP reflects that the PVC is INACTIVE and
   an SLI is sent when the PVC becomes ACTIVE (see <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>).

   The Incoming-Call-Connected (ICCN) is the final stage in the session
   establishment, confirming the receipt of the ICRP with acceptable
   parameters to allow bidirectional traffic.

   In the event that a PVC is deleted (unprovisioned) at either LCCE,
   the associated L2TP session MUST be torn down via the CDN message
   defined in <a href="./rfc3931#section-3.4.3">SectionÂ 3.4.3 of [RFC3931]</a>.

   General Result Codes regarding L2TP session establishment are defined
   in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>].  Additional Frame Relay result codes are defined as
   follows:

      17: FR PVC was deleted permanently (no longer provisioned) 18: FR
      PVC has been INACTIVE for an extended period of time 19:
      Mismatched FR Header Length

   FRPW over L2TP makes use of the SLI control message defined in
   [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] to signal Frame Relay link status notifications between
   LCCEs.  This includes ACTIVE or INACTIVE notifications of the VC, and
   any other parameters that may need to be shared between the tunnel
   endpoints or LCCEs in order to provide proper PW emulation.  The SLI
   message is a single message that is sent over the L2TP control



<span class="grey">Townsley, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4591">RFC 4591</a>                Frame Relay over L2TPv3                July 2006</span>


   channel signalling the state change.  Since the message is delivered
   reliably, there is no additional response or action required of the
   PW subsystem to ensure that the state change notification was
   received by the tunnel peer.

   The SLI message MUST be sent any time there is a circuit status
   change that may be reported by any values identified in the Circuit
   Status AVP.  The only exceptions to this are the initial ICRQ, ICRP,
   and CDN messages, which establish and tear down the L2TP session
   itself when the PVC is created or deleted.  The SLI message may be
   sent from either LCCE at any time after the first ICRQ is sent (and
   perhaps before an ICRP is received, requiring that the peer to
   perform a reverse Session ID lookup).

   An LCCE participating in the procedures for PVC status management
   defined in [<a href="#ref-Q933" title='"Signalling specifications for frame mode switched and permanent virtual connection control and status monitoring"'>Q933</a>], Annex A, MUST transmit an SLI message including
   the Circuit Status AVP (see <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>) when it detects a change in
   the status for a particular local FR PVC (i.e., when it detects a
   service-affecting condition or the clearing of such a condition).  An
   LCCE receiving an SLI message indicating a change in the status of a
   particular FRPW SHOULD generate corresponding updates for the FR PVC
   towards the Remote System, as defined in [<a href="#ref-Q933" title='"Signalling specifications for frame mode switched and permanent virtual connection control and status monitoring"'>Q933</a>], Annex A.

   All sessions established by a given control connection utilize the
   L2TP Hello facility, defined in <a href="./rfc3931#section-4.4">SectionÂ 4.4 of [RFC3931]</a>, for session
   keepalive.  This gives all sessions basic dead peer and path
   detection between LCCEs.

   Frame Relay circuit status is reported via the Circuit Status AVP
   defined in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>], Attribute Type 71.  For reference, this AVP is
   shown below:

    0                   1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Reserved        |N|A|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Value is a 16-bit mask with the two least significant bits
   defined and the remaining bits reserved for future use.  Reserved
   bits MUST be set to 0 by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

   The N (New) bit indicates whether the Circuit Status indication is
   for a new FR PVC (1) or an existing FR PVC (0).

   The A (Active) bit indicates whether the FR PVC is ACTIVE (1) or
   INACTIVE (0).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.5.%20%20Frame%20Relay%20Header%20Length%20AVP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" id="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Frame Relay Header Length AVP</span>

   The "Frame Relay Header Length AVP", Attribute type 85, indicates the
   number of bytes in the Frame Relay header.  The two peer LCCEs MUST
   agree on the length of the Frame Relay header.

   This AVP is exchanged during session negotiation (in ICRQ, ICRP).  If
   the other LCCE supports a different Frame Relay header length, the
   associated L2TP session MUST be torn down via CDN message with result
   code 19 (see <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).

   If the Frame Relay Header Length AVP is not signalled, it MUST be
   assumed that the peer uses a 2-byte Frame Relay header.

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

   Frame Relay Header Length (ICRQ, ICRP)

       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Frame Relay Header Length   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Frame Relay Header Length Type is a 2-octet unsigned integer with
   the following values defined in this document:

      2: Two-octet Frame Relay Header 4: Four-octet Frame Relay Header

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this
   AVP MAY be set to 0 but MAY vary (see <a href="./rfc3931#section-5.2">SectionÂ 5.2 of [RFC3931]</a>).  The
   length (before hiding) of this AVP is 8.

   The FR PDU is transported in its entirety, excluding the opening and
   closing High Level Data Link Control (HDLC) flags and the frame check
   sequence (FCS).  Bit stuffing is undone.  The L2TPv3 Session Header
   is that as defined in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>].  If sequencing or other features
   require presence of an L2-Specific Sublayer, the Default format
   defined in <a href="./rfc3931#section-4.6">SectionÂ 4.6 of [RFC3931]</a> MUST be used.

   differs from that used in IETF specifications.  For reference, the FR
   header (referred to as Address Field in [<a href="#ref-Q922" title='"ISDN Data Link Layer Specification for Frame Mode Bearer Services"'>Q922</a>]) in IETF notation is

    0                   1

   Four-octet FR  Header

   C/R (bit 6) FR frame C/R (command/response) bit [<a href="#ref-Q922" title='"ISDN Data Link Layer Specification for Frame Mode Bearer Services"'>Q922</a>].

   F - FECN (bit 12):  FR FECN (Forward Explicit Congestion
   Notification) bit [<a href="#ref-Q922" title='"ISDN Data Link Layer Specification for Frame Mode Bearer Services"'>Q922</a>].

   B - BECN (bit 13):

   FR BECN (Backward Explicit Congestion Notification) bit [<a href="#ref-Q922" title='"ISDN Data Link Layer Specification for Frame Mode Bearer Services"'>Q922</a>].

   D - DE (bit 14) FR DE bit indicates the discard eligibility [<a href="#ref-Q922" title='"ISDN Data Link Layer Specification for Frame Mode Bearer Services"'>Q922</a>].

   Usage of the C/R, FECN, BECN, and DE bits is as specified in [<a href="#ref-Q922" title='"ISDN Data Link Layer Specification for Frame Mode Bearer Services"'>Q922</a>].

   The C/R bit is conveyed transparently.  Its value MUST NOT be changed
   by the LCCE.

   The FECN bit MAY be set by the LCCE to notify the receiving end-user
   that the frames it receives have encountered congestion.  The end-
   user may use this indication for destination-controlled transmit rate
   adjustment.  The bit must never be cleared by the LCCE.  If the LCCE
   does not support FECN, it shall pass the bit unchanged.

   The BECN bit MAY be set by the LCCE to notify the receiving end-user
   that the frames it transmits may encounter congestion.  The end-user
   may use this indication to adjust its transmit rate.  The bit must
   never be cleared by the LCCE.  If the LCCE does not support BECN, it
   shall pass the bit unchanged.

   The DE bit MAY be set by a policing function on the LCCE to indicate
   that this frame SHOULD be discarded in preference to other frames in
   a congestion situation.  The bit must never be cleared by the LCCE.
   If the LCCE does not support DE, it shall pass the bit unchanged.

   The encapsulation of Frame Relay frames with the two-octet FR Header
   is REQUIRED.  The encapsulation of Frame Relay frames with the four-
   octet FR Header is OPTIONAL.  The encapsulation of Frame Relay frames
   with the three-octet FR Header is outside the scope of this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Data%20Packet%20Sequencing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Data Packet Sequencing</span>

   Data Packet Sequencing MAY be enabled for FRPWs.  The sequencing
   mechanisms described in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] MUST be used for signalling
   sequencing support.  FRPW over L2TP MUST request the presence of the
   L2TPv3 Default L2-Specific Sublayer when sequencing is enabled and
   MAY request its presence at all times.

   If the FRPW is known to be carrying data that does not require packet
   order be strictly maintained (such as IP), then packet sequencing for
   the FRPW SHOULD NOT be enabled.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20MTU%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  MTU Considerations</span>

   With L2TPv3 as the tunneling protocol, the packet resulted from the
   encapsulation is N bytes longer than Frame Relay frame without the
   opening and closing HDLC flags or FCS.  The value of N depends on the
   following fields:

      L2TP Session Header:
      Flags, Ver, Res       4 octets (L2TPv3 over UDP only)
      Session ID            4 octets
      Cookie Size           0, 4, or 8 octets
      L2-Specific Sublayer  0 or 4 octets (i.e., with sequencing)

   Thus, the range for N in octets is:

      N = 4 - 16   L2TPv3 data messages are over IP
      N = 16 - 28  L2TPv3 data messages are over UDP
      (N does not include the IP header)

   The MTU and fragmentation implications resulting from this are
   discussed in <a href="./rfc3931#section-4.1.4">SectionÂ 4.1.4 of [RFC3931]</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Applicability%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Applicability Statement</span>

   The Frame Relay PW emulation described in this document allows a
   service provider to offer a Frame Relay PVC-based service across an
   IP packet-switched network (PSN).  A Frame Relay port-based service
   can be offered using [<a href="./rfc4349" title='"High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) Frames over Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC4349</a>].

   The FRPW emulation has the following characteristics in relationship
   to the native service:

   o There is a one-to-one mapping between a Frame Relay PVC and an
     FRPW, supporting bi-directional transport of variable length
     frames.  The Frame Relay frame is transported in its entirety,
     including the DLCI and the C/R, FECN, BECN, and DE bits, but
     excluding the opening and closing flags and the FCS.  The egress
     LCCE re-writes the DLCI and regenerates the FCS.

   o Two- and four-octet address fields are supported.  The length is
     negotiated between LCCEs during session establishment (see <a href="#section-3.5">Section</a>
     <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>).

   o The availability or unavailability of the PVC is signalled between
     LCCEs using the Circuit Status AVP (see <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>).  Loss of
     connectivity between LCCEs can be detected by the L2TPv3 keepalive
     mechanism (see <a href="./rfc3931#section-4.4">SectionÂ 4.4 in [RFC3931]</a>).  These indications can be
     used to determine the PVC status to be signalled through [<a href="#ref-Q933" title='"Signalling specifications for frame mode switched and permanent virtual connection control and status monitoring"'>Q933</a>]
     procedures at the Frame Relay interface.

   o The maximum frame size that can be supported is limited by the PSN
     MTU, unless fragmentation and reassembly is used (see <a href="./rfc3931#section-4.1.4">SectionÂ 4.1.4
     of [RFC3931]</a>).

   o Sequencing may be enabled on the FRPW to ensure that frames are
     delivered in order (see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>).

   o Quality of Service characteristics, such as throughput (CIR),
     committed burst size (bc), excess burst size (be), and priority,
     can be provided by leveraging Quality of Service features of the
     LCCEs and the underlying PSN.

   Frame Relay over L2TPv3 is subject to the security considerations
   defined in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>].  There are no additional considerations
   specific to carrying Frame Relay that are not present for carrying
   other data link types.

   The first Frame Relay over L2TP document, "Frame Relay Service Type
   for L2TP", was published in February of 2001, by Nishit Vasavada, Jim
   Boyle, Chris Garner, Serge Maskalik, and Vijay Gill.  This document
   is substantially different, but the basic concept of carrying Frame
   Relay over L2TP is the same.
