Abstract

   This document summarizes the history of HTML development, and defines
   the "text/html" MIME type by pointing to the relevant W3C
   recommendations; it is intended to obsolete the previous IETF
   documents defining HTML, including <a href="./rfc1866">RFC 1866</a>, <a href="./rfc1867">RFC 1867</a>, <a href="./rfc1980">RFC 1980</a>, <a href="./rfc1942">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc1942">1942</a> and <a href="./rfc2070">RFC 2070</a>, and to remove HTML from IETF Standards Track.

   This document was prepared at the request of the W3C HTML working
   group. Please send comments to www-html@w3.org, a public mailing list
   with archive at &lt;<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/</a>&gt;.

   HTML has been in use in the World Wide Web information infrastructure
   since 1990, and specified in various informal documents.  The
   text/html media type was first officially defined by the IETF HTML
   working group in 1995 in [<a href="#ref-HTML20" title='"Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0"'>HTML20</a>]. Extensions to HTML were proposed
   in [<a href="#ref-HTML30" title='"HyperText Markup Language Specification Version 3.0"'>HTML30</a>], [<a href="#ref-UPLOAD" title='"Form-based File Upload in HTML"'>UPLOAD</a>], [<a href="#ref-TABLES" title='"HTML Tables"'>TABLES</a>], [<a href="#ref-CLIMAPS" title='"A Proposed Extension to HTML: Client-Side Image Maps"'>CLIMAPS</a>], and [<a href="#ref-I18N" title='"Internationalization of the Hypertext Markup Language"'>I18N</a>].

   The IETF HTML working group closed Sep 1996, and work on defining
   HTML moved to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The proposed
   extensions were incorporated to some extent in [<a href="#ref-HTML32" title='"HTML 3.2 Reference Specification"'>HTML32</a>], and to a
   larger extent in [<a href="#ref-HTML40" title='"HTML 4.0 Specification"'>HTML40</a>]. The definition of multipart/form-data from
   [<a href="#ref-UPLOAD" title='"Form-based File Upload in HTML"'>UPLOAD</a>] was described in [<a href="#ref-FORMDATA" title='"Returning Values from Forms: multipart/form-data"'>FORMDATA</a>]. In addition, a reformulation of
   HTML 4.0 in XML 1.0[XHTML1] was developed.

   [<a id="ref-HTML32">HTML32</a>] notes "This specification defines HTML version 3.2. HTML 3.2
   aims to capture recommended practice as of early '96 and as such to
   be used as a replacement for HTML 2.0 (<a href="./rfc1866">RFC 1866</a>)."  Subsequent
   specifications for HTML describe the differences in each version.

   In addition to the development of standards, a wide variety of
   additional extensions, restrictions, and modifications to HTML were
   popularized by NCSA's Mosaic system and subsequently by the
   competitive implementations of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
   Internet Explorer; these extensions are documented in numerous books
   and online guides.

   MIME media type name:      text
   MIME subtype name:         html
   Required parameters:       none
   Optional parameters:

      charset
         The optional parameter "charset" refers to the character
         encoding used to represent the HTML document as a sequence of
         bytes. Any registered IANA charset may be used, but UTF-8 is
         preferred.  Although this parameter is optional, it is strongly
         recommended that it always be present. See <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> below for
         a discussion of charset default rules.

      Note that [<a href="#ref-HTML20" title='"Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0"'>HTML20</a>] included an optional "level" parameter; in
      practice, this parameter was never used and has been removed from
      this specification.  [<a href="#ref-HTML30" title='"HyperText Markup Language Specification Version 3.0"'>HTML30</a>] also suggested a "version"
      parameter; in practice, this parameter also was never used and has
      been removed from this specification.

   Encoding considerations:
      See <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of this document.

   Security considerations:
      See <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> of this document.

   Interoperability considerations:
      HTML is designed to be interoperable across the widest possible
      range of platforms and devices of varying capabilities.  However,
      there are contexts (platforms of limited display capability, for
      example) where not all of the capabilities of the full HTML
      definition are feasible. There is ongoing work to develop both a
      modularization of HTML and a set of profiling capabilities to
      identify and negotiate restricted (and extended) capabilities.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2854">RFC 2854</a>               The 'text/html' Media Type              June 2000</span>


      Due to the long and distributed development of HTML, current
      practice on the Internet includes a wide variety of HTML variants.
      Implementors of text/html interpreters must be prepared to be
      "bug-compatible" with popular browsers in order to work with many
      HTML documents available the Internet.

      Typically, different versions are distinguishable by the DOCTYPE
      declaration contained within them, although the DOCTYPE
      declaration itself is sometimes omitted or incorrect.

   Published specification:
      The text/html media type is now defined by W3C Recommendations;
      the latest published version is [<a href="#ref-HTML401" title='"HTML 4.01 Specification"'>HTML401</a>].  In addition, [<a href="#ref-XHTML1" title='"XHTML 1.0: The Extensible HyperText Markup Language: A Reformulation of HTML 4 in XML 1.0"'>XHTML1</a>]
      defines a profile of use of XHTML which is compatible with HTML
      4.01 and which may also be labeled as text/html.

   Applications which use this media type:
      The first and most common application of HTML is the World Wide
      Web; commonly, HTML documents contain URI references [<a href="#ref-URI" title='"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax"'>URI</a>] to
      other documents and media to be retrieved using the HTTP protocol
      [<a href="#ref-HTTP" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>HTTP</a>]. Many gateway applications provide HTML-based interfaces to
      other underlying complex services. Numerous other applications now
      also use HTML as a convenient platform-independent multimedia
      document representation.

   Additional information:

      Magic number:
         There is no single initial string that is always present for
         HTML files. However, <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> below gives some guidelines for
         recognizing HTML files.

      File extension:
         The file extensions 'html' or 'htm' are commonly used, but
         other extensions denoting file formats for preprocessing are
         also common.

      Macintosh File Type code: TEXT

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2854">RFC 2854</a>               The 'text/html' Media Type              June 2000</span>


   Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller:
      The HTML specification is a work product of the World Wide Web
      Consortium's HTML Working Group.  The W3C has change control over
      the HTML specification.

   Further information:
      HTML has a means of including, by reference via URI, additional
      resources (image, video clip, applet) within the base document. In
      order to transfer a complete HTML object and the included
      resources in a single MIME object, the mechanisms of [<a href="#ref-MHTML" title='"MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)"'>MHTML</a>] may
      be used.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Fragment%20Identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Fragment Identifiers</span>

   The URI specification [<a href="#ref-URI" title='"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax"'>URI</a>] notes that the semantics of a fragment
   identifier (part of a URI after a "#") is a property of the data
   resulting from a retrieval action, and that the format and
   interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type
   of the retrieval result.

   For documents labeled as text/html, the fragment identifier
   designates the correspondingly named element; any element may be
   named with the "id" attribute, and A, APPLET, FRAME, IFRAME, IMG and
   MAP elements may be named with a "name" attribute.  This is described
   in detail in [<a href="#ref-HTML40" title='"HTML 4.0 Specification"'>HTML40</a>] <a href="#section-12">section 12</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Encoding%20considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Encoding considerations</span>

   Because of the availability within HTML itself for using character
   entity references, documents that use a wide repertoire of characters
   may still be represented using the US-ASCII charset and transported
   without encoding.  However, transport of text/html using a charset
   other than US-ASCII may require base64 or quoted-printable encoding
   for 7-bit channels.

   As with all MIME text subtypes, the canonical form of "text/html"
   must always represent a line break as a sequence of a CR byte value
   (0x0D) followed by an LF (0x0A) byte value.  Similarly, any
   occurrence of such a CRLF sequence in "text/html" must represent a
   line break.  Use of CR byte values and LF byte values outside of line
   break sequences is also forbidden. This rule applies regardless of
   the character encoding ('charset') involved.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2854">RFC 2854</a>               The 'text/html' Media Type              June 2000</span>


   Note, however, that the HTTP protocol allows the transport of data
   not in canonical form, and, in particular, with other end-of-line
   conventions; see [<a href="#ref-HTTP" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>HTTP</a>] <a href="#section-3.7.1">section 3.7.1</a>. This exception is commonly
   used for HTML.

   HTML sent via email is still subject to the MIME restrictions; this
   is discussed fully in [<a href="#ref-MHTML" title='"MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)"'>MHTML</a>] <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20Recognizing%20HTML%20files"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. Recognizing HTML files</span>

   Almost all HTML files have the string "&lt;html" or "&lt;HTML" near the
   beginning of the file.

   Documents conformant to HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.0 will start
   with a DOCTYPE declaration "&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML" near the beginning,
   before the "&lt;html". These dialects are case insensitive.  Files may
   start with white space, comments (introduced by "&lt;!--" ), or
   processing instructions (introduced by "&lt;?") prior to the DOCTYPE
   declaration.

   XHTML documents (optionally) start with an XML declaration which
   begins with "&lt;?xml" and are required to have a DOCTYPE declaration
   "&lt;!DOCTYPE html".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20Charset%20default%20rules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>. Charset default rules</span>

   The use of an explicit charset parameter is strongly recommended.
   While [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>MIME</a>] specifies "The default character set, which must be
   assumed in the absence of a charset parameter, is US-ASCII."  [<a href="#ref-HTTP" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>HTTP</a>]
   <a href="#section-3.7.1">Section 3.7.1</a>, defines that "media subtypes of the 'text' type are
   defined to have a default charset value of 'ISO-8859-1'".  <a href="#section-19.3">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-19.3">19.3</a> of [<a href="#ref-HTTP" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>HTTP</a>] gives additional guidelines.  Using an explicit
   charset parameter will help avoid confusion.

   Using an explicit charset parameter also takes into account that the
   overwhelming majority of deployed browsers are set to use something
   else than 'ISO-8859-1' as the default; the actual default is either a
   corporate character encoding or character encodings widely deployed
   in a certain national or regional community. For further
   considerations, please also see Section 5.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTML40" title='"HTML 4.0 Specification"'>HTML40</a>].

   [<a href="#ref-HTML401" title='"HTML 4.01 Specification"'>HTML401</a>], section B.10, notes various security issues with
   interpreting anchors and forms in HTML documents.

   In addition, the introduction of scripting languages and interactive
   capabilities in HTML 4.0 introduced a number of security risks
   associated with the automatic execution of programs written by the
   sender but interpreted by the recipient.  User agents executing such
   scripts or programs must be extremely careful to insure that
   untrusted software is executed in a protected environment.
