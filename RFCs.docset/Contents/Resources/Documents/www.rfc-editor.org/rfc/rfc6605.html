<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6605">RFC 6605</a>                    ECDSA for DNSSEC                  April 2012</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   DNSSEC, which is broadly defined in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035
   ([<a href="./rfc4033" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>], [<a href="./rfc4034" title='"Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4034</a>], and [<a href="./rfc4035" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>]), uses cryptographic keys and
   digital signatures to provide authentication of DNS data.  Currently,
   the most popular signature algorithm is RSA with SHA-1, using keys
   that are 1024 or 2048 bits long.

   This document defines the DNSKEY and RRSIG resource records (RRs) of
   two new signing algorithms: ECDSA (Elliptic Curve DSA) with curve
   P-256 and SHA-256, and ECDSA with curve P-384 and SHA-384.  (A
   description of ECDSA can be found in [<a href="#ref-FIPS-186-3" title='"Digital Signature Standard"'>FIPS-186-3</a>].)  This document
   also defines the DS RR for the SHA-384 one-way hash algorithm; the
   associated DS RR for SHA-256 is already defined in <a href="./rfc4509">RFC 4509</a>
   [<a href="./rfc4509" title='"Use of SHA-256 in DNSSEC Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Records (RRs)"'>RFC4509</a>].  [<a href="./rfc6090" title='"Fundamental Elliptic Curve Cryptography Algorithms"'>RFC6090</a>] provides a good introduction to implementing
   ECDSA.

   Current estimates are that ECDSA with curve P-256 has an approximate
   equivalent strength to RSA with 3072-bit keys.  Using ECDSA with
   curve P-256 in DNSSEC has some advantages and disadvantages relative
   to using RSA with SHA-256 and with 3072-bit keys.  ECDSA keys are
   much shorter than RSA keys; at this size, the difference is 256
   versus 3072 bits.  Similarly, ECDSA signatures are much shorter than
   RSA signatures.  This is relevant because DNSSEC stores and transmits
   both keys and signatures.

   In the two signing algorithms defined in this document, the size of
   the key for the elliptic curve is matched with the size of the output
   of the hash algorithm.  This design is based on the widespread belief
   that the equivalent strength of P-256 and P-384 is half the length of
   the key, and also that the equivalent strength of SHA-256 and SHA-384
   is half the length of the key.  Using matched strengths prevents an
   attacker from choosing the weaker half of a signature algorithm.  For
   example, in a signature that uses RSA with 2048-bit keys and SHA-256,
   the signing portion is significantly weaker than the hash portion,
   whereas the two algorithms here are balanced.

   Signing with ECDSA is significantly faster than with RSA (over 20
   times in some implementations).  However, validating RSA signatures
   is significantly faster than validating ECDSA signatures (about 5
   times faster in some implementations).

   Some of the material in this document is copied liberally from <a href="./rfc6460">RFC</a>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6605">RFC 6605</a>                    ECDSA for DNSSEC                  April 2012</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20SHA-384%20DS%20Records"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  SHA-384 DS Records</span>

   SHA-384 is defined in FIPS 180-3 [<a href="#ref-FIPS-180-3" title='"Secure Hash Standard (SHS)"'>FIPS-180-3</a>] and <a href="./rfc6234">RFC 6234</a> [<a href="./rfc6234" title='"US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)"'>RFC6234</a>],
   and is similar to SHA-256 in many ways.  The implementation of SHA-
   384 in DNSSEC follows the implementation of SHA-256 as specified in
   <a href="./rfc4509">RFC 4509</a> except that the underlying algorithm is SHA-384, the digest
   value is 48 bytes long, and the digest type code is 4.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20ECDSA%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  ECDSA Parameters</span>

   Verifying ECDSA signatures requires agreement between the signer and
   the verifier of the parameters used.  FIPS 186-3 [<a href="#ref-FIPS-186-3" title='"Digital Signature Standard"'>FIPS-186-3</a>] lists
   some NIST-recommended elliptic curves.  (Other documents give more
   detail on ECDSA than is given in FIPS 186-3.)  These are the same
   curves listed in <a href="./rfc5114">RFC 5114</a> [<a href="./rfc5114" title='"Additional Diffie-Hellman Groups for Use with IETF Standards"'>RFC5114</a>].  The curves used in this
   document are:

   FIPS 186-3                  <a href="./rfc5114">RFC 5114</a>
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   P-256 (Section D.1.2.3)     256-bit Random ECP Group (<a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>)
   P-384 (Section D.1.2.4)     384-bit Random ECP Group (<a href="#section-2.7">Section 2.7</a>)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20DNSKEY%20and%20RRSIG%20Resource%20Records%20for%20ECDSA"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records for ECDSA</span>

   ECDSA public keys consist of a single value, called "Q" in FIPS
   186-3.  In DNSSEC keys, Q is a simple bit string that represents the
   uncompressed form of a curve point, "x | y".

   The ECDSA signature is the combination of two non-negative integers,
   called "r" and "s" in FIPS 186-3.  The two integers, each of which is
   formatted as a simple octet string, are combined into a single longer
   octet string for DNSSEC as the concatenation "r | s".  (Conversion of
   the integers to bit strings is described in Section C.2 of FIPS
   186-3.)  For P-256, each integer MUST be encoded as 32 octets; for
   P-384, each integer MUST be encoded as 48 octets.

   The algorithm numbers associated with the DNSKEY and RRSIG resource
   records are fully defined in the IANA Considerations section.  They
   are:

   o  DNSKEY and RRSIG RRs signifying ECDSA with the P-256 curve and
      SHA-256 use the algorithm number 13.

   o  DNSKEY and RRSIG RRs signifying ECDSA with the P-384 curve and
      SHA-384 use the algorithm number 14.

   Conformant implementations that create records to be put into the DNS
   MUST implement signing and verification for both of the above
   algorithms.  Conformant DNSSEC verifiers MUST implement verification
   for both of the above algorithms.

   <a href="./rfc5155">RFC 5155</a> [<a href="./rfc5155" title='"DNS Security (DNSSEC) Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence"'>RFC5155</a>] defines new algorithm identifiers for existing
   signing algorithms to indicate that zones signed with these algorithm
   identifiers can use NSEC3 as well as NSEC records to provide denial
   of existence.  That mechanism was chosen to protect implementations
   predating <a href="./rfc5155">RFC 5155</a> from encountering resource records they could not
   know about.  This document does not define such algorithm aliases.

   A DNSSEC validator that implements the signing algorithms defined in
   this document MUST be able to validate negative answers in the form
   of both NSEC and NSEC3 with hash algorithm 1, as defined in <a href="./rfc5155">RFC 5155</a>.
   An authoritative server that does not implement NSEC3 MAY still serve
   zones that use the signing algorithms defined in this document with
   NSEC denial of existence.

   The cryptographic work factor of ECDSA with curve P-256 or P-384 is
   generally considered to be equivalent to half the size of the key, or
   128 bits and 192 bits, respectively.  Such an assessment could, of
   course, change in the future if new attacks that work better than the
   ones known today are found.

   The security considerations listed in <a href="./rfc4509">RFC 4509</a> apply here as well.
