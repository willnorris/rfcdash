Abstract

   The OpenLDAP Project is operating an experimental LDAP (Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol) referral service known as the "OpenLDAP
   Root Service".  The automated system generates referrals based upon
   service location information published in DNS SRV RRs (Domain Name
   System location of services resource records).  This document
   describes this service.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Background</span>

   LDAP [<a href="./rfc2251" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)"'>RFC2251</a>] directories use a hierarchical naming scheme inherited
   from X.500 [<a href="#ref-X500" title='"The Directory: Overview of Concepts, Models and Service"'>X500</a>].  Traditionally, X.500 deployments have used a
   geo-political naming scheme (e.g., CN=Jane
   Doe,OU=Engineering,O=Example,ST=CA,C=US).  However, registration
   infrastructure and location services in many portions of the naming
   hierarchical are inadequate or nonexistent.

   The construction of a global directory requires a robust registration
   infrastructure and location service.  Use of Internet domain-based
   naming [<a href="./rfc2247" title='"Using Domains in LDAP/X.500 Distinguished Names"'>RFC2247</a>] (e.g., UID=jdoe,DC=eng,DC=example,DC=net) allows
   LDAP directory services to leverage the existing DNS [<a href="./rfc1034" title='"Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities"'>RFC1034</a>]
   registration infrastructure and DNS SRV [<a href="./rfc2782" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC2782</a>] resource records
   can be used to locate services [<a href="#ref-LOCATE" title='"Discovering LDAP Services with DNS"'>LOCATE</a>].

   Most existing LDAP implementations do not support location of
   directory services using DNS SRV resource records.  However, most
   servers support generation of referrals to "superior" server(s).
   This service provides a "root" LDAP service which servers may use as
   their superior referral service.

   Client may also use the service directly to locate services
   associated with an arbitrary Distinguished Name [<a href="./rfc2253" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): UTF-8 String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>RFC2253</a>] within the
   domain based hierarchy.

   Notice:
     The mechanisms used by service are experimental.  The descriptions
     provided by this document are not definitive.  Definitive
     mechanisms shall be published in a Standard Track document(s).

   This service returns referrals generated from DNS SRV resource
   records [<a href="./rfc2782" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC2782</a>].

   The service maps a DN [<a href="./rfc2253" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): UTF-8 String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>RFC2253</a>] to a fully qualified domain name
   using the following algorithm:

       domain = null;
       foreach RDN left-to-right        // [1]

       {
           if not multi-valued RDN and
               RDN.type == domainComponent
           {
               if ( domain == null || domain == "." )
               {   // start
                   domain = "";
               }
               else
               {   // append separator
                   domain .= ".";
               }

               if ( RDN.value == "."  )
               {   // root
                   domain = ".";
               }
               else

               {   // append domainComponent
                   domain .= RDN.value;
               }
               continue;
           }
           domain = null;
       }

   Examples:

       -----------------------------   ------------
       DC=example,DC=net               example.net

       DC=example+O=example,DC=net     net
       DC=example,C=US+DC=net          null

   Notes:

   0) A later incarnation will use a Standard Track mechanism.

   1) A later incarnation of this service may use a right-to-left
      algorithm.

   2) <a href="./rfc2247">RFC 2247</a> does not state how one can map the domain representing
      the root of the domain tree to a DN.  We suggest the root of the
      domain tree be mapped to "DC=." and that this be reversable.

   3) <a href="./rfc2247">RFC 2247</a> states that domain "example.net" should be mapped to the
      DN "DC=example,DC=net", not to "DC=example,DC=net,DC=.".  As it is
      not our intent to introduce or support an alternative domain to DN
      mapping, the algorithm ignores domainComponents to the left of
      "DC=.".

   4) <a href="./rfc2247">RFC 2247</a> states that domain "example.net" should be mapped to the
      DN "DC=example,DC=net", not to "DC=example,DC=.,DC=net".  As it is
      not our intent to introduce or support an alternative domain to DN
      mapping, the algorithm ignores domainComponents to the left of
      "DC=." and "DC=." itself if further domainComponents are found to
      the right.

   5) <a href="./rfc2247">RFC 2247</a> states that value of an DC attribute type is a domain
      component.  It should not contain multiple domain components.  A
      later incarnation of this service may map this domain to null or
      be coded to return invalid DN error.

   If the domain is null or ".", the service aborts further processing
   and returns noSuchObject.  Later incarnation of this service may
   abort processing if the resulting domain is a top-level domain.

   The root service locates services associated with a given fully
   qualified domain name by querying the Domain Name System for LDAP SRV
   resource records.  For the domain example.net, the service would do a
   issue a SRV query for the domain "_ldap._tcp.example.net".  A
   successful query will return one or more resource records of the
   form:

     _ldap._tcp.example.net. IN SRV 0 0 389 ldap.example.net.

   If no LDAP SRV resource records are returned or any DNS error occurs,
   the service aborts further processing and returns noSuchObject.
   Later incarnations of this service will better handle transient
   errors.

   For each DNS SRV resource record returned for the domain, a LDAP URL
   [<a href="./rfc2255" title='"The LDAP URL Format"'>RFC2255</a>] is constructed.  For the above resource record, the URL
   would be:

     ldap://ldap.example.net:389/

   These URLs are then returned in the referral.  The URLs are currently
   returned in resolver order.  That is, the server itself does not make
   use of priority or weight information in the SRV resource records.  A
   later incarnation of this service may.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Protocol%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Protocol Operations</span>

   This section describes how the service performs basic LDAP
   operations.  The service supports operations extended through certain
   controls as described in a later section.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3088">RFC 3088</a>                 OpenLDAP Root Service                April 2001</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20Basic%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>. Basic Operations</span>

   Basic (add, compare, delete, modify, rename, search) operations
   return a referral result if the target (or base) DN can be mapped to
   a set of LDAP URLs as described above.  Otherwise a noSuchObject
   response or other appropriate response is returned.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20Bind%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>. Bind Operation</span>

   The service accepts "anonymous" bind specifying version 2 or version
   3 of the protocol.  All other bind requests will return a non-
   successful resultCode.  In particular, clients which submit clear
   text credentials will be sent an unwillingToPerform resultCode with a
   cautionary text regarding providing passwords to strangers.

   As this service is read-only, LDAPv3 authentication [<a href="./rfc2829" title='"Authentication Methods for LDAP"'>RFC2829</a>] is not
   supported.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20Unbind%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>. Unbind Operations</span>

   Upon receipt of an unbind request, the server abandons all
   outstanding requests made by client and disconnects.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20Extended%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>. Extended Operations</span>

   The service currently does recognize any extended operation.  Later
   incarnations of the service may support Start TLS [<a href="./rfc2830" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Extension for Transport Layer Security"'>RFC2830</a>] and other
   operations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.5.%20Update%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" id="section-3.5">3.5</a>. Update Operations</span>

   A later incarnation of this service may return unwillingToPerform for
   all update operations as this is an unauthenticated service.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Controls"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Controls</span>

   The service supports the ManageDSAit control.  Unsupported controls
   are serviced per <a href="./rfc2251">RFC 2251</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20ManageDSAit%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>. ManageDSAit Control</span>

   The server recognizes and honors the ManageDSAit control [<a href="#ref-NAMEDREF" title='"Named Subordinate References in LDAP Directories"'>NAMEDREF</a>]
   provided with operations.

   If DNS location information is available for the base DN itself, the
   service will return unwillingToPerform for non-search operations.
   For search operations, an entry will be returned if within scope and
   matches the provided filter.  For example:

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3088">RFC 3088</a>                 OpenLDAP Root Service                April 2001</span>


       c: searchRequest {
           base="DC=example,DC=net"
           scope=base
           filter=(objectClass=*)
           ManageDSAit
       }

       s: searchEntry {
           dn: DC=example,DC=net
           objectClass: referral
           objectClass: extensibleObject
           dc: example
           ref: ldap://ldap.example.net:389/
           associatedDomain: example.net
       }
       s: searchResult {
           success
       }

   If DNS location information is available for the DC portion of a
   subordinate entry, the service will return noSuchObject with the
   matchedDN set to the DC portion of the base for search and update
   operations.

       c: searchRequest {
           base="CN=subordinate,DC=example,DC=net"
           scope=base
           filter=(objectClass=*)
           ManageDSAit
       }

       s: searchResult {
           noSuchObject
           matchedDN="DC=example,DC=net"
       }

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20Using%20the%20Service"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. Using the Service</span>

   Servers may be configured to refer superior requests to
   &lt;ldap://root.openldap.org:389&gt;.

   Though clients may use the service directly, this is not encouraged.
   Clients should use a local service and only use this service when
   referred to it.

   The service supports LDAPv3 and LDAPv2+ [LDAPv2+] clients over
   TCP/IPv4.  Future incarnations of this service may support TCP/IPv6
   or other transport/internet protocols.

   This service currently runs on a single host.  This host and
   associated network resources are not yet exhausted.  If they do
   become exhausted, we believe we can easily scale to meet the demand
   through common distributed load balancing technics.  The service can
   also easily be duplicated locally.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20Protocol%20interoperability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>. Protocol interoperability</span>

   This service has able avoided known interoperability issues in
   supporting variants of LDAP.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.1.%20LDAPv3"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2.1" id="section-6.2.1">6.2.1</a>. LDAPv3</span>

   The server implements all features of LDAPv3 [<a href="./rfc2251" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)"'>RFC2251</a>] necessary to
   provide the service.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.2.%20LDAPv2"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2.2" id="section-6.2.2">6.2.2</a>. LDAPv2</span>

   LDAPv2 [<a href="./rfc1777" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol"'>RFC1777</a>] does not support the return of referrals and hence
   may not be referred to this service.  Though a LDAPv2 client could
   connect and issue requests to this service, the client would treat
   any referral returned to it as an unknown error.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.3.%20LDAPv2%2B"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2.3" id="section-6.2.3">6.2.3</a>. LDAPv2+</span>

   LDAPv2+ [LDAPv2+] provides a number of extensions to LDAPv2,
   including referrals.  LDAPv2+, like LDAPv3, does not require a bind
   operation before issuing of other operations.  As the referral
   representation differ between LDAPv2+ and LDAPv3, the service returns
   LDAPv3 referrals in this case.  However, as commonly deployed LDAPv2+
   clients issue bind requests (for compatibility with LDAPv2 servers),
   this has not generated any interoperability issues (yet).

   A future incarnation of this service may drop support for LDAPv2+
   (and LDAPv2).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.4.%20CLDAP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2.4" id="section-6.2.4">6.2.4</a>. CLDAP</span>

   CLDAP [<a href="./rfc1798" title='"Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol"'>RFC1798</a>] does not support the return of referrals and hence is
   not supported.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   This service provides information to "anonymous" clients.  This
   information is derived from the public directories, namely the Domain
   Name System.

   The use of authentication would require clients to disclose
   information to the service.  This would be an unnecessary invasion of
   privacy.

   The lack of encryption allows eavesdropping upon client requests and
   responses.  A later incarnation of this service may support
   encryption (such as via Start TLS [<a href="./rfc2830" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Extension for Transport Layer Security"'>RFC2830</a>]).

   Information integrity protection is not provided by the service.  The
   service is subject to varies forms of DNS spoofing and attacks.  LDAP
   session or operation integrity would provide false sense of security
   concerning the integrity of DNS information.  A later incarnation of
   this service may support DNSSEC and provide integrity protection (via
   SASL, TLS, or IPSEC).

   The service is subject to a variety of denial of service attacks.
   The service is capable of blocking access by a number of factors.
   This capability have yet to be used and likely would be ineffective
   in preventing sophisticated attacks.  Later incarnations of this
   service will likely need better protection from such attacks.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20Conclusions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>. Conclusions</span>

   DNS is good glue.  By leveraging of the Domain Name System, global
   LDAP directories may be built without requiring a protocol specific
   registration infrastructures.

   In addition, use of DNS service location allows global directories to
   be built "ad hoc".  That is, anyone with a domain name can
   participate.  There is no requirement that the superior domain
   participate.

   Internet hosting for this experiment is provided by the Internet
   Software Consortium &lt;<a href="http://www.isc.org/">http://www.isc.org/</a>&gt;.  Computing resources were
   provided by Net Boolean Incorporated &lt;<a href="http://www.boolean.net/">http://www.boolean.net/</a>&gt;.  This
   experiment would not have been possible without the contributions of
   numerous volunteers of the open source community.  Mechanisms
   described in this document are based upon those introduced in
   [<a href="./rfc2247" title='"Using Domains in LDAP/X.500 Distinguished Names"'>RFC2247</a>] and [<a href="#ref-LOCATE" title='"Discovering LDAP Services with DNS"'>LOCATE</a>].
