Introduction

   This note describes the Name/Finger protocol.  This is a simple
   protocol which provides an interface to the Name and Finger programs
   at several network sites.  These programs return a friendly,
   human-oriented status report on either the system at the moment or a
   particular person in depth.  Currently only the SAIL (SU-AI), SRI
   (SRI-(KA/KL)), and ITS (MIT-(AI/ML/MC/DMS)) sites support this
   protocol, but there are other systems with similar programs that
   could easily be made servers; there is no required format and the
   protocol consists mostly of specifying a single "command line".

To use via the network:

   ICP to socket 117 (octal, 79. decimal) and establish two 8-bit
   connections.

   Send a single "command line", ending with &lt;CRLF&gt;.

   Receive information which will vary depending on the above line and
   the particular system.  The server closes its connections as soon as
   this output is finished.

The command line:

   Systems may differ in their interpretations of this line.  However,
   the basic scheme is straightforward:  if the line is null (i.e. just
   a &lt;CRLF&gt; is sent) then the server should return a "default" report
   which lists all people using the system at that moment.  If on the
   other hand a user name is specified (e.g. FOO&lt;CRLF&gt;) then the
   response should concern only that particular user, whether logged in
   or not.

   Both ITS and SAIL sites allow several names to be included on the
   line, separated by commas; but the syntax for some servers can be
   slightly more elaborate.  For example, if "/W" (called the "Whois
   switch") also appears on the line given to an ITS server, much fuller
   descriptions are returned.  The complete documentation may be found
   at any time in the files ".INFO.;NAME ORDER" on MIT-AI,
   "FINGER.LES[UP,DOC]" on SU-AI, and "&lt;DOCUMENTATION&gt;FINGER.DOC" on

Name/Finger



   SRI-KL, all freely accessible by FTP (with the exception of SRI-KL,
   where TOPS-20 requires the "anonymous" login convention).

   Allowable "names" in the command line should of course include "user
   names" or "login names" as defined by the system, but it is also
   reasonable to understand last names or even full names as well.  If a
   name is ambiguous, all possible derivations should be returned in
   some fashion; SAIL will simply list the possible names and no more,
   whereas an ITS server will furnish the full standard information for
   each possibility.

Response to null command line - "default" listing:

   This is a request for a list of all online users, much like a TOPS-10
   or TENEX "systat".  To fulfill the basic intent of the Name/Finger
   programs, the returned list should include at least the full names of
   each user and the physical locations of their terminals insofar as
   they can be determined.  Including the job name and idle time (number
   of minutes since last typein, or since last job activity) is also
   reasonable and useful.  The appendix has examples which demonstrate
   how this information can be formatted.

Response to non-null command line - "name" listing:

   For in-depth status of a specified user, there are two main cases.
   If the user is logged in, a line or two is returned in the same
   format as that for the "default" listing, but showing only that user.
   If not logged in, things become more interesting.  Furnishing the
   full name and time of last logout is the expected thing to do, but
   there is also a "plan" feature, wherein a user may leave a short
   message that will be included in the response to such requests.  This
   is easily implemented by (for example) having the program look for a
   specially named text file on the user's directory or some common
   area.  See the examples for typical "plans".

Implementation miscellany:

   Anyone wishing to implement such a server is encouraged to get in
   touch with the maintainers of NAME by sending a message to BUG-NAME @
   MIT-AI;  apart from offering advice and help, a list of all sites
   with such servers is kept there.  It is also suggested that any
   existing programs performing similar functions locally (i.e. not as
   net servers) be extended to allow specification of other sites, or
   names at other sites.  For example, on ITS systems one can say
   ":NAME&lt;cr&gt;" for a local default listing, or ":NAME @SAIL&lt;cr&gt;" for
   SAIL's default listing, or ":NAME Foo@MC&lt;cr&gt;" to ask MIT-MC about
   Foo's status, etc.

Name/Finger



   It should be noted that connecting directly to the server from a TIP
   or an equally narrow-minded TELNET-protocol user program can result
   in meaningless attempts at option negotiation being sent to the
   server, which will foul up the command line interpretation unless the
   server knows enough to filter out IAC's and perhaps even respond
   negatively (IAC WON'T) to all option commands received.  This is a
   convenience but is not at all required, since normally the user side
   is just an extended NAME/FINGER type program.

And finally a little background:

   The FINGER program at SAIL, written by Les Earnest, was the
   inspiration for the NAME program on ITS.  Earl Killian at MIT and
   Brian Harvey at SAIL were jointly responsible for implementing the
   protocol just described, and Greg Hinchliffe has recently brought up
   a similar server for SRI-KA and SRI-KL.

Note: it is possible for some lines of the actual output to exceed 80
chars in length.  The handling of such lines is of course dependant on
the particular user program; in these examples, lines have been
truncated to 72 chars for greater clarity.
