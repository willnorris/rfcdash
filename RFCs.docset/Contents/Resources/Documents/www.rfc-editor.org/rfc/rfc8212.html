<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   BGP routing security issues need to be addressed in order to make the
   Internet more stable.  Route leaks [<a href="./rfc7908" title='"Problem Definition and Classification of BGP Route Leaks"'>RFC7908</a>] are part of the problem,
   but software defects or operator misconfiguration can also
   contribute.  This document updates [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] so that routes are
   neither imported nor exported unless specifically enabled by
   configuration.  This change reduces the consequences of these
   problems and improves the default level of Internet routing security.

   Many deployed BGP speakers send and accept any and all route
   announcements between their BGP neighbors by default.  This practice
   dates back to the early days of the Internet, where operators were
   permissive in sending routing information to allow all networks to
   reach each other.  As the Internet has become more densely
   interconnected, the risk of a misbehaving BGP speaker poses
   significant risks to Internet routing.

   This specification intends to improve this situation by requiring the
   explicit configuration of both BGP Import and Export Policies for any
   External BGP (EBGP) session such as customers, peers, or
   confederation boundaries for all enabled address families.  Through
   codification of the aforementioned requirement, operators will
   benefit from consistent behavior across different BGP
   implementations.

   BGP speakers following this specification do not use or send routes
   on EBGP sessions, unless specifically configured to do so.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC4271">RFC4271</a>] describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) that contains
   local policies that can be applied to the information in the Routing
   Information Base (RIB).  This document distinguishes the type of a
   policy based on its application.

   Import Policy: a local policy to be applied to the information
   contained in the Adj-RIBs-In.  As described in <a href="./rfc4271#section-3.2">Section 3.2 [RFC4271]</a>,
   the Adj-RIBs-In contain information learned from other BGP speakers,
   and the application of the Import Policy results in the routes that
   will be considered in the Decision Process by the local BGP speaker.

   Export Policy: a local policy to be applied in selecting the
   information contained in the Adj-RIBs-Out.  As described in
   <a href="./rfc4271#section-3.2">Section 3.2 [RFC4271]</a>, the Adj-RIBs-Out contain information that has
   been selected for advertisement to other BGP speakers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   capitals, as shown here.

   This section updates [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] to specify the default behavior of a
   BGP speaker when there are no Import or Export Policies associated
   with a particular EBGP session.  A BGP speaker MAY provide a
   configuration option to deviate from the following updated behaviors.

   The following paragraph is added to <a href="#section-9.1">Section 9.1</a> (Decision Process)
   after the fifth paragraph, which ends in "route aggregation and route
   information reduction":

      Routes contained in an Adj-RIB-In associated with an EBGP peer
      SHALL NOT be considered eligible in the Decision Process if no
      explicit Import Policy has been applied.

   The following paragraph is added to <a href="#section-9.1.3">Section 9.1.3</a> (Phase 3: Route
   Dissemination) after the third paragraph, which ends in "by means of
   an UPDATE message (see 9.2).":

      Routes SHALL NOT be added to an Adj-RIB-Out associated with an
      EBGP peer if no explicit Export Policy has been applied.

   Permissive default routing policies can result in inadvertent effects
   such as route leaks [<a href="./rfc7908" title='"Problem Definition and Classification of BGP Route Leaks"'>RFC7908</a>], in general resulting in routing of
   traffic through an unexpected path.  While it is possible for an
   operator to use monitoring to detect unexpected flows, there is no
   general framework that can be applied.  These policies also have the
   potential to expose software defects or misconfiguration that could
   have unforeseen technical and business impacting effects.

   The update to [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] specified in this document is intended to
   eliminate those inadvertent effects.  Operators must explicitly
   configure Import and Export Policies to achieve their expected goals.
   There is of course no protection against a malicious or incorrect
   explicit configuration.

   The security considerations described in [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] and the
   vulnerability analysis discussed in [<a href="./rfc4272" title='"BGP Security Vulnerabilities Analysis"'>RFC4272</a>] also apply to this
   document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Transition%20Considerations%20for%20BGP%20Implementers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Transition Considerations for BGP Implementers</span>

   This appendix is not normative.

   For an implementer, transitioning to a compliant BGP implementation
   may require a process that can take several years.

   It is understood and acknowledged that operators who are taking
   advantage of an undefined behavior will always be surprised by
   changes to said behavior.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.1.%20%20%22N%2B1%20N%2B2%22%20Release%20Strategy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" id="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  "N+1 N+2" Release Strategy</span>

   An implementer could leverage an approach described as the "N+1 and
   N+2" release strategy.  In release N+1, the implementer introduces a
   new default configuration parameter to indicate that the BGP speaker
   is operating in "ebgp insecure-mode".  In addition to the
   introduction of the new parameter, an implementer could begin to
   display informational warnings to the operator that certain parts of
   the configuration are incomplete.  In release N+1, operators of the
   BGP implementation become aware that a configurable default exists in
   the implementation, and can prepare accordingly.  In release N+2 or
   later, the inverse of the previous default configuration parameter
   that was introduced in release N+1 becomes the new default.

   As a result, any new installation of release N+2 will adhere to this
   document.  Installations upgraded from version release N+1 will
   adhere to the previous insecure behavior, if no modification was made
   to the "ebgp insecure-mode" configuration parameter.
