                  <span class="h1">Categorization and Guide to NWG/RFCs</span>

   The NWG/RFC Guide is an attempt to introduce some order into the
   NWG/RFC series, which now numbers 102.  The Guide categorizes the
   NWG/RFC notes, identifies topics under discussion and the relevant
   NWG/RFCs, and indicates whether the notes are current, obsolete, or
   superseded.

   A minimum subset of NWG/RFCs is identified.  This subset consists of
   the NWG/RFCs that one should read to quickly become familiar with the
   current status of topics.

   For historical reasons and for readers interested in tracing through
   the stages of development of a topic, a brief summary is given for
   each NWG/RFC relevant to a particular category.

   This initial Guide is being issued as a NWG/RFC since it establishes
   the basis for future releases.  So, please comment! Suggestions,
   criticism, corrections, etc., will be accepted for a period of
   approximately two weeks.  Be critical as I have not had to implement
   an NCP and probably have some misconceptions regarding various
   technical points.  An official version will be released on March 26.
   The Guide will then be a unique series of documents, separate from
   NWG/RFCs (as is the Document No. 1, No. 2 series).

   With regard to renumbering NWG/RFCs, I am inclined to keep she
   sequential numbering scheme presently employed.  The main reason for
   this position is that the current numbers have both historical and
   semantic significance.  For example, reference to "#33, #66, #83,
   etc." is a convenient shorthand (reminiscent of the old corny joke
   about joke #s) used extensively during meetings.  The list of
   "current status" NWG/RFC numbers should dispel any fear of
   maintaining stacks of NWG/RFCs for quick reference.  The subject is
   not closed, however, and I will entertain any objections,
   suggestions, etc.

GUIDE TO NETWORK WORKING GROUP/REQUEST FOR COMMENTS

   The NWG/RFC notes are partitioned into 9 categories, which in turn
   are divided into subcategories.  For each category the official
   document (if any), unresolved issues, and documents to be published
   are identified.

   For each subcategory, relevant NWG/RFCs are listed and a brief
   description of the topics addressed in each note is given.

   The categories are again listed and the current NWG/RFCs identified
   (p. 23).  The NWG/RFCs in the list comprise the subset defining
   "current status".  Note that most of the documentation in the subset
   addresses topics in Category D - Subsystem Level Protocol, where at
   the present time most issues are unresolved.

   Finally, the NWG/RFCs are listed by number, with a reference to the
   relevant categories (p. 26).

   The distribution list contains names, addresses, and phone numbers
   for recipients of NWG/RFCs.  The most recent list, NWG/RFC 95,
   designates the Technical Liaison as the recipient for each site and
   supersedes all other RFCs in this category.

   NWG/RFC #s: 84, 100

   The NWG/RFC Guide categorizes the NWG/RFC notes, identifies topics
   under discussion, the relevant NWG/RFCs, and denotes whether the
   notes are current, obsolete, or superseded.  Included in this
   category are lists of NWG/RFCs, ordered by number (as in 84) and/or
   by author.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.5%20Policies"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.5" id="appendix-A.5">A.5</a> Policies</span>

   NWG/RFC #s: 18, 24, 25, 27, 30, 37, 41, 48, 53, 54, 72, 73, 77, 82,
               102

   NWG/RFCs categorized as policy contain official stands on issues
   i.e., the position taken by S. Crocker, NWG Chairman.  The issues
   covered are varied.

   In particular:

   77 and 82 discuss meeting policy.

   72, 73, 77, and 82 discuss the decision to delay making changes to
   the Host/Host protocol in order to first gain experience with the
   network.  A committee to propose specific changes has been formed.

   37 discusses changes to the Host/Host protocol and the schedule for
   introducing modifications.

   53 sets forth the mechanism for establishing and modifying the
   official Host/Host protocol.

   54 presents the initial official protocol.

   48 presents some suggestions for policy on some outstanding issues.

   41 requests the tagging of IMP-IMP teletype messages.

   Documentation conventions for NWG/RFCs are given in 24, 27, and 30.

   25 and 18 designate uses for particular link numbers. 25 has been
   superseded by 37 and 48. 18 is obsolete.

   102 discusses the issuing of Document #2, in lieu of the official
   modification procedure outlined in 53.

   Official document: BBN Memo No. 1822 (latest revision - February
   1971)

   Unresolved issues: Location of first byte of data in a message.

   To be published: Document No. 2 will be written by S. Crocker and
   will, among other things, resolve the first byte location issue.

   NWG/RFC #s: 17, 17a, 19, 21, 33, 36, 37, 38, 46, 47, 102

   In particular:

   17 raised several questions regarding HOST/IMP protocol.  In 17a,BBN
   responds to the questions.

   19 proposes that the hosts control the ordering of IMP/Host traffic
   rather than getting messages delivered in the order received by the
   IMP.  This proposal is counter to BBN's position, specifically
   expressed in 47; that is, buffering is a Host rather than an IMP
   function.  The purpose of buffering in the IMP is to handle surges of
   traffic, thus IMP buffers should be empty.  NWG/RFC 19 is obsolete.

   21 discusses changes to BBN Memo No. 1822.  The remarks are obsolete.

   33 contains a general description of the interface between a host and
   the IMP.  NWG/RFC 47 comments on NWG/RFC 33.

   The use of RFNMs (type 10 and type 5 messages) to control flow is
   discussed in NWG/RFCs 36, 37 and 46.  The official position in "cease
   on link" (i.e., discontinue the mechanism) is presented in 102 and
   renders obsolete the remarks in 36, 37, and 46.

   38 discusses the changes to message format that would be necessary if
   multiplexing connections over links was allowed.

   NWG/RFC #s: 44, 48, 49, 50, 54, 64, 65, 67, 70, 102

   In particular:

   102 presents the decision of the Host/Host protocol committee to
   abandon the marking convention and to ignore padding.  The issue of
   whether to have the first data byte begin after 72 bits of header or
   to use double physical transmission (NWG/RFC #s 65, 67) is discussed.

   The former official position is expressed in 54: "All regular
   messages consist of a 32 bit leader, marking, text, and padding.
   Marking is a (possibly null) sequence of zeros followed by a 1;
   padding is a 1 followed by a (possibly null) sequence of zeros."

   Several proposals to eliminate marking have been made. 64 suggests a
   hardware modification to eliminate marking/padding by adding
   appropriate counters to Host/IMP interfaces. 65 suggests breaking
   regular messages into two messages. 67 supports 65. 72 and 73 suggest
   that such changes be postponed until sufficient experience with the
   network is gained.

   44 introduces the notion of double padding and presents two
   alternative approaches when a message does not end on a Host word
   boundary:

      a) The host provides padding in addition to the IMPS ("double
         padding")

      b) The host shifts messages to end on a word boundary.

   48 explains double padding in more detail and discusses the pros and
   cons.  A suggestion is made to use marking to adjust the word
   baundary (alternative b).  NWG/RFCs 49 and 50 are concurrences with
   48.

   70 presents a method to handle the stripping of padding from a
   message.

   All NWG/RFCs in this category have been superseded by 102.

   Control Program (NCP).  The topics included in this category are
   connection establishment and termination, flow control, interrupt
   handling, error control and status testing, dynamic reconnection, and
   the relationship between connections and links.

   Official documents: Document No. 1 by S. Crocker, 3 August 1970, with
   modifications presented in NWG/RFC 102.

   Unresolved issues: Length of control messages
                      Location in message of first byte of data
                      Flow control algorithm
                      Socket identification format

   To be published: Document No. 2 will be written by S. Crocker and
   will resolve the first three issues.  A NWG/RFC will be written by J.
   Heafner, in collaboration with E. Meyer and G. Grossman. presenting
   the pros and cons on alternative proposals for socket number
   identification.

   NWG/RFC #s: 9, 11, 22, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50,
               54, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 65, 68, 93, 102

   The official Host/Host protocol presented in Document No. 1 is based
   on the proposals, discussions, acceptance, and rejection of ideas in
   the above list of NWG/RFCs, up to and including 59.

   In particular:

   9, 11, and 22 represent an early attempt at a Host/Host protocol. 11
   supersedes 9 and 22 contains some modifications to control message
   formats presented in 11.  The protocol was not considered powerful
   enough because it didn't provide for inter-host communication without
   logging in.  This protocol was thrown out as a result of a network
   meeting in December 1969.

   33 is the basis for the current protocol.  It was presented at the
   SJCC, 1970.

   36 is a modification of 33.  It discusses connection establishment
   without switching, flow control, and introduces the idea of
   reconnection.  Control commands are summarized. 36 was distributed at
   a Network meeting in March 1970.

   37 presents the reaction to 36 and presents ideas on reconnection
   flow control and decoupling of links and connections.  Provisions of
   error detection, status testing, experimentation and expansions are
   discussed.

   38, 39, 40, 44, 49 and 50 are comments written in response to the
   meeting. 46 is also a comment but in the form of a rewrite of 33. 46
   introduces the notion of interrupts, INT, and ECO for status testing.

   47 concerns the philosophy behind the notion of a link.

   48 summarizes the issues discussed in the above NWG/RFCs.

   54 is the initial official protocol submitted for criticism,
   comments, etc.  It introduces a new mechanism for flow control in
   which the receiving host allocates buffer space and notifies the
   sending host of the space available.

   57 and 59 comment on 54.

   Document No. 1 differs from NWG/RFC 54 as follows: commands GVB and
   RET have been added for flow control and error condition codes have
   been added to ERR.  NWG/RFC 102 presents some modifications to
   Document No. 1: fixed lengths are specified for ECO, ERP, and ERR; a
   new pair of commands RST and RRP (suggested in 57) are added.

   60, 61, and 62 propose new Host/Host protocols, quite different from
   the current official protocol. 62 supersedes 61. 60 and 62 are worth
   considering for possible implementation in future protocols.
   Hopefully, more documents of a similar nature will be generated as
   experience is gained with the current protocol.

   NWG/RFCs 65 and 68 comment on Document No. 1.

   93 points out an ambiguity in Document No. 1 regarding the
   requirement of a message data type in the message sent from server
   socket 1.  The ambiguity is resolved by 102 which eliminates message
   data type from level 2 protocol.

   NWG/RFC #s: 9, 11, 22, 23, 33, 36, 44, 46, 48, 55, 70, 71, 74, 89

   This category includes RFCs which give details of system calls, table
   structures, implementation techniques, etc.

   In particular:

   NWG/RFCs 9, 11, and 22 are obsolete

   23 is a general statement on sending or receiving multiple control
   messages in a single communication.

   33 discusses the system calls used for interaction between the NCP
   and a user process.

   36 describes a possible implementation giving table structures and
   their interrelationships.

   44 lists the system calls that SDC feels should operate, includes
   spec. of calls to NCP.

   NWG/RFC 48 presents Postel's and Crocker's view on the environment in
   which a host time-sharing system operates, suggests some system
   calls, and presents a design to illustrate the components of an NCP.

   55 presents a prototypical NCP which implements the initial official
   protocol specified in 54.  It is offered as an illustrative example.

   70 gives some techniques for stripping the padding from a message.

   71 presents the method employed by the CCN-Host at UCLA to
   resynchronize flow control when an input error occurs.

   74 documents the implementation of sections of the NCP at UCSB.

   89 gives a brief description of the "interim interim NCP" (IINCP) on
   the MIT Dynamic Modeling PDP-6/10 used to run some experiments.

   NWG/RFC #s: 33, 36, 39, 44, 49, 50, 54, 60, 62

   The NWG/RFCs in this category present the system calls and control
   commands used to establish and terminate connections, i.e., the
   handshaking that must transpire before connections are established or
   terminated.

   In particular:

   36 presents a rough scenario of connection establishment which
   differs from that specified in 33 in that establishment does not
   include procedures for switching procedures.

   39 suggests the addition of a command TER to supplement CLS.

   44 discusses the use of the CLS command and suggests that two
   commands BLS and CLS be adopted.

   46, 46, and 50 all discuss queuing of RFCs.

   54 presents the initial official method for establishing and
   terminating connections.

   60 and 62 present schemes different from the official protocol.

   NWG/RFC #s: 19, 33, 36, 37, 46, 47, 54, 59, 60, 65, 68, 102

   The NWG/RFCs in this category address the problem of controlling the
   flow of messages from the sending socket to the receive socket.  The
   official position is stated in Document No. 1 with an unresolved
   issue pending as described in NWG/RFC 102.

   In particular:

   19 suggests that Hosts may want the capability of agreeing to lock
   programs into core for more efficient core-to-core transfers.  This
   may require different handling of RFNMs.

   33 describes the use of RFNM (type 10 rather than 5) on a link to
   control flow.  A control command RSM (resume) is defined to allow the
   host to signal for resumption of message flow. 46 describes the same
   technique.

   37 describes the effect some proposed changes (for reconnect and
   decoupling of connections and links) would have on RFNMs and "cease
   on link."

   46 (MIT's rewrite of protocol) introduces BLK and RSM commands as an
   alternative to "cease on link", SPD and RSM commands.

   47 presents BBN's position that buffering be handled by the Host, not
   the IMP.

   54 introduces a new flow control mechanism in which the receiving
   host is required to allocate buffer space for each connection and not
   notify the sending host of bit sizes.  A new command, ALL to allocate
   space is sent from the receiving host to the sending host.  With this
   new mechanism, 33, 37, 46, and 47 become obsolete.

   59 presents the objections of Project MAC and Lincoln Labs to the
   flow control mechanism introduced in 54.  Their preference is for
   "cease on link" which allocates buffer space on demand.

   60, which defines a simplified NCP protocol, presents a method of
   flow control based on the requirement that connections are full
   duplex.

   65 comments on Document No. 1.  With respect to flow control, it
   disagrees with the allocation mechanism and the introduction of
   irregular message to make the cease mechanism work.

   68 proposes modifications to RFNM by defining three forms which would
   insure control of data and would replace the memory allocation
   mechanism.

   102 eliminates the cease mechanism and introduces potential

   NWG/RFC #s: 2, 37, 39, 40, 46, 48, 54, 57, 102

   This category addresses schemes for detecting and controlling errors
   and for Host status reporting and testing.

   In particular:

   2 talks about error checking and gives an algorithm for implementing
   a checksum.  It also recommends that Hosts should have a mode in
   which positive verification of all messages is required.

   37 brings up the topics of error detection and status testing, which
   are expanded by RAND in 39 and 40. 39 introduces control commands ERR
   for error checking and QRY, HCU, and HGD for status testing. 40
   expands on the discussion, suggests error codes, introduces RPY as a
   response to QRY, and suggests that NOP could be used for reporting
   Host status.

   46 concurs with 40 on ERR and introduces ECO to test communication
   between NCPs.

   48 recommends that ERR, as presented in 40 and 46, be adopted, that a
   distinction be made between resource errors and other error types,
   that ECO, presented in 46, be of variable length, and that an ECO,
   ERP command pair be adopted.

   54 officially specifies the control commands ERR, ECO, and ERP.  The
   official protocol doesn't include a specific list of error types nor
   does it recommend the action to be taken.  Suggestions for extensions
   to error detection and recovery and Host/Host status testing are
   encouraged.

   57 presents a list of error types and suggests new commands OVF for
   overflow errors and RST/RSR for host status testing.

   102 sets fixed lengths for ERR, ECO, and ERP control commands.  RST
   and RSR are adopted.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/C.6%20Interrupt"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C.6" id="appendix-C.6">C.6</a> Interrupt</span>

   NWG/RFC #s: 46, 48, 49, 50, 54, 102

   The interrupt system call and the INT control commands are used to
   interrupt a process.  This is actually a third level issue.  The
   NWG/RFCs leading up to the decision to include INR and INS in the
   official protocol are summarized below.

   In particular:

   46 introduces the INT command as a method for interrupting a process.

   48 recommends adoption of INT with the restriction that the feature
   should not be used during communication with systems which scan for
   interrupts and that INT should not be used on non-console type
   connections (see D.2).

   49 expands on the explanation of INT. 50 concurs with proposal 46,
   that INT is useful.

   54 induces INT, INS control commands in the official protocol as an
   escape mechanism, where interpretation is a local matter.

   102 discusses synchronization of interrupt signals, presents two
   implementation schemes, and relegates the topic to third level
   protocol.  INS should be used to indicate a special code in the input
   stream.

   NWG/RFC #s: 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50

   The notion of dynamic reconnection was introduced early in the
   Host/Host protocol design.  However, the consensus was that it
   introduced complexities with which the initial NCP implementations



<span class="grey">Karp                                                           [Page 11]</span></pre>

   did not want to cope.  The need for dynamic reconnection was
   questioned; NWG/RFC 48 explains why it was included and considered
   useful.

   In particular:

   33 introduces the concept of switching connections to the Logger. 36
   presents a scheme for dynamic reconnection, i.e., reconnection can
   take place after the flow is started.

   37 presents two methods suggested by BBN for handling reconnection.

   38 discusses changes to proposed END and RDY control commands that
   would be necessary if connections were multiplexed over links.

   39 states that dynamic reconnection is too complex.

   44 presents two cases where reconnection could be used, suggests that
   the cases be separated, and recommends implementation of only the
   case of a simple connection switch within the same Host.

   46 recommends that dynamic reconnection be reserved for further
   Host/Host protocol implementations.

   48 discusses the aesthetics of dynamic reconnection in detail but
   concedes that it won't be included in the initial protocol. 49 and 50
   concur with the decision.

   NWG/RFC #s: 37, 38, 44, 48

   A connection is an extension of a link.  The NWG/RFCs in this
   category discuss this relationship.

   In particular:

   37 presents the pros and cons on decoupling connections and links. 38
   recommends that connections be multiplexed over links.  Two cases
   where this would be useful are presented.  The effect on the proposed
   protocol is discussed.  Both 37 and 38 suggest the inclusion of the
   destination socket as part of the text of the message and recommend
   that messages should be send over any unblocked link.

   44 suggests the use of link numbers in control commands (except RFSs)
   due to the 1 to 1 correspondence between links and foreign socket
   numbers.

   In particular:

   33 proposes that the logger listen to calls on socket #0.  It then
   switches to the assigned socket.  The sequence of events is
   illustrated.

   46 proposes a User Control and Communication (UCC) module, which
   implements logger protocol and permits the logger to interact with
   the NCP.  It proposes the use of two full-duplex pseudo-typewriter
   connections.

   48 proposes that sockets &lt;U, H, 0&gt; and &lt;U, H, 1&gt; designate either the
   input and output sockets of a copy of the logger or the console
   sockets.

   49 is a write-up of a combination of the proposals presented in 46
   and 48. 49 presents the disadvantages of the new proposal and reverts
   back to supporting the UCC of 46.

   50 indicates RAND support for the UCC presented in 46.

   56 defines a send-logger and a receive-logger with a full-duplex
   connection.  The logger handles one request at a time; requests are
   queued.  The receiver logger is identified as user 0 on socket 0.

   66 introduces a dial-up protocol (Initial Connection Protocol, ICP)
   to get a process at one site in contact with the logger at another
   site.

   74 documents the logger implemented at UCSB.

   77 and 82 report the discussion of logger protocol at the FJCC 1970
   Network meeting.  E.  Harslem and E. Meyer agreed to write proposals.

   79 discusses a conflict between Document No. 1 and NWG/RFC 66
   regarding the use of ALL prior to connection establishment.

   80 presents a variation of 66 that rectifies the conflict. 80 also
   suggests that ICP should apply to more than just the logger i.e., let
   user 0 signify the logger.

   88 documents the logger implemented as part of NETRJS, which allows
   access to RJS at UCLA's CCN.  The ICP described in 66 and 80 is
   adhered to.  The logger is designated as user 0.

   91 contains a description of the logger for the PDP-10 at Harvard.

   93 points out an ambiguity in the Host/Host protocol of Document No.
   1 regarding the requirement of message data type for ICP.  The

               97, 98

   Console protocol will specify conventions for what goes out over the
   network.  Included are conventions for echoing, character set,
   interrupt or break, end of line, message formats.

   In particular:

   20 suggests a standard of 7-bit ASCII in an 8-bit byte, with the high
   order bit 0.

   44 discusses three possibilities for echoing over the network
   (echoing, no echoing, optional echoing) and states a preference for
   no echoing. 44 also states a preference for establishing a network
   common code where all code conversion is performed on outgoing text;
   thus, all incoming text would be in the common code.

   46 proposes the use of interrupt on the third level.  An interrupt
   means "quit" when sent from a requestor process to a created process.
   The command level is entered.

   48 and 49 relegate issues of echoing and code conversion to third
   level protocol.

   50 and 56 support adoption of ASCII for the network standard
   character set. 56 also discusses two uses of break characters
   (interrupt): in a panic situation and to exit from subsystem.  Three
   message formats (character by character, end by carriage return,
   several command lines per message) are discussed.  A recommendation
   that echoing be handled locally is made.

   66 specifies that the standard console use 7-bit ASCII in 8 bits with
   the 8th bit on (note the conflict with 20).  It also specifies the
   use of INR for break or interrupt.

   74 documents console protocol implemented by UCSB.

   TELNET is a subsystem permitting a teletype-like terminal at a remote
   Host for function as a teletype at the serving Host.  TELNET protocol
   specifies user level interface to the network by way of network
   system calls.

   In particular:

   15 introduces the TELNET concept and presents a sample dialogue
   between Utah's PDP-10 and SRI's 940.  System primitives are proposed.

   33 describes TELNET and gives essentially the same example as in 15.

   76 describes a terminal user control language for Illinois's PDP-11
   ARPA Network Terminal System.  The protocol defined permits the user
   to utilize the network at a symbolic level.

   80 and 83 introduce the concept of a Protocol Manager that can manage
   protocol sequences between consoles and the network.  The Form
   Machine (see D.4) can be used for translations.

   NWG/RFC #s: 5, 31, 42, 51, 63, 80, 83, 96

   NIL, DEL, and Form Machines are proposals of similar methods for
   adapting user programs and/or data to the network.  A committee
   chaired by J. Heafner has been formed to plan, implement, and
   exercise a language for reconfiguring data streams.

   In particular:

   NIL (Network Interchange Language), described in 51, introduces the
   concept of an abstract network machine which would permit a user to
   consider the computer network as an overall computing facility.  All
   dialogue would take place between hosts and the network machine.  NIL
   permits the description of the environment and the description of the
   Front End of an interactive system.  Sublanguages for describing
   control, operation, data declaration, and environment are used.  With
   NIL, the network machine can operate in standard mode as well as
   user-defined extended mode.  The network machine can act as a user of
   a Host; conversely, a Host can be a user of a network machine.  Each
   Host will have a generator to generate a translator from the
   descriptive sublanguage inputs.

   DEL (Decode - Encode Language), described in 5, utilizes a front end
   translator at the using site to translate the using site characters
   to the server host character set.  Return messages are subsequently
   translated locally to the local standard.  Immediate feedback in an
   interactive mode is also handled locally.  DEL can be used for the
   operation of large display-oriented systems.  Provisions are given
   for representing a universal hardware.  The syntax is included.

   Two proposals for the Form Machine have been given. 80 introduces the
   concept of the Form Machine, an experimental software package
   operating on regular expressions that describe data formats. 83
   presents a different approach: a syntax-driven interpreter which
   operates on a grammar which is an _ordered_ set of replacement rules.
   83 contains a description of the Form Machine with some examples of
   replacement rules for particular data types.  Application of the
   Form-Machine to program protocols is also discussed.

   31 proposes a message description language as a standard symbolic
   method for defining and describing binary messages.  In the future,
   the descriptive language could be used as input to generators of data
   translation programs.

   42 proposes the use of message data types prior to the development of
   network languages specifying the syntax and semantics of messages.

   Programs would extract the message data type and transform the data
   accordingly.  Both standard and local types would be handled (as in
   RFC #51), probably using tables stored at one location such as NIC.

   96 includes a discussion on a Front End for NLS (T) and suggests that
   further study be given to standard languages as presented in 51.

   Positions that no special structures should be imposed on data
   transmission are presented in 49 and 91. 50 and 58 disagree. 58
   claims that logical and physical message distinctions exist and that
   logical messages must begin on a physical message boundary.

   63 reports a decision from a meeting that records may begin anywhere
   in a message.  In a later meeting, 77 and 82, the issue was reopened.
   Discussion included consideration of methods of indicating the end of
   message and alternatives were given.  Earlier RFCs had discussed
   these alternatives: 13 proposes a 0 length message to specify EOF; 50
   proposes use of a bit count preceding the transmission and discusses
   solutions to the problem of dropping bits.

   77 and 82 discuss the formation of a working group to specify
   procedures for using graphics over the network.

   80 states that graphics oriented descriptions will added to the Form
   Machine.

   86 is a proposal for a network standard format for a data stream to
   control graphics displays. 87 announces a network graphics meeting to
   be hosted by MIT and suggests discussion topics.  Both 86 and 87 are
   attempts to stimulate some interest in the generation of graphics
   protocol proposals.

   29 responds to 28, stating that a millisecond clock should be
   sufficient.

   32 discusses the desirability of adding a network clock for
   measurement of user-oriented message delays.  A one millisecond
   resolution is a reasonable specification.  The problems of clock
   synchronization and long term accuracy are addressed.

   34 describes the SRI ARC clock on the XDS 940.
