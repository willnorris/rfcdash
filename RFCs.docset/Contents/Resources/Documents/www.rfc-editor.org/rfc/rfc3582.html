Abstract

   This document outlines a set of goals for proposed new IPv6 site-
   multihoming architectures.  It is recognised that this set of goals
   is ambitious and that some goals may conflict with others.  The
   solution or solutions adopted may only be able to satisfy some of the
   goals presented here.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Site-multihoming, i.e., connecting to more than one IP service
   provider, is an essential component of service for many sites which
   are part of the Internet.

   Current IPv4 site-multihoming practices have been added on to the
   CIDR architecture [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Classless Inter- Domain Routing (CIDR): an Address Assignment and Aggregation Strategy"'>1</a>], which assumes that routing table entries can
   be aggregated based upon a hierarchy of customers and service
   providers.

   However, it appears that this hierarchy is being supplanted by a
   dense mesh of interconnections [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Commentary on Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet"'>6</a>].  Additionally, there has been an
   enormous growth in the number of multihomed sites.  For purposes of
   redundancy and load-sharing, the multihomed address blocks are
   introduced into the global table even if they are covered by a
   provider aggregate.  This contributes to the rapidly-increasing size
   of both the global routing table and the turbulence exhibited within
   it, and places stress on the inter-provider routing system.

   Continued growth of both the Internet and the practice of site-
   multihoming will seriously exacerbate this stress.  The site-
   multihoming architecture for IPv6 should allow the routing system to
   scale more pleasantly.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   A "site" is an entity autonomously operating a network using IP, and
   in particular, determining the addressing plan and routing policy for
   that network.  This definition is intended to be equivalent to
   "enterprise" as defined in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>2</a>].

   A "transit provider" operates a site that directly provides
   connectivity to the Internet to one or more external sites.  The
   connectivity provided extends beyond the transit provider's own site.
   A transit provider's site is directly connected to the sites for
   which it provides transit.

   A "multihomed" site is one with more than one transit provider.
   "Site-multihoming" is the practice of arranging a site to be
   multihomed.

   The term "re-homing" denotes a transition of a site between two
   states of connectedness due to a change in the connectivity between
   the site and its transit providers' sites.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Multihoming%20Goals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Multihoming Goals</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Capabilities%20of%20IPv4%20Multihoming"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Capabilities of IPv4 Multihoming</span>

   The following capabilities of current IPv4 multihoming practices
   should be supported by an IPv6 multihoming architecture.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.1.%20%20Redundancy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" id="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Redundancy</span>

   By multihoming, a site should be able to insulate itself from certain
   failure modes within one or more transit providers, as well as
   failures in the network providing interconnection among one or more
   transit providers.

   Infrastructural commonalities below the IP layer may result in
   connectivity which is apparently diverse, sharing single points of
   failure.  For example, two separate DS3 circuits ordered from
   different suppliers and connecting a site to independent transit
   providers may share a single conduit from the street into a building;
   in this case, physical disruption (sometimes referred to as
   "backhoe-fade") of both circuits may be experienced due to a single
   incident in the street.  The two circuits are said to "share fate".

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3582">RFC 3582</a>              IPv6 Site-Multihoming Goals            August 2003</span>


   The multihoming architecture should accommodate (in the general case,
   issues of shared fate notwithstanding) continuity of connectivity
   during the following failures:

   o  Physical failure, such as a fiber cut, or router failure,

   o  Logical link failure, such as a misbehaving router interface,

   o  Routing protocol failure, such as a BGP peer reset,

   o  Transit provider failure, such as a backbone-wide IGP failure, and

   o  Exchange failure, such as a BGP reset on an inter-provider
      peering.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.2.%20%20Load%20Sharing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2" id="section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Load Sharing</span>

   By multihoming, a site should be able to distribute both inbound and
   outbound traffic between multiple transit providers.  This goal is
   for concurrent use of the multiple transit providers, not just the
   usage of one provider over one interval of time and another provider
   over a different interval.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.3.%20%20Performance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.3" id="section-3.1.3">3.1.3</a>.  Performance</span>

   By multihoming, a site should be able to protect itself from
   performance difficulties directly between the site's transit
   providers.

   For example, suppose site E obtains transit from transit providers T1
   and T2, and there is long-term congestion between T1 and T2.  The
   multihoming architecture should allow E to ensure that in normal
   operation, none of its traffic is carried over the congested
   interconnection T1-T2.  The process by which this is achieved should
   be a manual one.

   A multihomed site should be able to distribute inbound traffic from
   particular multiple transit providers according to the particular
   address range within their site which is sourcing or sinking the
   traffic.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3582">RFC 3582</a>              IPv6 Site-Multihoming Goals            August 2003</span>


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.4.%20%20Policy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.4" id="section-3.1.4">3.1.4</a>.  Policy</span>

   A customer may choose to multihome for a variety of policy reasons
   beyond technical scope (e.g., cost, acceptable use conditions, etc.)
   For example, customer C homed to ISP A may wish to shift traffic of a
   certain class or application, NNTP, for example, to ISP B as matter
   of policy.  A new IPv6 multihoming proposal should provide support
   for site-multihoming for external policy reasons.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.5.%20%20Simplicity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.5" id="section-3.1.5">3.1.5</a>.  Simplicity</span>

   As any proposed multihoming solution must be deployed in real
   networks with real customers, simplicity is paramount.  The current
   multihoming solution is quite straightforward to deploy and maintain.

   A new IPv6 multihoming solution should not be substantially more
   complex to deploy and operate (for multihomed sites or for the rest
   of the Internet) than current IPv4 multihoming practices.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.6.%20%20Transport-Layer%20Survivability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.6" id="section-3.1.6">3.1.6</a>.  Transport-Layer Survivability</span>

   Multihoming solutions should provide re-homing transparency for
   transport-layer sessions; i.e., exchange of data between devices on
   the multihomed site and devices elsewhere on the Internet may proceed
   with no greater interruption than that associated with the transient
   packet loss during the re-homing event.

   New transport-layer sessions should be able to be created following a
   re-homing event.

   Transport-layer sessions include those involving transport-layer
   protocols such as TCP, UDP and SCTP over IP.  Applications which
   communicate over raw IP and other network-layer protocols may also
   enjoy re-homing transparency.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.7.%20%20Impact%20on%20DNS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.7" id="section-3.1.7">3.1.7</a>.  Impact on DNS</span>

   Multi-homing solutions either should be compatible with the observed
   dynamics of the current DNS system, or the solutions should
   demonstrate that the modified name resolution system required to
   support them is readily deployable.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.8.%20%20Packet%20Filtering"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.8" id="section-3.1.8">3.1.8</a>.  Packet Filtering</span>

   Multihoming solutions should not preclude filtering packets with
   forged or otherwise inappropriate source IP addresses at the
   administrative boundary of the multihomed site, or at the
   administrative boundaries of any site in the Internet.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3582">RFC 3582</a>              IPv6 Site-Multihoming Goals            August 2003</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Additional%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Additional Requirements</span>

   Current IPV4 multihoming practices contribute to the significant
   growth currently observed in the state held in the global inter-
   provider routing system; this is a concern, both because of the
   hardware requirements it imposes, and also because of the impact on
   the stability of the routing system.  This issue is discussed in
   great detail in [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Commentary on Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet"'>6</a>].

   A new IPv6 multihoming architecture should scale to accommodate
   orders of magnitude more multihomed sites without imposing
   unreasonable requirements on the routing system.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.2.%20%20Impact%20on%20Routers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.2" id="section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  Impact on Routers</span>

   The solutions may require changes to IPv6 router implementations, but
   these changes should be either minor, or in the form of logically
   separate functions added to existing functions.

   Such changes should not prevent normal single-homed operation, and
   routers implementing these changes should be able to interoperate
   fully with hosts and routers not implementing them.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.3.%20%20Impact%20on%20Hosts"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.3" id="section-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>.  Impact on Hosts</span>

   The solution should not destroy IPv6 connectivity for a legacy host
   implementing <a href="./rfc3513">RFC 3513</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture"'>3</a>], <a href="./rfc2460">RFC 2460</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>4</a>], <a href="./rfc3493">RFC 3493</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6"'>5</a>], and other
   basic IPv6 specifications current in April 2003.  That is to say, if
   a host can work in a single-homed site, it should still be able to
   work in a multihomed site, even if it cannot benefit from site-
   multihoming.

   It would be compatible with this goal for such a host to lose
   connectivity if a site lost connectivity to one transit provider,
   despite the fact that other transit provider connections were still
   operational.

   If the solution requires changes to the host stack, these changes
   should be either minor, or in the form of logically separate
   functions added to existing functions.

   If the solution requires changes to the socket API and/or the
   transport layer, it should be possible to retain the original socket
   API and transport protocols in parallel, even if they cannot benefit
   from multihoming.

   The multihoming solution may allow host or application changes if
   that would enhance transport-layer survivability.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.4.%20%20Interaction%20between%20Hosts%20and%20the%20Routing%20System"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.4" id="section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  Interaction between Hosts and the Routing System</span>

   The solution may involve interaction between a site's hosts and its
   routing system; such an interaction should be simple, scalable and
   securable.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.5.%20%20Operations%20and%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.5" id="section-3.2.5">3.2.5</a>.  Operations and Management</span>

   It should be possible for staff responsible for the operation of a
   site to monitor and configure the site's multihoming system.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.6.%20%20Cooperation%20between%20Transit%20Providers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.6" id="section-3.2.6">3.2.6</a>.  Cooperation between Transit Providers</span>

   A multihoming strategy may require cooperation between a site and its
   transit providers, but should not require cooperation (relating
   specifically to the multihomed site) directly between the transit
   providers.

   The impact of any inter-site cooperation that might be required to
   facilitate the multihoming solution should be examined and assessed
   from the point of view of operational practicality.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.7.%20%20Multiple%20Solutions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.7" id="section-3.2.7">3.2.7</a>.  Multiple Solutions</span>

   There may be more than one approach to multihoming, provided all
   approaches are orthogonal (i.e., each approach addresses a distinct
   segment or category within the site multihoming problem).  Multiple
   solutions will incur a greater management overhead, however, and the
   adopted solutions should attempt to cover as many multihoming
   scenarios and goals as possible.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   A multihomed site should not be more vulnerable to security breaches
   than a traditionally IPv4-multihomed site.

   Any changes to routing practices made to accommodate multihomed sites
   should not cause non-multihomed sites to become more vulnerable to
   security breaches.
