              <span class="h1">Coordination of Equipment and Supplies Purchase</span>
              <span class="h1">-----------------------------------------------</span>

        The purpose of this message is to pass on to all members of the
   Network an agreement reached between Messrs. Steve Crocker of ARPA and
   R. F. Borelli of the University of Illinois.  The Center for Advanced
   Computation has agreed to study the feasibility of a coordinating point
   for purchases of equipment and supplies to be used on the network.

        To this end, the Center will compile a list of common equipment and
   supplies needed by Network members and ascertain the value of contacting
   the appropriate manufacturers and distributers in order to negotiate the
   best possible group price.  Thereafter, the results of the negotiations
   will be passed on to Network members with a resulting listing of items,
   costs and supplies.

        The two biggest pitfalls with this concept are:
             1.  Insufficient demand for commonly required items.
             2.  Not satisfying each organization's administrative
                 requirements for competitive bidding on items
                 which are not sole-source justified.

        At this time, it appears to be premature to allow this to stop the
   idea.  After the listing of items and range of sources are collected and
   analyzed, these two points can be addressed.  In fact, this project may
   have to be abandoned; however, there are sufficient reasons to believe
   that these problems can be overcome to make the venture workable.

       We request that all members of the Network forward to the Center,
   ATTN. R. F. Borelli, a descriptive listing of equipment and supplies
   they require in this fiscal year.  Particular attention must be paid to
   listing all the acceptable alternates to increase the changes of
   commonality.  For example: TI-725 terminals could be considered a
   substitute for Teleterms 1030's, etc.  The only items excluded at this
   time are 2400 ft. Magnetic Computer Tapes, tabulating cards, and
   conventional computer printer paper.  Any added suggestions or ideas are
   both encouraged and welcomed.

        A sample format of information is attached.
