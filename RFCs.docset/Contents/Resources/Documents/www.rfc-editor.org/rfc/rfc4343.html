<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global hierarchical replicated
   distributed database system for Internet addressing, mail proxy, and
   other information.  Each node in the DNS tree has a name consisting
   of zero or more labels [STD13, <a href="./rfc1591">RFC1591</a>, <a href="./rfc2606">RFC2606</a>] that are treated in
   a case insensitive fashion.  This document clarifies the meaning of
   "case insensitive" for the DNS.  This clarification updates RFCs
   1034, 1035 [<a href="#ref-STD13" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>STD13</a>], and [<a href="./rfc2181" title='"Clarifications to the DNS Specification"'>RFC2181</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Case%20Insensitivity%20of%20DNS%20Labels"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Case Insensitivity of DNS Labels</span>

   DNS was specified in the era of [<a href="#ref-ASCII" title='"USA Standard Code for Information Interchange"'>ASCII</a>].  DNS names were expected to
   look like most host names or Internet email address right halves (the
   part after the at-sign, "@") or to be numeric, as in the in-addr.arpa
   part of the DNS name space.  For example,

       foo.example.net.
       aol.com.
       www.gnu.ai.mit.edu.
   or  69.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.

   Case-varied alternatives to the above [<a href="./rfc3092" title='"Etymology of "'>RFC3092</a>] would be DNS names
   like

       Foo.ExamplE.net.
       AOL.COM.
       WWW.gnu.AI.mit.EDU.
   or  69.2.0.192.in-ADDR.ARPA.

   However, the individual octets of which DNS names consist are not
   limited to valid ASCII character codes.  They are 8-bit bytes, and
   all values are allowed.  Many applications, however, interpret them
   as ASCII characters.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Escaping%20Unusual%20DNS%20Label%20Octets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Escaping Unusual DNS Label Octets</span>

   In Master Files [<a href="#ref-STD13" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>STD13</a>] and other human-readable and -writable ASCII
   contexts, an escape is needed for the byte value for period (0x2E,
   ".") and all octet values outside of the inclusive range from 0x21
   ("!") to 0x7E ("~").  That is to say, 0x2E and all octet values in
   the two inclusive ranges from 0x00 to 0x20 and from 0x7F to 0xFF.

   One typographic convention for octets that do not correspond to an
   ASCII printing graphic is to use a back-slash followed by the value
   of the octet as an unsigned integer represented by exactly three
   decimal digits.

   The same convention can be used for printing ASCII characters so that
   they will be treated as a normal label character.  This includes the
   back-slash character used in this convention itself, which can be
   expressed as \092 or \\, and the special label separator period
   ("."), which can be expressed as and \046 or \.  It is advisable to
   avoid using a backslash to quote an immediately following non-
   printing ASCII character code to avoid implementation difficulties.

   A back-slash followed by only one or two decimal digits is undefined.
   A back-slash followed by four decimal digits produces two octets, the
   first octet having the value of the first three digits considered as
   a decimal number, and the second octet being the character code for
   the fourth decimal digit.

   The first example below shows embedded spaces and a period (".")
   within a label.  The second one shows a 5-octet label where the
   second octet has all bits zero, the third is a backslash, and the
   fourth octet has all bits one.

   and   a\000\\\255z.example.

   According to the original DNS design decision, comparisons on name
   lookup for DNS queries should be case insensitive [<a href="#ref-STD13" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>STD13</a>].  That is
   to say, a lookup string octet with a value in the inclusive range
   from 0x41 to 0x5A, the uppercase ASCII letters, MUST match the
   identical value and also match the corresponding value in the
   inclusive range from 0x61 to 0x7A, the lowercase ASCII letters.  A
   lookup string octet with a lowercase ASCII letter value MUST
   similarly match the identical value and also match the corresponding
   value in the uppercase ASCII letter range.

   (Historical note: The terms "uppercase" and "lowercase" were invented
   after movable type.  The terms originally referred to the two font
   trays for storing, in partitioned areas, the different physical type
   elements.  Before movable type, the nearest equivalent terms were
   "majuscule" and "minuscule".)

   One way to implement this rule would be to subtract 0x20 from all
   octets in the inclusive range from 0x61 to 0x7A before comparing
   octets.  Such an operation is commonly known as "case folding", but
   implementation via case folding is not required.  Note that the DNS
   case insensitivity does NOT correspond to the case folding specified
   in [<a href="#ref-ISO-8859-1" title="Standard for Character Encodings">ISO-8859-1</a>] or [<a href="#ref-ISO-8859-2" title="Standard for Character Encodings">ISO-8859-2</a>].  For example, the octets 0xDD (\221)
   and 0xFD (\253) do NOT match, although in other contexts, where they
   are interpreted as the upper- and lower-case version of "Y" with an
   acute accent, they might.

   DNS labels in wire-encoded names have a type associated with them.
   The original DNS standard [<a href="#ref-STD13" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>STD13</a>] had only two types: ASCII labels,
   with a length from zero to 63 octets, and indirect (or compression)
   labels, which consist of an offset pointer to a name location
   elsewhere in the wire encoding on a DNS message.  (The ASCII label of
   length zero is reserved for use as the name of the root node of the
   name tree.)  ASCII labels follow the ASCII case conventions described
   herein and, as stated above, can actually contain arbitrary byte
   values.  Indirect labels are, in effect, replaced by the name to
   which they point, which is then treated with the case insensitivity
   rules in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Extended%20Label%20Type%20Case%20Insensitivity%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Extended Label Type Case Insensitivity Considerations</span>

   DNS was extended by [<a href="./rfc2671" title='"Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)"'>RFC2671</a>] so that additional label type numbers
   would be available.  (The only such type defined so far is the BINARY
   type [<a href="./rfc2673" title='"Binary Labels in the Domain Name System"'>RFC2673</a>], which is now Experimental [<a href="./rfc3363" title='"Representing Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) Addresses in the Domain Name System (DNS)"'>RFC3363</a>].)

   The ASCII case insensitivity conventions only apply to ASCII labels;
   that is to say, label type 0x0, whether appearing directly or invoked
   by indirect labels.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20CLASS%20Case%20Insensitivity%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  CLASS Case Insensitivity Considerations</span>

   As described in [<a href="#ref-STD13" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>STD13</a>] and [<a href="./rfc2929" title='"Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations"'>RFC2929</a>], DNS has an additional axis for
   data location called CLASS.  The only CLASS in global use at this
   time is the "IN" (Internet) CLASS.

   The handling of DNS label case is not CLASS dependent.  With the
   original design of DNS, it was intended that a recursive DNS resolver
   be able to handle new CLASSes that were unknown at the time of its
   implementation.  This requires uniform handling of label case
   insensitivity.  Should it become desirable, for example, to allocate
   a CLASS with "case sensitive ASCII labels", it would be necessary to
   allocate a new label type for these labels.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Case%20on%20Input%20and%20Output"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Case on Input and Output</span>

   While ASCII label comparisons are case insensitive, [<a href="#ref-STD13" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>STD13</a>] says case
   MUST be preserved on output and preserved when convenient on input.
   However, this means less than it would appear, since the preservation
   of case on output is NOT required when output is optimized by the use
   of indirect labels, as explained below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20DNS%20Output%20Case%20Preservation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  DNS Output Case Preservation</span>

   [<a id="ref-STD13">STD13</a>] views the DNS namespace as a node tree.  ASCII output is as
   if a name were marshaled by taking the label on the node whose name
   is to be output, converting it to a typographically encoded ASCII
   string, walking up the tree outputting each label encountered, and
   preceding all labels but the first with a period (".").  Wire output
   follows the same sequence, but each label is wire encoded, and no
   periods are inserted.  No "case conversion" or "case folding" is done
   during such output operations, thus "preserving" case.  However, to
   optimize output, indirect labels may be used to point to names
   elsewhere in the DNS answer.  In determining whether the name to be
   pointed to (for example, the QNAME) is the "same" as the remainder of
   the name being optimized, the case insensitive comparison specified
   above is done.  Thus, such optimization may easily destroy the output
   preservation of case.  This type of optimization is commonly called
   "name compression".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20DNS%20Input%20Case%20Preservation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  DNS Input Case Preservation</span>

   Originally, DNS data came from an ASCII Master File as defined in
   [<a href="#ref-STD13" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>STD13</a>] or a zone transfer.  DNS Dynamic update and incremental zone
   transfers [<a href="./rfc1995" title='"Incremental Zone Transfer in DNS"'>RFC1995</a>] have been added as a source of DNS data [RFC2136,
   <a href="./rfc3007">RFC3007</a>].  When a node in the DNS name tree is created by any of such
   inputs, no case conversion is done.  Thus, the case of ASCII labels
   is preserved if they are for nodes being created.  However, when a
   name label is input for a node that already exists in DNS data being
   held, the situation is more complex.  Implementations are free to
   retain the case first loaded for such a label, to allow new input to
   override the old case, or even to maintain separate copies preserving
   the input case.

   For example, if data with owner name "foo.bar.example" [<a href="./rfc3092" title='"Etymology of "'>RFC3092</a>] is
   loaded and then later data with owner name "xyz.BAR.example" is
   input, the name of the label on the "bar.example" node (i.e., "bar")
   might or might not be changed to "BAR" in the DNS stored data.  Thus,
   later retrieval of data stored under "xyz.bar.example" in this case
   can use "xyz.BAR.example" in all returned data, use "xyz.bar.example"
   in all returned data, or even, when more than one RR is being
   returned, use a mixture of these two capitalizations.  This last case



<span class="grey">Eastlake 3rd                Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4343">RFC 4343</a>          DNS Case Insensitivity Clarification      January 2006</span>


   is unlikely, as optimization of answer length through indirect labels
   tends to cause only one copy of the name tail ("bar.example" or
   "BAR.example") to be used for all returned RRs.  Note that none of
   this has any effect on the number or completeness of the RR set
   returned, only on the case of the names in the RR set returned.

   The same considerations apply when inputting multiple data records
   with owner names differing only in case.  For example, if an "A"
   record is the first resource record stored under owner name
   "xyz.BAR.example" and then a second "A" record is stored under
   "XYZ.BAR.example", the second MAY be stored with the first (lower
   case initial label) name, the second MAY override the first so that
   only an uppercase initial label is retained, or both capitalizations
   MAY be kept in the DNS stored data.  In any case, a retrieval with
   either capitalization will retrieve all RRs with either
   capitalization.

   Note that the order of insertion into a server database of the DNS
   name tree nodes that appear in a Master File is not defined so that
   the results of inconsistent capitalization in a Master File are
   unpredictable output capitalization.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Internationalized%20Domain%20Names"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Internationalized Domain Names</span>

   A scheme has been adopted for "internationalized domain names" and
   "internationalized labels" as described in [RFC3490, <a href="./rfc3454">RFC3454</a>,
   <a href="./rfc3491">RFC3491</a>, and <a href="./rfc3492">RFC3492</a>].  It makes most of [<a href="#ref-UNICODE" title='"The Unicode Standard"'>UNICODE</a>] available through
   a separate application level transformation from internationalized
   domain name to DNS domain name and from DNS domain name to
   internationalized domain name.  Any case insensitivity that
   internationalized domain names and labels have varies depending on
   the script and is handled entirely as part of the transformation
   described in [<a href="./rfc3454" title='"Preparation of Internationalized Strings ("'>RFC3454</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3491" title='"Nameprep: A Stringprep Profile for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)"'>RFC3491</a>], which should be seen for
   further details.  This is not a part of the DNS as standardized in
   STD 13.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The equivalence of certain DNS label types with case differences, as
   clarified in this document, can lead to security problems.  For
   example, a user could be confused by believing that two domain names
   differing only in case were actually different names.

   Furthermore, a domain name may be used in contexts other than the
   DNS.  It could be used as a case sensitive index into some database
   or file system.  Or it could be interpreted as binary data by some
   integrity or authentication code system.  These problems can usually
   be handled by using a standardized or "canonical" form of the DNS



<span class="grey">Eastlake 3rd                Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-7"></span>

   ASCII type labels; that is, always mapping the ASCII letter value
   octets in ASCII labels to some specific pre-chosen case, either
   uppercase or lower case.  An example of a canonical form for domain
   names (and also a canonical ordering for them) appears in <a href="./rfc4034#section-6">Section 6
   of [RFC4034]</a>.  See also [<a href="./rfc3597" title='"Handling of Unknown DNS Resource Record (RR) Types"'>RFC3597</a>].

   Finally, a non-DNS name may be stored into DNS with the false
   expectation that case will always be preserved.  For example,
   although this would be quite rare, on a system with case sensitive
   email address local parts, an attempt to store two Responsible Person
   (RP) [<a href="./rfc1183" title='"New DNS RR Definitions"'>RFC1183</a>] records that differed only in case would probably
   produce unexpected results that might have security implications.
   That is because the entire email address, including the possibly case
   sensitive local or left-hand part, is encoded into a DNS name in a
   readable fashion where the case of some letters might be changed on
   output as described above.
