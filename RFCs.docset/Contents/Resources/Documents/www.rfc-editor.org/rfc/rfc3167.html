Abstract

   <a href="./rfc1745">RFC 1745</a>, "BGP4/IDRP for IP---OSPF Interaction", describes technology
   which was never deployed in the public internet.  This document
   requests that <a href="./rfc1745">RFC 1745</a> be moved to Historic status.

   During a review of internet standards relating to BGP, it became
   apparent that BGP/IDRP OSPF interaction, as described in <a href="./rfc1745">RFC 1745</a>,
   has never been deployed in the public internet, and would require
   significant implementation complexity.  Since this mechanism has
   never been in use in the public internet, it is proposed to
   reclassify it to Historic.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   Moving <a href="./rfc1745">RFC 1745</a> to Historic has no known effect on the security of
   the internet.
