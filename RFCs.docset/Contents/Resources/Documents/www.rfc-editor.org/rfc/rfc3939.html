Abstract

   This document describes a method for identifying the originating
   calling party in the headers of a stored voice mail message.  Two new
   header fields are defined for this purpose: Caller_ID and
   Called_Name.  Caller_id is used to store sufficient information for
   the recipient to callback, or reply to, the sender of the message.
   Caller-name provides the name of the person sending the message.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   There is currently a need for a mechanism to identify the originating
   party of a voice mail message, outside of the "FROM" header
   information.  The telephone number and name of the caller are
   typically available from the telephone network, but there is no
   obvious header field to store this in an Internet Mail message.

   This information is intended for use when the VPIM message format is
   used for storing "Call Answer" voice messages in an Internet Mail
   message store, i.e., the calling party leaves a voice message for the
   recipient, who was unable to answer the call.  The implication is
   that there is no <a href="./rfc2822">RFC 2822</a> address known for the originator.

   [<a id="ref-VPIMV2R2">VPIMV2R2</a>] suggests the originating number be included as an Internet
   address, using the first method shown below.  There are several other
   ways to store this information, but they all involve some
   manipulation of the "From" field.  For example:

      1. From: "416 555 1234" &lt;non-mail-user@host&gt;
      2. From: "John Doe" &lt;4165551234@host&gt;
      3. From:  unknown:;

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3939">RFC 3939</a>              Calling Line Identification          December 2004</span>


   Since any of these is a forced translation, it would be useful to
   store the calling party's name and number as presented by the
   telephone system to the called party without manipulation.  This
   would allow the calling party's information to be displayed to the
   recipient (similar to it appearing on the telephone) and also allow
   future determination of an Internet address for the originator (if
   one exists).  Note that there is no requirement to store meta-data
   (e.g., type of number, presentation restricted), as this information
   is not presented to the called party and is generally not available
   to voice mail systems.  The intent is to store the available
   information to an analog (non-ISDN) phone (e.g., per [<a href="#ref-T1.401" title=" or Visual Message-Waiting Indicator Features">T1.401</a>] in
   North America).

   [<a id="ref-RFC2076">RFC2076</a>] currently lists "phone" as an Internet message header which
   would hold the originating party's telephone number, but it is listed
   as "non-standard", i.e., usage of this header is not generally
   recommended.  It also has no defined format, making the information
   unparsable.  There is no similar entry for the originator's name.

   It is proposed that two new message header fields be included to hold
   this information, namely the Calling Line Identification ("Caller-
   ID") and Caller Name ("Caller-Name").

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Conventions%20Used%20in%20this%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Conventions Used in this Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Calling%20Line%20Identification%20Field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Calling Line Identification Field</span>

   The Calling Line Identification header ("Caller-ID") holds sufficient
   information for the recipient's voice mail system to call back, or
   reply to, the sender of the message.  The number that is contained in
   this header is supplied by the telephone system.  The exact format of
   the data received depends on the type of call, that is -- internal or
   external call.

   Note that for both options, the number field MUST contain only the
   digits of the number and MUST be representable using the American
   Standard Code for Information Interchange [<a href="#ref-ASCII" title="ANSI X3.4">ASCII</a>] character set; it
   does not include any separating character (e.g., "-").

   It is expected that default, likely to be the most common case, will
   not have any numbering plan semantic associated with the number.
   However, in the case that it is known, an optional "NumberingPlan"
   parameter MAY be used to indicate the semantic.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3939">RFC 3939</a>              Calling Line Identification          December 2004</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Internal%20Call"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Internal Call</span>

   For an internal call (e.g., between two extensions within the same
   company), it is sufficient to relay only the extension of the calling
   party, based on the company dialing plan.

   However, the support of longer numbers may be supported by the
   enterprise phone system.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20External%20Call"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  External Call</span>

   For an international call, the calling party's number must be the
   full international number as described in [<a href="#ref-E.164">E.164</a>], i.e., Country Code
   (CC), National Destination Code (NDC), and Subscriber Number (SN).
   Other information, such as prefixes or symbols (e.g., "+"), MUST NOT
   be included.  [<a href="#ref-E.164">E.164</a>] allows for numbers of up to 15 digits.

   For a call within North America, it is also suggested that 15 digits
   per [<a href="#ref-T1.625" title=" Telecommunications - Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) _ Calling Line identification Presentation and Restriction Supplementary Services">T1.625</a>] be supported.  However, some service providers may only
   support 10 digits as described in [<a href="#ref-T1.401" title=" or Visual Message-Waiting Indicator Features">T1.401</a>] and [<a href="#ref-GR-31-CORE" title='"CLASS Feature: Calling Number Delivery"'>GR-31-CORE</a>].  Though
   it is desirable that an international number not be truncated to 10
   digits if it contains more, it is recognized that limitations of
   various systems will cause this to happen.

   Implementors of this specification should be aware that some phone
   systems are known to truncate international numbers, even though this
   behavior is undesirable.

   Note that the other defined fields available to non-analog systems
   (e.g., subaddress, redirecting number), as well as the meta-data, are
   not intended to be stored in this header.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Numbering%20Plan"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Numbering Plan</span>

   In this baseline case (i.e., analog lines), no numbering plan
   information is known or implied.  However, in the case that a
   numbering plan is known, an optional "NumberingPlan" parameter MAY be
   used to indicate the semantic.  Only three semantics are defined:
   "unknown", "local", and "e164".  "unknown" is the default if no
   numbering plan semantic is known (and the default if the parameter is
   absent).  "local" has meaning only within the domain of the voice
   mail system that stored the message (i.e., the voice mail system
   knows that the number belongs to a local numbering plan).  "e164"
   indicates that the number is as described in [<a href="#ref-E.164">E.164</a>].  "x-" may be
   used to indicate enterprise or service specific dialing plans.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Date%20Header"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Date Header</span>

   The date and time may be included by the telephone system with the
   calling party's telephone number per [<a href="#ref-T1.401" title=" or Visual Message-Waiting Indicator Features">T1.401</a>].  This MAY be used, as
   there is an existing "Date" Internet header to hold this information.
   It is a local implementation decision whether this time or the local
   system time will be recorded in the "Date" header.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Caller%20Name%20Field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Caller Name Field</span>

   The name of the person sending the message is also important.
   Information about whether the call is internal or external may be
   included if it is available.  This information may not be available
   on international calls.

   Further, the exact format for this field is typically a service
   provider option per [<a href="#ref-T1.641" title=" Telecommunications - Calling Name Identification Presentation">T1.641</a>].  It is possible for the caller's name
   to be sent in one of several character sets depending on the service
   provider signaling transport (e.g., ISDN-UP, SCCP, TCAP).  These
   include:

      1) International Reference Alphabet (IRA), formerly know as
         International Alphabet No.5 or IA5 [<a href="#ref-T.50">T.50</a>]
      2) Latin Alphabet No. 1 [<a href="#ref-8859-1">8859-1</a>]
      3) American National Standard Code for Information Interchange
         [<a href="#ref-ASCII" title="ANSI X3.4">ASCII</a>]
      4) Character Sets for the International Teletex Service [<a href="#ref-T.61">T.61</a>]

   Of these, the IRA and T.61 character sets contain a number of options
   that help specify national and application oriented versions.  If
   there is no agreement between parties to use these options, then the
   7-bit character set in which the graphical characters of IRA, T.61,
   and ASCII are coded exactly the same, will be assumed.  Further, the
   7-bit graphical characters of [<a href="#ref-8859-1">8859-1</a>] are the same as in [<a href="#ref-ASCII" title="ANSI X3.4">ASCII</a>].

   Note that for delivery to customer equipment in North America, the
   calling name MUST be presented in ASCII per [<a href="#ref-T1.401" title=" or Visual Message-Waiting Indicator Features">T1.401</a>].

   As a result, for the caller name header defined in this document,
   characters are represented with ASCII characters.  However, if a name
   is received that cannot be represented in 7-bit ASCII, it MAY be
   stored using its native character set as defined in [<a href="./rfc2047" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text "'>RFC2047</a>].

   In telephone networks, the length of the name field MUST NOT exceed
   50 characters, as defined in [<a href="#ref-T1.641" title=" Telecommunications - Calling Name Identification Presentation">T1.641</a>].  However, service providers
   may choose to further limit this to 15 characters for delivery to
   customer equipment, e.g., [<a href="#ref-T1.401" title=" or Visual Message-Waiting Indicator Features">T1.401</a>] and [<a href="#ref-GR-1188-CORE" title='"CLASS Feature: Calling Name Delivery Generic Requirements"'>GR-1188-CORE</a>].

   specification using the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) as described
   in [<a href="./rfc2234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC2234</a>].  While the semantics of these headers are defined in

   The intent of these headers are to record telephone number that is
   sent by the analog phone system with an incoming call without
   alteration or interpretation.  If sufficient semantic is known or can
   be inferred, this may be included in the NumberingPlan field.  This
   may allow it to be later translated into an addressable phone number.
   Addressable or dialable phone numbers (which this document does not
   define) are defined in other documents, such as GSTN address
   [<a href="./rfc3191" title='"Minimal GSTN address format in Internet Mail"'>RFC3191</a>] or telephone URL [<a href="./rfc2806" title='"URLs for Telephone Calls"'>RFC2806</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Usage</span>

   There are a few scenarios of how this mechanism may fail that must be
   considered.  The first is mentioned in <a href="#section-3.2">section 3.2</a> - the truncation
   of an international number to 10 digits.  This could result in a
   misinterpretation of the resulting number.  For instance, an
   international number (e.g., from Ireland) of the form "353 91 73
   3307" could be truncated to "53 91 73 3307" if received in North
   America, and interpreted as "539 917 3307" - a seemingly "North
   American" style number.  Thus, the recipient is left with incorrect
   information to reply to the message, possibly with an annoyed callee
   at the North American number.

   The second scenario is the possibility of sending an internal
   extension to an external recipient when a Call Answer message is
   forwarded.  This poses two problems, the recipient is given the wrong
   phone number, and the company's dialing plan could be exposed.

   The final concern deals with exercising character options that are
   available in coding the Calling Name field.  An international system
   may send a message with coding options that are not available on the
   receiving system, thus giving the recipient an incorrect Caller Name.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Note that unlisted and restricted numbers are not a concern as these
   header fields are defined to contain what the called party would see
   (e.g., 'Private Name'), as opposed to the complete details exchanged
   between service providers.

   However, it must also be noted that this mechanism allows the
   explicit indication of phone numbers in the headers of an email
   message (used to store voice messages).  While the rationale for this
   is reviewed in <a href="#section-1">section 1</a>, the recipient of this message may not be
   aware that this information is contained in the headers unless the
   user's client presents the information.  Its use is intended to be
   informative as it is when it appears on a telephone screen.

   This document defines an IANA-administered registration space for
   Caller-ID numbering plans in <a href="#section-5.1">section 5.1</a>.  Each registry entry
   consists of an identifying token and a short textual description of
   the entry.  There are three initial entries in this registry:

      unknown - The number's semantics are unknown.  This value is the
                default in the absence of this parameter.
