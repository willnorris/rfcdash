<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Pervasive%20Monitoring%20Is%20a%20Widespread%20Attack%20on%20Privacy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Pervasive Monitoring Is a Widespread Attack on Privacy</span>

   Pervasive Monitoring (PM) is widespread (and often covert)
   surveillance through intrusive gathering of protocol artefacts,
   including application content, or protocol metadata such as headers.
   Active or passive wiretaps and traffic analysis, (e.g., correlation,
   timing or measuring packet sizes), or subverting the cryptographic
   keys used to secure protocols can also be used as part of pervasive
   monitoring.  PM is distinguished by being indiscriminate and very
   large scale, rather than by introducing new types of technical
   compromise.

   The IETF community's technical assessment is that PM is an attack on
   the privacy of Internet users and organisations.  The IETF community
   has expressed strong agreement that PM is an attack that needs to be
   mitigated where possible, via the design of protocols that make PM
   significantly more expensive or infeasible.  Pervasive monitoring was
   discussed at the technical plenary of the November 2013 IETF meeting
   [<a href="#ref-IETF88Plenary">IETF88Plenary</a>] and then through extensive exchanges on IETF mailing
   lists.  This document records the IETF community's consensus and
   establishes the technical nature of PM.

   The term "attack" is used here in a technical sense that differs
   somewhat from common English usage.  In common English usage, an
   attack is an aggressive action perpetrated by an opponent, intended
   to enforce the opponent's will on the attacked party.  The term is
   used here to refer to behavior that subverts the intent of
   communicating parties without the agreement of those parties.  An
   attack may change the content of the communication, record the
   content or external characteristics of the communication, or through
   correlation with other communication events, reveal information the
   parties did not intend to be revealed.  It may also have other
   effects that similarly subvert the intent of a communicator.
   [<a href="./rfc4949" title='"Internet Security Glossary, Version 2"'>RFC4949</a>] contains a more complete definition for the term "attack".
   We also use the term in the singular here, even though PM in reality
   may consist of a multifaceted set of coordinated attacks.

   In particular, the term "attack", used technically, implies nothing
   about the motivation of the actor mounting the attack.  The
   motivation for PM can range from non-targeted nation-state
   surveillance, to legal but privacy-unfriendly purposes by commercial
   enterprises, to illegal actions by criminals.  The same techniques to
   achieve PM can be used regardless of motivation.  Thus, we cannot
   defend against the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring by
   other actors no matter how benevolent some might consider them to be,
   since the actions required of the attacker are indistinguishable from
   other attacks.  The motivation for PM is, therefore, not relevant for
   how PM is mitigated in IETF protocols.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7258">RFC 7258</a>            Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack           May 2014</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20IETF%20Will%20Work%20to%20Mitigate%20Pervasive%20Monitoring"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The IETF Will Work to Mitigate Pervasive Monitoring</span>

   "Mitigation" is a technical term that does not imply an ability to
   completely prevent or thwart an attack.  Protocols that mitigate PM
   will not prevent the attack but can significantly change the threat.
   (See the diagram on page 24 of <a href="./rfc4949">RFC 4949</a> for how the terms "attack"
   and "threat" are related.)  This can significantly increase the cost
   of attacking, force what was covert to be overt, or make the attack
   more likely to be detected, possibly later.

   IETF standards already provide mechanisms to protect Internet
   communications and there are guidelines [<a href="./rfc3552" title='"Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations"'>RFC3552</a>] for applying these
   in protocol design.  But those standards generally do not address PM,
   the confidentiality of protocol metadata, countering traffic
   analysis, or data minimisation.  In all cases, there will remain some
   privacy-relevant information that is inevitably disclosed by
   protocols.  As technology advances, techniques that were once only
   available to extremely well-funded actors become more widely
   accessible.  Mitigating PM is therefore a protection against a wide
   range of similar attacks.

   It is therefore timely to revisit the security and privacy properties
   of our standards.  The IETF will work to mitigate the technical
   aspects of PM, just as we do for protocol vulnerabilities in general.
   The ways in which IETF protocols mitigate PM will change over time as
   mitigation and attack techniques evolve and so are not described
   here.

   Those developing IETF specifications need to be able to describe how
   they have considered PM, and, if the attack is relevant to the work
   to be published, be able to justify related design decisions.  This
   does not mean a new "pervasive monitoring considerations" section is
   needed in IETF documentation.  It means that, if asked, there needs
   to be a good answer to the question "Is pervasive monitoring relevant
   to this work and if so, how has it been considered?"

   In particular, architectural decisions, including which existing
   technology is reused, may significantly impact the vulnerability of a
   protocol to PM.  Those developing IETF specifications therefore need
   to consider mitigating PM when making architectural decisions.
   Getting adequate, early review of architectural decisions including
   whether appropriate mitigation of PM can be made is important.
   Revisiting these architectural decisions late in the process is very
   costly.

   While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring that might fit the
   definition of PM can be beneficial and not part of any attack, e.g.,
   network management functions monitor packets or flows and anti-spam

   mechanisms need to see mail message content.  Some monitoring can
   even be part of the mitigation for PM, for example, certificate
   transparency [<a href="./rfc6962" title='"Certificate Transparency"'>RFC6962</a>] involves monitoring Public Key Infrastructure
   in ways that could detect some PM attack techniques.  However, there
   is clear potential for monitoring mechanisms to be abused for PM, so
   this tension needs careful consideration in protocol design.  Making
   networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome,
   but ignoring PM would go against the consensus documented here.  An
   appropriate balance will emerge over time as real instances of this
   tension are considered.

   Finally, the IETF, as a standards development organisation, does not
   control the implementation or deployment of our specifications
   (though IETF participants do develop many implementations), nor does
   the IETF standardise all layers of the protocol stack.  Moreover, the
   non-technical (e.g., legal and political) aspects of mitigating
   pervasive monitoring are outside of the scope of the IETF.  The
   broader Internet community will need to step forward to tackle PM, if
   it is to be fully addressed.

   To summarise: current capabilities permit some actors to monitor
   content and metadata across the Internet at a scale never before
   seen.  This pervasive monitoring is an attack on Internet privacy.
   The IETF will strive to produce specifications that mitigate
   pervasive monitoring attacks.

   In the past, architectural statements of this sort, e.g., [<a href="./rfc1984" title='"IAB and IESG Statement on Cryptographic Technology and the Internet"'>RFC1984</a>]
   and [<a href="./rfc2804" title='"IETF Policy on Wiretapping"'>RFC2804</a>], have been published as joint products of the Internet
   Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and the Internet Architecture Board
   (IAB).  However, since those documents were published, the IETF and
   IAB have separated their publication "streams" as described in
   [<a href="./rfc4844" title='"The RFC Series and RFC Editor"'>RFC4844</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5741" title='"RFC Streams, Headers, and Boilerplates"'>RFC5741</a>].  This document was initiated after
   discussions in both the IESG and IAB, but is published as an IETF-
   stream consensus document, in order to ensure that it properly
   reflects the consensus of the IETF community as a whole.

   This document is entirely about privacy.  More information about the
   relationship between security and privacy threats can be found in
   [<a href="./rfc6973" title='"Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols"'>RFC6973</a>].  <a href="./rfc6973#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1 of [RFC6973]</a> specifically addresses
   surveillance as a combined security-privacy threat.
