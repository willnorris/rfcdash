              <span class="h1">ESTABLISHING A LOCAL GUIDE FOR NETWORK USAGE</span>


     Actual experiences and experimentation with network systems and
subsystems will be an important supplement to existing NIC
documentation.  For this reason, MITRE, to facilitate local user
access to network resources, is planning to establish a local GUIDE TO
NETWORK USAGE to supplement the Resources Notebook and other NIC
documentation.  The Guide will be tailored to the needs of MITRE users
and will contain information on network systems and subsystems.  (We
cannot precisely define systems and subsystems at this time but as an
example of what we have in mind, TENNEX at SRI is a system and NLS is
a subsystem.)

     The Guide will be implemented under NLS in much the same fashion
as the NIC LOCATOR SYSTEM.  Information gathered that is appropriate
for the NIC but not yet included will be submitted for inclusion in
the NIC.

     Attached is an outline of the proposed NLS files for the Guide
System.  The information included in the Guide will be sufficiently
detailed to enable local users who are unfamiliar with the network,
its terminology, and stores of reference material to utilize resources
at foreign hosts via the network.

     Sites will be included in the Guide as local users gain
experience with systems and subsystems located at the remote sites.
Therefore, the sites most likely to be in the Guide will be those that
can be used to support MITRE projects.

     We are planning to coordinate our efforts in this undertaking
with a similar effort at the National Bureau of Standards.  We believe
that such endeavors will result in valuable contributions to the NIC,

<span class="grey">particularly to the Network Resources Notebook.  Although the Guide</span>
will be tailored for MITRE users, it will contain information of
general interest to other network users and will be made accessible to
them through NLS.

     The Guide should become operational during December 1971.  Any
comments on proposed contents of the Guide are welcome.  Anyone
wishing to cooperate in this effort should contact E. Forman at MITRE.

     An NLS "Site File" will be built for each site at which a
resource is presently available to network users at MITRE.  Initial
files will be for those sites that offer resources that are of
specific interest to the local community.  A RESOURCE LOCATOR FILE
will contain a table of contents of the SITE FILES and a list of the
subsystems surveyed for each of these sites.  The headings in the
table of contents will contain links to the corresponding online site
file documents.
