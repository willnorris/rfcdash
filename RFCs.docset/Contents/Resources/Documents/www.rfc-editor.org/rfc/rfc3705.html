   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="./rfc3410#section-7">sectionÂ 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="./rfc3410" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   In cases where a manager must obtain performance history data about
   the behavior of equipment it manages, several strategies can be
   followed in the design of a MIB module that represents the managed
   equipment, including:

   -  The agent counts events on a continuous basis and, whenever
      desired, the manager obtains the value of the event counter and
      adjusts its understanding of the history of events at the agent.

   -  The agent allocates events to 'buckets' where each bucket
      represents an interval of time.

   Telecommunications equipment often makes use of the latter strategy.
   For such equipment the standard practice is that history data is
   maintained by the agent in terms of 15-minute intervals [<a href="#ref-T1.231" title="ANSI T1.231-1997">T1.231</a>].

   MIB modules for collecting performance history based on 15-minute
   intervals have been defined for the DS1/E1 [<a href="./rfc2495" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS1, E1, DS2 and E2 Interface Types"'>RFC2495</a>], DS3/E3
   [<a href="./rfc2496" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS3/E3 Interface Type"'>RFC2496</a>], SONET/SDH [<a href="./rfc3592" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) Interface Type"'>RFC3592</a>], ADSL [<a href="./rfc2662" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the ADSL Lines"'>RFC2662</a>], HDLS2 and SHDSL
   [<a href="./rfc3276" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for High Bit-rate DSL - 2nd Generation (HDSL2) and Single-Pair High-Speed Digital Subscriber Line (SHDSL) Lines"'>RFC3276</a>] interface types.  These MIB modules use a common set of
   textual conventions defined in [<a href="./rfc3593" title='"Textual Conventions for MIB Modules Using Performance History Based on 15 Minute Intervals"'>RFC3593</a>].

   A need has arisen to define 64-bit versions of the textual
   conventions in [<a href="./rfc3593" title='"Textual Conventions for MIB Modules Using Performance History Based on 15 Minute Intervals"'>RFC3593</a>].  Ideally, these high-capacity textual
   conventions would be based on a Gauge64 or Unsigned64 data type, but
   unfortunately no such types exist in SMIv2.  The next best choice
   would be to base them on the CounterBasedGauge64 textual convention



<span class="grey">Ray &amp; Abbi                  Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3705">RFC 3705</a>             High Capacity Perfhist TC MIB         February 2004</span>


   presented in [<a href="./rfc2856" title='"Textual Conventions for Additional High Capacity Data Types"'>RFC2856</a>], but that is not possible either since SMIv2
   allows only base types to be used in defining textual conventions.
   Therefore, the textual conventions presented in this memo are based
   directly on the Counter64 type, like those in [<a href="./rfc2856" title='"Textual Conventions for Additional High Capacity Data Types"'>RFC2856</a>].  They are
   subject to the following limitations:

   -  The MAX-ACCESS of objects defined using these textual conventions
      must be read-only, because the MAX-ACCESS of the underlying
      Counter64 type is read-only.

   -  No sub-range can be specified in object definitions using these
      textual conventions, because sub-ranges are not allowed on
      Counter64 objects.

   -  No DEFVAL clause can be specified in object definitions using
      these textual conventions, because DEFVALs are not allowed on
      Counter64 objects.

   -  Objects defined using these textual conventions cannot be used in
      an INDEX clause, because there is no INDEX clause mapping defined
      for objects of type Counter64.

   Use of the textual conventions presented in this memo assumes the
   following:

   -  The agent supports 15 minute based history counters.

   -  The agent is capable of keeping a history of 96 intervals of 15
      minute performance data.

   -  The agent may optionally support performance data aggregating the
      history intervals.

   -  The agent will keep separate tables for the current interval, the
      history intervals, and the total aggregates.

           "A gauge associated with a performance measurement in a
            current 15 minute measurement interval.  The value of an
            object with an HCPerfCurrentCount syntax starts from zero
            and is increased when associated events occur, until the
            end of the 15 minute interval.  At that time the value of
            the gauge is stored in the first 15 minute history
            interval, and the gauge is restarted at zero.  In the case
            where the agent has no valid data available for the
            current interval, the corresponding object instance is not
            available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding
            error message shall be returned to indicate that this
            instance does not exist.

            This count represents a non-negative integer, which
            may increase or decrease, but shall never exceed 2^64-1
            (18446744073709551615 decimal), nor fall below 0.  The
            value of an object with HCPerfCurrentCount syntax
            assumes its maximum value whenever the underlying count
            exceeds 2^64-1.  If the underlying count subsequently
            decreases below 2^64-1 (due, e.g., to a retroactive
            adjustment as a result of entering or exiting unavailable
            time), then the object's value also decreases.

            Note that this TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2,
            because the 'always increasing' and 'counter wrap'
            semantics associated with the Counter64 base type are not
            preserved.  It is possible that management applications
            which rely solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to
            determine object semantics will mistakenly operate upon
            objects of this type as they would for Counter64 objects.

            This textual convention represents a limited and short-
            term solution, and may be deprecated as a long term
            solution is defined and deployed to replace it."

            decreases below 2^64-1 (due, e.g., to a retroactive
            adjustment as a result of entering or exiting unavailable
            time), then the object's value also decreases.

            Note that this TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2,
            because the 'always increasing' and 'counter wrap'
            semantics associated with the Counter64 base type are not
            preserved.  It is possible that management applications
            which rely solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to
            determine object semantics will mistakenly operate upon
            objects of this type as they would for Counter64 objects.

            This textual convention represents a limited and short-
            term solution, and may be deprecated as a long term
            solution is defined and deployed to replace it."

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.
