                  <span class="h1">TELNET Protocol Meeting Announcement</span>

Since the publication of RFC #318 there have been a great number of
proposals for changes and/or extensions to the (still unofficial) TELNET
Protocol. It now seems appropriate to have a meeting of concerned
parties to try, once again, to reach a consensus position and define an
"official" protocol (with perhaps, some room for optional expansion).

Accordingly, I hereby announce a TELNET Protocol meeting to be held at
UCLA on Monday, March 5. I  expect this to be a working meeting (rather
than a tutorial to bring new members of the network community up-to-
speed) and therefore wish to invite the attendance of only those
individuals prepared to discuss at LEAST those issues which have already
been raised.  At a minimum, attendees should be familiar with the
following:

    <a href="./rfc318">RFC 318</a>
    <a href="./rfc328">RFC 328</a>
    <a href="./rfc340">RFC 340</a>
    <a href="./rfc357">RFC 357</a>
    <a href="./rfc393">RFC 393</a>
    <a href="./rfc426">RFC 426</a>
    <a href="./rfc435">RFC 435</a>

A familiarity with deliberations of the TELNET Committee prior to RFC
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/318%20would%20probably%20also%20be%20helpful."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-318" id="section-318">318</a> would probably also be helpful.  </span>Finally, attendees should be aware
that there are few (no?) Hosts which follow the echo-control conventions
described in <a href="./rfc318">RFC 318</a>.

Anyone wishing to attend this meeting should contact Alex McKenzie at
BBN (NIC ident aam) 50 Moulton Street, Cambridge, Mass. 02l38.  My
telephone number is

    (617) 491-1850 ext. 441

When there is some indication of the number of individuals planning to
attend, a meeting room will be selected, a time announced, etc.
