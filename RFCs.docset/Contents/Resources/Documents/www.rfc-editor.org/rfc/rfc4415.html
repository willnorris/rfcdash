Abstract

   This document registers the Enumservice "voice" (which has a defined
   subtype "tel"), as per the IANA registration process defined in the
   ENUM specification <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a>.  This service indicates that the contact
   held in the generated Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) can be used
   to initiate an interactive voice (audio) call.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)"'>1</a>]) is a system that transforms
   E.164 numbers [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The International Public Telecommunication Number Plan"'>2</a>] into domain names and then uses DNS (<a href="./rfc1034">RFC 1034</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"DOMAIN NAMES - CONCEPTS AND FACILITIES"'>3</a>])
   features such as delegation through NS records, and the use of Naming
   Authority Pointer (NAPTR) records, to look up the communication
   services available for a specific domain name.

   This document registers an Enumservice according to the guidelines
   given in <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a> to be used for provisioning in the services field
   of a NAPTR [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database"'>4</a>] resource record to indicate what class of
   functionality a given endpoint offers.  The registration is defined
   within the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS, [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS"'>5</a>] [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Two: The Algorithm"'>6</a>] [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database"'>4</a>] [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Four: The Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)"'>7</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Five: URI.ARPA Assignment Procedures"'>8</a>]) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS application defined in
   <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a>.

   Enumservices have a type and subtype.  This latter is optional, as it
   may be implicit in the service type.  The type defines the kind of
   communication session that can be initiated using the contact
   indicated by the URI generated by the enclosing NAPTR.  In
   telecommunications engineering terms, it reflects the "teleservice".

   The subtype defines the subsystem that is to be used to initiate the
   communication session.  Note that the subtype definition is usually
   associated with the URI scheme that is to be used.

   Both the type and subtype (where present) must be supported for the
   NAPTR to be used by a potential correspondent.

   There are a number of DDDS applications in addition to ENUM (for
   example, see [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Four: The Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)"'>7</a>] and [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Five: URI.ARPA Assignment Procedures"'>8</a>]).  However, an Enumservice indication
   operates only within the context of the "E2U" (ENUM) DDDS
   Application.

   Whilst the protocol elements that make up ENUM are defined in the
   above documents and in this one, further examples of the use to which
   these may be put are given in other documents, for example, in ETSI
   TS 102 172 [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Minimum Requirements for Interoperability of ENUM Implementations"'>11</a>].

   This document registers the Enumservice "voice" (which has a defined
   subtype "tel"), as per the IANA registration process defined in the
   ENUM specification <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a>.  This service indicates that the contact
   held in the generated URI can be used to initiate an interactive
   voice (audio) call.

   Enumservice Name: "voice"

   Enumservice Type: "voice"

   Enumservice Subtype: "tel"

   URI Scheme: 'tel:'

   Functional Specification:

      The kind of communication indicated by this Enumservice is
      "Interactive Voice".  From a protocol perspective, this
      communication is expected to involve bidirectional media streams
      carrying audio data.

      A client may imply that the person controlling population of a
      NAPTR holding this Enumservice indicates his capability to engage
      in an interactive voice session when contacted using the URI
      generated by this NAPTR.

   Security Considerations:

      See <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Authors:

      Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, and Richard Stastny (for author
      contact detail, see Authors' Addresses section)

   Any other information the author deems interesting:

      This Enumservice indicates that the person responsible for the
      NAPTR is accessible via the Public Switched Telephone Network
      (PSTN) or Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) using the value of the
      generated URI.

      The kind of subsystem required to initiate a Voice Enumservice
      with this subtype is a "Dialer".  This is a subsystem that either



<span class="grey">Brandner, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4415">RFC 4415</a>          IANA Voice Enumservice Registration      February 2006</span>


      provides a local connection to the PSTN or PLMN or provides an
      indirect connection to those networks.  The subsystem will use the
      telephone number held in the generated URI to place a voice call.
      The voice call is placed to a network that uses E.164 numbers to
      route calls to an appropriate destination.

      Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be indirect.  The end user
      receiving this NAPTR may have a relationship with a Communications
      Service Provider that accepts call initiation requests from that
      subsystem using an IP-based protocol such as SIP or H.323, and
      places the call to the PSTN using a remote gateway service.  In
      this case, the provider either may accept requests using "tel:"
      URIs or has a defined mechanism to convert "tel:" URI values into
      a "protocol-native" form.

      The "tel:" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified (using the "global
      phone number" form of <a href="./rfc3966">RFC 3966</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"The tel URI for Telephone Numbers"'>10</a>]).  A "local phone number" as
      defined in that document SHOULD NOT be used unless the controller
      of the zone in which the NAPTR appears is sure that it can be
      distinguished unambiguously by all clients that can access the
      resource record and that a call from their network access points
      can be routed to that destination.

   The following is an example of the use of the Enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record.

      $ORIGIN 0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
      3.8.0 NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+voice:tel"
         "!^.*$!tel:+441414960000!" .

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Thus, any
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.  Whilst
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a telephone
   directory, it does open the data subjects to having "their"
   information collected automatically without any indication that this
   has been done or by whom.

   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists
   of targets for unrequested information; in short, they are used to
   address "spam".  Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware
   that the volume of "spam" email sent increases when he or she posts
   to the mailing list; publication of a telephone number in ENUM is no
   different, and may be used for attempts to send "junk faxes" or "junk
   SMS", for example.



<span class="grey">Brandner, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4415">RFC 4415</a>          IANA Voice Enumservice Registration      February 2006</span>


   Many mailing list users have more than one email address and use
   "sacrificial" email accounts when posting to such lists to help
   filter out unrequested emails sent to them.  This is not so easy with
   published telephone numbers; the PSTN E.164 number assignment process
   is much more involved and usually a single E.164 number (or a fixed
   range of numbers) is associated with each PSTN access.  Thus,
   providing a "sacrificial" phone number in any publication is not
   possible.

   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible
   database, as a principle the data subjects MUST give their explicit
   informed consent to data being published in ENUM.

   In addition, they should be made aware that, due to storage of such
   data during harvesting by third parties, removal of the data from
   publication will not remove any copies that have been taken; in
   effect, any publication may be permanent.

   However, regulations in many regions will require that the data
   subjects can at any time request that the data be removed from
   publication and that their consent for its publication be explicitly
   confirmed at regular intervals.

   When placing a voice call via the PSTN (or from the Public Land
   Mobile Network), the sender may be charged for this action.  In both
   kinds of networks, calling some numbers is more expensive than
   sending to others; both kinds of networks have "premium rate"
   services that can be charged at a rate considerably more than a
   "normal" call.  As such, it is important that end users be asked to
   confirm placing the call and that the destination number be presented
   to them.  It is the originating user's choice whether or not to place
   a call to this destination number, but the originating user SHOULD be
   shown the destination number so that he or she can make this
   decision.

   In addition to the specific security considerations given above, all
   security considerations given in <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a> apply, as well as the
   DNS-specific threats covered in <a href="./rfc3833">RFC 3833</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Threat Analysis of the Domain Name System (DNS)"'>12</a>].

   The IANA has registered the Enumservice "voice" with a single subtype
   "tel" according to the framework defined in <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a>.  The current
   document defines this Enumservice and the expected behaviour of
   clients.
