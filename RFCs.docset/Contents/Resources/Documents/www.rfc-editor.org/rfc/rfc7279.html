         <span class="h1">An Acceptable Use Policy for New ICMP Types and Codes</span>

Abstract

   In this document we provide a basic description of ICMP's role in the
   IP stack and some guidelines for future use.

   This document is motivated by concerns about lack of clarity
   concerning when to add new Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
   types and/or codes.  These concerns have highlighted a need to
   describe policies for when adding new features to ICMP is desirable
   and when it is not.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   There has been some recent concern expressed about a lack of clarity
   around when new message types and codes should be added to ICMP
   (including ICMPv4 [<a href="./rfc0792" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol"'>RFC0792</a>] and ICMPv6 [<a href="./rfc4443" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC4443</a>]).  We lay out a
   policy regarding when (and when not) to move functionality into ICMP.

   This document is the result of discussions among ICMP experts within
   the Operations and Management (OPS) area's IP Diagnostics Technical
   Interest Group [<a href="#ref-DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a>] and concerns expressed by the OPS area
   leadership.

   Note that this document does not supercede the "IANA Allocation
   Guidelines For Values In the Internet Protocol and Related Headers"
   [<a href="./rfc2780" title='"IANA Allocation Guidelines For Values In the Internet Protocol and Related Headers"'>RFC2780</a>], which specifies best practices and processes for the
   allocation of values in the IANA registries but does not describe the
   policies to be applied in the standards process.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   In this document, we describe an acceptable use policy for new ICMP
   message types and codes, and provide some background about the
   policy.

   In summary, any future message types added to ICMP should be limited
   to two broad categories:

   1.  to inform a datagram's originator that a forwarding plane anomaly
       has been encountered downstream.  The datagram originator must be
       able to determine whether or not the datagram was discarded by
       examining the ICMP message.

   2.  to discover and convey dynamic information about a node (other
       than information usually carried in routing protocols), to
       discover and convey network-specific parameters, and to discover
       on-link routers and hosts.

   Normally, ICMP SHOULD NOT be used to implement a general-purpose
   routing or network management protocol.  However, ICMP does have a
   role to play in conveying dynamic information about a network, which
   would belong in category 2 above.

   As mentioned in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, using ICMP as a general-purpose routing or
   network management protocol is not advisable and SHOULD NOT be used
   that way.

   ICMP has a role in the Internet as an integral part of the IP layer;
   it is not as a routing protocol or as a transport protocol for other
   layers including routing information.  From a more pragmatic
   perspective, some of the key characteristics of ICMP make it a less-
   than-ideal choice for a routing protocol.  These key characteristics
   include that ICMP is frequently filtered, is not authenticated, and
   is easily spoofed.  In addition, specialist hardware processing of
   ICMP would disrupt the deployment of an ICMP-based routing or
   management protocol.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.2.%20%20A%20Few%20Notes%20on%20RPL"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.2" id="section-2.1.2">2.1.2</a>.  A Few Notes on RPL</span>

   RPL, the IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (see
   [<a href="./rfc6550" title='"RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks"'>RFC6550</a>]) uses ICMP as a transport.  In this regard, it is an
   exception among the ICMP message types.  Note that, although RPL is
   an IP routing protocol, it is not deployed on the general Internet;
   it is limited to specific, contained networks.

   This should be considered anomalous and is not a model for future
   ICMP message types.  That is, ICMP is not intended as a transport for
   other protocols and SHOULD NOT be used in that way in future
   specifications.  In particular, while it is adequate to use ICMP as a
   discovery protocol, it does not extend to full routing capabilities.

   Some applications make use of ICMP error notifications, or even
   deliberately create anomalous conditions in order to elicit ICMP
   messages.  These ICMP messages are then used to generate feedback to
   the higher layer.  Some of these applications include some of the
   most widespread examples, such as PING, TRACEROUTE, and Path MTU
   Discovery (PMTUD).  These uses are considered acceptable because they
   use existing ICMP message types and do not change ICMP functionality.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Extending%20ICMP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Extending ICMP</span>

   ICMP multi-part messages are specified in [<a href="./rfc4884" title='"Extended ICMP to Support Multi-Part Messages"'>RFC4884</a>] by defining an
   extension mechanism for selected ICMP messages.  This mechanism
   addresses a fundamental problem in ICMP extensibility.  An ICMP
   multi-part message carries all of the information that ICMP messages
   carried previously, as well as additional information that
   applications may require.

   Some currently defined ICMP extensions include ICMP extensions for
   Multiprotocol Label Switching [<a href="./rfc4950" title='"ICMP Extensions for Multiprotocol Label Switching"'>RFC4950</a>] and ICMP extensions for
   interface and next-hop identification [<a href="./rfc5837" title='"Extending ICMP for Interface and Next-Hop Identification"'>RFC5837</a>].

   Extensions to ICMP SHOULD follow the requirements provided in
   [<a href="./rfc4884" title='"Extended ICMP to Support Multi-Part Messages"'>RFC4884</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20ICMPv4%20vs.%20ICMPv6"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  ICMPv4 vs. ICMPv6</span>

   Because ICMPv6 is used for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, deployed IPv6
   routers, IPv6-capable security gateways, and IPv6-capable firewalls
   normally support administrator configuration of how specific ICMPv6
   message types are handled.  By contrast, deployed IPv4 routers,
   IPv4-capable security gateways, and IPv4-capable firewalls are less
   likely to allow an administrator to configure how specific ICMPv4
   message types are handled.  So, at present, ICMPv6 messages usually
   have a higher probability of travelling end-to-end than ICMPv4
   messages.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20ICMP%27s%20Role%20in%20the%20Internet"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  ICMP's Role in the Internet</span>

   ICMP was originally intended to be a mechanism for gateways or
   destination hosts to report error conditions back to source hosts in
   ICMPv4 [<a href="./rfc0792" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol"'>RFC0792</a>]; ICMPv6 [<a href="./rfc4443" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC4443</a>] is modeled after it.  ICMP is also
   used to perform IP-layer functions, such as diagnostics (e.g., PING).

   ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP and must be implemented
   by every IP module.  This is true for ICMPv4 as an integral part of
   IPv4 (see the Introduction of [<a href="./rfc0792" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol"'>RFC0792</a>]), and for ICMPv6 as an

   integral part of IPv6 (see <a href="./rfc4443#section-2">SectionÂ 2 of [RFC4443]</a>).  When first
   defined, ICMP messages were thought of as IP messages that didn't
   carry any higher-layer data.  It could be conjectured that the term
   "control" was used because ICMP messages were not "data" messages.

   The word "control" in the protocol name did not describe ICMP's
   function (i.e., it did not "control" the Internet); rather, it was
   used to communicate about the control functions in the Internet.  For
   example, even though ICMP included a redirect message type that
   affects routing behavior in the context of a LAN segment, it was not
   and is not used as a generic routing protocol.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document describes a high-level policy for adding ICMP types and
   codes.  While special attention must be paid to the security
   implications of any particular new ICMP type or code, this
   recommendation presents no new security considerations.

   From a security perspective, ICMP plays a part in the Photuris
   protocol [<a href="./rfc2521" title='"ICMP Security Failures Messages"'>RFC2521</a>].  But more generally, ICMP is not a secure
   protocol and does not include features to be used to discover network
   security parameters or to report on network security anomalies in the
   forwarding plane.

   Additionally, new ICMP functionality (e.g., ICMP extensions, or new
   ICMP types or codes) needs to consider potential ways that ICMP can
   be abused (e.g., Smurf IP DoS [<a href="#ref-CA-1998-01">CA-1998-01</a>]).
