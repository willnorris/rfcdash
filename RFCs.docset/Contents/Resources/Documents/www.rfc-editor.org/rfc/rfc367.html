                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

   This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from July 3 to
   July 14.

   No testing was done on July 4 as BBN took a holiday to celebrate
   Independence Day.  No testing was done on July 11 and 12 as I was on
   vacation.

   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing as they
   are presently intended to be users only.  Included here are the
   Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, RADC,
   NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, ARPA, and BBN*).  This category also
   includes the Network Control Center computer (Network address 5)
   which is used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.
   Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:

   Network
   Address           Site            Computer
   -------           ----            --------
   7                 Rand            IBM-360/65
   73                Harvard         PDP-1
   138               Lincoln         TSP
   12                Illinois        PDP-11
   19                NBS             PDP-11
   23                USC             IBM-360/44

   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this
   period.






   ---------
   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as such
   is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to refine
   and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

   where
 D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
     partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)
 F = Full (Destination Host opened a connection, informed user that all
     Network ports were in use, and immediately closed the connection.)
 H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
     immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)
 O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to
     users.)
 R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)
 T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
     connection within 60 seconds.)

---------
*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a Network
Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to
test NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection to the NETRJS
logger indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.

#These sites advertise that they may not have their system available at
these times.
