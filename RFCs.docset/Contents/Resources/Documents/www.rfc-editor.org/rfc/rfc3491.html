Abstract

   This document describes how to prepare internationalized domain name
   (IDN) labels in order to increase the likelihood that name input and
   name comparison work in ways that make sense for typical users
   throughout the world.  This profile of the stringprep protocol is
   used as part of a suite of on-the-wire protocols for
   internationalizing the Domain Name System (DNS).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document specifies processing rules that will allow users to
   enter internationalized domain names (IDNs) into applications and
   have the highest chance of getting the content of the strings
   correct.  It is a profile of stringprep [<a href="#ref-STRINGPREP" title='"Preparation of Internationalized Strings ("'>STRINGPREP</a>].  These
   processing rules are only intended for internationalized domain
   names, not for arbitrary text.

   This profile defines the following, as required by [<a href="#ref-STRINGPREP" title='"Preparation of Internationalized Strings ("'>STRINGPREP</a>].

   -  The intended applicability of the profile: internationalized
      domain names processed by IDNA.

   -  The character repertoire that is the input and output to
      stringprep:  Unicode 3.2, specified in <a href="#section-2">section 2</a>.

   Nameprep is used by the IDNA [<a href="#ref-IDNA" title='"Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)"'>IDNA</a>] protocol for preparing domain
   names; it is not designed for any other purpose.  It is explicitly
   not designed for processing arbitrary free text and SHOULD NOT be
   used for that purpose.  Nameprep is a profile of Stringprep
   [<a href="#ref-STRINGPREP" title='"Preparation of Internationalized Strings ("'>STRINGPREP</a>].  Implementations of Nameprep MUST fully implement
   Stringprep.

   Nameprep is used to process domain name labels, not domain names.
   IDNA calls nameprep for each label in a domain name, not for the
   whole domain name.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   The Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 repertoires have many characters that
   look similar.  In many cases, users of security protocols might do
   visual matching, such as when comparing the names of trusted third
   parties.  Because it is impossible to map similar-looking characters
   without a great deal of context such as knowing the fonts used,
   stringprep does nothing to map similar-looking characters together
   nor to prohibit some characters because they look like others.

   Security on the Internet partly relies on the DNS.  Thus, any change
   to the characteristics of the DNS can change the security of much of
   the Internet.

   Domain names are used by users to connect to Internet servers.  The
   security of the Internet would be compromised if a user entering a
   single internationalized name could be connected to different servers
   based on different interpretations of the internationalized domain
   name.

   Current applications might assume that the characters allowed in
   domain names will always be the same as they are in [<a href="#ref-STD13" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>STD13</a>].  This
   document vastly increases the number of characters available in
   domain names.  Every program that uses "special" characters in
   conjunction with domain names may be vulnerable to attack based on
   the new characters allowed by this specification.

   This is a profile of stringprep.  It has been registered by the IANA
   in the stringprep profile registry
   (www.iana.org/assignments/stringprep-profiles).

      Name of this profile:
         Nameprep

      RFC in which the profile is defined:
         This document.

      Indicator whether or not this is the newest version of the
      profile:
         This is the first version of Nameprep.

   Many people from the IETF IDN Working Group and the Unicode Technical
