<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The "IANA IPR Community Agreement" [<a href="#ref-1" title='"IANA IPR Community Agreement"'>1</a>] was one of the many documents
   that was part of the IANA Stewardship Transition.  It calls for the
   creation of the Community Coordination Group (CCG) to provide
   guidance and advice to the IETF Trust regarding the stewardship of
   the IANA Intellectual Property, which is the IANA trademarks and the
   IANA domain names.

   The CCG is comprised of nine individuals, called the CCG
   Representatives.  The three operational communities (i.e., the Names
   Community, the Numbers Community, and the Protocol Parameters
   Community) each appoint three CCG Representatives.  Each operational
   community has the right to change any of its CCG Representatives upon
   written notice to the other operational communities and the IETF
   Trust.  An operational community may remove or replace its CCG
   Representatives at any time and at its sole discretion.  The means
   and procedures by which an operational community chooses to select,
   appoint, and remove its own CCG Representatives are determined solely
   by that operational community.

   Each operational community appoints one of its CCG Representatives as
   a co-chair of the CCG, and that co-chair is empowered to speak on
   behalf of its operational community regarding the IANA Intellectual
   Property.  An operational community has the right to change its CCG
   co-chair upon written notice to the other operational communities and
   the IETF Trust.  An operational community may remove or replace its
   CCG co-chair at any time and at its sole discretion.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8090">RFC 8090</a>              CCG Representative Procedures        February 2017</span>


   This document outlines the procedures for the IETF to select,
   appoint, and remove the three CCG Representatives for the Protocol
   Parameter Community.  In addition, this document outlines the
   procedures for the selection of the co-chair among those CCG
   Representatives.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Desirable%20Qualifications%20for%20CCG%20Representatives"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Desirable Qualifications for CCG Representatives</span>

   Candidates for the CCG Representative position for the Protocol
   Parameters Community should have a demonstrable involvement in the
   IETF and a solid understanding of the various ways that the IETF
   makes use of protocol parameter registries.  Candidates should be
   familiar with the ways that the IETF community depends upon the IANA
   trademarks and the IANA domain names.

   Candidates are expected to be able to call on others in the IETF
   community, as required, to ensure that the IETF Trust receives the
   highest quality advice available.

   Candidates are expected to possess clearly demonstrated technical
   competence relating to the management of IANA protocol parameter
   registries.  Candidates are also expected to be able to understand
   the ways that IANA registries are used by the Names Community and the
   Numbers Community.

   The three CCG Representatives for the Protocol Parameters Community
   serve at the pleasure of the IAB.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Duration%20of%20Appointment"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Duration of Appointment</span>

   Each of the CCG Representatives is expected to serve for at least a
   year, and appointments ought to be staggered to avoid simultaneous
   replacement of all of the CCG Representatives at the same time.  Each
   year the IAB will seek input from the IETF community to determine
   whether a personnel change is appropriate.

   When the IAB decides to appoint a new person as a CCG Representative,
   the IAB will make a public call for nominations on the
   ietf-announce@ietf.org mailing list.  The public call will specify
   the manner by which nominations will be accepted and the means by
   which the list of nominees will be published for IETF community
   feedback.  Self-nominations are permitted.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8090">RFC 8090</a>              CCG Representative Procedures        February 2017</span>


   Each nomination must include the name and contact information for
   each candidate.  The details about the candidate's background and
   qualifications for the position should be provided with the
   nomination.  Trustees of the IETF Trust are not eligible for
   nomination.  All other IETF participants, including working group
   chairs, IETF NomCom members, IAB members, and IESG members are
   eligible for nomination.

   IAB members who accept a nomination shall recuse themselves from
   selection discussions.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Selection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Selection</span>

   The IAB will publish the list of people that have accepted their
   nomination or have nominated themselves.  Feedback from the IETF
   community will be considered by the IAB in making a selection.  The
   IAB will keep any received feedback confidential.

   The IAB will consider potential conflicts with a CCG Representative
   position and any other positions held by the nominated candidates.

   After considering the IETF community feedback, potential conflicts,
   and any other appropriate information that is available, the IAB
   shall vote to select the best qualified CCG Representative.

   If there are concerns with the performance of an IAB-appointed CCG
   Representative, the IETF community can request that the IAB consider
   removal.  Such a request must be sent by email to iab-chair@iab.org.

   The request must include a statement of justification for the removal
   of the CCG Representative, including all relevant and appropriate
   supporting documentation.

   The IAB shall respond to the request within six weeks.  If an IAB
   member is serving in any of the CCG Representative positions,
   regardless of the operational community that the IAB member
   represents, that IAB member shall be recused from any investigation,
   discussion, and vote to determine what action to take.

   If the CCG Representative is removed, then the open position is to be
   filled according to <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of this document.

   Whenever there is a change to the list of people that are serving as
   CCG Representatives for the Protocol Parameters Community, the
   sitting CCG Representatives shall use a procedure of their own
   choosing to select the co-chair.  The co-chair selection shall be
   confirmed by the IAB, and then the IAB shall announce the co-chair
   selection to the IETF community, the IETF Trust, and the CCG
   Representatives from the other operational communities.

   At any time, for any reason, the list of people that are serving as
   CCG Representatives for the Protocol Parameters Community may revisit
   the selection of co-chair.  If a different selection is made, the new
   selection shall be confirmed by the IAB, and then the IAB shall
   announce the co-chair selection to the IETF community, the IETF
   Trust, and the CCG Representatives from the other operational
   communities.

   As part of the confirmation process, the IAB shall consider potential
   conflicts of interest of the candidate for co-chair.

   Since three CCG Representatives needed to be in place at midnight on
   30 September 2016 when the IANA Stewardship Transition took place,
   the IAB quickly appointed three individuals that were heavily
   involved in the transition.  The three individuals agreed to serve
   until the appointment procedures could be adopted and employed.

   Using the procedures in this document, the IAB will appoint three CCG
   Representatives before the second IETF meeting in 2017.

   To encourage the staggered replacement, at least one of those
   appointed will be replaced before the second IETF meeting in 2018,
   that is, one year after the first set of CCG Representatives are
   appointed by the process in this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Reporting%20by%20the%20CCG%20Representatives%20to%20the%20IAB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Reporting by the CCG Representatives to the IAB</span>

   CCG Representatives shall deliver reports to the IAB within a
   reasonable time frame, providing whenever possible the opportunity to
   obtain advice regarding open IANA Intellectual Property issues.
   While no specific time periods for reporting are mandated, CCG
   Representatives are expected to keep the IAB informed of CCG
   activities.

   Reports from the CCG Representatives will be made publicly available,
   except for comments about individuals.  These reports will typically
   be part of the minutes of the IAB meeting where they are discussed.
