Request for Comments: 590                                    MIT-Multics
NIC: 20326                                              19 November 1973


                         <span class="h1">Multics Address Change</span>

   We will be changing the Network address of MIT-Multics from 6 to 44
   (decimal) on Monday, December 17, 1973.  Please make any necessary
   table and program changes then, and accept our apologies for the
   inconvenience.

   The change was necessitated by the fact that 1) there were some nine
   uses for the four ports on IMP 6, making the second MIT IMP
   desirable; 2) there were four very active Hosts on IMP 6, making the
   shift of at least one of them to the new, less busy IMP desirable;
   and 3) the new Multics machine is some 2000 feet from the old IMP,
   making it the logical candidate for the move.

   It is likely that we will have one or two additional test sessions on
   the new IMP prior to the changeover date.  These will be announced in
   our "message of the day", and would only affect -- temporarily --
   users who cannot employ numeric Host addresses directly.
