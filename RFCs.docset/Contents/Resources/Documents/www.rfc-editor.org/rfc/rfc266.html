                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>











   This RFC reports on the status of most.Network Hosts from October 26
   to November 5.  (Massachusetts celebrated Armistice day on Monday,
   October 25.) During these two weeks the general status of these hosts
   remained as it had been previously.

   The table on the following page summarizes the daily information on
   host status for this period.

where

D=  Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)

R=  Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T=  Timed out (Destination Host did not respond in any way to the
    initial RFC, although not dead.)

H=  1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O=  Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to
    users.)

* The UCLA IBM-360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS), but
  has not implemented a full server Telnet System.  The BBN Terminal
  IMP is not equipped to test NETRJS;  however, we are assuming that
  receipt of the UCLA explanatory message indicates that NETRJS is also
  functioning.
