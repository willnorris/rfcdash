Abstract

   This document specifies a protocol for performing encapsulation of an
   arbitrary network layer protocol over another arbitrary network layer
   protocol.

Introduction

   A number of different proposals [RFC 1234, <a href="./rfc1226">RFC 1226</a>] currently exist
   for the encapsulation of one protocol over another protocol. Other
   types of encapsulations [RFC 1241, SDRP, <a href="./rfc1479">RFC 1479</a>] have been proposed
   for transporting IP over IP for policy purposes. This memo describes
   a protocol which is very similar to, but is more general than, the
   above proposals.  In attempting to be more general, many protocol
   specific nuances have been ignored.  The result is that this proposal
   is may be less suitable for a situation where a specific "X over Y"
   encapsulation has been described.  It is the attempt of this protocol
   to provide a simple, general purpose mechanism which is reduces the
   problem of encapsulation from its current O(n^2) problem to a more
   manageable state.  This proposal also attempts to provide a
   lightweight encapsulation for use in policy based routing.  This memo
   explicitly does not address the issue of when a packet should be
   encapsulated.  This memo acknowledges, but does not address problems
   with mutual encapsulation [<a href="./rfc1326">RFC 1326</a>].

   In the most general case, a system has a packet that needs to be
   encapsulated and routed.  We will call this the payload packet.  The
   payload is first encapsulated in a GRE packet, which possibly also
   includes a route.  The resulting GRE packet can then be encapsulated
   in some other protocol and then forwarded.  We will call this outer

   protocol the delivery protocol. The algorithms for processing this
   packet are discussed later.

Overall packet

   The entire encapsulated packet would then have the form:

                  ---------------------------------
                  |                               |

Packet header

   The GRE packet header has the form:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      Flags and version (2 octets)

      The GRE flags are encoded in the first two octets.  Bit 0 is the
      most significant bit, bit 15 is the least significant bit.  Bits
      13 through 15 are reserved for the Version field.  Bits 5 through
      12 are reserved for future use and MUST be transmitted as zero.

      Checksum Present (bit 0)

      If the Checksum Present bit is set to 1, then the Checksum field
      is present and contains valid information.

      If either the Checksum Present bit or the Routing Present bit are
      set, BOTH the Checksum and Offset fields are present in the GRE
      packet.

      Routing Present (bit 1)

      If the Routing Present bit is set to 1, then it indicates that the
      Offset and Routing fields are present and contain valid
      information.

      If either the Checksum Present bit or the Routing Present bit are
      set, BOTH the Checksum and Offset fields are present in the GRE
      packet.

      Key Present (bit 2)

      If the Key Present bit is set to 1, then it indicates that the Key
      field is present in the GRE header.  Otherwise, the Key field is
      not present in the GRE header.

      Sequence Number Present (bit 3)

      If the Sequence Number Present bit is set to 1, then it indicates
      that the Sequence Number field is present.  Otherwise, the
      Sequence Number field is not present in the GRE header.

      Strict Source Route (bit 4)

      The meaning of the Strict Source route bit is defined in other
      documents.  It is recommended that this bit only be set to 1 if
      all of the the Routing Information consists of Strict Source
      Routes.

      Recursion Control (bits 5-7)

      Recursion control contains a three bit unsigned integer which
      contains the number of additional encapsulations which are
      permissible.  This SHOULD default to zero.

      Version Number (bits 13-15)

      The Version Number field MUST contain the value 0.  Other values
      are outside of the scope of this document.

      Protocol Type (2 octets)

      The Protocol Type field contains the protocol type of the payload
      packet.  In general, the value will be the Ethernet protocol type
      field for the packet.  Currently defined protocol types are listed
      below.  Additional values may be defined in other documents.

      Offset (2 octets)

      The offset field indicates the octet offset from the start of the
      Routing field to the first octet of the active Source Route Entry
      to be examined.  This field is present if the Routing Present or
      the Checksum Present bit is set to 1, and contains valid
      information only if the Routing Present bit is set to 1.

      Checksum (2 octets)

      The Checksum field contains the IP (one's complement) checksum of
      the GRE header and the payload packet.  This field is present if
      the Routing Present or the Checksum Present bit is set to 1, and
      contains valid information only if the Checksum Present bit is set
      to 1.

      Key (4 octets)

      The Key field contains a four octet number which was inserted by
      the encapsulator.  It may be used by the receiver to authenticate
      the source of the packet.  The techniques for determining
      authenticity are outside of the scope of this document.  The Key
      field is only present if the Key Present field is set to 1.

      Sequence Number (4 octets)

      The Sequence Number field contains an unsigned 32 bit integer
      which is inserted by the encapsulator.  It may be used by the
      receiver to establish the order in which packets have been
      transmitted from the encapsulator to the receiver.  The exact
      algorithms for the generation of the Sequence Number and the
      semantics of their reception is outside of the scope of this
      document.

      Routing (variable)

      The Routing field is optional and is present only if the Routing
      Present bit is set to 1.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a>          Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)       October 1994</span>


      The Routing field is a list of Source Route Entries (SREs).  Each
      SRE has the form:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |       Address Family          |  SRE Offset   |  SRE Length   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                        Routing Information ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The routing field is terminated with a "NULL" SRE containing an
   address family of type 0x0000 and a length of 0.

   Address Family (2 octets)

   The Address Family field contains a two octet value which indicates
   the syntax and semantics of the Routing Information field.  The
   values for this field and the corresponding syntax and semantics for
   Routing Information are defined in other documents.

   SRE Offset (1 octet)

   The SRE Offset field indicates the octet offset from the start of the
   Routing Information field to the first octet of the active entry in
   Source Route Entry to be examined.

   SRE Length (1 octet)

   The SRE Length field contains the number of octets in the SRE.  If
   the SRE Length is 0, this indicates this is the last SRE in the
   Routing field.

   Routing Information (variable)

   The Routing Information field contains data which may be used in
   routing this packet.  The exact semantics of this field is defined in
   other documents.

Forwarding of GRE packets

   Normally, a system which is forwarding delivery layer packets will
   not differentiate GRE packets from other packets in any way.
   However, a GRE packet may be received by a system.  In this case, the
   system should use some delivery-specific means to determine that this
   is a GRE packet.  Once this is determined, the Key, Sequence Number
   and Checksum fields if they contain valid information as indicated by
   the corresponding flags may be checked.  If the Routing Present bit



<span class="grey">Hanks, Li, Farinacci &amp; Traina                                   [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a>          Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)       October 1994</span>


   is set to 1, then the Address Family field should be checked to
   determine the semantics and use of the SRE Length, SRE Offset and
   Routing Information fields.  The exact semantics for processing a SRE
   for each Address Family is defined in other documents.

   Once all SREs have been processed, then the source route is complete,
   the GRE header should be removed, the payload's TTL MUST be
   decremented (if one exists) and the payload packet should be
   forwarded as a normal packet.  The exact forwarding method depends on
   the Protocol Type field.

Current List of Protocol Types

   The following are currently assigned protocol types for GRE.  Future
   protocol types must be taken from DIX ethernet encoding.  For
   historical reasons, a number of other values have been used for some
   protocols.  The following table of values MUST be used to identify
   the following protocols:
