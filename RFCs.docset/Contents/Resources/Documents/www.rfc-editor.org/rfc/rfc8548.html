Abstract

   This document specifies "tcpcrypt", a TCP encryption protocol
   designed for use in conjunction with the TCP Encryption Negotiation
   Option (TCP-ENO).  Tcpcrypt coexists with middleboxes by tolerating
   resegmentation, NATs, and other manipulations of the TCP header.  The
   protocol is self-contained and specifically tailored to TCP
   implementations, which often reside in kernels or other environments
   in which large external software dependencies can be undesirable.
   Because the size of TCP options is limited, the protocol requires one
   additional one-way message latency to perform key exchange before
   application data can be transmitted.  However, the extra latency can
   be avoided between two hosts that have recently established a
   previous tcpcrypt connection.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document describes tcpcrypt, an extension to TCP for
   cryptographic protection of session data.  Tcpcrypt was designed to
   meet the following goals:

   o  Meet the requirements of the TCP Encryption Negotiation Option
      (TCP-ENO) [<a href="./rfc8547" title='"TCP-ENO: Encryption Negotiation Option"'>RFC8547</a>] for protecting connection data.

   o  Be amenable to small, self-contained implementations inside TCP
      stacks.

   o  Minimize additional latency at connection startup.

   o  As much as possible, prevent connection failure in the presence of
      NATs and other middleboxes that might normalize traffic or
      otherwise manipulate TCP segments.

   o  Operate independently of IP addresses, making it possible to
      authenticate resumed sessions efficiently even when either end
      changes IP address.

   A companion document [<a href="#ref-TCPINC-API">TCPINC-API</a>] describes recommended interfaces
   for configuring certain parameters of this protocol.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   This section describes the operation of the tcpcrypt protocol.  The
   wire format of all messages is specified in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Cryptographic%20Algorithms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Cryptographic Algorithms</span>

   Setting up a tcpcrypt connection employs three types of cryptographic
   algorithms:

   o  A key agreement scheme is used with a short-lived public key to
      agree upon a shared secret.






<span class="grey">Bittau, et al.                Experimental                      [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8548">RFC 8548</a>            tcpcrypt: TCP Encryption Protocol           May 2019</span>


   o  An extract function is used to generate a pseudo-random key (PRK)
      from some initial keying material produced by the key agreement
      scheme.  The notation Extract(S, IKM) denotes the output of the
      extract function with salt S and initial keying material IKM.

   o  A collision-resistant pseudo-random function (CPRF) is used to
      generate multiple cryptographic keys from a pseudo-random key,
      typically the output of the extract function.  The CPRF produces
      an arbitrary amount of Output Keying Material (OKM), and we use
      the notation CPRF(K, CONST, L) to designate the first L bytes of
      the OKM produced by the CPRF when parameterized by key K and the
      constant CONST.

   The Extract and CPRF functions used by the tcpcrypt variants defined
   in this document are the Extract and Expand functions of the HMAC-
   based Key Derivation Function (HKDF) [<a href="./rfc5869" title='"HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)"'>RFC5869</a>], which is built on
   Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication (HMAC) [<a href="./rfc2104" title='"HMAC: Keyed- Hashing for Message Authentication"'>RFC2104</a>].  These are
   defined as follows in terms of the function HMAC-Hash(key, value) for
   a negotiated Hash function such as SHA-256; the symbol "|" denotes
   concatenation, and the counter concatenated to the right of CONST
   occupies a single octet.

           HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM) -&gt; PRK
              PRK = HMAC-Hash(salt, IKM)

           HKDF-Expand(PRK, CONST, L) -&gt; OKM
              T(0) = empty string (zero length)
              T(1) = HMAC-Hash(PRK, T(0) | CONST | 0x01)
              T(2) = HMAC-Hash(PRK, T(1) | CONST | 0x02)
              T(3) = HMAC-Hash(PRK, T(2) | CONST | 0x03)
              ...

              OKM  = first L octets of T(1) | T(2) | T(3) | ...
              where L &lt;= 255*OutputLength(Hash)

             Figure 1: HKDF Functions Used for Key Derivation

   Lastly, once tcpcrypt has been successfully set up and encryption
   keys have been derived, an algorithm for Authenticated Encryption
   with Associated Data (AEAD) is used to protect the confidentiality
   and integrity of all transmitted application data.  AEAD algorithms
   use a single key to encrypt their input data and also to generate a
   cryptographic tag to accompany the resulting ciphertext; when
   decryption is performed, the tag allows authentication of the
   encrypted data and of optional associated plaintext data.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Protocol%20Negotiation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Protocol Negotiation</span>

   Tcpcrypt depends on TCP-ENO [<a href="./rfc8547" title='"TCP-ENO: Encryption Negotiation Option"'>RFC8547</a>] to negotiate whether encryption
   will be enabled for a connection as well as which key-agreement
   scheme to use.  TCP-ENO negotiates the use of a particular TCP
   encryption protocol (TEP) by including protocol identifiers in ENO
   suboptions.  This document associates four TEP identifiers with the
   tcpcrypt protocol as listed in Table 4 of <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.  Each identifier
   indicates the use of a particular key-agreement scheme, with an
   associated CPRF and length parameter.  Future standards can associate
   additional TEP identifiers with tcpcrypt following the assignment
   policy specified by TCP-ENO.

   An active opener that wishes to negotiate the use of tcpcrypt
   includes an ENO option in its SYN segment.  That option includes
   suboptions with tcpcrypt TEP identifiers indicating the key-agreement
   schemes it is willing to enable.  The active opener MAY additionally
   include suboptions indicating support for encryption protocols other
   than tcpcrypt, as well as global suboptions as specified by TCP-ENO.

   If a passive opener receives an ENO option including tcpcrypt TEPs
   that it supports, it MAY then attach an ENO option to its SYN-ACK
   segment, including solely the TEP it wishes to enable.

   To establish distinct roles for the two hosts in each connection,
   tcpcrypt depends on the role-negotiation mechanism of TCP-ENO.  As
   one result of the negotiation process, TCP-ENO assigns hosts unique
   roles abstractly called "A" at one end of the connection and "B" at
   the other.  Generally, an active opener plays the "A" role and a
   passive opener plays the "B" role, but in the case of simultaneous
   open, an additional mechanism breaks the symmetry and assigns a
   distinct role to each host.  TCP-ENO uses the terms "host A" and
   "host B" to identify each end of a connection uniquely; this document
   employs those terms in the same way.

   An ENO suboption includes a flag "v" which indicates the presence of
   associated variable-length data.  In order to propose fresh key
   agreement with a particular tcpcrypt TEP, a host sends a one-byte
   suboption containing the TEP identifier and v = 0.  In order to
   propose session resumption (described further below) with a
   particular TEP, a host sends a variable-length suboption containing
   the TEP identifier, the flag v = 1, an identifier derived from a
   session secret previously negotiated with the same host and the same
   TEP, and a nonce.







<span class="grey">Bittau, et al.                Experimental                      [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-7"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8548">RFC 8548</a>            tcpcrypt: TCP Encryption Protocol           May 2019</span>


   Once two hosts have exchanged SYN segments, TCP-ENO defines the
   negotiated TEP to be the last valid TEP identifier in the SYN segment
   of host B (that is, the passive opener in the absence of simultaneous
   open) that also occurs in that of host A.  If there is no such TEP,
   hosts MUST disable TCP-ENO and tcpcrypt.

   If the negotiated TEP was sent by host B with v = 0, it means that
   fresh key agreement will be performed as described in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.
   If, on the other hand, host B sent the TEP with v = 1 and both hosts
   sent appropriate resumption identifiers in their suboption data, then
   the key-exchange messages will be omitted in favor of determining
   keys via session resumption as described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.  With
   session resumption, protected application data MAY be sent
   immediately as detailed in <a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>.

   Note that the negotiated TEP is determined without reference to the
   "v" bits in ENO suboptions, so if host A offers resumption with a
   particular TEP and host B replies with a non-resumption suboption
   with the same TEP, that could become the negotiated TEP, in which
   case fresh key agreement will be performed.  That is, sending a
   resumption suboption also implies willingness to perform fresh key
   agreement with the indicated TEP.

   As REQUIRED by TCP-ENO, once a host has both sent and received an ACK
   segment containing a valid ENO option, encryption MUST be enabled and
   plaintext application data MUST NOT ever be exchanged on the
   connection.  If the negotiated TEP is among those listed in Table 4,
   a host MUST follow the protocol described in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Key%20Exchange"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Key Exchange</span>

   Following successful negotiation of a tcpcrypt TEP, all further
   signaling is performed in the Data portion of TCP segments.  Except
   when resumption was negotiated (described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>), the two
   hosts perform key exchange through two messages, Init1 and Init2, at
   the start of the data streams of host A and host B, respectively.
   These messages MAY span multiple TCP segments and need not end at a
   segment boundary.  However, the segment containing the last byte of
   an Init1 or Init2 message MUST have TCP's push flag (PSH) set.

   The key exchange protocol, in abstract, proceeds as follows:

       A -&gt; B:  Init1 = { INIT1_MAGIC, sym_cipher_list, N_A, Pub_A }
       B -&gt; A:  Init2 = { INIT2_MAGIC, sym_cipher, N_B, Pub_B }

   The concrete format of these messages is specified in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8548">RFC 8548</a>            tcpcrypt: TCP Encryption Protocol           May 2019</span>


   The parameters are defined as follows:

   o  INIT1_MAGIC, INIT2_MAGIC: Constants defined in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.

   o  sym_cipher_list: A list of identifiers of symmetric ciphers (AEAD
      algorithms) acceptable to host A.  These are specified in Table 5
      of <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   o  sym_cipher: The symmetric cipher selected by host B from the
      sym_cipher_list sent by host A.

   o  N_A, N_B: Nonces chosen at random by hosts A and B, respectively.

   o  Pub_A, Pub_B: Ephemeral public keys for hosts A and B,
      respectively.  These, as well as their corresponding private keys,
      are short-lived values that MUST be refreshed frequently.  The
      private keys SHOULD NOT ever be written to persistent storage.
      The security risks associated with the storage of these keys are
      discussed in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   If a host receives an ephemeral public key from its peer and a key-
   validation step fails (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), it MUST abort the connection
   and raise an error condition distinct from the end-of-file condition.

   The ephemeral secret ES is the result of the key-agreement algorithm
   (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>) indicated by the negotiated TEP.  The inputs to the
   algorithm are the local host's ephemeral private key and the remote
   host's ephemeral public key.  For example, host A would compute ES
   using its own private key (not transmitted) and host B's public key,
   Pub_B.

   The two sides then compute a pseudo-random key, PRK, from which all
   session secrets are derived, as follows:

          PRK = Extract(N_A, eno_transcript | Init1 | Init2 | ES)

   Above, "|" denotes concatenation, eno_transcript is the protocol-
   negotiation transcript defined in <a href="./rfc8547#section-4.8">SectionÂ 4.8 of [RFC8547]</a>, and Init1
   and Init2 are the transmitted encodings of the messages described in
   <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   A series of session secrets are computed from PRK as follows:

                 ss[0] = PRK
                 ss[i] = CPRF(ss[i-1], CONST_NEXTK, K_LEN)

   The value ss[0] is used to generate all key material for the current
   connection.  The values ss[i] for i &gt; 0 are used by session
   resumption to avoid public key cryptography when establishing
   subsequent connections between the same two hosts as described in
   <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.  The CONST_* values are constants defined in
   <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.  The length K_LEN depends on the tcpcrypt TEP in use,
   and is specified in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   Given a session secret ss[i], the two sides compute a series of
   master keys as follows:

              mk[0] = CPRF(ss[i], CONST_REKEY | sn[i], K_LEN)
              mk[j] = CPRF(mk[j-1], CONST_REKEY, K_LEN)

   The process of advancing through the series of master keys is
   described in <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>.  The values represented by sn[i] are
   session nonces.  For the initial session with i = 0, the session
   nonce is zero bytes long.  The values for subsequent sessions are
   derived from fresh connection data as described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.

   Finally, each master key mk[j] is used to generate traffic keys for
   protecting application data using authenticated encryption:

       k_ab[j] = CPRF(mk[j], CONST_KEY_A, ae_key_len + ae_nonce_len)
       k_ba[j] = CPRF(mk[j], CONST_KEY_B, ae_key_len + ae_nonce_len)

   In the first session derived from fresh key agreement, traffic keys
   k_ab[j] are used by host A to encrypt and host B to decrypt, while
   keys k_ba[j] are used by host B to encrypt and host A to decrypt.  In
   a resumed session, as described more thoroughly in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>, each
   host uses the keys in the same way as it did in the original session,
   regardless of its role in the current session; for example, if a host
   played role "A" in the first session, it will use keys k_ab[j] to
   encrypt in each derived session.

   The values ae_key_len and ae_nonce_len depend on the authenticated-
   encryption algorithm selected and are given in Table 3 of <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.
   The algorithm uses the first ae_key_len bytes of each traffic key as
   an authenticated-encryption key, and it uses the following
   ae_nonce_len bytes as a nonce randomizer.

   Implementations SHOULD provide an interface allowing the user to
   specify, for a particular connection, the set of AEAD algorithms to
   advertise in sym_cipher_list (when playing role "A") and also the
   order of preference to use when selecting an algorithm from those
   offered (when playing role "B").  A companion document [<a href="#ref-TCPINC-API">TCPINC-API</a>]
   describes recommended interfaces for this purpose.

   After host B sends Init2 or host A receives it, that host MAY
   immediately begin transmitting protected application data as
   described in <a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>.

   If host A receives Init2 with a sym_cipher value that was not present

   abort the connection and raise an error condition distinct from the
   end-of-file condition.

   Throughout this document, to "abort the connection" means to issue
   the "Abort" command as described in <a href="./rfc793#section-3.8">SectionÂ 3.8 of [RFC793]</a>.  That

   TCP-ENO requires each TEP to define a session ID value that uniquely
   identifies each encrypted connection.

   A tcpcrypt session ID begins with the byte transmitted by host B that
   contains the negotiated TEP identifier along with the "v" bit.  The
   remainder of the ID is derived from the session secret and session
   nonce, as follows:

    session_id[i] = TEP-byte | CPRF(ss[i], CONST_SESSID | sn[i], K_LEN)

   Again, the length K_LEN depends on the TEP and is specified in
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   If two hosts have previously negotiated a session with secret
   ss[i-1], they can establish a new connection without public-key
   operations using ss[i], the next session secret in the sequence
   derived from the original PRK.

   A host signals its willingness to resume with a particular session
   secret by sending a SYN segment with a resumption suboption, i.e., an
   ENO suboption containing the negotiated TEP identifier of the
   previous session, half of the resumption identifier for the new
   session, and a resumption nonce.

   The resumption nonce MUST have a minimum length of zero bytes and
   maximum length of eight bytes.  The value MUST be chosen randomly or
   using a mechanism that guarantees uniqueness even in the face of
   virtual-machine cloning or other re-execution of the same session.
   An attacker who can force either side of a connection to reuse a
   session secret with the same nonce will completely break the security

   of tcpcrypt.  Reuse of session secrets is possible in the event of
   virtual-machine cloning or reuse of system-level hibernation state.
   Implementations SHOULD provide an API through which to set the
   resumption nonce length and MUST default to eight bytes if they
   cannot prohibit the reuse of session secrets.

   The resumption identifier is calculated from a session secret ss[i]
   as follows:

                 resume[i] = CPRF(ss[i], CONST_RESUME, 18)

   To name a session for resumption, a host sends either the first or
   second half of the resumption identifier according to the role it
   played in the original session with secret ss[0].

   A host that originally played role "A" and wishes to resume from a
   cached session sends a suboption with the first half of the
   resumption identifier:

         byte     0      1             9      10
              +------+------+--...--+------+------+--...--+------+

              | byte |                     |                     |
              +------+------+--...--+------+------+--...--+------+

      Figure 2: Resumption suboption sent when original role was "A".

   The TEP-byte contains a tcpcrypt TEP identifier and v = 1.  The nonce
   value MUST have length between 0 and 8 bytes.

   Similarly, a host that originally played role "B" sends a suboption
   with the second half of the resumption identifier:

         byte     0      1             9      10
              +------+------+--...--+------+------+--...--+------+
              | TEP- |   resume[i]{9..17}  |       nonce_b       |

              +------+------+--...--+------+------+--...--+------+

      Figure 3: Resumption suboption sent when original role was "B".

   The TEP-byte contains a tcpcrypt TEP identifier and v = 1.  The nonce
   value MUST have length between 0 and 8 bytes.

   If a passive opener receives a resumption suboption containing an
   identifier-half that names a session secret that it has cached, and
   the subobtion's TEP matches the TEP used in the previous session, it
   SHOULD (with exceptions specified below) agree to resume from the

   cached session by sending its own resumption suboption, which will
   contain the other half of the identifier.  Otherwise, it MUST NOT
   agree to resumption.

   If a passive opener does not agree to resumption with a particular
   TEP, it MAY either request fresh key exchange by responding with a
   non-resumption suboption using the same TEP or else respond to any
   other received TEP suboption.

   If a passive opener receives an ENO suboption with a TEP identifier
   and v = 1, but the suboption data is less than 9 bytes in length, it
   MUST behave as if the same TEP had been sent with v = 0.  That is,
   the suboption MUST be interpreted as an offer to negotiate fresh key
   exchange with that TEP.

   If an active opener sends a resumption suboption with a particular
   TEP and the appropriate half of a resumption identifier, and then, in
   the same TCP handshake, it receives a resumption suboption with the
   same TEP and an identifier-half that does not match that resumption
   identifier, it MUST ignore that suboption.  In the typical case that
   this was the only ENO suboption received, this means the host MUST
   disable TCP-ENO and tcpcrypt; it MUST NOT send any more ENO options
   and MUST NOT encrypt the connection.

   When a host concludes that TCP-ENO negotiation has succeeded for some
   TEP that was received in a resumption suboption, it MUST then enable
   encryption with that TEP using the cached session secret.  To do
   this, it first constructs sn[i] as follows:

                         sn[i] = nonce_a | nonce_b

   Master keys are then computed from s[i] and sn[i] as described in
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> as well as from application data encrypted as described
   in <a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>.

   The session ID (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>) is constructed in the same way for
   resumed sessions as it is for fresh ones.  In this case, the first
   byte will always have v = 1.  The remainder of the ID is derived from
   the cached session secret and the session nonce that was generated
   during resumption.

   In the case of simultaneous open where TCP-ENO is able to establish
   asymmetric roles, two hosts that simultaneously send SYN segments
   with compatible resumption suboptions MAY resume the associated
   session.

   In a particular SYN segment, a host SHOULD NOT send more than one
   resumption suboption (because this consumes TCP option space and is

   unlikely to be a useful practice), and it MUST NOT send more than one
   resumption suboption with the same TEP identifier.  But in addition
   to any resumption suboptions, an active opener MAY include
   non-resumption suboptions describing other TEPs it supports (in
   addition to the TEP in the resumption suboption).

   After using the session secret ss[i] to compute mk[0],
   implementations SHOULD compute and cache ss[i+1] for possible use by
   a later session and then erase ss[i] from memory.  Hosts MAY retain
   ss[i+1] until it is used or the memory needs to be reclaimed.  Hosts
   SHOULD NOT write any session secrets to non-volatile storage.

   When proposing resumption, the active opener MUST use the lowest
   value of "i" that has not already been used (successfully or not) to
   negotiate resumption with the same host and for the same original
   session secret ss[0].

   A given session secret ss[i] MUST NOT be used to secure more than one
   TCP connection.  To prevent this, a host MUST NOT resume with a
   session secret if it has ever enabled encryption in the past with the
   same secret, in either role.  In the event that two hosts
   simultaneously send SYN segments to each other that propose
   resumption with the same session secret but with both segments not
   part of a simultaneous open, both connections would need to revert to
   fresh key exchange.  To avoid this limitation, implementations MAY
   choose to implement session resumption such that all session secrets
   derived from a given ss[0] are used for either passive or active
   opens at the same host, not both.

   If two hosts have previously negotiated a tcpcrypt session, either
   host MAY later initiate session resumption regardless of which host
   was the active opener or played the "A" role in the previous session.

   However, a given host MUST either encrypt with keys k_ab[j] for all
   sessions derived from the same original session secret ss[0], or with
   keys k_ba[j].  Thus, which keys a host uses to send segments is not
   affected by the role it plays in the current connection: it depends
   only on whether the host played the "A" or "B" role in the initial
   session.

   Implementations that cache session secrets MUST provide a means for
   applications to control that caching.  In particular, when an
   application requests a new TCP connection, it MUST have a way to
   specify two policies for the duration of the connection: 1) that
   resumption requests will be ignored, and thus fresh key exchange will
   be necessary; and 2) that no session secrets will be cached.  (These
   policies can be specified independently or as a unit.)  And for an
   established connection, an application MUST have a means to cause any

   connection to be flushed.  A companion document [<a href="#ref-TCPINC-API">TCPINC-API</a>]

   Following key exchange (or its omission via session resumption), all
   further communication in a tcpcrypt-enabled connection is carried out
   within delimited encryption frames that are encrypted and
   authenticated using the agreed-upon keys.

   This protection is provided via algorithms for Authenticated
   Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).  The permitted algorithms are
   listed in Table 5 of <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.  Additional algorithms can be
   specified in the future according to the policy in that section.  One
   algorithm is selected during the negotiation described in
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.  The lengths ae_key_len and ae_nonce_len associated with
   each algorithm are found in Table 3 of <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> along with
   requirements for which algorithms MUST be implemented.

   The format of an encryption frame is specified in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.  A
   sending host breaks its stream of application data into a series of
   chunks.  Each chunk is placed in the data field of a plaintext value,
   which is then encrypted to yield a frame's ciphertext field.  Chunks
   MUST be small enough that the ciphertext (whose length depends on the
   AEAD cipher used, and is generally slightly longer than the
   plaintext) has length less than 2^16 bytes.

   An "associated data" value (see <a href="#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2</a>) is constructed for the
   frame.  It contains the frame's control field and the length of the
   ciphertext.

   A "frame ID" value (see <a href="#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3</a>) is also constructed for the
   frame, but not explicitly transmitted.  It contains a 64-bit offset
   field whose integer value is the zero-indexed byte offset of the
   beginning of the current encryption frame in the underlying TCP
   datastream.  (That is, the offset in the framing stream, not the
   plaintext application stream.)  The offset is then left-padded with
   zero-valued bytes to form a value of length ae_nonce_len.  Because it
   is strictly necessary for the security of the AEAD algorithms
   specified in this document, an implementation MUST NOT ever transmit
   distinct frames with the same frame ID value under the same
   encryption key.  In particular, a retransmitted TCP segment MUST
   contain the same payload bytes for the same TCP sequence numbers, and
   a host MUST NOT transmit more than 2^64 bytes in the underlying TCP
   datastream (which would cause the offset field to wrap) before
   rekeying as described in <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>.

   Keys for AEAD encryption are taken from the traffic key k_ab[j] or
   k_ba[j] for some "j", according to the host's role as described in
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.  First, the appropriate traffic key is divided into two
   parts:

                      Figure 4: Format of Traffic Key

   With reference to the "AEAD Interface" described in <a href="./rfc5116#section-2">SectionÂ 2 of
   [RFC5116]</a>, the first ae_key_len bytes of the traffic key provide the
   AEAD key K.  The remaining ae_nonce_len bytes provide a nonce
   randomizer value NR, which is combined via bitwise exclusive-or with
   the frame ID to yield N, the AEAD nonce for the frame:

                            N = frame_ID XOR NR

   The remaining AEAD inputs, P and A, are provided by the frame's
   plaintext value and associated data, respectively.  The output of the
   AEAD operation, C, is transmitted in the frame's ciphertext field.

   When a frame is received, tcpcrypt reconstructs the associated data
   and frame ID values (the former contains only data sent in the clear,
   and the latter is implicit in the TCP stream), computes the nonce N
   as above, and provides these and the ciphertext value to the AEAD
   decryption operation.  The output of this operation is either a
   plaintext value P or the special symbol FAIL.  In the latter case,
   the implementation SHOULD abort the connection and raise an error
   condition distinct from the end-of-file condition.  But if none of
   the TCP segment(s) containing the frame have been acknowledged and
   retransmission could potentially result in a valid frame, an
   implementation MAY instead drop these segments (and renege if they
   have been selectively acknowledged (SACKed), according to <a href="./rfc2018#section-8">SectionÂ 8
   of [RFC2018]</a>).

   The ciphertext field of the encryption frame contains protected
   versions of certain TCP header values.

   When the URGp bit is set, the urgent field indicates an offset from
   the current frame's beginning offset; the sum of these offsets gives
   the index of the last byte of urgent data in the application
   datastream.

   A sender MUST set the FINp bit on the last frame it sends in the
   connection (unless it aborts the connection) and MUST NOT set FINp on
   any other frame.

   TCP sets the FIN flag when a sender has no more data, which with
   tcpcrypt means setting FIN on the segment containing the last byte of
   the last frame.  However, a receiver MUST report the end-of-file
   condition to the connection's local user when and only when it
   receives a frame with the FINp bit set.  If a host receives a segment
   with the TCP FIN flag set but the received datastream including this
   segment does not contain a frame with FINp set, the host SHOULD abort
   the connection and raise an error condition distinct from the end-of-
   file condition.  But if there are unacknowledged segments whose
   retransmission could potentially result in a valid frame, the host
   MAY instead drop the segment with the TCP FIN flag set (and renege if
   it has been SACKed, according to <a href="./rfc2018#section-8">SectionÂ 8 of [RFC2018]</a>).

   Rekeying allows hosts to wipe from memory keys that could decrypt
   previously transmitted segments.  It also allows the use of AEAD
   ciphers that can securely encrypt only a bounded number of messages
   under a given key.

   As described in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>, a master key mk[j] is used to generate
   two encryption keys k_ab[j] and k_ba[j].  We refer to these as a key
   set with generation number "j".  Each host maintains both a local
   generation number that determines which key set it uses to encrypt
   outgoing frames and a remote generation number equal to the highest
   generation used in frames received from its peer.  Initially, these
   two generation numbers are set to zero.

   A host MAY increment its local generation number beyond the remote
   generation number it has recorded.  We call this action "initiating
   rekeying".

   When a host has incremented its local generation number and uses the
   new key set for the first time to encrypt an outgoing frame, it MUST
   set rekey = 1 for that frame.  It MUST set rekey = 0 in all other
   cases.

   When a host receives a frame with rekey = 1, it increments its record
   of the remote generation number.  If the remote generation number is
   now greater than the local generation number, the receiver MUST
   immediately increment its local generation number to match.
   Moreover, if the receiver has not yet transmitted a segment with the
   FIN flag set, it MUST immediately send a frame (with empty
   application data if necessary) with rekey = 1.

   A host MUST NOT initiate more than one concurrent rekey operation if
   it has no data to send; that is, it MUST NOT initiate rekeying with
   an empty encryption frame more than once while its record of the
   remote generation number is less than its own.

   Note that when parts of the datastream are retransmitted, TCP
   requires that implementations always send the same data bytes for the
   same TCP sequence numbers.  Thus, frame data in retransmitted
   segments MUST be encrypted with the same key as when it was first
   transmitted, regardless of the current local generation number.

   Implementations SHOULD delete older-generation keys from memory once
   they have received all frames they will need to decrypt with the old
   keys and have encrypted all outgoing frames under the old keys.

   Instead of using TCP keep-alives to verify that the remote endpoint
   is still responsive, tcpcrypt implementations SHOULD employ the
   rekeying mechanism for this purpose, as follows.  When necessary, a
   host SHOULD probe the liveness of its peer by initiating rekeying and
   transmitting a new frame immediately (with empty application data if
   necessary).

   As described in <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>, a host receiving a frame encrypted under
   a generation number greater than its own MUST increment its own
   generation number and (if it has not already transmitted a segment
   with FIN set) immediately transmit a new frame (with zero-length
   application data if necessary).

   Implementations MAY use TCP keep-alives for purposes that do not
   require endpoint authentication, as discussed in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.

   Implementations of this protocol MUST construct Init2 such that the
   field "ignored" has zero length; that is, they MUST construct the

   An encryption frame comprises a control byte and a length-prefixed
   ciphertext value:

          byte   0       1       2       3               clen+2

             +-------+-------+-------+-------+---...---+-------+

   The field clen is an integer in big-endian format and gives the
   length of the ciphertext field.

   The control field has this structure:

                  bit     7                 1       0
                      +-------+---...---+-------+-------+
                      |          cres           | rekey |
                      +-------+---...---+-------+-------+

   The seven-bit field cres is reserved; implementations MUST set these
   bits to zero when sending and MUST ignore them when receiving.

   The use of the rekey field is described in <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.1.%20%20Plaintext"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1" id="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Plaintext</span>

   The ciphertext field is the result of applying the negotiated
   authenticated-encryption algorithm to a plaintext value, which has
   one of these two formats:

          byte   0       1               plen-1

   (Note that clen in the previous section will generally be greater
   than plen, as the ciphertext produced by the authenticated-encryption
   scheme both encrypts the application data and provides redundancy
   with which to verify its integrity.)

   The flags field has this structure:

               bit    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0
                   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

                   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

   The six-bit field fres is reserved; implementations MUST set these
   six bits to zero when sending, and MUST ignore them when receiving.

   When the URGp bit is set, it indicates that the urgent field is
   present, and thus that the plaintext value has the second structure
   variant above; otherwise, the first variant is used.

   The meaning of the urgent field and of the flag bits is described in
   <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>.

   An encryption frame's associated data (which is supplied to the AEAD
   algorithm when decrypting the ciphertext and verifying the frame's
   integrity) has this format:

                       byte   0       1       2
                          +-------+-------+-------+
                          |control|     clen      |
                          +-------+-------+-------+

   It contains the same values as the frame's control and clen fields.

   Lastly, a frame ID (used to construct the nonce for the AEAD
   algorithm) has this format:

          byte  0            ae_nonce_len - 8    ae_nonce_len - 1
                |                   |             |

   The TEP negotiated via TCP-ENO indicates the use of one of the key-
   agreement schemes named in Table 4 in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.  For example,
   TCPCRYPT_ECDHE_P256 names the tcpcrypt protocol using ECDHE-P256
   together with the CPRF and length parameters specified below.

   All the TEPs specified in this document require the use of HKDF-
   Expand-SHA256 as the CPRF, and these lengths for nonces and session
   secrets:

                             N_A_LEN: 32 bytes
                             N_B_LEN: 32 bytes
                             K_LEN:   32 bytes

   Future documents assigning additional TEPs for use with tcpcrypt
   might specify different values for the lengths above.  Note that the
   minimum session ID length specified by TCP-ENO, together with the way
   tcpcrypt constructs session IDs, implies that K_LEN MUST have length
   at least 32 bytes.

   Key-agreement schemes ECDHE-P256 and ECDHE-P521 employ the Elliptic
   Curve Secret Value Derivation Primitive, Diffie-Hellman version

   "Elliptic Curve Point to Octet String Conversion Primitive" described
   in Section E.2.3 of [<a href="#ref-IEEE-1363">IEEE-1363</a>] and are prefixed by a two-byte length

                 +-------+-------+-------+---...---+-------+

   Implementations MUST encode these pubkey values in "compressed
   format".  Implementations MUST validate these pubkey values according
   to the algorithm in Section A.16.10 of [<a href="#ref-IEEE-1363">IEEE-1363</a>].

   Key-agreement schemes ECDHE-Curve25519 and ECDHE-Curve448 perform the
   Diffie-Hellman protocol using the functions X25519 and X448,
   respectively.  Implementations SHOULD compute these functions using
   the algorithms described in [<a href="./rfc7748" title='"Elliptic Curves for Security"'>RFC7748</a>].  When they do so,
   implementations MUST check whether the computed Diffie-Hellman shared
   secret is the all-zero value and abort if so, as described in

    Table 5: Authenticated-Encryption Algorithms for Use with tcpcrypt

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   All of the security considerations of TCP-ENO apply to tcpcrypt.  In
   particular, tcpcrypt does not protect against active network
   attackers unless applications authenticate the session ID.  If it can
   be established that the session IDs computed at each end of the
   connection match, then tcpcrypt guarantees that no man-in-the-middle
   attacks occurred unless the attacker has broken the underlying
   cryptographic primitives, e.g., Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).
   A proof of this property for an earlier version of the protocol has
   been published [<a href="#ref-tcpcrypt" title='"The case for ubiquitous transport-level encryption"'>tcpcrypt</a>].

   To ensure middlebox compatibility, tcpcrypt does not protect TCP
   headers.  Therefore, the protocol is vulnerable to denial-of-service
   from off-path attackers just as plain TCP is.  Possible attacks
   include desynchronizing the underlying TCP stream, injecting RST or
   FIN segments, and forging rekey bits.  These attacks will cause a
   tcpcrypt connection to hang or fail with an error, but not in any
   circumstance where plain TCP could continue uncorrupted.
   Implementations MUST give higher-level software a way to distinguish
   such errors from a clean end-of-stream (indicated by an authenticated
   FINp bit) so that applications can avoid semantic truncation attacks.

   There is no "key confirmation" step in tcpcrypt.  This is not needed
   because tcpcrypt's threat model includes the possibility of a
   connection to an adversary.  If key negotiation is compromised and
   yields two different keys, failed integrity checks on every
   subsequent frame will cause the connection either to hang or to



<span class="grey">Bittau, et al.                Experimental                     [Page 25]</span></pre>

   abort.  This is not a new threat as an active attacker can achieve
   the same results against a plain TCP connection by injecting RST
   segments or modifying sequence and acknowledgement numbers.

   Tcpcrypt uses short-lived public keys to provide forward secrecy;
   once an implementation removes these keys from memory, a compromise
   of the system will not provide any means to derive the session
   secrets for past connections.  All currently-specified key agreement
   schemes involve key agreement based on Ephemeral Elliptic Curve
   Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE), meaning a new key pair can be efficiently
   computed for each connection.  If implementations reuse these
   parameters, they MUST limit the lifetime of the private parameters as
   far as is practical in order to minimize the number of past
   connections that are vulnerable.  Of course, placing private keys in
   persistent storage introduces severe risks that they will not be
   destroyed reliably and in a timely fashion, and it SHOULD be avoided
   whenever possible.

   Attackers cannot force passive openers to move forward in their
   session resumption chain without guessing the content of the
   resumption identifier, which will be difficult without key knowledge.

   The cipher-suites specified in this document all use HMAC-SHA256 to
   implement the collision-resistant pseudo-random function denoted by
   CPRF.  A collision-resistant function is one for which, for
   sufficiently large L, an attacker cannot find two distinct inputs
   (K_1, CONST_1) and (K_2, CONST_2) such that CPRF(K_1, CONST_1, L) =
   CPRF(K_2, CONST_2, L).  Collision resistance is important to assure
   the uniqueness of session IDs, which are generated using the CPRF.

   Lastly, many of tcpcrypt's cryptographic functions require random
   input, and thus any host implementing tcpcrypt MUST have access to a
   cryptographically-secure source of randomness or pseudo-randomness.
   [<a href="./rfc4086" title='"Randomness Requirements for Security"'>RFC4086</a>] provides recommendations on how to achieve this.

   Most implementations will rely on a device's pseudo-random generator,
   seeded from hardware events and a seed carried over from the previous
   boot.  Once a pseudo-random generator has been properly seeded, it
   can generate effectively arbitrary amounts of pseudo-random data.
   However, until a pseudo-random generator has been seeded with
   sufficient entropy, not only will tcpcrypt be insecure, it will
   reveal information that further weakens the security of the pseudo-
   random generator, potentially harming other applications.  As
   REQUIRED by TCP-ENO, implementations MUST NOT send ENO options unless
   they have access to an adequate source of randomness.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.1.%20%20Asymmetric%20Roles"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" id="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Asymmetric Roles</span>

   Tcpcrypt transforms a shared pseudo-random key (PRK) into
   cryptographic traffic keys for each direction.  Doing so requires an
   asymmetry in the protocol, as the key derivation function must be
   perturbed differently to generate different keys in each direction.
   Tcpcrypt includes other asymmetries in the roles of the two hosts,
   such as the process of negotiating algorithms (e.g., proposing vs.
   selecting cipher suites).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.2.%20%20Verified%20Liveness"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" id="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Verified Liveness</span>

   Many hosts implement TCP keep-alives [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>] as an option for
   applications to ensure that the other end of a TCP connection still
   exists even when there is no data to be sent.  A TCP keep-alive
   segment carries a sequence number one prior to the beginning of the
   send window and may carry one byte of "garbage" data.  Such a segment
   causes the remote side to send an acknowledgment.

   Unfortunately, tcpcrypt cannot cryptographically verify keep-alive
   acknowledgments.  Therefore, an attacker could prolong the existence
   of a session at one host after the other end of the connection no
   longer exists.  (Such an attack might prevent a process with
   sensitive data from exiting, giving an attacker more time to
   compromise a host and extract the sensitive data.)

   To counter this threat, tcpcrypt specifies a way to stimulate the
   remote host to send verifiably fresh and authentic data, described in
   <a href="#section-3.9">Section 3.9</a>.

   The TCP keep-alive mechanism has also been used for its effects on
   intermediate nodes in the network, such as preventing flow state from
   expiring at NAT boxes or firewalls.  As these purposes do not require
   the authentication of endpoints, implementations MAY safely
   accomplish them using either the existing TCP keep-alive mechanism or
   tcpcrypt's verified keep-alive mechanism.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.3.%20%20Mandatory%20Key-Agreement%20Schemes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.3" id="section-8.3">8.3</a>.  Mandatory Key-Agreement Schemes</span>

   This document mandates that tcpcrypt implementations provide support
   for at least one key-agreement scheme: ECDHE using Curve25519.  This
   choice of a single mandatory algorithm is the result of a difficult
   tradeoff between cryptographic diversity and the ease and security of
   actual deployment.

   The IETF's appraisal of best current practice on this matter
   [<a href="./rfc7696" title='"Guidelines for Cryptographic Algorithm Agility and Selecting Mandatory-to-Implement Algorithms"'>RFC7696</a>] says, "Ideally, two independent sets of mandatory-to-
   implement algorithms will be specified, allowing for a primary suite



<span class="grey">Bittau, et al.                Experimental                     [Page 27]</span></pre>

   and a secondary suite.  This approach ensures that the secondary
   suite is widely deployed if a flaw is found in the primary one."

   To meet that ideal, it might appear natural to also mandate ECDHE
   using P-256.  However, implementing the Diffie-Hellman function using
   NIST elliptic curves (including those specified for use with
   tcpcrypt, P-256 and P-521) appears to be very difficult to achieve
   without introducing vulnerability to side-channel attacks
   [<a href="#ref-NIST-fail">NIST-fail</a>].  Although well-trusted implementations are available as
   part of large cryptographic libraries, these can be difficult to
   extract for use in operating-system kernels where tcpcrypt is usually
   best implemented.  In contrast, the characteristics of Curve25519
   together with its recent popularity has led to many safe and
   efficient implementations, including some that fit naturally into the
   kernel environment.

   [<a id="ref-RFC7696">RFC7696</a>] insists that, "The selected algorithms need to be resistant
   to side-channel attacks and also meet the performance, power, and
   code size requirements on a wide variety of platforms."  On this
   principle, tcpcrypt excludes the NIST curves from the set of
   mandatory-to-implement key-agreement algorithms.

   Lastly, this document encourages support for key agreement with
   Curve448, categorizing it as RECOMMENDED.  Curve448 appears likely to
   admit safe and efficient implementations.  However, support is not
   REQUIRED because existing implementations might not yet be
   sufficiently well proven.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Experiments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Experiments</span>

   Some experience will be required to determine whether the tcpcrypt
   protocol can be deployed safely and successfully across the diverse
   environments of the global internet.

   Safety means that TCP implementations that support tcpcrypt are able
   to communicate reliably in all the same settings as they would
   without tcpcrypt.  As described in <a href="./rfc8547#section-9">SectionÂ 9 of [RFC8547]</a>, this
   property can be subverted if middleboxes strip ENO options from
   non-SYN segments after allowing them in SYN segments, or if the
   particular communication patterns of tcpcrypt offend the policies of
   middleboxes doing deep-packet inspection.

   Success, in addition to safety, means hosts that implement tcpcrypt
   actually enable encryption when connecting to one another.  This
   property depends on the network's treatment of the TCP-ENO handshake
   and can be subverted if middleboxes merely strip unknown TCP options
   or terminate TCP connections and relay data back and forth
   unencrypted.

   Ease of implementation will be a further challenge to deployment.
   Because tcpcrypt requires encryption operations on frames that may
   span TCP segments, kernel implementations are forced to buffer
   segments in different ways than are necessary for plain TCP.  More
   implementation experience will show how much additional code
   complexity is required in various operating systems and what kind of
   performance effects can be expected.
