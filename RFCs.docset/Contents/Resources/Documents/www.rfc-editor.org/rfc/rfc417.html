   We have noticed that TENEX systems use link numbers outside the
   allowed range.  This is a violation of the official HOST-HOST
   protocol.  This causes problems with some sites when attempting to
   establish connections with TENEX systems.  We urge that this problem
   be corrected by bringing all TENEX systems into conformance with the
   established official protocol
