Abstract

   This specification defines a TLS handshake message for exchange of
   supplemental application data.  TLS hello message extensions are used
   to determine which supplemental data types are supported by both the
   TLS client and the TLS server.  Then, the supplemental data handshake
   message is used to exchange the data.  Other documents will define
   the syntax of these extensions and the syntax of the associated
   supplemental data types.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4680">RFC 4680</a>      TLS Handshake Message for Supplemental Data September 2006</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Recent standards activities have proposed different mechanisms for
   transmitting supplemental application data in the TLS handshake
   message.  For example, recent proposals transfer data that is not
   processed by the TLS protocol itself, but assist the TLS-protected
   application in the authentication and authorization decisions.  One
   proposal transfers user name hints for locating credentials, and
   another proposal transfers attribute certificates and Security
   Assertions Markup Language (SAML) assertions for authorization
   checks.

   In order to avoid definition of multiple handshake messages, one for
   each new type of application-specific supplemental data, this
   specification defines a new handshake message type that bundles
   together all data objects that are to be delivered to the TLS-
   protected application and sends them in a single handshake message.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-N1" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>N1</a>].

   The syntax for the supplemental_data handshake message is defined
   using the TLS Presentation Language, which is specified in Section 4
   of [<a href="#ref-N2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>N2</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Supplemental%20Data%20Handshake%20Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Supplemental Data Handshake Message</span>

   The new supplemental_data handshake message type is defined to
   accommodate communication of supplemental data objects as agreed
   during the exchange of extensions in the client and server hello
   messages.  See <a href="./rfc2246">RFC 2246</a> (TLS 1.0) [<a href="#ref-N2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>N2</a>] and <a href="./rfc4346">RFC 4346</a> (TLS 1.1) [<a href="#ref-N3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>N3</a>]
   for other handshake message types.

   Information provided in a supplemental data object MUST be intended
   to be used exclusively by applications and protocols above the TLS
   protocol layer.  Any such data MUST NOT need to be processed by the
   TLS protocol.

      struct {

      enum {
            (65535)
        } SupplementalDataType;

   supp_data_length
      This field is the length (in bytes) of the data selected by
      SupplementalDataType.

   The client MUST NOT send more than one SupplementalData handshake
   message, and the server MUST NOT send more than one SupplementalData
   handshake message.  Receiving more than one SupplementalData
   handshake message results in a fatal error, and the receiver MUST
   close the connection with a fatal unexpected_message alert.

   If present, the SupplementalData handshake message MUST contain a
   non-empty SupplementalDataEntry structure carrying data associated
   with at least one defined SupplementalDataType.  An explicit
   agreement that governs presence of any supplemental data MUST be
   concluded between client and server for each SupplementalDataType
   using the TLS extensions [<a href="#ref-N4" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions"'>N4</a>] in the client and server hello
   messages.  Receiving an unexpected SupplementalData handshake message
   results in a fatal error, and the receiver MUST close the connection
   with a fatal unexpected_message alert.

   Other documents will define specific SupplementalDataTypes and their
   associated data syntax and processing.  These same specifications
   must also specify the client and server hello message extensions that
   are used to negotiate the support for the specified supplemental data
   type.  This document simply specifies the TLS Handshake Protocol
   message that will carry the supplemental data objects.

   Different situations require the transfer of supplemental data from
   the client to the server, require the transfer of supplemental data
   from the server to the client, or both ways.  All three situations
   are fully supported.

   The SupplementalData handshake message, if exchanged, MUST be sent as
   the first handshake message as illustrated in Figure 1 below.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Each SupplementalDataType included in the handshake message defined
   in this specification introduces its own unique set of security
   properties and related considerations.  Security considerations must
   therefore be defined in each document that defines a supplemental
   data type.

   In some cases, the SupplementalData information may be sensitive.
   The double handshake technique can be used to provide protection for
   the SupplementalData information.  Figure 2 illustrates the double
   handshake, where the initial handshake does not include any
   extensions, but it does result in protected communications.  Then, a
   second handshake that includes the SupplementalData information is
   performed using the protected communications.  In Figure 2, the
   number on the right side indicates the amount of protection for the
   TLS message on that line.  A zero (0) indicates that there is no
   communication protection; a one (1) indicates that protection is
   provided by the first TLS session; and a two (2) indicates that
   protection is provided by both TLS sessions.

   The placement of the SupplementalData message in the TLS Handshake
   results in the server providing its SupplementalData information
   before the client is authenticated.  In many situations, servers will
   not want to provide authorization information until the client is
   authenticated.  The double handshake illustrated in Figure 2 provides
   a technique to ensure that the parties are mutually authenticated
   before either party provides SupplementalData information.

   IANA has taken the following actions:

   1) Created an entry, supplemental_data(23), in the existing registry
      for HandshakeType (defined in <a href="./rfc2246">RFC 2246</a> [<a href="#ref-N2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>N2</a>]).

   2) Established a registry for TLS Supplemental Data Formats
      (SupplementalDataType).  Values in the inclusive range 0-16385
      (decimal) are assigned via <a href="./rfc2434">RFC 2434</a> [<a href="#ref-N5" title="">N5</a>] Standards Action.  Values
