Abstract

   This document describes mechanisms which enable the Layer Two
   Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) to negotiate desired Per Hop Behavior (PHB)
   code for the L2TP control connection, as well as individual sessions
   within an L2TP tunnel.

   L2TP provides a standard method for tunneling PPP packets.  The
   current specification provides no provisions for supporting
   Differentiated Services (diffserv) over the L2TP control connection
   or subsequent data sessions.  As a result, no standard mechanism
   currently exists within L2TP to provide L2TP protocol negotiations
   for service discrimination.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>].

   The L2TP specification currently provides no mechanism for supporting
   diffserv (DS).  This document describes mechanisms that enable L2TP
   to indicate desired PHB code, as defined in [<a href="./rfc3140">RFC 3140</a>], to be
   associated with an L2TP control connection, as well as individual
   sessions within an L2TP tunnel.

   The actual bit interpretation of the DS field is beyond the scope of
   this document, and is purposefully omitted.  This document is
   concerned only with defining a uniform exchange and subsequent
   mapping mechanism for the DS AVPs.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3308">RFC 3308</a>                L2TP Diffserv Extension            November 2002</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Control%20Connection%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Control Connection Operation</span>

   As defined in [<a href="./rfc2661">RFC 2661</a>], a control connection operates in-band over
   a tunnel to control the establishment, release, and maintenance of
   sessions and of the tunnel itself.  As such, this document provides a
   mechanism to enable discrimination of L2TP control messages from
   other packets.  For this purpose, we introduce the Control Connection
   DS (CCDS) AVP.

   The presence of the CCDS AVP serves as an indication to the peer (LAC
   or LNS) that the tunnel initiator wishes both the tunnel initiator
   and terminator to use the per-hop behavior(s) (PHB(s)) indicated by
   the AVP's PHB code for all packets within the tunnel's control
   connection.  A PHB is a description of the externally observable
   forwarding behavior of a DS node applied to a particular DS behavior
   aggregate, as defined in [<a href="./rfc2475">RFC 2475</a>].  The most simple example of a
   PHB is one which guarantees a minimal bandwidth allocation of a link
   to a behavior aggregate.

   Upon receipt of a Start-Control-Connection-Request (SCCRQ) containing
   the CCDS AVP, if the tunnel terminator provides no support for the
   CCDS AVP it MUST ignore the AVP and send an SCCRP to the tunnel
   initiator without the CCDS AVP.  The tunnel initiator interprets the
   absence of the CCDS AVP in the SCCRP as an indication that the tunnel
   terminator is incapable of supporting CCDS.

   Upon receipt of an SCCRP that contains no CCDS AVP in response to a
   SCCRQ that contained a CCDS AVP, if the tunnel initiator wants to
   continue tunnel establishment it sends an SCCCN.  Otherwise, it sends
   a StopCCN to the tunnel terminator to end the connection.  The
   StopCCN control message MUST contain the Result Code 8 that indicates
   CCDS AVP value (47) as the reason for sending the StopCCN.

   If the tunnel terminator provides support for CCDS, it SHOULD use the
   Host Name AVP embedded in SCCRQ to consult its local policy, and to
   determine whether local policy permits the requested PHB code to be
   used on this control connection.  If it is unwilling or unable to
   support the requested PHB code after consulting the local policy, the
   tunnel terminator MUST send an SCCRP control message containing a
   CCDS AVP indicating the value it is willing to use.  If the CCDS AVP
   value is the same as the one in the SCCRQ, it signals the acceptance
   of the requested PHB code.  If the value is different it serves as a
   counter-offer by the tunnel terminator.

   If the tunnel initiator receives an SCCRP that contains a CCDS AVP
   with a value other than that requested in the SCCRQ, the tunnel
   initiator SHOULD check the PHB code against its own policy.  If it is
   unwilling to use the value, the tunnel initiator MUST send a StopCCN
   control message containing the Result Code 8 that indicates CCDS AVP
   value (47) as the reason for sending the StopCCN.

   The CCDS AVP is encoded as Vendor ID 0, and the Attribute Type is 47.

   Each CCDS AVP is encoded as follows:

     Vendor ID = 0
     Attribute = 47

    0                   1                   2                   3

   This AVP MAY be present in the following message types:  SCCRQ and
   SCCRP.  This AVP MAY be hidden (the H-bit set to 0 or 1) and is
   optional (M-bit not set).  The length (before hiding) of this AVP
   MUST be 8 octets.  The encoding of the PHB code is described in
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Session%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Session Operation</span>

   As defined in [<a href="./rfc2661">RFC 2661</a>], an L2TP session is connection-oriented. The
   LAC and LNS maintain states for each call that is initiated or
   answered by an LAC.  An L2TP session is created between the LAC and
   LNS when an end-to-end connection is established between a Remote
   System and the LNS.  Datagrams related to the connection are sent
   over the tunnel between the LAC and LNS.  As such, this document
   provides a mechanism to enable discrimination for packets within a
   particular session from those in other sessions.  For this purpose,
   we introduce the Session DS (SDS) AVP.

   The presence of the SDS AVP serves as an indication to the peer (LAC
   or LNS) that the session initiator wishes both the session initiator
   and terminator to use the per-hop behavior(s) (PHB(s)) indicated by
   the AVP's PHB code for all packets within the session.

   Upon receipt of an Incoming-Call-Request (ICRQ) or Outgoing-Call-
   Request (OCRQ) containing the SDS AVP if the session terminator
   provides no support for the requested PHB code, the session
   terminator MUST ignore the SDS AVP and send an ICRP or OCRP to the
   session initiator without the SDS AVP.  The session initiator
   interprets the absence of the SDS AVP in the ICRP or OCRP as an
   indication that the session terminator is incapable of supporting
   SDS.

   Upon receipt of an ICRP or OCRP that contains no SDS AVP in response
   to an ICRQ or OCRQ that contained an SDS AVP, if the session
   initiator is willing to omit employing SDS AVP it continues session
   establishment as defined in [<a href="./rfc2661">RFC 2661</a>].  Otherwise, it sends a CDN to
   the session terminator to end the connection.  The CDN control
   message MUST contain the Result Code 12 that indicates SDS AVP value
   (48) as the reason for sending the CDN.

   In order to help the session terminator to distinguish one session
   from another when consulting the local policy of the PHB code, the
   session initiator MAY use the identifier or a combination of
   identifiers embedded in AVPs such as Proxy Authen Name AVP, Calling
   Number AVP, Called Number AVP, and Sub-Address AVP.  When Proxy
   Authen Name AVP is used as a distinguishor, it SHOULD be present in
   the ICRQ or OCRQ.  The designated DS identifier(s) used for looking
   up the PHB code SHOULD be configurable.

   If the session terminator provides support for SDS, it SHOULD use the
   the designated DS identification AVP (via out-of-band agreement
   between the administrators of the LAC and LNS) to consult the local
   policy and determinate whether the local policy permits the requested
   PHB code to be used on this session.  If it is unwilling or unable to
   support the requested PHB code the session terminator MUST do one of
   the following:

   1) Send a CDN message containing the Result Code 12 that indicates
      SDS AVP value (48) as the reason for sending the CDN.

   2) Send an Incoming-Call-Reply (ICRP) or Outgoing-Call-Reply (OCRP)
      message containing an SDS AVP indicating the PHB code the
      terminator is willing to use for the session.

   If the session terminator supports the PHB code in the SDS AVP
   session establishment MUST continue as defined in [<a href="./rfc2661">RFC 2661</a>].

   If the session initiator receives an ICRP or OCRP that contains an
   SDS AVP with a value other than that requested in the ICRQ or OCRQ,
   and the session initiator is unwilling to use the value, the session
   initiator MUST send a CDN message containing the Result Code 12 that

   the session initiator receives an ICRP or OCRP that contains an SDS
   AVP with a value other than that requested in the ICRQ or OCRQ, and

   initiator MUST proceed as indicated in [<a href="./rfc2661">RFC 2661</a>].

   This AVP MAY be present in the following message types:  ICRQ, ICRP,
   OCRQ and OCRP.  This AVP MAY be hidden (the H-bit set to 0 or 1) and
   is optional (M-bit is not set 0).  The length (before hiding) of this

   CCDS AVP and SDS AVP are independent of each other.  CCDS AVP is used
   to signal diffserv for the control connection between two L2TP peers,
   while SDS AVP is used for data connection.  The PHB code signaled in
   one AVP SHOULD NOT have any implication on the PHB code signaled in
   the other AVP.  Implementations MAY choose to implement either or
   both DS AVPs, and operations MAY choose to enable diffserv on either
   or both types of connections.

   The PHB code is a left-justified 16-bit field using Per Hop Behavior
   (PHB) encoding defined in [<a href="./rfc3140">RFC 3140</a>].  Note that [<a href="./rfc3140">RFC 3140</a>] and its
   successor are the ultimate authority defining PHB encoding.

   Upon successful establishment of an L2TP tunnel control connection or
   individual L2TP session employing the appropriate DS AVP defined in
   this document, both LAC and LNS MUST use their own PHB-to-DSCP
   mappings of their present DS domains to map the PHB to a DSCP and
   place it in the DS field of the outer IP header of packets
   transmitted on the connection.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20DSCP%20Selection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>. DSCP Selection</span>

   The requirements or rules of each service and DSCP mapping are set
   through administrative policy mechanisms which are outside the scope
   of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20Packet%20Reordering%20and%20Sequence%20Numbers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>. Packet Reordering and Sequence Numbers</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC 2474">RFC 2474</a>] RECOMMENDS that PHB implementations not cause reordering
   of packets within an individual connection.  [<a href="./rfc3140">RFC 3140</a>] requires that
   a set of PHBs signaled using a single PHB ID MUST NOT cause
   additional packet reordering within an individual connection vs.
   using a single PHB.  Since the CCDS and SDS AVPs contain one PHB ID,
   use of diffserv PHBs in accordance with this specification should not
   cause additional packet reordering within an L2TP control or data
   connection.

   Sequence numbers are required to be present in all control messages
   and are used to provide reliable delivery on the control connection,
   as defined in [<a href="./rfc2661">RFC 2661</a>].  While packet reordering is inevitably as
   much a function of the network as it is local traffic conditioning,
   the probability of it occurring when employing the CCDS AVP is same
   as when not employing the AVP.  Data messages MAY use sequence
   numbers to reorder packets and detect lost packets.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20Crossing%20Differentiated%20Services%20Boundaries"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>. Crossing Differentiated Services Boundaries</span>

   With the potential that an L2TP connection traverses an arbitrary
   number of DS domains, signaling PHBs via L2TP is more appropriate
   than signaling DSCPs, because it maintains a consistent end-to-end
   differentiated service for the L2TP connection.  As per [<a href="./rfc2983">RFC 2983</a>],
   the negotiated PHBs are mapped to locally defined DSCPs of the
   current DS domain at the tunnel ingress node.  At the DS domain
   boundary nodes, the DSCPs can be rewritten in the DS field of the
   outer IP header, so that the DSCPs are always with respect to
   whatever DS domain the packet happens to be in.

   As a result, it is perfectly acceptable that the outermost DS field
   of packets arriving on a given control connection or session are not
   marked with the same DSCP value that was used by the tunnel ingress
   node.

   This encoding in itself raises no security issues.  However, users of
   this encoding should consider that modifying a DSCP MAY constitute
   theft or denial of service, so protocols using this encoding MUST be
   adequately protected.  No new security issues beyond those discussed
