IESG Note

   This document describes a directory access protocol that provides
   both read and update access.  Update access requires secure
   authentication, but this document does not mandate implementation of
   any satisfactory authentication mechanisms.

   In accordance with <a href="./rfc2026#section-4.4.1">RFC 2026, section 4.4.1</a>, this specification is
   being approved by IESG as a Proposed Standard despite this
   limitation, for the following reasons:

   a. to encourage implementation and interoperability testing of
      these protocols (with or without update access) before they
      are deployed, and

   b. to encourage deployment and use of these protocols in read-only
      applications.  (e.g. applications where LDAPv3 is used as
      a query language for directories which are updated by some
      secure mechanism other than LDAP), and

   c. to avoid delaying the advancement and deployment of other Internet
      standards-track protocols which require the ability to query, but
      not update, LDAPv3 directory servers.

   Readers are hereby warned that until mandatory authentication
   mechanisms are standardized, clients and servers written according to
   this specification which make use of update functionality are
   UNLIKELY TO INTEROPERATE, or MAY INTEROPERATE ONLY IF AUTHENTICATION
   IS REDUCED TO AN UNACCEPTABLY WEAK LEVEL.

   Implementors are hereby discouraged from deploying LDAPv3 clients or
   servers which implement the update functionality, until a Proposed
   Standard for mandatory authentication in LDAPv3 has been approved and
   published as an RFC.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Abstract"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Abstract</span>

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)"'>1</a>] requires that
   the contents of AttributeValue fields in protocol elements be octet
   strings.  This document defines a set of syntaxes for LDAPv3, and the
   rules by which attribute values of these syntaxes are represented as
   octet strings for transmission in the LDAP protocol.  The syntaxes
   defined in this document are referenced by this and other documents
   that define attribute types.  This document also defines the set of
   attribute types which LDAP servers should support.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Overview</span>

   This document defines the framework for developing schemas for
   directories accessible via the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

   Schema is the collection of attribute type definitions, object class
   definitions and other information which a server uses to determine
   how to match a filter or attribute value assertion (in a compare
   operation) against the attributes of an entry, and whether to permit
   add and modify operations.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> states the general requirements and notations for attribute
   types, object classes, syntax and matching rule definitions.

   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> lists attributes, <a href="#section-6">section 6</a> syntaxes and <a href="#section-7">section 7</a> object
   classes.

   Additional documents define schemas for representing real-world
   objects as directory entries.

   This document describes encodings used in an Internet protocol.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>4</a>].

   Attribute Type and Object Class definitions are written in a string
   representation of the AttributeTypeDescription and
   ObjectClassDescription data types defined in X.501(93) [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>].
   Implementors are strongly advised to first read the description of
   how schema is represented in X.500 before reading the rest of this
   document.

   For the purposes of defining the encoding rules for attribute
   syntaxes, the following BNF definitions will be used.  They are based
   on the BNF styles of <a href="./rfc822">RFC 822</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Standard of the Format of ARPA-Internet Text Messages"'>13</a>].

   In the following BNF for the string representation of OBJECT
   IDENTIFIERs, descr is the syntactic representation of an object
   descriptor, which consists of letters and digits, starting with a
   letter.  An OBJECT IDENTIFIER in the numericoid format should not
   have leading zeroes (e.g. "0.9.3" is permitted but "0.09.3" should
   not be generated).

   When encoding 'oid' elements in a value, the descr encoding option
   SHOULD be used in preference to the numericoid. An object descriptor
   is a more readable alias for a number OBJECT IDENTIFIER, and these
   (where assigned and known by the implementation) SHOULD be used in
   preference to numeric oids to the greatest extent possible.  Examples
   of object descriptors in LDAP are attribute type, object class and
   matching rule names.

   The attribute types are described by sample values for the subschema
   "attributeTypes" attribute, which is written in the
   AttributeTypeDescription syntax.  While lines have been folded for
   readability, the values transferred in protocol would not contain
   newlines.

   The AttributeTypeDescription is encoded according to the following
   BNF, and the productions for oid, qdescrs and qdstring are given in
   <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>.  Implementors should note that future versions of this
   document may have expanded this BNF to include additional terms.
   Terms which begin with the characters "X-" are reserved for private

   SHOULD provide at least one of the "SUP" and "SYNTAX" fields for each

   Servers MUST implement all the attribute types referenced in sections
   5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.

   Servers MAY recognize additional names and attributes not listed in
   this document, and if they do so, MUST publish the definitions of the
   types in the attributeTypes attribute of their subschema entries.

   Schema developers MUST NOT create attribute definitions whose names
   conflict with attributes defined for use with LDAP in existing
   standards-track RFCs.

   An AttributeDescription can be used as the value in a NAME part of an
   AttributeTypeDescription.  Note that these are case insensitive.

   Note that the AttributeTypeDescription does not list the matching
   rules which can can be used with that attribute type in an
   extensibleMatch search filter.  This is done using the
   matchingRuleUse attribute described in <a href="#section-4.5">section 4.5</a>.

   This document refines the schema description of X.501 by requiring
   that the syntax field in an AttributeTypeDescription be a string
   representation of an OBJECT IDENTIFIER for the LDAP string syntax
   definition, and an optional indication of the maximum length of a
   value of this attribute (defined in <a href="#section-4.3.2">section 4.3.2</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20Syntaxes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>. Syntaxes</span>

   This section defines general requirements for LDAP attribute value
   syntax encodings. All documents defining attribute syntax encodings
   for use with LDAP are expected to conform to these requirements.

   The encoding rules defined for a given attribute syntax must produce
   octet strings.  To the greatest extent possible, encoded octet
   strings should be usable in their native encoded form for display
   purposes. In particular, encoding rules for attribute syntaxes
   defining non-binary values should produce strings that can be
   displayed with little or no translation by clients implementing LDAP.
   There are a few cases (e.g. audio) however, when it is not sensible
   to produce a printable representation, and clients MUST NOT assume
   that an unrecognized syntax is a string representation.

   In encodings where an arbitrary string, not a Distinguished Name, is
   used as part of a larger production, and other than as part of a
   Distinguished Name, a backslash quoting mechanism is used to escape
   the following separator symbol character (such as "'", "$" or "#") if
   it should occur in that string.  The backslash is followed by a pair
   of hexadecimal digits representing the next character.  A backslash
   itself in the string which forms part of a larger syntax is always
   transmitted as '\5C' or '\5c'. An example is given in <a href="#section-6.27">section 6.27</a>.





<span class="grey">Wahl, et. al.               Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

   Syntaxes are also defined for matching rules whose assertion value
   syntax is different from the attribute value syntax.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.1%20%20Binary%20Transfer%20of%20Values"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.1" id="section-4.3.1">4.3.1</a>  Binary Transfer of Values</span>

   This encoding format is used if the binary encoding is requested by
   the client for an attribute, or if the attribute syntax name is
   "1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.5".  The contents of the LDAP
   AttributeValue or AssertionValue field is a BER-encoded instance of
   the attribute value or a matching rule assertion value ASN.1 data
   type as defined for use with X.500. (The first byte inside the OCTET
   STRING wrapper is a tag octet.  However, the OCTET STRING is still
   encoded in primitive form.)

   All servers MUST implement this form for both generating attribute
   values in search responses, and parsing attribute values in add,
   compare and modify requests, if the attribute type is recognized and
   the attribute syntax name is that of Binary.  Clients which request
   that all attributes be returned from entries MUST be prepared to
   receive values in binary (e.g. userCertificate;binary), and SHOULD
   NOT simply display binary or unrecognized values to users.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.2.%20Syntax%20Object%20Identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.2" id="section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a>. Syntax Object Identifiers</span>

   Syntaxes for use with LDAP are named by OBJECT IDENTIFIERs, which are
   dotted-decimal strings.  These are not intended to be displayed to
   users.

   noidlen = numericoid [ "{" len "}" ]

   len     = numericstring

   The following table lists some of the syntaxes that have been defined
   for LDAP thus far.  The H-R column suggests whether a value in that
   syntax would likely be a human readable string.  Clients and servers
   need not implement all the syntaxes listed here, and MAY implement
   other syntaxes.

   Other documents may define additional syntaxes.  However, the
   definition of additional arbitrary syntaxes is strongly deprecated
   since it will hinder interoperability: today's client and server
   implementations generally do not have the ability to dynamically
   recognize new syntaxes.  In most cases attributes will be defined
   with the syntax for directory strings.

   A suggested minimum upper bound on the number of characters in value
   with a string-based syntax, or the number of bytes in a value for all
   other syntaxes, may be indicated by appending this bound count inside
   of curly braces following the syntax name's OBJECT IDENTIFIER in an
   Attribute Type Description.  This bound is not part of the syntax
   name itself.  For instance, "1.3.6.4.1.1466.0{64}" suggests that
   server implementations should allow a string to be 64 characters
   long, although they may allow longer strings.  Note that a single
   character of the Directory String syntax may be encoded in more than
   one byte since UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding.

   The following BNF may be used to associate a short description with a
   syntax OBJECT IDENTIFIER. Implementors should note that future
   versions of this document may expand this definition to include
   additional terms.  Terms whose identifier begins with "X-" are
   reserved for private experiments, and MUST be followed by a
   &lt;qdstrings&gt;.

   The format for representation of object classes is defined in X.501
   [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]. In general every entry will contain an abstract class ("top" or
   "alias"), at least one structural object class, and zero or more
   auxiliary object classes.  Whether an object class is abstract,
   structural or auxiliary is defined when the object class identifier
   is assigned.  An object class definition should not be changed
   without having a new identifier assigned to it.

   Object class descriptions are written according to the following BNF.
   Implementors should note that future versions of this document may
   expand this definition to include additional terms.  Terms whose
   identifier begins with "X-" are reserved for private experiments, and
   MUST be followed by a &lt;qdstrings&gt; encoding.

      whsp ")"

   These are described as sample values for the subschema
   "objectClasses" attribute for a server which implements the LDAP
   schema. While lines have been folded for readability, the values
   transferred in protocol would not contain newlines.

   Servers SHOULD implement all the object classes referenced in <a href="#section-7">section</a>
   <a href="#section-7">7</a>, except for extensibleObject, which is optional. Servers MAY
   implement additional object classes not listed in this document, and
   if they do so, MUST publish the definitions of the classes in the
   objectClasses attribute of their subschema entries.

   Schema developers MUST NOT create object class definitions whose
   names conflict with attributes defined for use with LDAP in existing
   standards-track RFCs.

   Matching rules are used by servers to compare attribute values
   against assertion values when performing Search and Compare
   operations.  They are also used to identify the value to be added or
   deleted when modifying entries, and are used when comparing a
   purported distinguished name with the name of an entry.

   Most of the attributes given in this document will have an equality
   matching rule defined.

   Matching rule descriptions are written according to the following
   BNF.  Implementors should note that future versions of this document
   may have expanded this BNF to include additional terms.  Terms whose
   identifier begins with "X-" are reserved for private experiments, and

   Values of the matchingRuleUse list the attributes which are suitable
   for use with an extensible matching rule.

      MatchingRuleUseDescription = "(" whsp
          numericoid whsp  ; MatchingRule identifier
          [ "NAME" qdescrs ]

          [ "OBSOLETE" ]
         "APPLIES" oids    ; AttributeType identifiers
      whsp ")"

   Servers which support matching rules and the extensibleMatch SHOULD
   implement all the matching rules in <a href="#section-8">section 8</a>.

   Servers MAY implement additional matching rules not listed in this
   document, and if they do so, MUST publish the definitions of the
   matching rules in the matchingRules attribute of their subschema
   entries. If the server supports the extensibleMatch, then the server
   MUST publish the relationship between the matching rules and
   attributes in the matchingRuleUse attribute.

   For example, a server which implements a privately-defined matching
   rule for performing sound-alike matches on Directory String-valued
   attributes would include the following in the subschema entry
   (1.2.3.4.5 is an example, the OID of an actual matching rule would be
   different):

   matchingRule: ( 1.2.3.4.5 NAME 'soundAlikeMatch'
    SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

   If this matching rule could be used with the attributes 2.5.4.41 and
   2.5.4.15, the following would also be present:

   matchingRuleUse: ( 1.2.3.4.5 APPLIES (2.5.4.41 $ 2.5.4.15) )

   A client could then make use of this matching rule by sending a
   search operation in which the filter is of the extensibleMatch
   choice, the matchingRule field is "soundAlikeMatch", and the type
   field is "2.5.4.41" or "2.5.4.15".

   A string in this syntax is encoded in the UTF-8 form of ISO 10646 (a
   superset of Unicode).  Servers and clients MUST be prepared to
   receive encodings of arbitrary Unicode characters, including
   characters not presently assigned to any character set.

   For characters in the PrintableString form, the value is encoded as
   the string value itself.

   If it is of the TeletexString form, then the characters are
   transliterated to their equivalents in UniversalString, and encoded
   in UTF-8 [<a href="#ref-9" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of Unicode and ISO 10646"'>9</a>].

   If it is of the UniversalString or BMPString forms [<a href="#ref-10">10</a>], UTF-8 is
   used to encode them.

   Note: the form of DirectoryString is not indicated in protocol unless
   the attribute value is carried in binary.  Servers which convert to
   DAP MUST choose an appropriate form.  Servers MUST NOT reject values
   merely because they contain legal Unicode characters outside of the

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      otherMailbox = mailbox-type "$" mailbox

      mailbox-type = printablestring

      mailbox = &lt;an encoded IA5 String&gt;

   In the above, mailbox-type represents the type of mail system in
   which the mailbox resides, for example "MCIMail"; and mailbox is the

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      postal-address = dstring *( "$" dstring )

   In the above, each dstring component of a postal address value is
   encoded as a value of type Directory String syntax.  Backslashes and
   dollar characters, if they occur in the component, are quoted as
   described in <a href="#section-4.3">section 4.3</a>.   Many servers limit the postal address to
   six lines of up to thirty characters.

   Example:

      1234 Main St.$Anytown, CA 12345$USA

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can be
   people, organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   The transformations of an AttributeValue value from its X.501 form to
   an LDAP string representation are not always reversible back to the
   same BER or DER form.  An example of a situation which requires the
   DER form of a distinguished name is the verification of an X.509
   certificate.

   For example, a distinguished name consisting of one RDN with one AVA,
   in which the type is commonName and the value is of the TeletexString
   choice with the letters 'Sam' would be represented in LDAP as the
   string CN=Sam.  Another distinguished name in which the value is
   still 'Sam' but of the PrintableString choice would have the same
   representation CN=Sam.

   Applications which require the reconstruction of the DER form of the
   value SHOULD NOT use the string representation of attribute syntaxes
   when converting a value to LDAP format.  Instead it SHOULD use the
