         <span class="h1">An IANA Registry for Level of Assurance (LoA) Profiles</span>

Abstract

   This document establishes an IANA registry for Level of Assurance
   (LoA) Profiles.  The registry is intended to be used as an aid to
   discovering such LoA definitions in protocols that use an LoA
   concept, including Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 and
   OpenID Connect.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document establishes an IANA registry for Level of Assurance
   (LoA) Profiles.

   [<a id="ref-SAML">SAML</a>] provides the following definition of the concept of "level of
   assurance":

      Many existing (and potential) SAML federation deployments have
      adopted a "levels of assurance" (or LOA) model for categorizing
      the wide variety of authentication methods into a small number of
      levels, typically based on some notion of the strength of the
      authentication.  Federation members (service providers or "relying
      parties") then decide which level of assurance is required to
      access specific protected resources, based on some assessment of
      "value" or "risk".

   Another definition of an "assurance level" is given in <a href="./rfc4949">RFC 4949</a>
   [<a href="./rfc4949" title='"Internet Security Glossary, Version 2"'>RFC4949</a>], which also identifies the roots of such profiles in the
   NIST special publication series, in particular SP 800-63 [<a href="#ref-SP63" title='"Electronic Authentication Guideline, NIST Special Publication 800-63"'>SP63</a>].
   Level of Assurance Profiles are used in various protocols, including
   the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) version 2.0 and OpenID
   Connect.

   Several so-called trust frameworks and identity federations now
   exist, some of which define one or more LoAs.  The purpose of this
   specification is to create an IANA registry where such LoA
   definitions can be discovered.  While the quote above references
   SAML, the notion of a level of assurance has gained widespread
   acceptance and should be treated as a protocol-independent concept.
   The newly created IANA registry attempts to reflect this.



<span class="grey">Johansson                     Informational                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6711">RFC 6711</a>                      LoA Registry                   August 2012</span>


   Although the registry will contain URIs that reference SAML
   Authentication Context Profiles, other protocols may use such URIs to
   identify level of assurance definitions without relying on or
   transmitting their SAML XML definitions.  Use of the registry by
   protocols other than SAML is encouraged.

   For instance, OpenID Connect defines the standard claim 'acr' as a
   identifier that may reference a SAML Authentication Context Class
   even though OpenID Connect is not itself based on XML or SAML.

   Protocol designers who want to reference the registry should be aware
   that registered LoAs may depend on assumptions that do not carry over
   to all protocols and that such assumptions may vary among the
   protocols for which the LoAs were originally registered.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Name%20of%20Registry"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Name of Registry</span>

   The name of the registry shall be "Level of Assurance (LoA) Profile",
   in plural "Level of Assurance (LoA) Profiles".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Registration%20Template"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Registration Template</span>

   The following information must be provided with each registration:

   URI:  A URI referencing a Level of Assurance Profile.  This is the
      registry key.

   Context Class:  A valid XML schema definition for the SAML 2.0 LoA
      Context Class fulfilling the requirements of [<a href="#ref-SAML" title='"SAML V2.0 Identity Assurance Profiles, Version 1.0"'>SAML</a>].  The registry
      key (the URI) is the unique identifier for the Context Class.

   Name:  A string uniquely and unambiguously identifying the LoA for
      use in protocols where URIs are not appropriate.

   Informational URL:  A URL containing auxiliary information.  This URL
      must minimally reference contact information for the
      administrative authority of the level of assurance definition and
      must use either the http or https scheme.

   Note that it is possible for a single SAML Authentication Context
   Class to contain definitions of multiple URIs.  In that case, a
   separate registration is to be used for each URI.  Both the name and
   the URI are to uniquely and unambiguously identify the LoA.  The name
   is meant to be used in protocols where URIs are not appropriate.  In
   addition the requester is expected to provide basic contact
   information and the name of the organization on behalf of which the
   LoA definition is registered.

   The name is defined by the following ABNF (as defined in <a href="./rfc5234">RFC 5234</a>
   [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>]):

   label = ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
   name = label 1*( label / "-" / "." / "_" )

   The elements defined by the following ABNF productions represent a
   set of reserved values for the name element and are not to be
   registered:

   reserved = loa / al / num
   loa = ( "l" / "L" ) ( "o" / "O" ) ( "a" / "A") *DIGIT
   al = ( "a" / "A") ( "l" / "L") *DIGIT
   num = *DIGIT

   The reason for excluding these productions is a desire to avoid a
   race to register overly generic LoA Profiles under names like "AL1"
   or "LOA2".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Note%20on%20the%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Note on the Example</span>

   The example is borrowed (slightly modified) from [<a href="#ref-SAML" title='"SAML V2.0 Identity Assurance Profiles, Version 1.0"'>SAML</a>].  The example
   should not be registered.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Registration%20Policy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Registration Policy</span>

   The registry is to be operated under the "Expert Review" policy from
   <a href="./rfc5226">RFC 5226</a> [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>], employing a pool of experts.  IANA will be kindly
   asked to do rough, randomized load-balancing among the experts and
   also to perform an initial review of each submission to ensure that
   the name and URI are unique within the registry.  The review criteria
   are outlined below.

   For registrations that reference multiple LoAs in a consistent set of
   policies -- for instance, when a trust framework defines multiple
   levels of assurance -- the registered LoA name and URIs should be
   consistently named so that they can be identified as belonging to the
   same set of registrations.  For instance, fruitLoA1, fruitLoA2, and
   fruitLoA3 are preferred over apple, pear, and banana when these names
   refer to a single set of policies defining three LoAs.

   The expectation of the IANA LoA Registry is that it will contain
   registrations of bona fide Level of Assurance Profiles while not
   presenting a very high bar for entry.

   Expert reviewers are expected to verify that:

   o  the registration is consistent and that the provided XML fulfills
      the requirements of [<a href="#ref-SAML" title='"SAML V2.0 Identity Assurance Profiles, Version 1.0"'>SAML</a>].

   o  the name element is clearly associated with the registered LoA
      Profile and is not a reserved value.

   o  the URI and name elements are not already registered.

   o  the Informational URL can be expected to be stable and permanent.

   Note that multiple registrations may share a common Informational
   URL.

   The reviewers should exclude registrations where the name does not
   unambiguously identify the LoA definition or where the name is a
   simple variation on one of the reserved names.

   Expert reviewers are expected to allow registrations made in good
   faith that fulfill these requirements.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Registry%20Semantics"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Registry Semantics</span>

   The intended use for this registry is to serve as a basis for
   discovery of LoA definitions that might, for instance, be used by
   protocol-specific (e.g., SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect) management
   tools.

   Note that consumers of the registry, being implementations of [<a href="#ref-SAML" title='"SAML V2.0 Identity Assurance Profiles, Version 1.0"'>SAML</a>],
   are expected to allow configuration of LoA URIs at system deployment
   time.  If multiple sources of LoA URIs are permitted in addition to
   the registry (e.g., manual input), then it is important to avoid
   collisions with URIs found in the registry.

   The presence of an entry in the registry does not imply any semantics
   or quality beyond that which results from the review done by the
   expert reviewer as part of the registration process.

   The registry is not a federation or trust framework.  Consumers of
