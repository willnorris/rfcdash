Abstract

   This document specifies the algorithms, algorithms' parameters,
   asymmetric key formats, asymmetric key size, and signature format for
   the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) subscribers that
   generate digital signatures on certificates, Certificate Revocation
   Lists, and signed objects as well as for the relying parties (RPs)
   that verify these digital signatures.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document specifies:

   *  the digital signature algorithm and parameters;
   *  the hash algorithm and parameters;
   *  the public and private key formats; and,
   *  the signature format

   used by Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) subscribers when
   they apply digital signatures to certificates, Certificate Revocation
   Lists (CRLs), and signed objects (e.g., Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs) and manifests).  Relying parties (RPs) also use the algorithms
   defined in this document to verify RPKI subscribers' digital
   signatures [<a href="./rfc6480" title='"An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet Routing"'>RFC6480</a>].

   This document is referenced by other RPKI profiles and
   specifications, including the RPKI Certificate Policy (CP) [<a href="./rfc6484" title='"Certificate Policy (CP) for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)"'>RFC6484</a>],
   the RPKI Certificate Profile [<a href="./rfc6487" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>], the SIDR Architecture
   [<a href="./rfc6480" title='"An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet Routing"'>RFC6480</a>], and the Signed Object Template for the RPKI [<a href="./rfc6488" title='"Signed Object Template for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)"'>RFC6488</a>].
   Familiarity with these documents is assumed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Algorithms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Algorithms</span>

   Two cryptographic algorithms are used in the RPKI:

      *  The signature algorithm used in certificates, CRLs, and signed
         objects is RSA Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1
         Version 1.5 (sometimes referred to as "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5") from
         <a href="./rfc4055#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC4055]</a>.

      *  The hashing algorithm used in certificates, CRLs, and signed
         objects is SHA-256 [<a href="#ref-SHS" title='"FIPS Publication 180-3: Secure Hash Standard (SHS)"'>SHS</a>].  The hashing algorithm is not
         identified by itself when used in certificates and CRLs, as
         they are combined with the digital signature algorithm (see
         below).

         When used in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData,
         the hash algorithm (in this case, the hash algorithm is
         sometimes called a message digest algorithm) is identified by
         itself.  For CMS SignedData, the object identifier and
         parameters for SHA-256 (as defined in [<a href="./rfc5754" title='"Using SHA2 Algorithms with Cryptographic Message Syntax"'>RFC5754</a>]) MUST be used

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6485">RFC 6485</a>                 RPKI Algorithm Profile            February 2012</span>


         when populating the digestAlgorithms and digestAlgorithm
         fields.

         NOTE: The exception to the above hashing algorithm is the use
         of SHA-1 [<a href="#ref-SHS" title='"FIPS Publication 180-3: Secure Hash Standard (SHS)"'>SHS</a>] when Certification Authorities (CAs) generate
         authority and subject key identifiers [<a href="./rfc6487" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>].

   When used to generate and verify digital signatures the hash and
   digital signature algorithms are referred together, i.e., "RSA PKCS#1
   v1.5 with SHA-256" or more simply "RSA with SHA-256".  The Object
   Identifier (OID) sha256withRSAEncryption from [<a href="./rfc4055" title='"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC4055</a>] MUST be used.

   Locations for this OID are as follows:

      In the certificate, the OID appears in the signature and
      signatureAlgorithm fields [<a href="./rfc4055" title='"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC4055</a>];

      In the CRL, the OID appears in the signatureAlgorithm field
      [<a href="./rfc4055" title='"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC4055</a>];

      In CMS SignedData, the OID appears in each SignerInfo
      signatureAlgoithm field [<a href="./rfc3370" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms"'>RFC3370</a>] using the OID from above; and,

      In a certification request, the OID appears in the PKCS #10
      signatureAlgorithm field [<a href="./rfc2986" title='"PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax Specification Version 1.7"'>RFC2986</a>] or in the Certificate Request
      Message Format (CRMF) POPOSigningKey signature field [<a href="./rfc4211" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)"'>RFC4211</a>].

   The RSA key pairs used to compute the signatures MUST have a 2048-bit
   modulus and a public exponent (e) of 65,537.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Public%20Key%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Public Key Format</span>

   The subject's public key is included in subjectPublicKeyInfo
   [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>].  It has two sub-fields: algorithm and subjectPublicKey.
   The values for the structures and their sub-structures follow:

   algorithm (which is an AlgorithmIdentifier type):
      The object identifier for RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 with SHA-256 MUST be
      used in the algorithm field, as specified in <a href="./rfc4055#section-5">Section 5 of
      [RFC4055]</a>.  The value for the associated parameters from that
      clause MUST also be used for the parameters field.

   subjectPublicKey:
      RSAPublicKey MUST be used to encode the certificate's
      subjectPublicKey field, as specified in [<a href="./rfc4055" title='"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC4055</a>].

   Local policy determines the private key format.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Signature%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Signature Format</span>

   The structure for the certificate's signature field is as specified
   in <a href="./rfc4055#section-1.2">Section 1.2 of [RFC4055]</a>.  The structure for the CMS SignedData's
   signature field is as specified in [<a href="./rfc3370" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms"'>RFC3370</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Additional%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Additional Requirements</span>

   It is anticipated that the RPKI will require the adoption of updated
   key sizes and a different set of signature and hash algorithms over
   time, in order to maintain an acceptable level of cryptographic
   security to protect the integrity of signed products in the RPKI.
   This profile should be replaced to specify such future requirements,
   as and when appropriate.

   CAs and RPs SHOULD be capable of supporting a transition to allow for
   the phased introduction of additional encryption algorithms and key
   specifications, and also accommodate the orderly deprecation of
   previously specified algorithms and keys.  Accordingly, CAs and RPs
   SHOULD be capable of supporting multiple RPKI algorithm and key
   profiles simultaneously within the scope of such anticipated
   transitions.  The recommended procedures to implement such a
   transition of key sizes and algorithms is not specified in this
   document.

   The Security Considerations of [<a href="./rfc4055" title='"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC4055</a>], [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>], and [<a href="./rfc6487" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>]
   apply to certificates and CRLs.  The Security Considerations of
   [<a href="./rfc5754" title='"Using SHA2 Algorithms with Cryptographic Message Syntax"'>RFC5754</a>] apply to signed objects.  No new security threats are
   introduced as a result of this specification.
