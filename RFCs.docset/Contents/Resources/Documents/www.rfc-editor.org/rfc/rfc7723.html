             <span class="h1">Port Control Protocol (PCP) Anycast Addresses</span>

Abstract

   The Port Control Protocol (PCP) anycast addresses enable PCP clients
   to transmit signaling messages to their closest PCP-aware on-path
   NAT, firewall, or other middlebox without having to learn the IP
   address of that middlebox via some external channel.  This document
   establishes one well-known IPv4 address and one well-known IPv6
   address to be used as PCP anycast addresses.

   The Port Control Protocol (PCP) [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>] provides a mechanism to
   control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such
   as Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4
   Servers (NAT64), Network Address Translation from IPv4 to IPv4
   (NAT44), and IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices.  Furthermore, it
   provides a mechanism to reduce application keepalive traffic
   [<a href="#ref-PCP-OPTIMIZE">PCP-OPTIMIZE</a>].  The PCP base protocol document [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>] specifies
   the message formats used, but the address to which a client sends its
   request is either assumed to be the default router (which is
   appropriate in a typical single-link residential network) or has to
   be configured otherwise via some external mechanism, such as a
   configuration file or a DHCP option [<a href="./rfc7291" title='"DHCP Options for the Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC7291</a>].

   This document follows a different approach: it establishes two well-
   known anycast addresses for the PCP server, one IPv4 address and one
   IPv6 address.  PCP clients usually send PCP requests to these well-
   known addresses if no other PCP server addresses are known or after
   communication attempts to such other addresses have failed.  The
   anycast addresses are allocated from pools of special-purpose IP
   addresses (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>), in accordance with <a href="./rfc4085#section-3.4">Section 3.4 of
   [RFC4085]</a>.  Yet, a means to disable or override these well-known
   addresses (e.g., a configuration file option) should be available in
   implementations.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7723">RFC 7723</a>                  PCP Anycast Addresses             January 2016</span>


   Using an anycast address is particularly useful in larger network
   topologies.  For example, if the PCP-enabled NAT/firewall function is
   not located on the client's default gateway but further upstream in a
   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN), sending PCP requests to the default
   gateway's IP address will not have the desired effect.  When using a
   configuration file or the DHCP option to learn the PCP server's IP
   address, this file or the DHCP server configuration must reflect the
   network topology and the router and CGN configuration.  This may be
   cumbersome to achieve and maintain.  If there is more than one
   upstream CGN and traffic is routed using a dynamic routing protocol
   such as OSPF, this approach may not be feasible at all, as it cannot
   provide timely information regarding which CGN to interact with.  In
   contrast, when using the PCP anycast address, the PCP request will
   travel through the network like any other packet (i.e., without any
   special support from DNS, DHCP, other routers, or anything else)
   until it reaches the PCP-capable device that receives it, handles it,
   and sends back a reply.  A further advantage of using an anycast
   address instead of a DHCP option is that the anycast address can be
   hard-coded into the application.  There is no need for an application
   programming interface that passes the PCP server's address from the
   operating system's DHCP client to the application.  For further
   discussion of deployment considerations, see <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20PCP%20Server%20Discovery%20Based%20on%20Well-Known%20IP%20Address"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  PCP Server Discovery Based on Well-Known IP Address</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20PCP%20Discovery%20Client%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  PCP Discovery Client Behavior</span>

   PCP clients can add the PCP anycast addresses, which are defined in
   Sections <a href="#section-4.1">4.1</a> and <a href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>, after the default router list (for IPv4 and
   IPv6) to the list of PCP server(s) (see step 2 in <a href="./rfc6887#section-8.1">Section 8.1 of
   [RFC6887]</a>).  This list is processed as specified in [<a href="./rfc7488" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP) Server Selection"'>RFC7488</a>].

   Note: If, in some specific scenario, it was desirable to use only the
   anycast address (and not the default router), this could be achieved
   by putting the anycast address into the configuration file or DHCP
   option.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20PCP%20Discovery%20Server%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  PCP Discovery Server Behavior</span>

   PCP servers can be configured to listen on the anycast addresses for
   incoming PCP requests.  When a PCP server receives a PCP request
   destined for an anycast address it supports, it sends the
   corresponding PCP replies using that same anycast address as the
   source address (see the "How UDP and TCP Use Anycasting" section of
   [<a href="./rfc1546" title='"Host Anycasting Service"'>RFC1546</a>] for further discussion).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7723">RFC 7723</a>                  PCP Anycast Addresses             January 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Deployment%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Deployment Considerations</span>

   For general recommendations regarding operation of anycast services,
   see [<a href="./rfc4786" title='"Operation of Anycast Services"'>RFC4786</a>].  Architectural considerations of IP anycast are
   discussed in [<a href="./rfc7094" title='"Architectural Considerations of IP Anycast"'>RFC7094</a>].

   In some deployment scenarios, using PCP anycasting may have certain
   limitations that can be overcome by using additional mechanisms or by
   using other PCP server discovery methods instead, such as DHCP
   [<a href="./rfc7291" title='"DHCP Options for the Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC7291</a>] or a configuration file.

   One important example is a network topology in which a network is
   connected to one or more upstream network(s) via several parallel
   firewalls, each individually controlled by its own PCP server.  Even
   if all of these PCP servers are configured for anycasting, only one
   will receive the messages sent by a given client, depending on the
   state of the routing tables.

   As long as routing is always symmetric, i.e., all upstream and
   downstream packets from/to that client are routed through this very
   same firewall, communication will be possible as expected.  If there
   is a routing change, a PCP client using PCP anycasting might start
   interacting with a different PCP server.  From the PCP client's point
   of view, this would be the same as a PCP server reboot and the client
   could detect it by examining the Epoch field during the next PCP
   response or ANNOUNCE message.  The client would re-establish the
   firewall rules and packet flows could resume.

   If, however, routing is asymmetric, upstream packets from a client
   traverse a different firewall than the downstream packets to that
   client.  Establishing policy rules in only one of these two firewalls
   by means of PCP anycasting will not have the desired result of
   allowing bidirectional connectivity.  One solution approach to
   overcome this problem is an implementation-specific mechanism to
   synchronize state between all firewalls at the border of a network,
   i.e., a PEER message sent to any of these PCP servers would establish
   rules in all firewalls.  Another approach would be to use a different
   discovery mechanism (e.g., DHCP or a configuration file) that allows
   a PCP client to acquire a list of all PCP servers controlling the
   parallel firewalls and configure each of them individually.

   PCP anycast as such allows a PCP client to communicate only with its
   closest upstream PCP server.  However, it may be used in conjunction
   with the PCP proxy function [<a href="./rfc7648" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP) Proxy Function"'>RFC7648</a>], in order to support scenarios
   with cascaded PCP-enabled NATs or firewalls.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   In addition to the security considerations in [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>], [<a href="./rfc4786" title='"Operation of Anycast Services"'>RFC4786</a>],
   and [<a href="./rfc7094" title='"Architectural Considerations of IP Anycast"'>RFC7094</a>], two further security issues are considered here.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Information%20Leakage%20through%20Anycast"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Information Leakage through Anycast</span>

   In a network without any border gateway, NAT, or firewall that is
   aware of the PCP anycast address, outgoing PCP requests could leak
   out onto the external Internet, possibly revealing information about
   internal devices.

   Using an IANA-assigned, well-known PCP anycast address enables border
   gateways to block such outgoing packets.  In the default-free zone,
   routers should be configured to drop such packets.  Such
   configuration can occur naturally via BGP messages advertising that
   no route exists to said address.

   Sensitive clients that do not wish to leak information about their
   presence can set an IP TTL on their PCP requests that limits how far
   they can travel towards the public Internet.  However, methods for
   choosing an appropriate TTL value, e.g., based on the assumed radius
   of the trusted network domain, is beyond the scope of this document.

   Before sending PCP requests with possibly privacy-sensitive
   parameters (e.g., IP addresses and port numbers) to the PCP anycast
   addresses, PCP clients can send an ANNOUNCE request (without
   parameters; see <a href="./rfc6887#section-14.1">Section 14.1 of [RFC6887]</a>) in order to probe whether
   a PCP server consumes and processes PCP requests sent to that anycast
   address.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Hijacking%20of%20PCP%20Messages%20Sent%20to%20Anycast%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Hijacking of PCP Messages Sent to Anycast Addresses</span>

   The anycast addresses are treated by normal host operating systems as
   normal unicast addresses, i.e., packets destined for an anycast
   address are sent to the default router for processing and forwarding.
   Hijacking such packets in the first network segment would effectively
   require the attacker to impersonate the default router, e.g., by
   means of ARP spoofing in an Ethernet network.  Once an anycast
   message is forwarded closer to the core network, routing will likely
   become subject to dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF or BGP.
   Anycast messages could be hijacked by announcing counterfeited
   messages in these routing protocols.  When analyzing the risk and
   possible consequences of such attacks in a given network scenario,
   the probable impacts on PCP signaling need to be put into proportion
   with probable impacts on other protocols such as the actual
   application protocols.

   In addition to following best current practices in first-hop security
   and routing-protocol security, PCP authentication [<a href="./rfc7652" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP) Authentication Mechanism"'>RFC7652</a>] may be
   useful in some scenarios.  However, the effort needed for a proper
   setup of this authentication mechanism (e.g., installing the right
   shared secrets or cryptographic keys on all involved systems) may
   thwart the goal of fully automatic configuration by using PCP
   anycast.  Therefore, this approach may be less suitable for scenarios
   with high trust between the operator of the PCP-controlled middlebox
   and all users (e.g., a residential gateway used only by family
   members) or in scenarios in which there is rather limited trust that
   the middlebox will behave correctly (e.g., the Wi-Fi in an airport
   lounge).  In contrast, this scheme may be highly useful in scenarios
   with many users and a trusted network operator, such as a large
   corporate network or a university campus network, which uses several
   parallel NATs or firewalls to connect to the Internet.  Therefore, a
   thorough analysis of the benefits and costs of using PCP
   authentication in a given network scenario is recommended.
