Abstract

   This RFC is being distributed to members of the Internet community in
   order to solicit their reactions to the proposals contained in it.
   While the issues discussed may not be directly relevant to the
   research problems of the Internet, they may be interesting to a
   number of researchers and implementers.

   This document defines a set of criteria by which a DUA
   implementation, or more precisely a Directory user interface, may be
   judged.  Particular issues covered include terminal requirements;
   style of interface; target user; default object classes and attribute
   types; use of DAP; error handling.  The focus of the note is on
   "white pages" DUAs: this is a reflection of the current information
   base.  Nevertheless much of the document will be applicable to DUAs
   developed for other types of Directory usage.

   Please send comments to the author or to the discussion group &lt;osi-
   ds@CS.UCL.AC.UK&gt;.

   The purpose of this document is to define some metrics by which DUA
   products can be measured.  It should be first be noted that the use
   of the term "DUA" is rather misleading.  There is an assumption here
   that the DUA is implemented correctly and is able to "talk" valid
   X.500 protocol: this is a sine qua non.  Instead, this document seeks
   to draw out the characteristics of Directory user interfaces.
   However, the term DUA is persisted with as it is used by most people
   when referring to Directory user interfaces.  The format of these DUA
   metrics is essentially a questionnaire which extracts a detailed
   description of a user interface.  DUAs come in very different forms.
   Many make use of windowing environments, offering a "high-tech" view
   of the Directory, while others are designed to work in a terminal
   environment.  Some interfaces offer extensive control over the
   Directory, and thus may be well-suited to Directory managers, while
   others are aimed more at the novice user.  Some interfaces are
   configurable to allow searches for any attribute in any part of the
   DIT, while others lack this generality but are focussed on handling
   the most typical queries well.  In many aspects, it is almost
   impossible to say that one DUA is better than other from looking at
   the responses to question in this document.  A flexible management
   tool will be better for management than a DUA aimed at servicing
   simple look-ups, and vice-versa.  Furthermore, in other areas, there
   are several radically different approaches to a problem, but it is
   not as yet clear whether one approach is better than another.  One
   example of this is the extent to which a DUA provides an abstraction
   of the underlying DIT hierarchy, either emphasising the world as a
   tree or trying to conceal this from the user.

   However, other aspects, such as whether the DUA can actually find the
   entries required, and if so, how quickly, can be directly measured in
   some way.  Throughout this document, some of the questions posed are
   annotated with a square-bracketed points score and an explanation as
   to how the points should be allocated.  For example, a question might
   be appended with "[2 if yes]", indicating score 2 points for an
   affirmative answer to that question.  These points scores should be

   collated in Table 1 at the end of the document, and this table
   constitutes a measure of the DUA. The metrics are on a section by
   section basis, which should help the reader who is seeking, for
   example, a DUA with good management capabilities which runs on a wide
   variety of platforms, to focus on the critical aspects of a DUA for
   the particular requirement.

   5.  Describe the hardware and software platforms on which the DUA will
       run.  Some DUAs are split into a user interface part, and a DUA
       server part, communicating by means of a protocol.  If the DUA is
       of the type where the DUA protocol machinery and user agent are
       implemented in a single process, complete only the user interface
       section, and indicate "n/a" for the DUA server and
       communications protocol questions.

   The term "querying" is used here as a generic term for finding an
   entry, whether it be as a simple look-up, or the prelude to a
   modification operation.

   28. Which best describes the query entry style?

      (a)  Form filling (user responds to a set of prompts) ............

           i.  Query specified first, then resolved ....................

          ii.  Query entry and resolution mixed ........................

         iii.  Both modes possible .....................................

      (b)  Queries entered as "user-friendly names" ..................

      (c)  Querying is by "navigating" around the DIT, the user
           searching and selecting .....................................

      (d)  Other (please describe) .....................................

   A number of strategies are employed by DUAs to find the entry the
   user is looking for.  These have implications for user-friendliness
   and performance.  For example, an interface which makes extensive use
   of search operations may be excellent at finding entries, but at the
   cost of being intolerably slow.

   29. Which of the following strategies most closely accords with the
       behaviour of the DUA?

      (a)  The DUA always uses search operations to find entries .......

      (b)  The DUA offers users a list of entries, and invites the user
           to select from the list .....................................

      (c)  The DUA only tries read operations (i.e., the DN must be
           exactly right) ..............................................

      (d)  The DUA tries read operations first, then searches for
           something similar if no entry can be found ..................

       operation or by a single level search operation) all the child
       entries of a node (notwithstanding administrative limits)?  .....

   31. Does the DUA follow aliases?  ...................................
       If so, does it do so:

      (a)  Always?  ....................................................

       independently configurable?  [2] ................................

   34. Name any attribute types where the attribute values may be
       presented in local formats?  (For example, it may be possible to
       configure the display of telephone numbers so that local numbers
       are shown as extensions, rather than with the full international
       dialling code.)  [1 per attribute, up to a maximum of 4] ........
    ....................................................................

   35. Does the DUA allow for the display of more than one result at a
       time (showing attribute values other than the name of the entry)?
       If so, how many entries may be displayed in response to a single
       query?  [2 if feature provided] .................................
    ....................................................................

       core of attributes is retrieved initially, and a larger set is
       returned if required?  [2 if yes] ...............................

   37. What does the DUA do with attribute types it doesn't support in
       its sub-schema, but which have a standard syntax?  ..............

   This section discusses the process of query resolution.  While two
   DUAs may both be able to resolve a query using the same information,
   one may do so much more quickly than the other.  Some DUAs may be
   more "economic" in their use of DAP operations to achieve the same
   results.  Some DUAs may find the correct results even when the users'
   input corresponds rather weakly to Directory names.  Three aspects of
   query resolution are measured:

    o  Does the DUA actually find the required entry?

    o  If the required entry is found, how many entries were returned as
       well?

    o  How "expensive" was the query in terms of underlying X.500
       operations, whether the query was resolved successfully or not?

   The following set of queries might all conceivably be resolved such
   that the author's Directory entry be found.  The queries are split
   into 2 groups:  the first group SHOULD pose no difficulties for a
   reasonable DUA; the second group are more problematic.  In each case,
   award [2] marks if the query found the author's entry successfully.
   The expensiveness of each query should be measured using the
   following formula, which introduces the notion of SearchStones!  The
   SearchStone rating is calculated by adding together the total
   operations used in attempting to resolve a query, weighted thus:

    o  Bind [5]

    o  Read operation [1]

    o  List operation [2]

    o  Search single level for countries, organisations or
       localities [3]



<span class="grey">Barker                                                         [Page 13]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-14"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1431">RFC 1431</a>                      DUA Metrics                  February 1993</span>


    o  Search single level for organisational units, people or roles [3]

    o  Search subtree [5]

      Note: The single level searches have been separated into two
      categories in acknowledgement that certain types of search are
      much more likely to span multiple DSAs than others.  The
      weightings are the same for the moment because of the
      pervasiveness of the Quipu implementation, which replicates all
      sibling entries in a single DSA, whatever the level in the DIT.

   The notion of SearchStones merits some further explanation and the
   statement of some caveats.

   The idea is to give some broad brush view of the work being
   undertaken by a DUA to retrieve an entry.  There will be some
   correspondence between a low SearchStone rating and a DUA responding
   quickly, and vice-versa, although this correlation is not consistent,
   for reasons given below.  It would be desirable to be able to have
   some timing information for the resolution of queries, but such
   results would only be meaningful if the tests were for target entries
   widely distributed throughout the DIT. Maybe this is something for
   the future?  In the meantime it is worth noting some of the factors
   which militate against simple minded interpretation of the
   SearchStones.

    o  The DIT is not uniform, with the depth varying considerably

    o  While the DIT is currently mastered mostly by DSAs of a single
       implementation, this will be decreasingly the case, and other DSAs
       may have very different performance profiles.

    o  Different directory domains are already adopting different
       strategies on information replication with profound performance
       implications.

    o  No weighting is given to different search filters, or to boolean
       combinations of filters.

   While acknowledging the difficulty of the exercise, there are counter
   arguments:

    o  Some DUAs are better than others at finding the required results

    o  Some DUAs will get the required results more quickly than most

    o  DUA designers have to build DUAs in the knowledge that the DIT is
       heterogeneous with respect to DSA implementation and DIT structure

   One possible way forward would be to refine the test queries such
   that they better represented the diversity of the DIT. However, as a
   first step, the tests are restricted to queries which could
   reasonably be constructed as searches for the author's entry.  The
   author's entry is held in part of the DIT which is representative of
   much of the current DIT.  It is suggested that in order to normalise
   the tests as much as possible, that testing be performed by
   connecting to the target DSA directly.  The DSA's name is "cn=Vicuna,
   c=GB", and the addresses of the DSA may be found in the presentation
   address attribute for that entry.  Note that the SearchStone rating
   should be shown even for queries which cannot be resolved.

   First, the straightforward queries:

   50. NAME=Paul Barker, OU=Computer Science, O=University College
       London, C=GB

   51. NAME=Paul Barker, OU=Computer Science, O=UCL, C=GB

   52. NAME=Barker, OU=Computer, O=UCL, C=GB

   53. NAME=Barker, O=UCL, C=GB

   54. NAME=p barker, O=university college, C=GB

   55. NAME=paul b, OU=cs, O=university college, C=GB

   More difficult queries:

   56. NAME=p b, O=university college, C=uk

   57. NAME=Paul Barker, OU=Computer Networking, O=london college, C=GB

   58. NAME=Paul Baker (sic), OU=cs, O=ucl, C=Britain

   59. NAME=p baker (sic), O=UCL, C=England

   60. NAME=Paul Barker, OU=Directories, O=london, C=United Kingdom

   Other general questions:

   61. Will the DUA attempt a query of the form "Find all the Smiths in
       Britain"?  .....................................................

       If so, does it do it by:

    ....................................................................
    ....................................................................

   67. If modify operations are provided, is there support for editing
       the attributes correctly with the appropriate syntax (e.g., does
