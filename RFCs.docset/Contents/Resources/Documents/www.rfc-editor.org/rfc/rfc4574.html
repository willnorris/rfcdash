Abstract

   This document defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   media-level attribute: "label".  The "label" attribute carries a
   pointer to a media stream in the context of an arbitrary network
   application that uses SDP.  The sender of the SDP document can attach
   the "label" attribute to a particular media stream or streams.  The
   application can then use the provided pointer to refer to each
   particular media stream in its context.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   SDP is being used by a variety of distributed-over-the-network
   applications.  These applications deal with multiple sessions being
   described by SDP [<a href="#ref-4" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>4</a>] and serving multiple users or services in the
   context of a single application instance.  Applications of this kind
   need a means to identify a particular media stream across multiple
   SDP descriptions exchanged with different users.

   The XCON framework is an example of a centralized conference
   architecture that uses SDP according to the offer/answer mechanism
   defined in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>3</a>] to establish media streams with each of the conference
   participants.  Additionally, XCON identifies the need to uniquely
   identify a media stream in terms of its role in a conference
   regardless of its media type, transport protocol, and media format.
   This can be accomplished by using an external document that points to
   the appropriate media stream and provides information (e.g., the
   media stream's role in the conference) about it.  The SIP Event
   Package for Conference State [<a href="#ref-7" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State"'>7</a>] defines and uses a concrete format
   for such external documents.

   This specification defines the SDP [<a href="#ref-4" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>4</a>] "label" media-level attribute,
   which provides a pointer to a media stream that is described by an
   'm' line in an SDP session description.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>1</a>] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Motivation%20for%20the%20New%20label%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Motivation for the New label Attribute</span>

   Even though SDP and its extensions already provide a few ways to
   refer to a media stream, none of them is appropriate to be used in
   the context of external documents that may be created before the
   session description itself and need to be handled by automata.

   The 'i' SDP attribute, defined in <a href="./rfc2327">RFC 2327</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>4</a>], can be used to label
   media streams.  Nevertheless, values of the 'i' attribute are
   intended for human users and not for automata.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4574">RFC 4574</a>                  SDP Label Attribute                August 2006</span>


   The 'mid' SDP attribute, defined in <a href="./rfc3388">RFC 3388</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>6</a>], can be used to
   identify media streams as well.  Nevertheless, the scope of 'mid' is
   too limited to be used by applications dealing with multiple SDP
   sessions.  This is because values of the 'mid' attribute are
   meaningful in the context of a single SDP session, not in the context
   of a broader application (e.g., a multiparty application).

   Another way of referring to a media stream is by using the order of
   the 'm' line in the SDP session document (e.g., the 5th media stream
   in the session description).  This is the mechanism used in the
   offer/answer model [<a href="#ref-3" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>3</a>].

   The problem with this mechanism is that it can only be used to refer
   to media streams in session descriptions that exist already.  There
   are scenarios where a static document needs to refer, using a
   pointer, to a media stream that will be negotiated by SDP means and
   created in the future.  When the media stream is eventually created,
   the application needs to label the media stream so that the pointer
   in the static document points to the proper media stream in the
   session description.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20Label%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The Label Attribute</span>

   This specification defines a new media-level value attribute:
   'label'.  Its formatting in SDP is described by the following ABNF
   [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>2</a>]:

      label-attribute    = "a=label:" pointer

      pointer            = token

      token              = 1*(token-char)

      token-char         = %x21 / %x23-27 / %x2A-2B / %x2D-2E / %x30-39
                           / %x41-5A / %x5E-7E

   The token-char and token elements are defined in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>4</a>] but included
   here to provide support for the implementor of this SDP feature.

   The 'label' attribute contains a token that is defined by an
   application and is used in its context.  The new attribute can be
   attached to 'm' lines in multiple SDP documents allowing the
   application to logically group the media streams across SDP sessions
   when necessary.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20The%20Label%20Attribute%20in%20the%20Offer%2FAnswer%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  The Label Attribute in the Offer/Answer Model</span>

   This specification does not define a means to discover whether or not
   the peer endpoint understands the 'label' attribute because 'label'
   values are informative only at the offer/answer model level.

   At the offer/answer level, it means that the fact that an offer does
   not contain label attributes does not imply that the answer should
   not have them.  It also means that the fact that an offer contains
   label attributes does not imply that the answer should have them too.

   In addition to the basic offer/answer rule above, applications that
   use 'label' as a pointer to media streams MUST specify its usage
   constraints.  For example, such applications MAY mandate support for
   'label'.  In this case, the application will define means for
   negotiation of the 'label' attribute support as a part of its
   specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Example</span>

   The following is an example of an SDP session description that uses
   the 'label' attribute:

      v=0
      o=bob 280744730 28977631 IN IP4 host.example.com
      s=
      i=A Seminar on the session description protocol
      c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
      t=0 0
      m=audio 6886 RTP/AVP 0
      a=label:1
      m=audio 22334 RTP/AVP 0
      a=label:2

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   An attacker may attempt to add, modify, or remove 'label' attributes
   from a session description.  This could result in an application
   behaving in a non-desirable way.  So, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that
   integrity protection be applied to the SDP session descriptions.  For
   session descriptions carried in SIP [<a href="#ref-5" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>5</a>], S/MIME is the natural choice
   to provide such end-to-end integrity protection, as described in <a href="./rfc3261">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3261">3261</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>5</a>].  Other applications MAY use a different form of integrity
   protection.
