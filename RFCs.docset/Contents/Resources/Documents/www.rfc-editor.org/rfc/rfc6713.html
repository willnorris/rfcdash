<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6713">RFC 6713</a>              Media Types 'zlib' and 'gzip'          August 2012</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   zlib [<a href="./rfc1950" title='"ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification version 3.3"'>RFC1950</a>] and gzip [<a href="./rfc1952" title='"GZIP file format specification version 4.3"'>RFC1952</a>] are widely used compression
   formats. zlib is a stream format, while gzip adds header and trailer
   fields more appropriate for a file format.  Both implement the
   DEFLATE compression scheme described in [<a href="./rfc1951" title='"DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification version 1.3"'>RFC1951</a>].

   They are used to compress a wide variety of material, from
   unstructured text to structured data to executable code.

   Some applications have informally used media types such as
   application/gzip-compressed, application/gzipped, application/
   x-gunzip, application/x-gzip, application/x-gzip-compressed, and
   gzip/document to describe data compressed with gzip.  The media types
   defined in this document should replace those media types in future
   applications.

   The 'application/zlib' media type describes a block of data that is
   compressed using zlib [<a href="./rfc1950" title='"ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification version 3.3"'>RFC1950</a>] compression.  The data is a stream of
   bytes as described in <a href="./rfc1950">RFC 1950</a>.

   Additional information:
      Magic number(s): first byte is usually 0x78 but can also be 0x08,
      0x18, 0x28, 0x38, 0x48, 0x58, or 0x68.  The first two bytes, when
      interpreted as an unsigned 16-bit number in big-endian byte order,
      contain a value that is a multiple of 31.

   zlib and gzip compression can be used to compress arbitrary binary
   data such as hostile executable code.  Also, data that purports to be
   in zlib or gzip format may not be, and fields that are supposed to be
   flags, lengths, or pointers could contain anything.  Applications
   should treat any data with due skepticism.

   Also see the security considerations in the underlying format
   documents: <a href="./rfc1950#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC1950]</a>, <a href="./rfc1951#section-6">Section 6 of [RFC1951]</a>, and
   <a href="./rfc1952#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC1952]</a>.

   IANA has updated the "Application Media Types" registry to include
   'application/zlib' as described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> and 'application/gzip'
   as described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.
