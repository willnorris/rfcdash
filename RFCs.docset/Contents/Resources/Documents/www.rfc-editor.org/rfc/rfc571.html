                           <span class="h1">TENEX FTP PROBLEM</span>

   Tenex users of FTP should beware of a problem in the current Tenex
   implementation which is likely to cause incorrect results when
   transferring files to a non-Tenex site.  Some Tenex programs create
   an ASCII US (Unit Separator) character as an end-of-line indicator,
   instead of CR LF.  The current Tenex FTP user implementation passes
   these US characters over the Network instead of translating them to
   CR LF as required by FTP protocol.  If the recipient is not a Tenex,
   he will not do anything special with these US characters and the line
   spacing will be lost. In the case of sending to CCN, we will treat it
   as a very long logical record and fold it into successive 360
   records.

   A circumvention is to pass the Tenex file through some Tenex program
   that does the necessary conversion before sending it over the
   Network.  We know that TECO will remove US's; there are probably
   other means.  Loading and saving the file with TECO will replace all
   US's with CR LF sequences.
