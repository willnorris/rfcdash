   IMAP keywords [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>] are boolean named flags that can be used by
   clients to annotate messages in an IMAP mailbox.  Although IMAP
   keywords are an optional feature of IMAP, the majority of IMAP
   servers can store arbitrary keywords.  Many mainstream IMAP clients
   use a limited set of specific keywords, and some can manage (create,
   edit, display) arbitrary IMAP keywords.

   Over the years, some IMAP keywords have become de-facto standards,
   with some specific semantics associated with them.  In some cases,
   different client implementors decided to define and use keywords with
   different names, but the same semantics.  Some server implementors
   decided to map such keywords automatically in order to improve cross-
   client interoperability.

   In other cases, the same keywords have been used with different
   semantics, thus causing interoperability problems.

   This document attempts to prevent further incompatible uses of IMAP
   keywords by establishing an "IMAP Keywords" registry and allocating a
   special prefix for standardized keywords.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has established a new registry for IMAP keywords.

   Registration of an IMAP keyword is requested by filling in the
   following template and following the instructions on the IANA pages
   for the registry to submit it to IANA:

   Subject:    Registration of IMAP keyword X

   IMAP keyword name:

   Purpose (description):

   Private or Shared on a server:  (One of PRIVATE, SHARED, or BOTH.
                                   PRIVATE means that each different
                                   user has a distinct copy of the
                                   keyword.  SHARED means that all
                                   different users see the same value of
                                   the keyword.  BOTH means that an IMAP
                                   server can have the keyword as either
                                   private or shared.)

   Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:

   When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:

   Related keywords:  (for example, "mutually exclusive with keywords Y
                      and Z")

   Related IMAP capabilities:

   Security considerations:

   Published specification (recommended):

   Person &amp; email address to contact for further information:

   Intended usage:  (One of COMMON, LIMITED USE, or DEPRECATED (i.e.,
                    not recommended for use))

   Owner/Change controller:  (MUST be "IESG" for any "common use"
                             keyword registration specified in an IETF
                             Review document.  See definition of "common
                             use" below in this section.  When the
                             Owner/Change controller is not a
                             Standardization Organization, the
                             registration request MUST make it clear if

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5788">RFC 5788</a>                 IMAP4 Keyword Registry               March 2010</span>


                             the registration is controlled by a
                             company, or the individual performing the
                             registration.)

   Note:       (Any other information that the author deems interesting
               may be added here, for example, if the keyword(s) is
               supported by existing clients.)

   Registration of an IMAP keyword requires Expert Review [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].
   Registration of any IMAP keyword is initiated by posting a
   registration request to the Message Organization WG mailing list
   &lt;morg@ietf.org&gt; (or its replacement as chosen by the responsible
   Application Area Director) and CCing IANA (&lt;iana@iana.org&gt;).  After
   allowing for at least two weeks for community input on the designated
   mailing list, the expert will determine the appropriateness of the
   registration request and either approve or disapprove the request
   with notice to the requestor, the mailing list, and IANA.  Any
   refusal must come with a clear explanation.

   The IESG appoints one or more Expert Reviewers for the IMAP keyword
   registry established by this document.

   The Expert Reviewer should strive for timely reviews.  The Expert
   Reviewer should take no longer than six weeks to make and announce
   the decision, or notify the mailing list that more time is required.

   Decisions (or lack of) made by an Expert Reviewer can be first
   appealed to Application Area Directors and, if the appellant is not
   satisfied with the response, to the full IESG.

   There are two types of IMAP keywords in the "IMAP Keywords" registry:
   intended for "common use" and vendor-/organization-specific use (also
   known as "limited use").  An IMAP keyword is said to be for "common
   use" if it is reasonably expected to be implemented in at least two
   independent client implementations.  The two types of IMAP keywords
   have different levels of requirements for registration (see below).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Review%20Guidelines%20for%20the%20Designated%20Expert%20Reviewer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Review Guidelines for the Designated Expert Reviewer</span>

   Expert Reviewers should focus on the following requirements.

   Registration of a vendor-/organization-specific ("limited use") IMAP
   keyword is easier.  The Expert Reviewer only needs to check that the
   requested name doesn't conflict with an already registered name, and
   that the name is not too generic, misleading, etc.  The Expert
   Reviewer MAY request the IMAP keyword name change before approving





<span class="grey">Melnikov &amp; Cridland          Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5788">RFC 5788</a>                 IMAP4 Keyword Registry               March 2010</span>


   the registration.  The Expert Reviewer SHOULD refuse a registration
   if there is an already registered IMAP keyword that serves the same
   purpose, but has a different name.

   When registering an IMAP keyword for "common use", the Expert
   Reviewer performs the checks described for vendor-/
   organization-specific IMAP keywords, plus additional checks as
   detailed below.

   Keywords intended for "common use" SHOULD start with the "$" prefix.
   (Note that this is a SHOULD because some of the commonly used IMAP
   keywords in widespread use don't follow this convention.)

   IMAP keywords intended for "common use" SHOULD be standardized in
   IETF Review [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>] documents.  (Note that IETF Review documents
   still require Expert Review.)

   Values in the "IMAP Keywords" IANA registry intended for "common use"
   must be clearly documented and likely to ensure interoperability.
   They must be useful, not harmful to the Internet.  In cases when an
   IMAP keyword being registered is already deployed, Expert Reviewers
   should favor registering it over requiring perfect documentation
   and/or requesting a change to the name of the IMAP keyword.

   The Expert Reviewer MAY automatically "upgrade" registration requests
   for a "limited use" IMAP keyword to "common use" level.  The Expert
   Reviewer MAY also request that a registration targeted for "common
   use" be registered as "limited use" instead.

   Comments on registered IMAP keywords should be sent to both the
   "owner" of the mechanism and to the mailing list designated to IMAP
   keyword review (see <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).  This improves the chances of getting
   a timely response.

   Submitters of comments may, after a reasonable attempt to contact the
   owner and after soliciting comments on the IMAP mailing list, request
   the designated Expert Reviewer to attach their comment to the IMAP
   keyword registration itself.  The procedure is similar to requesting
   an Expert Review for the affected keyword.

   Once an IMAP keyword registration has been published by IANA, the
   owner may request a change to its definition.  The change request
   (including a change to the "intended usage" field) follows the same
   procedure as the initial registration request, with the exception of



<span class="grey">Melnikov &amp; Cridland          Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>

   changes to the "Person &amp; email address to contact for further
   information" and "Owner/Change controller" fields.  The latter can be
   changed by the owner by informing IANA; this can be done without
   discussion or review.

   The IESG may reassign responsibility for an IMAP keyword.  The most
   common case of this will be to enable clarifications to be made to
   keywords where the owner of the registration has died, moved out of
   contact, or is otherwise unable to make changes that are important to
   the community.

   IMAP keyword registrations MUST NOT be deleted; keywords that are no
   longer believed appropriate for use can be declared DEPRECATED by a
   change to their "intended usage" field.

   The IESG is considered the owner of all "common use" IMAP keywords
   that are published in an IETF Review document.

   IANA has registered the IMAP keywords specified in following
   subsections in the registry established by this document.

   Subject:    Registration of IMAP keyword $MDNSent


   IMAP keyword name:  $MDNSent

   Purpose (description):  Specifies that a Message Disposition
                           Notification (MDN) must not be sent for any
                           message annotated with the $MDNSent IMAP
                           keyword.

   Private or Shared on a server:  SHARED

   Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:
                           This keyword can cause automatic action by
                           the client.  See [<a href="./rfc3503" title='"Message Disposition Notification (MDN) profile for Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)"'>RFC3503</a>] for more details.

   When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:
                           This keyword is set by an IMAP client when it
                           decides to act on an MDN request, or when
                           uploading a sent or draft message.  It can
                           also be set by a delivery agent.  Once set,
                           the flag SHOULD NOT be cleared.

   Subject:    Registration of the IMAP keyword $Forwarded

   IMAP keyword name:  $Forwarded

   Purpose (description):  $Forwarded is used by several IMAP clients to
                           specify that the message was resent to
                           another email address, embedded within or
                           attached to a new message.  This keyword is
                           set by the mail client when it successfully
                           forwards the message to another email
                           address.  Typical usage of this keyword is to
                           show a different (or additional) icon for a
                           message that has been forwarded.

   Private or Shared on a server:  BOTH

   Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:
                           advisory

   When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:
                           This keyword can be set by either a delivery
                           agent or a mail client.  Once set, the flag
                           SHOULD NOT be cleared.  Notes: There is no
                           way to tell if a message with $Forwarded
                           keyword set was forwarded more than once.

   Related keywords:  None

   Related IMAP capabilities:  None

   Subject:    Registration of IMAP keyword $SubmitPending

   IMAP keyword name:  $SubmitPending

   Purpose (description):  The $SubmitPending IMAP keyword designates
                           the message as awaiting to be submitted.
                           This keyword allows storing messages waiting
                           to be submitted in the same mailbox where
                           messages that were already submitted and/or
                           are being edited are stored.

                           A message that has both $Submitted and
                           $SubmitPending IMAP keywords set is a message
                           being actively submitted.

   Private or Shared on a server:  SHARED

   Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:
                            This keyword can cause automatic action by
                           the client.  See <a href="./rfc5550#section-5.10">SectionÂ 5.10 of [RFC5550]</a>
                           for more details.

    IMAP keywords are one of the base IMAP features [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>].  This
    document doesn't change their behavior, so it does not add new
    security issues.

    A particular IMAP keyword might have specific security
    considerations, which are documented in the IMAP keyword
    registration template standardized by this document.
