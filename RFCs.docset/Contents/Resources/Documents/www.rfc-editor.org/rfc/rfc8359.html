Abstract

   This document discusses a Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) Resource reSerVation Protocol with Traffic Engineering
   (RSVP-TE) mechanism that enables the network to assign an upstream
   label for a bidirectional Label Switched Path (LSP).  This is useful
   in scenarios where a given node does not have sufficient information
   to assign the correct upstream label on its own and needs to rely on
   the downstream node to pick an appropriate label.  This document
   updates RFCs 3471, 3473, and 6205 as it defines processing for a
   special label value in the UPSTREAM_LABEL object.

   A functional description of the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling extensions for setting up a bidirectional
   Label Switched Path (LSP) is provided in [<a href="./rfc3471" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Functional Description"'>RFC3471</a>].  The GMPLS
   Resource reSerVation Protocol with Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   extensions for setting up a bidirectional LSP are specified in
   [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>].  The bidirectional LSP setup is indicated by the presence
   of an UPSTREAM_LABEL object in the Path message.  As per the existing
   setup procedure outlined for a bidirectional LSP, each upstream node
   must allocate a valid upstream label on the outgoing interface before
   sending the initial Path message downstream.  However, there are
   certain scenarios (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>) where it is not desirable or
   possible for a given node to pick the upstream label on its own.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8359">RFC 8359</a>             Network Assigned Upstream-Label          March 2018</span>


   This document defines the protocol mechanism to be used in such
   scenarios.  This mechanism enables a given node to offload the task
   of assigning the upstream label for a given bidirectional LSP to
   nodes downstream in the network.  It is meant to be used only for
   bidirectional LSPs that assign symmetric labels at each hop along the
   path of the LSP.  Bidirectional Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) LSPs use
   symmetric lambda labels (format specified in [<a href="./rfc6205" title='"Generalized Labels for Lambda-Switch-Capable (LSC) Label Switching Routers"'>RFC6205</a>]) at each hop
   along the path of the LSP.

   As per the bidirectional LSP setup procedures specified in [<a href="./rfc3471" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Functional Description"'>RFC3471</a>]
   and [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>], the UPSTREAM_LABEL object must indicate a label that
   is valid for forwarding.  This document updates that by allowing the
   UPSTREAM_LABEL object to indicate a special label that isn't valid
   for forwarding.  As per the bidirectional LSC LSP setup procedures
   specified in [<a href="./rfc6205" title='"Generalized Labels for Lambda-Switch-Capable (LSC) Label Switching Routers"'>RFC6205</a>], the LABEL_SET object and the UPSTREAM_LABEL
   object must contain the same label value.  This document updates that
   by allowing the UPSTREAM_LABEL object to carry a special label value
   that is different from the one used in the LABEL_SET object.

   This document defines a special label value -- "0xFFFFFFFF" (for a
   4-octet label) -- to indicate an Unassigned Upstream Label.  Similar
   "all-ones" patterns are expected to be used for labels of other
   sizes.

         Figure 1: Unassigned UPSTREAM_LABEL - "all-ones" Pattern

   The presence of this value in the UPSTREAM_LABEL object of a Path
   message indicates that the upstream node has not assigned an upstream
   label on its own and has requested the downstream node to provide a
   label that it can use in both the forward and reverse directions.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8359">RFC 8359</a>             Network Assigned Upstream-Label          March 2018</span>


   The presence of this value in the UPSTREAM_LABEL object of a Path
   message MUST also be interpreted by the receiving node as a request
   to mandate symmetric labels for the LSP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Procedures"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Procedures</span>

   The scope of the procedures is limited to the exchange and processing
   of messages between an upstream node and its immediate downstream
   node.  The Unassigned Upstream Label is used by an upstream node when
   it is not in a position to pick the upstream label on its own.  In
   such a scenario, the upstream node sends a Path message downstream
   with an Unassigned Upstream Label and requests the downstream node to
   provide a symmetric label.  If the upstream node desires to make the
   downstream node aware of its limitations with respect to label
   selection, it MUST specify a list of valid labels via the LABEL_SET
   object as specified in [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>].

   In response, the downstream node picks an appropriate symmetric label
   and sends it via the LABEL object in the Resv message.  The upstream
   node would then start using this symmetric label for both directions
   of the LSP.  If the downstream node cannot pick the symmetric label,
   it MUST issue a PathErr message with a "Routing Problem/Unacceptable
   Label Value" indication.  If the upstream node that signals an
   Unassigned Upstream Label receives a label with the "all-ones"
   pattern or any other unacceptable label in the LABEL object of the
   Resv message, it MUST issue a ResvErr message with a "Routing
   Problem/Unacceptable Label Value" indication.

   The upstream node will continue to signal the Unassigned Upstream
   Label in the Path message even after it receives an appropriate
   symmetric label in the Resv message.  This is done to make sure that
   the downstream node would pick a different symmetric label if and
   when it needs to change the label at a later time.  If the upstream
   node receives an unacceptable changed label, then it MUST issue a
   ResvErr message with a "Routing Problem/Unacceptable Label Value"
   indication.

   If the downstream node is running an implementation that doesn't
   support the semantics of an Unassigned UPSTREAM LABEL, it will either
   (a) reject the special label value and generate an error as specified
   in <a href="./rfc3473#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC3473]</a> or (b) accept it and treat it as a valid
   label.

   If the behavior that is exhibited is (a), then there are no backwards
   compatibility concerns.  If the behavior that is exhibited is (b),
   then the downstream node will send a label with the "all-ones"
   pattern in the LABEL object of the Resv message.  In response, the
   upstream node will issue a ResvErr message with a "Routing Problem/
   Unacceptable Label Value" indication.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Use-Case%3A%20Wavelength%20Setup%20for%20IP%20over%20Optical%20Networks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Use-Case: Wavelength Setup for IP over Optical Networks</span>

   Consider the network topology depicted in Figure 3.  Nodes A and B
   are client IP routers that are connected to an optical Wavelength
   Division Multiplexing (WDM) transport network.  F and I represent WDM
   nodes.  The transponder sits on the router and is directly connected
   to the add-drop port on a WDM node.

   The optical signal originating on "Router A" is tuned to a particular
   wavelength.  On "WDM-Node F", it gets multiplexed with optical
   signals at other wavelengths.  Depending on the implementation of
   this multiplexing function, it may not be acceptable to have the
   router send the signal into the optical network unless it is at the
   appropriate wavelength.  In other words, having the router send
   signals with a wrong wavelength may adversely impact existing optical
   trails.  If the clients do not have full visibility into the optical
   network, they are not in a position to pick the correct wavelength in
   advance.

   The rest of this section examines how the protocol mechanism proposed
   in this document allows the optical network to select and communicate
   the correct wavelength to its clients.

   Steps:

   o  "Router A" does not have enough information to pick an appropriate
      client wavelength.  It sends a Path message downstream requesting
      the network to assign an appropriate symmetric label for its use.
      Since the client wavelength is unknown, the laser is off at the
      ingress client.

   o  The downstream node (Node F) receives the Path message, chooses
      the appropriate wavelength values, and forwards them in
      appropriate label fields to the egress client ("Router B").

   o  "Router B" receives the Path message, turns the laser ON and tunes
      it to the appropriate wavelength (received in the UPSTREAM_LABEL/
      LABEL_SET of the Path) and sends a Resv message upstream.

   o  The Resv message received by the ingress client carries a valid
      symmetric label in the LABEL object.  "Router A" turns on the
      laser and tunes it to the wavelength specified in the network
      assigned symmetric LABEL.

   For cases where the egress-node relies on RSVP signaling to determine
   exactly when to start using the LSP, implementations may choose to
   integrate the above sequence with any of the existing graceful setup
   procedures:

   o  "ResvConf" setup procedure ([<a href="./rfc2205" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1 Functional Specification"'>RFC2205</a>])

   o  Two-step "ADMIN STATUS" based setup procedure ("A" bit set in the
      first step; "A" bit cleared when the LSP is ready for use)
      ([<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>])

   After the LSP is set up, the network may decide to change the
   wavelength for the given LSP.  This could be for a variety of reasons
   including policy reasons, restoration within the core, preemption,
   etc.

   In such a scenario, if the ingress client receives a changed label
   via the LABEL object in a modified Resv message, it retunes the laser
   at the ingress to the new wavelength.  Similarly, if the egress
   client receives a changed label via UPSTREAM_LABEL/LABEL_SET in a
   modified Path message, it retunes the laser at the egress to the new
   wavelength.

   This document defines a special label value to be carried in the
   UPSTREAM_LABEL object of a Path message.  This special label value is
   used to enable the function of requesting network assignment of an
   upstream label.  The changes proposed in this document pertain to the
   semantics of a specific field in an existing RSVP object and the

   corresponding procedures.  Thus, there are no new security
   implications raised by this document and the security considerations
   discussed by [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] still apply.

   For a general discussion on MPLS and GMPLS related security issues,
