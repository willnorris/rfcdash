<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Specification 1000D [<a href="#ref-1" title='"ASD Specification 1000D"'>1</a>] (S1000D) is an international specification
   for the procurement and production of technical publications.  The
   current issue of the specification has been jointly produced by the
   Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD;
   previously AECMA, European Association of Aerospace Industries) and
   the Aerospace Industries Association of America (AIA).  The
   specification is used worldwide by a variety of commercial and
   government entities for the development of technical documentation.

   The specification adopts ISO, Computer-Aided Acquisition and Life-
   Cycle Support (CALS), and W3C standards to promote document
   standardization in which information is generated in a neutral
   format.  Compliant documentation generated using the specification
   can be processed on different, and often disparate, IT systems.  It
   is this feature, added to the concept of modularization, that makes
   the specification acceptable to the wider international community.

   Portions of S1000D define a resource coding system allowing resources
   created under the specification to be uniquely identified in global
   environment.  To provide for the creation of a web-based resource
   management system, ASD would like to assign URNs [<a href="#ref-2" title='"URN Syntax"'>2</a>][3][<a href="#ref-4" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms"'>4</a>] to
   resources created under the specification in order to retain unique,
   permanent, location-independent names for these resources, in
   addition to providing a framework for resolution of these resources.

   For more information about ASD and S1000D, see <a href="http://www.s1000d.org">http://www.s1000d.org</a>.

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

   Declaration of structure:

      The identifier has the following ABNF [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>5</a>] structure.

      ;start ABNF notation

      URN = "URN:" namespace NSS

      namespace = "S1000D:"

      NSS = dmc-nss / pmc-nss / csn-nss / icn-nss
            com-nss / ddn-nss / dml-nss

      ;Define the subnamespace as an subnamespace identifier
      ;plus a subnamespace code string
      dmc-nss = "DMC-" nss-code
      pmc-nss = "PMC-" nss-code
      csn-nss = "CSN-" nss-code
      icn-nss = "ICN-" nss-code
      com-nss = "COM-" nss-code
      ddn-nss = "DDN-" nss-code
      dml-nss = "DML-" nss-code

      ;Define the subnamespace code as a string encoded to the
      ;format specified by the namespace identifier and an
      ;optional extension string indicating the resource status.
      nss-code = subcode subext

      ;The code strings are a groups of alpha and digit characters
      ;separated by the dash character.  The specific code syntax
      ;for each subnamespace is described in ASD Specification 1000D.
      subcode = 1*(DIGIT / ALPHA / "-")

      ;Define the encoding extension as an optional set of status
      ;indicators separated by the "_" character.
      subext = [issue] [lang]
      issue  = "_I-" 3DIGIT

      lang   = "_L-" 2ALPHA

      ;ABNF core rules <a href="./rfc2234">RFC 2234</a>, listed for clarity

      ;DIGIT  =  %x30-39             ; 0-9

      ;end ABNF notation

      The following subnamespaces are currently defined:

       "DMC" - contains all Data Modules Codes
       "PMC" - contains all Publication Module Codes
       "CSN" - contains all Catalogue Sequence Numbers
       "ICN" - contains all Illustration Control Numbers.
       "COM" - contains all Comment Codes.
       "DDN" - contains all Data Dispatch Notices.
       "DML" - contains all Data Module Lists.

      Example usage:

      URN:S1000D:{subid}-{subcode}_{subext}

      e.g., URN:S1000D:DMC-AE-A-07-05-0000-00A-040A-A_I-001_L-EN

      where:
      {subid}   = DMC, The code is a Data Module Code
      {subcode} = AE-A-07-05-0000-00A-040A-A, String in DMC syntax
      {subext}  = _I-001_L-EN, the first issue in English.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      Identifier uniqueness is guaranteed through processes outlined
      within ASD S1000D.  All codes defined within the specification
      must begin with a Model Identifier (MI) that will be registered
      with the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) and is never
      to be reused.  All project-generated codes are prefixed by the
      assigned MI and are required by the specification to be unique
      within the scope of the project.  Since all project codes are
      prefixed by a globally unique MI, and since these codes must be
      unique within the project, all generated identifiers will be
      globally unique.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4688">RFC 4688</a>       URN Namespace for ASD Specification 1000D    October 2006</span>


   Identifier persistence considerations:

      Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon suitable delegation
      of resolution and the fact that generated identifiers are to be
      persistent once published.  Existing information objects can be
      used in new projects by referencing them through their persistent
      identifiers.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Identifiers are assigned in the following manner.  Projects are
      assigned a Model Identifier by the NAMSA organization.  Projects
      then generate identifiers using the processes outlined in ASD
      S1000D.  The codes are prefixed with the encoding identifier and
      possibly postfixed by the extension status identifiers.

   Process for identifier resolution:

      The project identified by the Model Identifier is responsible for
      providing a method of resource resolution.  A suggested method of
      resolution is outlined in ASD S1000D.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      All generated identifiers are to be considered case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      Identifiers must conform to ASD S1000D.

   Scope:

      Global.

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

   Resources will be named and maintained in accordance with the
   processes described in this document, in addition to the processes
   described in S1000D.  Any organization or individual can utilize the
   specification to create resources described by S1000D.  Resolution
   and/or use of created resources is unrestricted by the specification
   in order to promote widespread adoption of open ASD standards,
   although organizations creating resources may control them as they
   see fit.
