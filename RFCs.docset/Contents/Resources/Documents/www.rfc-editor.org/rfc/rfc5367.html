Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document specifies a way to create subscription to a list of
   resources in SIP.  This is achieved by including the list of
   resources in the body of a SUBSCRIBE request.  Instead of having a
   subscriber send a SUBSCRIBE request for each resource individually,
   the subscriber defines the resource list, subscribes to it, and gets
   notifications about changes in the resources' states using a single
   SUBSCRIBE dialog.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC4662">RFC4662</a>] specifies how to establish subscriptions to a homogeneous
   resource list in SIP (which is specified in [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>]) and defines
   the procedures for getting notifications about changes in the state
   of the associated resources.  Yet, list creation is outside the scope
   of [<a href="./rfc4662" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>].

   This document specifies a way to create a list with a set of
   resources and subscribe to it using a single SIP request.  This is
   achieved by including the list of resources (as defined in [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI- List Services"'>RFC5363</a>])
   in the body of the SUBSCRIBE request.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20User%20Agent%20Client%20Procedures"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  User Agent Client Procedures</span>

   A UAC (User Agent Client) that wants to create a resource list and
   subscribe to it using the mechanism described in this document
   constructs a SUBSCRIBE request with at least one body, whose
   disposition is type "recipient-list" as defined in [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI- List Services"'>RFC5363</a>], that
   contains the URI list.  Additionally, the UAC MUST include the
   'recipient-list-subscribe' option-tag (which is registered with the
   IANA in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>) in a Require header field.  The UAC MUST build the
   rest of the SUBSCRIBE request following the rules in [<a href="./rfc3265" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>].

   The UAC MUST support the "rlmi+xml" format defined in [<a href="./rfc4662" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>] and
   signal this by including "rlmi+xml" in the Accept header.  The UAC
   MAY support additional formats and include them in the Accept header
   field of the SUBSCRIBE request.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Response%20Handling"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Response Handling</span>

   The status code in the response to the SUBSCRIBE request does not
   provide any information about whether or not the resource list server
   was able to successfully subscribe to the URIs in the URI list.  The
   UAC obtains this information in the notifications sent by the server.










<span class="grey">Camarillo                   Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5367">RFC 5367</a>               SUBSCRIBE-Contained Lists            October 2008</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Subsequent%20SUBSCRIBE%20Requests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Subsequent SUBSCRIBE Requests</span>

   The previous sections have specified how to include a URI list in an
   initial SUBSCRIBE request to a resource list server in order to
   subscribe to the state of a set of resources.  Once the subscription
   has been created and a dialog between the UAC and the resource list
   server has been established, the UAC can send subsequent SUBSCRIBE
   requests to, for example, extend the duration of the subscription.

   At this point, there are no semantics associated with resource-list
   bodies in subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests (although future extensions
   can define them).  Therefore, UACs SHOULD NOT include resource-list
   bodies in subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests to a resource list server.

      Note that a difference between an initial SUBSCRIBE request and
      subsequent ones is that while the initial request is sent to the
      public URI of the resource list, subsequent ones are sent to the
      URI provided by the server when the dialog is established.
      Therefore, from the UAC's point of view, the resource identified
      by the former URI supports recipient-list bodies, while the
      resource identified by the latter does not support them.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20URI-List%20Document%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  URI-List Document Format</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC5363">RFC5363</a>] mandates that each URI-list services specification, such as
   the subscription service defined here, specifies the default format
   for the recipient-list bodies used within the particular service.

   The default format for the recipient-list bodies for the subscription
   service defined in this document is the resource list format defined
   in [<a href="./rfc4826" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) Formats for Representing Resource Lists"'>RFC4826</a>].  UAs (User Agents) generating recipient-list bodies
   MUST support this format and MAY support other formats.  Resource
   list servers able to handle recipient-list bodies MUST support this
   format and MAY support other formats.

   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol
   (XCAP) resource list document provides features, such as hierarchical
   lists and the ability to include entries by reference relative to the
   XCAP root URI, that are not needed by the subscription service
   defined here, which only needs to transfer a flat list of URIs
   between a UA and the resource list server.  Therefore, when using the
   default resource list document, UAs SHOULD use flat lists (i.e., no
   hierarchical lists) and SHOULD NOT use &lt;entry-ref&gt; elements.  A
   resource list server receiving a URI list with more information than
   what has just been described MAY discard all the extra information.

   Figure 1 shows an example of a flat list that follows the resource
   list document.

       &lt;entry uri="sip:bill@example.com" /&gt;
       &lt;entry uri="sip:joe@example.org" /&gt;
       &lt;entry uri="sip:ted@example.net" /&gt;
     &lt;/list&gt;
   &lt;/resource-lists&gt;

                            Figure 1: URI list

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Resource%20List%20Server%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Resource List Server Behavior</span>

   Resource list servers that are able to receive and process SUBSCRIBE
   requests with a recipient-list body SHOULD include a 'recipient-list-
   subscribe' option-tag in a Supported header field when responding to
   OPTIONS requests.

   On reception of a SUBSCRIBE request with a URI list, a resource list
   server that chooses to accept the "rlmi+xml" format MUST comply with
   [<a href="./rfc4662" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>] for creating the subscription and reporting the changes in
   the resources within the created dialog.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Subsequent%20SUBSCRIBE%20Requests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Subsequent SUBSCRIBE Requests</span>

   At this point, there are no semantics associated with resource-list
   bodies in subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests (although future extensions
   may define them).  Therefore, a resource list server receiving a
   subsequent SUBSCRIBE request with a resource-list body, following
   standard SIP procedures, rejects it with a 415 (Unsupported Media
   Type) response.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Providing%20a%20URI%20to%20Manipulate%20a%20Resource%20List"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Providing a URI to Manipulate a Resource List</span>

   A UAC can manipulate a resource list at a resource list server.  The
   resource list server MAY provide a URI to manipulate the resource
   list associated with a subscription using the Call-Info header field
   in the NOTIFY request that establishes the subscription.  The
   "purpose" parameter of the Call-Info header field MUST have a value
   of 'list-management', which we register with the IANA in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.
   The following is an example of such a header field.

   Call-Info: &lt;http://xcap.example.com/your-list.xml&gt;
              ;purpose=list-management



<span class="grey">Camarillo                   Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5367">RFC 5367</a>               SUBSCRIBE-Contained Lists            October 2008</span>


   The lifetime of a resource list to be manipulated by the URI provided
   by the server is bundled to the lifetime of the subscription.  That
   is, the resource list SHOULD be destroyed when the subscription
   expires or is otherwise terminated.

   <a href="./rfc3265#section-7.1">Section 7.1 of [RFC3265]</a> does not list the Call-Info header field in
   the table of header fields that NOTIFY requests can carry.  This
   document updates that table so that the Call-Info header field can be
   optionally included in NOTIFY requests.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Example</span>

   The following is an example of a SUBSCRIBE request, which carries a
   URI list in its body, sent by a UAC to a resource list server.

   The Security Considerations section of [<a href="./rfc4662" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>] discusses security
   issues related to resource list servers.  Resource list servers
   accepting request-contained URI lists MUST also follow the security
   guidelines given in [<a href="./rfc4662" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>].

   "Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) URI-List Services" [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI- List Services"'>RFC5363</a>] discusses issues related
   to SIP URI-list services.  Given that a resource list server sending
   SUBSCRIBE requests to a set of users acts as a URI-list service,
   implementations of resource list servers that handle request-
   contained URI lists MUST follow the security-related rules in
   [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI- List Services"'>RFC5363</a>].  These rules include opt-in lists and mandatory
   authentication and authorization of clients.

   The following sections describe the IANA registration of the 'list-
   management' value for the "purpose" parameter of the Call-Info header
   field and the 'recipient-list-subscribe' SIP option-tag.

   This document defines the 'list-management' value for the "purpose"
