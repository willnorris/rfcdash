<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Overview</span>

   A conventional IMAP or POP client may open a mailbox containing
   internationalized messages or may even attempt to read
   internationalized messages, for instance, when a user has both
   internationalized and conventional Mail User Agents (MUAs).

   Some operations cannot be performed by conventional clients.  Most
   importantly, an internationalized message usually contains at least
   one internationalized address, so address-based operations are rarely
   possible.  This includes displaying the addresses, replying to
   messages, and the processing of most types of address-based signature
   or security.

   However, the sender's name, message subject, body of text, and
   attachments can easily be displayed, so a helpful IMAP or POP server
   may prefer to display as much of the message as possible, rather than
   hide the message entirely.

   This document specifies a way to present such messages to the client.
   It values simplicity of implementation over fidelity of
   representation, since implementing a high-fidelity downgrade
   algorithm such as the one specified in a companion document [<a href="./rfc6857" title='"Post-Delivery Message Downgrading for Internationalized Email Messages"'>RFC6857</a>]
   is likely more work than implementing proper UTF-8 support for POP
   [<a href="./rfc6856" title='"Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3) Support for UTF-8"'>RFC6856</a>] and/or IMAP [<a href="./rfc6855" title='"IMAP Support for UTF-8"'>RFC6855</a>].

   The server is assumed to be internationalized internally and to store
   messages that are internationalized messages natively.  When it needs
   to present an internationalized message to a conventional client, the
   server synthesizes a conventional message containing most of the
   information and presents the "surrogate message".

   This specification modifies the base IMAP specification [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>] by
   relaxing a requirement that sizes be exact and adding a reporting
   requirement as discussed in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> below.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Information%20Preserved%20and%20Lost"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Information Preserved and Lost</span>

   The surrogate message is intended to convey the most important
   information to the user.  Where information is lost, the user should
   consider the message incomplete rather than modified.

   The surrogate message is not intended to convey any information to
   the client software that would require or enable it to apply special
   handling to the message.  Client authors who wish to handle
   internationalized messages are encouraged to implement POP [<a href="./rfc6856" title='"Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3) Support for UTF-8"'>RFC6856</a>]
   and/or IMAP [<a href="./rfc6855" title='"IMAP Support for UTF-8"'>RFC6855</a>] support for UTF-8.

   Uppercase letters in examples represent non-ASCII characters.
   example.com is a plain domain; EXAMPLE.com represents a non-ASCII
   domain in the .com top-level domain.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Email%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Email Addresses</span>

   Each internationalized email address in the header fields listed
   below is replaced with an invalid email address whose display-name
   tells the user what happened.

   The format of the display-name is explicitly unspecified.  Anything
   that tells the user what happened is good.  Anything that produces an
   email address that might belong to someone else is bad.

   Given an internationalized address "Fred Foo &lt;fred@EXAMPLE.com&gt;", an
   implementation may choose to render it as one of these examples:

      "fred@EXAMPLE.com" &lt;invalid@internationalized-address.invalid&gt;
      Fred Foo &lt;invalid@internationalized.invalid&gt;
      internationalized-address:;
      fred:;

   The .invalid top-level domain is reserved as a Top Level DNS Name
   [<a href="./rfc2606" title='"Reserved Top Level DNS Names"'>RFC2606</a>]; therefore, the first two examples are syntactically valid,
   but they will never belong to anyone.  Note that the display-name
   often needs encoding (see the Message Header Extensions document
   [<a href="./rfc2047" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text"'>RFC2047</a>]).

   The affected header fields are "Bcc:", "Cc:", "From:", "Reply-To:",
   "Resent-Bcc:", "Resent-Cc:", "Resent-From:", "Resent-Sender:",
   "Resent-To:", "Return-Path:", "Sender:", and "To:".  Any addresses
   present in other header fields, such as "Received:", are not regarded
   as addresses by this specification.

   Any MIME parameter [<a href="./rfc2045" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>RFC2045</a>] (whether in the message header or a body
   part header) that cannot be presented to the client exactly as it
   appears in the incoming message is silently excised.

   Given a field such as

      Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=FOO

   the field is presented as

      Content-Disposition: attachment

   If the Subject field cannot be presented to the client exactly as it
   appears in the incoming message, the server presents a representation
   encoded as specified in <a href="./rfc2047">RFC 2047</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20Remaining%20Header%20Fields"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Remaining Header Fields</span>

   Any header field that cannot be presented to the client, even with
   the modifications listed in Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>-<a href="#section-2.3">2.3</a>, is silently excised.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20IMAP-Specific%20Details"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  IMAP-Specific Details</span>

   IMAP allows clients to retrieve the message size without downloading
   the message, using <a href="./rfc822">RFC822</a>.SIZE, BODY.SIZE[] and so on.  The IMAP
   specification [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>] requires that the returned size be exact.

   This specification relaxes that requirement.  When a conventional
   client requests size information for a message, the IMAP server is
   permitted to return size information for the internationalized
   message, even though the size of the surrogate message differs.

   When an IMAP server performs downgrading as part of generating FETCH
   responses, it reports which messages were synthesized using a
   response code and attendant UID (Unique Identifier) set.  This can be
   helpful to humans debugging the server and/or client.

      C: a UID FETCH 1:* BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS(To From Cc)]
      S: 1 FETCH (UID 65 [...]
      S: 2 FETCH (UID 70 [...]
      S: a OK [DOWNGRADED 70,105,108,109] Done

   The message-set argument to DOWNGRADED contains UIDs.

   Note that DOWNGRADED does not necessarily mention all the
   internationalized messages in the mailbox.  In the example above, we
   know that UID 65 does not contain internationalized addresses in the
   "From:", "To:", and "Cc:" fields.  It may, for example, contain an
   internationalized "Subject:".

   The number of lines specified in the TOP command [<a href="./rfc1939" title='"Post Office Protocol - Version 3"'>RFC1939</a>] refers to
   the surrogate message.  The message size reported by, for example,
   LIST may refer to either the internationalized or the surrogate
   message.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   If the internationalized message uses any sort of signature that
   covers header fields, the signature of the surrogate message almost
   certainly is invalid and may be invalid in other cases.  This is a
   necessary limitation of displaying internationalized messages in
   legacy clients, since those clients do not support internationalized
   header fields.  These cases are discussed in more detail in the POP
   or IMAP Downgrade document [<a href="./rfc6857" title='"Post-Delivery Message Downgrading for Internationalized Email Messages"'>RFC6857</a>].  Even though invalid, these
   signatures should not be removed from the surrogate message, to
   preserve as much of the information as possible from the original
   message.

   If any excised information is significant, then that information does
   not arrive at the recipient.  Notably, the "Message-Id:",
   "In-Reference-To:", and "References:" fields may be excised, which
   might cause a lack of context when the recipient reads the message.

   Some POP or IMAP clients, such as Fetchmail, download messages and
   delete the versions on the server.  This may lead to permanent loss
   of information when the only remaining version of a message is the
   surrogate message.

   Other clients cache messages for a very long time, even across client
   upgrades, such as the stock Android client.  When such a client is
   internationalized, care must be taken so that it does not use an old
   surrogate message from its cache rather than retrieve the real
   message from the server.
