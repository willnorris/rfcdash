Abstract

   Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) directory has a defined syntax (i.e., data type).  A syntax
   definition specifies how attribute values conforming to the syntax
   are normally represented when transferred in LDAP operations.  This
   representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific encoding to
   distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.  This
   document defines an attribute option, the binary option, that can be
   used to specify that the associated attribute values are instead
   encoded according to the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) used by X.500
   directories.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4522">RFC 4522</a>            LDAP: The Binary Encoding Option           June 2006</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) directory [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>] has a defined syntax (i.e., data type)
   which constrains the structure and format of its values.

   The description of each syntax [<a href="./rfc4517" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Syntaxes and Matching Rules"'>RFC4517</a>] specifies how attribute or
   assertion values [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>] conforming to the syntax are normally
   represented when transferred in LDAP operations [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].  This
   representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific encoding to
   distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.

   This document defines an attribute option, the binary option, which
   can be used in an attribute description [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>] in an LDAP
   operation to specify that the associated attribute values or
   assertion values are, or are requested to be, encoded according to
   the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) [<a href="#ref-BER" title=" Information Technology - ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Basic Encoding Rules (BER)">BER</a>] as used by X.500 [<a href="#ref-X.500" title=" Information technology - Open Systems Interconnection - The Directory: Overview of concepts">X.500</a>]
   directories, instead of the usual LDAP-specific encoding.

   The binary option was originally defined in <a href="./rfc2251">RFC 2251</a> [<a href="./rfc2251" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)"'>RFC2251</a>].  The
   LDAP technical specification [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>] has obsoleted the previously
   defined LDAP technical specification [<a href="./rfc3377" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Technical Specification"'>RFC3377</a>], which included <a href="./rfc2251">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2251">2251</a>.  The binary option was not included in the revised LDAP
   technical specification for a variety of reasons including
   implementation inconsistencies.  No attempt is made here to resolve
   the known inconsistencies.

   This document reintroduces the binary option for use with certain
   attribute syntaxes, such as certificate syntax [<a href="./rfc4523" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema Definitions for X.509 Certificates"'>RFC4523</a>], that
   specifically require it.  No attempt has been made to address use of
   the binary option with attributes of syntaxes that do not require its
   use.  Unless addressed in a future specification, this use is to be
   avoided.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Conventions</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>
   [<a href="#ref-BCP14" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>BCP14</a>].

   The binary option is indicated with the attribute option string
   "binary" in an attribute description.  Note that, like all attribute
   options, the string representing the binary option is case
   insensitive.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4522">RFC 4522</a>            LDAP: The Binary Encoding Option           June 2006</span>


   Where the binary option is present in an attribute description, the
   associated attribute values or assertion values MUST be BER encoded
   (otherwise the values are encoded according to the LDAP-specific
   encoding [<a href="./rfc4517" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Syntaxes and Matching Rules"'>RFC4517</a>] for the attribute's syntax).  Note that it is
   possible for a syntax to be defined such that its LDAP-specific
   encoding is exactly the same as its BER encoding.

   In terms of the protocol [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>], the binary option specifies that
   the contents octets of the associated AttributeValue or
   AssertionValue OCTET STRING are a complete BER encoding of the
   relevant value.

   The binary option is not a tagging option [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>], so the presence
   of the binary option does not specify an attribute subtype.  An
   attribute description containing the binary option references exactly
   the same attribute as the attribute description without the binary
   option.  The supertype/subtype relationships of attributes with
   tagging options are not altered in any way by the presence or absence
   of the binary option.

   An attribute description SHALL be treated as unrecognized if it
   contains the binary option and the syntax of the attribute does not
   have an associated ASN.1 type [<a href="./rfc4517" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Syntaxes and Matching Rules"'>RFC4517</a>], or the BER encoding of
   values of that type is not supported.

   The presence or absence of the binary option only affects the
   transfer of attribute and assertion values in the protocol; servers
   store any particular attribute value in a format of their choosing.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Syntaxes%20Requiring%20Binary%20Transfer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Syntaxes Requiring Binary Transfer</span>

   The attribute values of certain attribute syntaxes are defined
   without an LDAP-specific encoding and are required to be transferred
   in the BER-encoded form.  For the purposes of this document, these
   syntaxes are said to have a binary transfer requirement.  The
   certificate, certificate list, certificate pair, and supported
   algorithm syntaxes [<a href="./rfc4523" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema Definitions for X.509 Certificates"'>RFC4523</a>] are examples of syntaxes with a binary
   transfer requirement.  These syntaxes also have an additional
   requirement that the exact BER encoding must be preserved.  Note that
   this is a property of the syntaxes themselves, and not a property of
   the binary option.  In the absence of this requirement, LDAP clients
   would need to re-encode values using the Distinguished Encoding Rules
   (DER).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4522">RFC 4522</a>            LDAP: The Binary Encoding Option           June 2006</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Attributes%20Returned%20in%20a%20Search"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Attributes Returned in a Search</span>

   An LDAP search request [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] contains a list of the attributes
   (the requested attributes list) to be returned from each entry
   matching the search filter.  An attribute description in the
   requested attributes list also implicitly requests all subtypes of
   the attribute type in the attribute description, whether through
   attribute subtyping or attribute tagging option subtyping [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>].

   The requested attributes list MAY contain attribute descriptions with
   the binary option, but MUST NOT contain two attribute descriptions
   with the same attribute type and the same tagging options (even if
   only one of them has the binary option).  The binary option in an
   attribute description in the requested attributes list implicitly
   applies to all the subtypes of the attribute type in the attribute
   description (however, see <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>).

   Attributes of a syntax with the binary transfer requirement, if
   returned, SHALL be returned in the binary form (i.e., with the binary
   option in the attribute description and the associated attribute
   values BER encoded) regardless of whether the binary option was
   present in the request (for the attribute or for one of its
   supertypes).

   Attributes of a syntax without the binary transfer requirement, if
   returned, SHOULD be returned in the form explicitly requested.  That
   is, if the attribute description in the requested attributes list
   contains the binary option, then the corresponding attribute in the
   result SHOULD be in the binary form.  If the attribute description in
   the request does not contain the binary option, then the
   corresponding attribute in the result SHOULD NOT be in the binary
   form.  A server MAY omit an attribute from the result if it does not
   support the requested encoding.

   Regardless of the encoding chosen, a particular attribute value is
   returned at most once.

   If the list of attributes in a search request is empty or contains
   the special attribute description string "*", then all user
   attributes are requested to be returned.

   Attributes of a syntax with the binary transfer requirement, if
   returned, SHALL be returned in the binary form.

   Attributes of a syntax without the binary transfer requirement and
   having a defined LDAP-specific encoding SHOULD NOT be returned in the
   binary form.

   Attributes of a syntax without the binary transfer requirement and
   without a defined LDAP-specific encoding may be returned in the
   binary form or omitted from the result.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Conflicting%20Requests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Conflicting Requests</span>

   A particular attribute could be explicitly requested by an attribute
   description and/or implicitly requested by the attribute descriptions
   of one or more of its supertypes, or by the special attribute
   description string "*".  If the binary option is present in at least
   one, but not all, of these attribute descriptions then the effect of
   the request with respect to binary transfer is implementation
   defined.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   When interpreting security-sensitive fields, and in particular fields
   used to grant or deny access, implementations MUST ensure that any
   matching rule comparisons are done on the underlying abstract value,
   regardless of the particular encoding used.
