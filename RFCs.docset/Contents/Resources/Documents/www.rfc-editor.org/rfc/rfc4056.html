Abstract

   This document specifies the conventions for using the RSASSA-PSS (RSA
   Probabilistic Signature Scheme) digital signature algorithm with the
   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Overview</span>

   This document specifies the conventions for using the RSA

   (DER) [<a href="#ref-X.509-88">X.509-88</a>].

   This document is written to be used in conjunction with <a href="./rfc4055">RFC 4055</a>
   [<a href="#ref-RSA-ALGS" title='"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RSA-ALGS</a>].  All of the ASN.1 structures referenced in this document
   are defined in <a href="./rfc4055">RFC 4055</a>.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20PSS%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  PSS Algorithm</span>

   Although there are no known defects with the PKCS #1 v1.5 [<a href="#ref-P1v1.5" title='"PKCS #1: RSA Encryption Version 1.5"'>P1v1.5</a>]
   signature algorithm, RSASSA-PSS [<a href="#ref-P1v2.1" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.1"'>P1v2.1</a>] was developed in an effort
   to have more mathematically provable security.  PKCS #1 v1.5
   signatures were developed in an ad hoc manner; RSASSA-PSS was
   developed based on mathematical foundations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Algorithm%20Identifiers%20and%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Algorithm Identifiers and Parameters</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Certificate%20Identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Certificate Identifiers</span>

   The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is defined in <a href="./rfc3447">RFC 3447</a> [<a href="#ref-P1v2.1" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.1"'>P1v2.1</a>].
   Conventions for encoding the public key are defined in <a href="./rfc4055">RFC 4055</a>
   [<a href="#ref-RSA-ALGS" title='"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RSA-ALGS</a>].

   Two algorithm identifiers for RSA subject public keys in certificates
   are used.  These are:

      rsaEncryption OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-1 1 }

   and

      id-RSASSA-PSS OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-1 10 }

   When the rsaEncryption algorithm identifier is used for a public key,
   the AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field MUST contain NULL.  Complete
   details can be found in [<a href="#ref-RSA-ALGS" title='"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RSA-ALGS</a>].

   When the id-RSASSA-PSS algorithm identifier is used for a public key,
   the AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field MUST either be absent or
   contain RSASSA-PSS-params. Again, complete details can be found in
   [<a href="#ref-RSA-ALGS" title='"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RSA-ALGS</a>].

   In both cases, the RSA public key, which is composed of a modulus and
   a public exponent, MUST be encoded using the RSAPublicKey type.  The
   output of this encoding is carried in the certificate subject public
   key.

         RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
            modulus INTEGER, -- n
            publicExponent INTEGER } -- e

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4056">RFC 4056</a>                 CMS and PSS Signature                 June 2005</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Signature%20Identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Signature Identifiers</span>

   The algorithm identifier for RSASAA-PSS signatures is:

      id-RSASSA-PSS OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {pkcs-1 10 }

   When the id-RSASSA-PSS algorithm identifier is used for a signature,
   the AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field MUST contain RSASSA-PSS-
   params.  Information about RSASSA-PSS-params can be found in [RSA-
   ALGS].

   When signing, the RSA algorithm generates a single value, and that
   value is used directly as the signature value.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Signed-data%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Signed-data Conventions</span>

   digestAlgorithms SHOULD contain the one-way hash function used to
   compute the message digest on the eContent value.

   The same one-way hash function SHOULD be used for computing the
   message digest on both the eContent and the signedAttributes value if
   signedAttributes exist.

   The same one-way hash function MUST be used for computing the message
   digest on the signedAttributes and as the hashAlgorithm in the RSA-
   PSS-params structure.

   signatureAlgorithm MUST contain id-RSASSA-PSS.  The algorithm
   parameters field MUST contain RSASSA-PSS-params.

   signature contains the single value resulting from the signing
   operation.

   If the subjectPublicKeyInfo algorithm identifier for the public key
   in the certificate is id-RSASSA-PSS and the parameters field is
   present, the following additional steps MUST be done as part of
   signature validation:

   1.  The hashAlgorithm field in the certificate
       subjectPublicKey.algorithm parameters and the signatureAlgorithm
       parameters MUST be the same.

   2.  The maskGenAlgorithm field in the certificate
       subjectPublicKey.algorithm parameters and the signatureAlgorithm
       parameters MUST be the same.

   3.  The saltLength in the signatureAlgorithm parameters MUST be
       greater or equal to the saltLength in the certificate
       subjectPublicKey.algorithm parameters.

   4.  The trailerField in the certificate subjectPublicKey.algorithm
       parameters and signatureAlgorithm parameters MUST be the same.

   In doing the above comparisons, default values are considered to be
   the same as extant values.  If any of the above four steps is not
   true, the signature checking algorithm MUST fail validation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Implementations must protect the RSA private key.  Compromise of the
   RSA private key may result in the ability to forge signatures.

   The generation of RSA private key relies on random numbers.  The use
   of inadequate pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate
   these values can result in little or no security.  An attacker may
   find it much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced
   the keys, searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather
   than brute force searching the whole key space.  The generation of
   quality random numbers is difficult.  <a href="./rfc1750">RFC 1750</a> [<a href="#ref-RANDOM" title='"Randomness Recommendations for Security"'>RANDOM</a>] offers
   important guidance in this area.

   Using the same private key for different algorithms has the potential
   of allowing an attacker to get extra information about the key.  It
   is strongly suggested that the same key not be used for both the PKCS
   #1 v1.5 and RSASSA-PSS signature algorithms.

   When computing signatures, the same hash function should be used for
   all operations.  This reduces the number of failure points in the
   signature process.

   The parameter checking procedures outlined in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> are of
   special importance.  It is possible to forge signatures by changing
   (especially to weaker values) these parameter values.  Signers using
   this algorithm should take care that only one set of parameter values
   is used as this decreases the possibility of leaking information.
