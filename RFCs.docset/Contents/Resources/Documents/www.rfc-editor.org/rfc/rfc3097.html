Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo resolves a duplication in the assignment of RSVP Message
   Types, by changing the Message Types assigned by <a href="./rfc2747">RFC 2747</a> to
   Challenge and Integrity Response messages.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc2747">RFC 2747</a> ("RSVP Cryptographic Authentication") [<a href="./rfc2747" title='"RSVP Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC2747</a>] assigns RSVP
   Message Type 12 to an Integrity Response message, while <a href="./rfc2961">RFC 2961</a>
   ("RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions") [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>] assigns the
   same value to a Bundle message.  This memo resolves the conflict over
   RSVP Message Type 12 by assigning a different value to the Message
   Type of the Integrity Response Message in <a href="./rfc2747">RFC 2747</a>.  It is believed
   that the protocol defined by <a href="./rfc2961">RFC 2961</a> entered use in the field before
   the RFC's publication and before the conflicting Message Type was
   noticed, and that it may be easier to install new software in
   environments that have deployed the Integrity object than in those
   that have deployed the refresh reduction extension.

   To simplify possible interoperability problems caused by this change,
   we also assign a new value to the Message Type of <a href="./rfc2747">RFC 2747</a>'s
   Challenge message, to which the Integrity Response message is a
   reply.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Modification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Modification</span>

   Message Types defined in the RSVP Integrity extension [<a href="./rfc2747">RFC 2747</a>]
   shall be changed as follows:

      o Challenge message has Message Type 25.
      o Integrity Response message has Message Type 25+1.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Compatibility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Compatibility</span>

   Two communicating nodes whose Integrity implementations are
   conformant with this modification will interoperate, using Message
   Type 12 for Bundle messages and Message Types 25 and 26 for the
   Integrity handshake.  A non-conformant implementation of the
   Integrity extension will not interoperate with a conformant
   implementation (though two non-conformant implementations can
   interoperate as before).

   There is no possibility of an Integrity handshake succeeding
   accidentally due to this change, since both sides of the handshake
   use the new numbers or the old numbers.  Furthermore, the Integrity
   Response message includes a 32-bit cookie that must match a cookie in
   the Challenge message, else the challenge will fail.  Finally, a
   non-conformant implementation should never receive a Bundle message
   that it interprets as an Integrity Response message, since <a href="./rfc2961">RFC 2961</a>
   requires that Bundle messages be sent only to a Bundle-capable node.
