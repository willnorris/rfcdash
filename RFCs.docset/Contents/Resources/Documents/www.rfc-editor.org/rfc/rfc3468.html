Abstract

   This document documents the consensus reached by the Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) Working Group within the IETF to focus its
   efforts on "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)-TE: Extensions to
   RSVP for Label-Switched Paths (LSP) Tunnels" (<a href="./rfc3209">RFC 3209</a>) as the MPLS
   signalling protocol for traffic engineering applications and to
   undertake no new efforts relating to "Constraint-Based LSP Setup
   using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)" (<a href="./rfc3212">RFC 3212</a>).  The
   recommendations of <a href="#section-6">section 6</a> have been accepted by the IESG.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Background</span>

   Very early (1997) in the MPLS standardization it was clear that a
   protocol would be needed that would enable providers to setup LSPs
   that took other information (e.g., various QoS parameters) into
   account.

   Development of this type of signalling protocol took two different
   tracks:

   -  extensions to RSVP for setting up MPLS tunnels [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>]

   -  extensions to LDP for setting constraint based LSPs [<a href="./rfc3212" title='"Constraint-Based LSP Setup using LDP"'>RFC3212</a>]

   The motivation for the choice of protocol in both cases was
   straightforward.  Extending RSVP-TE to do in an MPLS environment what
   it already was doing (handling QoS information and reserving
   resources) in an IP environment is comprehensible; you only have to
   add the label distribution capability.  Extending a native MPLS





<span class="grey">Andersson &amp; Swallow          Informational                      [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3468">RFC 3468</a>          Decision on MPLS Signaling Protocols     February 2003</span>


   protocol like LDP, which was designed to do label distribution, to
   handle some extra TLVs with QoS information is also not
   revolutionary.

   The MPLS group never reached a consensus on which way to go.  Both
   protocols were progressed to proposed standard.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20CCAMP%20implementation%20study"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  CCAMP implementation study</span>

   An implementation survey of GMPLS implementations was published in
   June 2002 [<a href="#ref-GMPLS" title='"Generalized MPLS Signaling - Implementation Survey"'>GMPLS</a>].  The survey includes responses from 22 different
   implementers.  Twenty-one of 22 implementations include the GMPLS
   signalling based on [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>], while only 3 include signalling based
   on [<a href="./rfc3212" title='"Constraint-Based LSP Setup using LDP"'>RFC3212</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20MPLS%20Working%20Group%20discussion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  MPLS Working Group discussion</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1%20Phase%201"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a> Phase 1</span>

   The GMPLS implementation report prompted questions asking if it was
   reasonable to have two different protocols for the same thing.  The
   discussion was brought to the MPLS Working Group at the meeting in
   Yokohama in July 2002.  After discussion at the meeting it was
   decided to "bring this to the list" and also invite comments from the
   other Sub-IP Area Working Groups.

   The following question sent to the mailing lists:

   "As there are issues with having two similar standards (potentially
   diverging), and it generates duplicate work in several IETF working
   groups, the question was asked whether we should make CR-LDP
   informational (which still make it available and possible to work
   with) and progress only RSVP-TE on the standards track."

   The response to this question was largely positive, but some problems
   were immediately pointed out:

   -  there are non-IETF standards which reference <a href="./rfc3212">RFC 3212</a>.  Taking
      CR-LDP off the standards track would cause un-necessary problems
      for those organizations and should be done only after co-
      ordinating with those organizations

   -  there is, e.g., in <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a> [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>], no documented process
      according to which a document on the standards track may be move
      to a status that is non-standards track






<span class="grey">Andersson &amp; Swallow          Informational                      [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3468">RFC 3468</a>          Decision on MPLS Signaling Protocols     February 2003</span>


   Each of these arguments is by themselves strong and would have led to
   some reformulation of the proposal to move CR-LDP to informational.
   Moreover, in combination it was clear that the original proposal was
   not viable.

   On the other hand the support for doing additional development of
   CR-LDP as an IETF standards track alternative to RSVP-TE was
   extremely small.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2%20IETF%20process"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a> IETF process</span>

   The current IETF process for managing changes in RFC status does not
   include any information on how to move an existing standard track RFC
   to a non-standard track status, nor does it include a prohibition of
   such an action.  It has been shown that such actions have been
   previously taken e.g., RFCs 2673 and 2874 were moved from Proposed
   Standard to Experimental.  Though the cases are not exactly parallel
   to the MPLS signalling case it shows that the IETF and IESG are
   prepared to take such decisions given that the arguments are
   sufficiently strong.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3%20%20Relationship%20to%20other%20standards%20organizations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>  Relationship to other standards organizations</span>

   The relationship with other standard organizations is an important
   part of IETF work.  We are dependent on their work and they make use
   of our technology; each organization has their own area of expertise.
   It is therefore necessary that both sides handle their standards
   documentation in such a way that no unnecessary updates or revisions
   are introduced simply by sloppy handling of documents.

   Consequently we need to keep CR-LDP referenceable, i.e., on the
   standards track, for the foreseeable future.  The implication of this
   is not that we need to progress it further, or need to undertake
   further work in the area.  One implication however is that standards
   organizations which reference the document, need to be notified of
   our decision so that they (at their own pace) can change their
   references to more appropriate documents.  It is also expected that
   they will notify us when they no longer have a need to normative
   reference to CR-LDP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.4%20Phase%202"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" id="section-4.4">4.4</a> Phase 2</span>

   Based on the feed back from this first discussion the question to the
   working group were reformulated as:

   "Should the MPLS WG focus its efforts on a signalling protocol for
   traffic engineering applications on RSVP-TE, and hence the WG effort
   with CR-LDP be discontinued?  This would not involve any change in



<span class="grey">Andersson &amp; Swallow          Informational                      [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3468">RFC 3468</a>          Decision on MPLS Signaling Protocols     February 2003</span>


   document status for CR-LDP, nor would it hinder continued individual
   contributions in the CR-LDP space.  It would involve a change in the
   MPLS WG charter to reflect this."

   It was pointed out that "nor would it hinder continued individual
   contributions" is too weak.  We actually discourage, while it is not
   prohibited, continued work in the CR-LDP area.  That is the whole
   point with taking this decision.

   It was also pointed out that while it is quite acceptable to not
   accept further working group documents, it would also be appropriate
   to take the existing CR-LDP related working group Internet Drafts
   through the process to proposed standard or informational as
   intended.  This is applicable to the following documents, since much
   of the work has already been completed on them:

      - in MPLS WG
       -- Multi Protocol Label Switching Label Distribution Protocol
          Query Message Description
       -- Improving Topology Data Base Accuracy with Label Switched Path
       -- Feedback in Constraint Based Label Distribution Protocol
       -- Signalling Unnumbered Links in CR-LDP
       -- Fault Tolerance for the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
      - in CCAMP WG
       -- Generalized MPLS Signaling - CR-LDP Extensions
       -- Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching Extensions for
          SONET and SDH Control
       -- Generalized MPLS Signalling Extensions for G.709 Optical
          Transport Networks Control
       -- Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching Extensions to
          Control Non-Standard SONET and SDH Features

   Some of the documents listed above are not in themselves extensions
   to CR-LDP, but in one way or another are deemed to be "equally
   applicable to CR-LDP".  For those documents it will be fully
   appropriate to progress them beyond proposed standard in the future
   if they meet the requirements.

   RFCs that are extensions to CR-LDP, e.g., RFCs 3213 and 3214, will
   remain proposed standard documents.

   After this compromise was proposed a good consensus quickly formed
   supporting the proposal.  Close to 90% of the people participating
   discussion said that they support or at least accept this outcome of
   the working group discussion.

   In a message to the working group (date) the working groups chairs
   stated that consensus had been reached on:

   -  that the MPLS WG needs to focus its efforts on RSVP-TE (<a href="./rfc3209">RFC 3209</a>)
      as protocol for traffic engineering signalling.

   -  that the Working Group will undertake no new work related to
      CR-LDP.

   -  that the WG charter should be updated to reflect this.

   -  that the WG will recommend that CR-LDP (<a href="./rfc3212">RFC 3212</a>) remain a
      proposed standard.

   -  that the WG will recommend that RFCs 3213 and 3214, which are
      closely related to CR-LDP, remain proposed standard.

   -  that existing Working Group drafts related to or updating/changing
      CR-LDP will be progressed through the standards process to
      proposed standard or informational RFCs as appropriate.

   - that "the existing cr-ldp working group documents" are:
      -- Multi Protocol Label Switching Label Distribution Protocol
         Query Message Description
      -- Improving Topology Data Base Accuracy with Label Switched Path
         Feedback in Constraint Based Label Distribution Protocol

         Transport Networks Control
      -- Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching Extensions to Control
         Non-Standard SONET and SDH Features

   -  that the MPLS working group will take on no new Working Group
      documents related to CR-LDP.

   -  that the MPLS working group will entertain no efforts to promote
      CR-LDP beyond proposed standard.

   -  that individual contributions related to CR-LDP area are not
      prohibited, but discouraged.

   Based on the consensus in the MPLS working group we recommend the
   IESG to:

      -  confirm the MPLS Working Group consensus to undertake no new
         work on CR-LDP and focus on RSVP-TE as signalling protocol for
         traffic engineering applications for MPLS, as described in this
         document

      -  adopt as an IETF policy to refrain from entertaining work that
         intends to progress <a href="./rfc3212">RFC 3212</a> or related RFCs beyond proposed
         standard

      -  adopt as an IETF policy to refrain from entertaining new
         working group documents that are extensions to <a href="./rfc3212">RFC 3212</a>

      -  review the IETF process with respect to management of documents
