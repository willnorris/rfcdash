Abstract

   This document specifies the IPv4 service continuity requirements for
   IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) routers that are provided either by the
   service provider or by vendors who sell through the retail market.

   Specifically, this document extends the basic requirements for IPv6
   CE routers as described in <a href="./rfc7084">RFC 7084</a> to allow the provisioning of IPv6
   transition services for the support of IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) by
   means of new transition mechanisms.  The document only covers
   IPv4aaS, i.e., transition technologies for delivering IPv4 in
   IPv6-only access networks.  IPv4aaS is necessary because there aren't
   sufficient IPv4 addresses available for every possible customer/
   device.  However, devices or applications in the customer Local Area
   Networks (LANs) may be IPv4-only or IPv6-only and still need to
   communicate with IPv4-only services on the Internet.

   This document defines IPv4 service continuity features over an
   IPv6-only network for residential or small office routers (referred
   to as "IPv6 Transition CE Routers") in order to establish an industry
   baseline for transition features to be implemented on such routers.

   These routers rely upon requirements for IPv6 CE routers defined in
   [<a href="./rfc7084" title='"Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers"'>RFC7084</a>].  The scope of this document is to ensure IPv4 service
   continuity support for devices in the LAN side.  This ensures that
   remote IPv4-only services continue to be accessible, for both
   IPv4-only and IPv6-only applications and devices, located in the LAN
   side behind an IPv6 Transition CE Router connected to an IPv6-only
   access network.  These ISP access networks are typically referred to
   as Wide Area Networks (WANs), even if they may be metropolitan or
   regional in some cases.  Figure 1 presents a simplified view of this
   architecture.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8585">RFC 8585</a>       Requirements for IPv6 CE to Support IPv4aaS      May 2019</span>


   This document covers a set of IP transition techniques required when
   ISPs have, or want to have, an IPv6-only access network.  This is a
   common situation when sufficient IPv4 addresses are no longer
   available for every possible customer and device, which causes IPv4
   addresses to become prohibitively expensive.  This, in turn, may
   result in service providers provisioning IPv6-only WAN access.  At
   the same time, they need to ensure that both IPv4-only and IPv6-only
   devices and applications in the customer networks can still reach
   IPv4-only devices and applications on the Internet.

   This document specifies the IPv4 service continuity mechanisms to be
   supported by an IPv6 Transition CE Router and relevant provisioning
   or configuration information differences from [<a href="./rfc7084" title='"Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers"'>RFC7084</a>].

   This document is not a recommendation for service providers to use
   any specific transition mechanism.

   Automatic provisioning of more complex topology than a single router
   with multiple LAN interfaces may be handled by means of the Home
   Networking Control Protocol (HNCP) [<a href="./rfc7788" title='"Home Networking Control Protocol"'>RFC7788</a>], which is out of the
   scope of this document.

   Since it is impossible to know prior to sale which transition
   mechanism a device will need over its lifetime, an IPv6 Transition CE
   Router intended for the retail market MUST support all the IPv4aaS
   transition mechanisms listed in this document.  Service providers
   that specify feature sets for the IPv6 Transition CE Router may
   define a different set of features from those included in this
   document, for example, features that support only some of the
   transition mechanisms enumerated in this document.

   Appendices A and B contain a complete description of the usage
   scenarios and end-user network architecture, respectively.  These
   appendices, along with [<a href="./rfc7084" title='"Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers"'>RFC7084</a>], will facilitate a clearer
   understanding of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   This document uses the same terms as in [<a href="./rfc7084" title='"Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers"'>RFC7084</a>], with minor
   clarifications.

   "IPv4aaS" stands for "IPv4-as-a-Service", meaning transition
   technologies for delivering IPv4 in IPv6-only connectivity.

   The term "IPv6 transition Customer Edge Router with IPv4aaS"
   (shortened as "IPv6 Transition CE Router") is defined as an IPv6
   Customer Edge Router that provides features for the delivery of IPv4
   services over an IPv6-only WAN network, including IPv6-IPv4
   communications.

   The term "WAN Interface" as used in this document is defined as an
   IPv6 Transition CE Router attachment to an IPv6-only link used to
   provide connectivity to a service provider network, including link
   Internet-layer (or higher layers) tunnels, such as IPv4-in-IPv6
   tunnels.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Requirements</span>

   The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST comply with [<a href="./rfc7084" title='"Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers"'>RFC7084</a>] ("Basic
   Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers").  This document adds
   new requirements, as described in the following subsections.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20LAN-Side%20Configuration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  LAN-Side Configuration</span>

   A new LAN requirement is added, which is, in fact, common in regular
   IPv6 Transition CE Routers, and is required by most of the transition
   mechanisms:

   L-1:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST implement a DNS proxy as
         described in [<a href="./rfc5625" title='"DNS Proxy Implementation Guidelines"'>RFC5625</a>] ("DNS Proxy Implementation Guidelines").

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Transition%20Technologies%20Support%20for%20IPv4%20Service%20Continuity%20%28IPv4-"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Transition Technologies Support for IPv4 Service Continuity (IPv4-</span>
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/as-a-Service%29"></a>      as-a-Service)</span>

   The main target of this document is the support of IPv6-only WAN
   access.  To enable legacy IPv4 functionality, this document also
   includes the support of IPv4-only devices and applications in the
   customer LANs, as well as IPv4-only services on the Internet.  Thus,
   both IPv4-only and IPv6-only devices in the customer-side LANs of the
   IPv6 Transition CE Router are able to reach the IPv4-only services.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8585">RFC 8585</a>       Requirements for IPv6 CE to Support IPv4aaS      May 2019</span>


   Note that this document only configures IPv4aaS in the IPv6
   Transition CE Router itself; it does not forward such information to
   devices attached to the LANs.  Thus, the WAN configuration and
   availability of native IPv4 or IPv4aaS are transparent for the
   devices attached to the LANs.

   This document takes no position on simultaneous operation of one or
   several transition mechanisms and/or native IPv4.

   In order to seamlessly provide IPv4 service continuity in the
   customer LANs and allow automated IPv6 transition mechanism
   provisioning, the following general transition requirements are
   defined.

   General transition requirements:

   TRANS-1:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST support the DHCPv6 S46
             priority options described in [<a href="./rfc8026" title='"Unified IPv4-in-IPv6 Softwire Customer Premises Equipment (CPE): A DHCPv6-Based Prioritization Mechanism"'>RFC8026</a>] ("Unified IPv4-in-
             IPv6 Softwire Customer Premises Equipment (CPE): A
             DHCPv6-Based Prioritization Mechanism").

   TRANS-2:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST have a GUI and either a
             CLI or API (or both) to manually enable/disable each of the
             supported transition mechanisms.

   TRANS-3:  If an IPv6 Transition CE Router supports more than one LAN
             subnet, the IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST allow
             appropriate subnetting and configuration of the address
             space among several interfaces.  In some transition
             mechanisms, this may require differentiating mappings/
             translations on a per-interface basis.

   In order to allow the service provider to disable all the transition
   mechanisms and/or choose the most convenient one, the IPv6 Transition
   CE Router MUST follow the following configuration steps:

   CONFIG-1:  Request the relevant configuration options for each
              supported transition mechanisms, which MUST remain
              disabled at this step.

   CONFIG-2:  Following the steps in <a href="./rfc8026#section-1.4">Section 1.4 of [RFC8026]</a>, MUST
              check for a valid match in OPTION_S46_PRIORITY, which
              allows enabling/disabling a transition mechanism.

   CONFIG-3:  Keep disabled all the transition mechanisms if no match is
              found between the priority list and the candidate list,
              unless a NAT64 [<a href="./rfc6146" title='"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6146</a>] prefix has been configured, in
              which case, 464XLAT [<a href="./rfc6877" title='"464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation"'>RFC6877</a>] MUST be enabled.



<span class="grey">Palet Martinez, et al.        Informational                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8585">RFC 8585</a>       Requirements for IPv6 CE to Support IPv4aaS      May 2019</span>


   Because 464XLAT has no DHCPv6 configuration options, it can't
   currently be included in the OPTION_S46_PRIORITY.  In the future, an
   update of [<a href="./rfc8026" title='"Unified IPv4-in-IPv6 Softwire Customer Premises Equipment (CPE): A DHCPv6-Based Prioritization Mechanism"'>RFC8026</a>] or a NAT64 DHCPv6 configuration option may enable
   it.  Meanwhile, if an operator provides 464XLAT, it needs to ensure
   that OPTION_S46_PRIORITY is not sent for any other transition
   mechanism to the relevant customers.

   The following subsections describe the requirements for supporting
   each one of the transition mechanisms.  An IPv6 Transition CE Router
   intended for the retail market MUST support all of them.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.1.%20%20464XLAT"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1" id="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  464XLAT</span>

   464XLAT [<a href="./rfc6877" title='"464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation"'>RFC6877</a>] is a technique to provide IPv4 service over an
   IPv6-only access network without encapsulation.  This architecture
   assumes a Stateful NAT64 [<a href="./rfc6146" title='"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6146</a>] function deployed at the service
   provider or a third-party network.

   The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST support customer-side translator
   (CLAT) functionality [<a href="./rfc6877" title='"464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation"'>RFC6877</a>] if intended for the retail market.  If
   464XLAT is supported, it MUST be implemented according to [<a href="./rfc6877" title='"464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation"'>RFC6877</a>].
   The following IPv6 Transition CE Router requirements also apply.

   464XLAT requirements:

   464XLAT-1:  Unless a dedicated /64 prefix has been acquired, either
               by using DHCPv6-PD (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
               for IPv6 Prefix Delegation) or by alternative means, the
               IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST perform IPv4 Network
               Address Translation (NAT) on IPv4 traffic translated
               using the CLAT.

   464XLAT-2:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router SHOULD support IGD-PCP IWF
               [<a href="./rfc6970" title='"Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Internet Gateway Device - Port Control Protocol Interworking Function (IGD-PCP IWF)"'>RFC6970</a>] ("Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Internet
               Gateway Device - Port Control Protocol Interworking
               Function (IGD-PCP IWF)").

   464XLAT-3:  If the Port Control Protocol (PCP) [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>] is
               implemented, the IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST also
               implement [<a href="./rfc7291" title='"DHCP Options for the Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC7291</a>] ("DHCP Options for the Port Control
               Protocol (PCP)").  Following [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>], if no PCP server
               is configured, the IPv6 Transition CE Router MAY verify
               if the default gateway or the NAT64 is the PCP server.
               The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST use plain IPv6 mode
               (i.e., not IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation) to send PCP
               requests to the server.

   464XLAT-4:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST implement [<a href="./rfc7050" title='"Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis"'>RFC7050</a>]
               ("Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address
               Synthesis") in order to discover the provider-side
               translator (PLAT) translation IPv4 and IPv6
               prefix(es)/suffix(es).

   464XLAT-5:  If PCP is implemented, the IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST
               follow [<a href="./rfc7225" title='"Discovering NAT64 IPv6 Prefixes Using the Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC7225</a>] ("Discovering NAT64 IPv6 Prefixes Using
               the Port Control Protocol (PCP)") in order to learn the
               PLAT-side translation IPv4 and IPv6 prefix(es)/suffix(es)
               used by an upstream PCP-controlled NAT64 device.

   464XLAT-6:  If the network provides several choices for the
               discovery/learning of the NAT64 prefix, the priority to
               use one or the other MUST follow this order: 1) [<a href="./rfc7225" title='"Discovering NAT64 IPv6 Prefixes Using the Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC7225</a>]
               and 2) [<a href="./rfc7050" title='"Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis"'>RFC7050</a>].

   The NAT64 prefix could be discovered by means of the method defined
   in [<a href="./rfc7050" title='"Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis"'>RFC7050</a>] only if the service provider uses DNS64 [<a href="./rfc6147" title='"DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6147</a>].  It
   may be the case that the service provider does not use or does not
   trust DNS64 [<a href="./rfc6147" title='"DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6147</a>] because the DNS configuration at the CE (or
   hosts behind the CE) can be modified by the customer.  In that case,
   the service provider may opt to configure the NAT64 prefix by means
   of the option defined in [<a href="./rfc7225" title='"Discovering NAT64 IPv6 Prefixes Using the Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC7225</a>].  This can also be used if the
   service provider uses DNS64 [<a href="./rfc6147" title='"DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6147</a>].

   DS-Lite [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>] enables continued support for IPv4 services.
   DS-Lite enables a broadband service provider to share IPv4 addresses
   among customers by combining two well-known technologies: IP in IP
   (IPv4-in-IPv6) and Network Address Translation (NAT).  It is expected
   that DS-Lite traffic is forwarded over the IPv6 Transition CE
   Router's native IPv6 WAN interface and not encapsulated in another
   tunnel.

   The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST implement DS-Lite B4 functionality
   [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>] if intended for the retail market.  If DS-Lite is
   supported, it MUST be implemented according to [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>].  The
   following IPv6 Transition CE Router requirements also apply.

   DS-Lite requirements:

   DSLITE-1:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST support configuration
              of DS-Lite via the DS-Lite DHCPv6 option [<a href="./rfc6334" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) Option for Dual-Stack Lite"'>RFC6334</a>]
              ("Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
              Option for Dual-Stack Lite").  The IPv6 Transition CE
              Router MAY use other mechanisms to configure DS-Lite
              parameters.  Such mechanisms are outside the scope of this
              document.

   DSLITE-2:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router SHOULD support IGD-PCP IWF
              [<a href="./rfc6970" title='"Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Internet Gateway Device - Port Control Protocol Interworking Function (IGD-PCP IWF)"'>RFC6970</a>].

   DSLITE-3:  If PCP [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>] is implemented, the IPv6 Transition CE
              Router SHOULD implement [<a href="./rfc7291" title='"DHCP Options for the Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC7291</a>].  If PCP [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>] is
              implemented and a PCP server is not configured, the IPv6
              Transition CE Router MUST assume, by default, that the
              Address Family Transition Router (AFTR, commonly called
              "CGN" - Carrier-Grade NAT) is the PCP server.  The IPv6

              Transition CE Router MUST use plain IPv6 mode (i.e., not
              IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation) to send PCP requests to the
              server.  The term "default" above is to be interpreted as
              pertaining to a configuration as applied by a vendor prior
              to the administrator changing it for its initial
              activation.

   DSLITE-4:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST NOT perform IPv4
              Network Address Translation (NAT) on IPv4 traffic
              encapsulated using DS-Lite [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>].

   lw4o6 [<a href="./rfc7596" title='"Lightweight 4over6: An Extension to the Dual- Stack Lite Architecture"'>RFC7596</a>] specifies an extension to DS-Lite that moves the NAPT
   function from the DS-Lite tunnel concentrator to the tunnel client
   located in the IPv6 Transition CE Router, removing the requirement
   for an AFTR (CGN) function in the tunnel concentrator and reducing
   the amount of centralized state.

   The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST implement lwB4 functionality
   [<a href="./rfc7596" title='"Lightweight 4over6: An Extension to the Dual- Stack Lite Architecture"'>RFC7596</a>] if intended for the retail market.  If DS-Lite is

   lw4o6 requirements:

   LW4O6-1:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST support configuration of
             lw4o6 via the lw4o6 DHCPv6 options [<a href="./rfc7598" title='"DHCPv6 Options for Configuration of Softwire Address and Port-Mapped Clients"'>RFC7598</a>] ("DHCPv6

             other mechanisms to configure lw4o6 parameters.  Such
             mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.

   LW4O6-2:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST support the DHCPv4-over-
             DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) transport described in [<a href="./rfc7341" title='"DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) Transport"'>RFC7341</a>]
             ("DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) Transport").

   LW4O6-3:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MAY support Dynamic

   Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E) [<a href="./rfc7597" title='"Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)"'>RFC7597</a>] is a
   mechanism for transporting IPv4 packets across an IPv6 network using
   IP encapsulation.  MAP-E includes an algorithmic mechanism for
   mapping between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.

   The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST support MAP-E CE functionality
   [<a href="./rfc7597" title='"Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)"'>RFC7597</a>] if intended for the retail market.  If MAP-E is supported,
   it MUST be implemented according to [<a href="./rfc7597" title='"Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)"'>RFC7597</a>].  The following IPv6
   Transition CE Router requirements also apply.

   MAP-E requirements:

   Existing IPv4 deployments support IPv4 multicast for services such as
   IPTV.  In the transition phase, it is expected that multicast
   services will still be provided using IPv4 to the customer LANs.

   If the IPv6 Transition CE Router supports delivery of IPv4 multicast
   services, then it MUST support [<a href="./rfc8114" title='"Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over an IPv6 Multicast Network"'>RFC8114</a>] ("Delivery of IPv4 Multicast

   IPv4aaS mechanism limits the available ports).

   An AddPortMapping() request for a port that is not available MUST
   result in "ConflictInMappingEntry".

   An AddAnyPortMapping() request for a port that is not available
   SHOULD result in a successful mapping with an alternative

   At the time of this writing, one of the apparent main issues for
   vendors with regard to including new functionalities, such as support
   for new transition mechanisms, is the lack of space in the flash (or
   equivalent) memory.  However, it has been confirmed from existing
   open-source implementations (e.g., OpenWRT/LEDE, Linux, and VPP) that
   adding the support for the new transition mechanisms requires around
   10-12 KBs because most of the code base is shared among several
   transition mechanisms, which are already supported by [<a href="./rfc7084" title='"Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers"'>RFC7084</a>].  A
   single data plane is common to all of them, which typically means, in
   popular CEs already in the market [<a href="#ref-OpenWRT" title='"Packages"'>OpenWRT</a>], the new required code is
   only about 0.15% of the total existing code size.

   In general, the new requirements don't have extra cost in terms of
   RAM memory, nor other hardware requirements such as more powerful
   CPUs, if compared to the cost of NAT44 code.  Thus, existing hardware
   should be able to support all of them with minimal impact.

   The other issue seems to be the cost of developing the code for those
   new functionalities.  However, at the time of writing this document,
   it has been confirmed that there are several open-source versions of
   the required code for supporting all the new transition mechanisms,
   and several vendors already have implementations and provided them to
   ISPs.  Therefore, the development cost is negligible, and only
   integration and testing cost may become an issue.

   Finally, in some cases, operators supporting several transition
   mechanisms may need to consider training costs for staff in all the
   techniques for the operation and management of these mechanisms, even
   if the costs are not directly caused by supporting this document but
   because of business decisions.

   Access network architecture for securing DHCP within the access

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8585">RFC 8585</a>       Requirements for IPv6 CE to Support IPv4aaS      May 2019</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Usage%20Scenarios"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Usage Scenarios</span>

   The situation of ongoing IPv6 deployment and a lack of IPv4 addresses
   is not happening at the same pace in every country and even within
   every country for every ISP.  For different technical, financial,
   commercial/marketing, and socio-economic reasons, each network is
   transitioning at their own pace; the global transition timings cannot
   be reliably estimated.

   Different studies (for example, [<a href="#ref-IPv6Survey">IPv6Survey</a>]) also show that IPv6
   deployment is a changing situation.  In a single country, not all
   operators will necessarily provide IPv6 support.  Consumers may also
   switch ISPs and use the same IPv6 Transition CE Router with either an
   ISP that provides IPv4-only or an ISP that provides IPv6 with
   IPv4aaS.

   So, to cover all those evolving situations, an IPv6 Transition CE
   Router is required, at least from the perspective of transition
   support.

   Moreover, because some services and service providers will remain
   IPv4-only for an undetermined period of time, IPv4 service continuity
   is required.  Thus, there is a need for CEs to support IPv4aaS
   indefinitely.

   Based on these premises, this document ensures that the IPv6
   Transition CE Router allows the continued transition from networks
   that today may provide access with dual-stack or IPv6-in-IPv4 (as
   described in [<a href="./rfc7084" title='"Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers"'>RFC7084</a>]) to networks that provide IPv6-only access
   with IPv4aaS.

   Considering that situation and different possible usage cases, the
   IPv6 Transition CE Router described in this document is expected to
   be used in residential/household; small office, home office (SOHO);
   and small/medium enterprise (SME).  Common usage is any kind of
   Internet access (web, email, streaming, online gaming, etc.), and
   more advanced requirements include inbound connections (IP cameras,
   web, DNS, email, VPN, etc.).

   The above is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the
   possible usage cases, just an overview.  In fact, combinations of the
   above usages are also possible, along with situations where the same
   CE is used at different times in different scenarios or even with
   different IPv4aaSes at different service providers.







<span class="grey">Palet Martinez, et al.        Informational                    [Page 17]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8585">RFC 8585</a>       Requirements for IPv6 CE to Support IPv4aaS      May 2019</span>


   The mechanisms for allowing inbound connections are naturally
   available in any IPv6 router when using IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses
   (GUAs), unless they are blocked by firewall rules, which may require
   some manual configuration.

   However, in the case of IPv4aaS, because of the usage of private IPv4
   addresses and NAT and depending on the specific transition mechanism,
   inbound connections typically require some degree of more complex
   manual configuration, such as setting up a DMZ, setting up virtual
   servers, or setting up port/protocol forwarding.  In general, IPv4 CE
   Routers already provide a GUI, CLI, or API to manually configure
   them, or provide the possibility to set up the CE in bridge mode, so
   another Router behind the original CE, takes care of inbound
   connections.  The requirements for that support are out of the scope
   of this document.

   Who provides the IPv6 Transition CE Router is not relevant.  In most
   cases, the service provider is responsible for provisioning/managing,
   at least on the WAN side.  Commonly, the user has access to configure
   the LAN interfaces, firewall, DMZ, and many other features.  However,
   in many cases, the user must supply or may replace the IPv6
   Transition CE Router.  This underscores the importance of the IPv6
   Transition CE Routers fulfilling the requirements defined in this
   document.

   The IPv6 Transition CE Router described in this document is not
   intended for usage in other scenarios, such as large enterprises,
   data centers, content providers, etc.  Even if the documented
   requirements meet their needs, they may have additional requirements,
   which are out of the scope of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20B.%20%20End-User%20Network%20Architecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B" id="appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  End-User Network Architecture</span>

   An end-user network will likely support both IPv4 and IPv6 (see
   <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> and <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).  It is not expected that end users will
   change their existing network topology with the introduction of IPv6.
   There are some differences in how IPv6 works and is provisioned;
   these differences have implications for the network architecture.

   A typical IPv4 end-user network consists of a "plug and play" router
   with NAT functionality and a single link upstream, connected to the
   service provider network.

   From the perspective of an IPv4 user behind an IPv6 Transition CE
   Router, this doesn't change.

   or some other firewall control protocol, in the case of an IPv6-only
   access and IPv4aaS, that may not be feasible depending on specific
   transition mechanism details.  PCP [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>] may be an alternative
   solution.

   Another consequence of using IPv4 private address space in the end-
   user network is that it provides stable addressing; that is, it
   doesn't change, even when you change service providers, and the
   addresses are always usable even when the WAN interface is down or
   the customer edge router has not yet been provisioned.  In the case
   of IPv6-only access, private IPv4 addresses are also available if the
   IPv4aaS transition mechanism keeps running the NAT interface towards
   the LAN side when the WAN interface is down.

   More advanced routers support dynamic routing (which learns routes
   from other routers), and advanced end users can build arbitrary,
   complex networks using manual configuration of address prefixes
   combined with a dynamic routing protocol.  Once again, this is true
   for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   In general, the end-user network architecture for IPv6 should provide
   equivalent or better capabilities and functionality than the current
   IPv4 architecture.

   The end-user network is a stub network in the sense that is not
   providing transit to other external networks.  However, HNCP
   [<a href="./rfc7788" title='"Home Networking Control Protocol"'>RFC7788</a>] allows support for automatic provisioning of downstream
   routers.  Figure 2 illustrates the model topology for the end-user
   network.

   The IPv6 Transition CE Router may be manually configured in an
   arbitrary topology with a dynamic routing protocol or HNCP [<a href="./rfc7788" title='"Home Networking Control Protocol"'>RFC7788</a>].
   Automatic provisioning and configuration are described for a single
   IPv6 Transition CE Router only.
