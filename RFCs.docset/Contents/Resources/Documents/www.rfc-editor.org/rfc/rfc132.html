On page 5 of <a href="./rfc107">RFC 107</a>, at the end of the section titled 'V.
Flow Control', the partial sentence:

     Each of these numbers is interpreted as "the number
     of 128ths of the current allocation" to be returned
     if it is in the range zero to 128...

should read:

     ...if it is the range of zero to 127,...
                                      ---

That is, return al the appropriate allocation if and
only if the high-order of the left-most bit of the corresponding
fraction is 1.
