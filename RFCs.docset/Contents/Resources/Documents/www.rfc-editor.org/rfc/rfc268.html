                    <span class="h1">Graphics Facilities Information</span>

   It was suggested at the recent network graphics meeting (@ SAIL
   21-23 November) that it would be a good idea to include in the Resources
   Notebook information about the graphics facilities at each site.  To
   further this proposal, I request that the Technical Liaison (or other
   knowledgeable person) at each site send me a description of their
   graphics facilities for inclusion in the Resources Notebook.

   [It is not intended that this replace any other mechanism for up-
   dating Resource Notebook entries and the information collected will
   be submitted to the normal editorial procedures.]
