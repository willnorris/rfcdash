                 <span class="h1">Processing of IPv6 "Atomic" Fragments</span>

Abstract

   The IPv6 specification allows packets to contain a Fragment Header
   without the packet being actually fragmented into multiple pieces (we
   refer to these packets as "atomic fragments").  Such packets are
   typically sent by hosts that have received an ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big"
   error message that advertises a Next-Hop MTU smaller than 1280 bytes,
   and are currently processed by some implementations as normal
   "fragmented traffic" (i.e., they are "reassembled" with any other
   queued fragments that supposedly correspond to the same original
   packet).  Thus, an attacker can cause hosts to employ atomic
   fragments by forging ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" error messages, and then
   launch any fragmentation-based attacks against such traffic.  This
   document discusses the generation of the aforementioned atomic
   fragments and the corresponding security implications.  Additionally,
   this document formally updates <a href="./rfc2460">RFC 2460</a> and <a href="./rfc5722">RFC 5722</a>, such that IPv6
   atomic fragments are processed independently of any other fragments,
   thus completely eliminating the aforementioned attack vector.

   [<a id="ref-RFC2460">RFC2460</a>] specifies the IPv6 fragmentation mechanism, which allows
   IPv6 packets to be fragmented into smaller pieces such that they fit
   in the Path-MTU to the intended destination(s).  [<a href="./rfc2460" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>] allows
   fragments to overlap, thus leading to ambiguity in the result of the
   reassembly process, which could be leveraged by attackers to bypass
   firewall rules and/or evade Network Intrusion Detection Systems
   (NIDS) [<a href="./rfc5722" title='"Handling of Overlapping IPv6 Fragments"'>RFC5722</a>].

   [<a id="ref-RFC5722">RFC5722</a>] forbids overlapping fragments, specifying that when
   overlapping fragments are detected, all the fragments corresponding
   to that packet must be silently discarded.

   As specified in <a href="./rfc2460#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC2460]</a>, when a host receives an
   ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" message advertising a "Next-Hop MTU" smaller
   than 1280 (the minimum IPv6 MTU), it is not required to reduce the
   assumed Path-MTU, but must simply include a Fragment Header in all
   subsequent packets sent to that destination.  The resulting packets

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6946">RFC 6946</a>                  IPv6 Atomic Fragments                 May 2013</span>


   will thus not actually be fragmented into several pieces but will
   just include a Fragment Header with both the "Fragment Offset" and
   the "M" flag set to 0 (we refer to these packets as "atomic
   fragments").  IPv6/IPv4 translators employ the Fragment
   Identification information found in the Fragment Header to select an
   appropriate Fragment Identification value for the resulting IPv4
   fragments.

   While these packets are really atomic fragments (they can be
   processed by the IPv6 module and handed to the upper-layer protocol
   without waiting for any other fragments), many IPv6 implementations
   process them as regular fragments.  Namely, they try to perform IPv6
   fragment reassembly with the atomic fragment and any other fragments
   already queued with the same set {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6
   Destination Address, Fragment Identification}.  For example, in the
   case of IPv6 implementations that have been updated to support
   [<a href="./rfc5722" title='"Handling of Overlapping IPv6 Fragments"'>RFC5722</a>], if a fragment with the same {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6
   Destination Address, Fragment Identification} is already queued for
   reassembly at a host when an atomic fragment is received with the
   same set {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address, Fragment
   Identification}, and both fragments overlap, all the fragments will
   be silently discarded.

   Processing of IPv6 atomic fragments as regular fragmented packets
   clearly provides an unnecessary vector to perform fragmentation-based
   attacks against non-fragmented traffic (i.e., IPv6 datagrams that are
   not really split into multiple pieces but that just include a
   Fragment Header).

   IPv6 fragmentation attacks have been discussed in great detail in
   [<a href="#ref-PREDICTABLE-ID">PREDICTABLE-ID</a>] and [<a href="#ref-CPNI-IPv6">CPNI-IPv6</a>], and [<a href="./rfc5722" title='"Handling of Overlapping IPv6 Fragments"'>RFC5722</a>] describes a specific
   firewall-circumvention attack that could be performed by leveraging
   overlapping fragments.  The possible IPv6 fragmentation-based attacks
   are, in most cases, "ports" of the IPv4 fragmentation attacks
   discussed in [<a href="./rfc6274" title='"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol Version 4"'>RFC6274</a>].

   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> describes the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments and how
   they can be remotely "triggered" by a remote attacker.  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>
   formally updates [<a href="./rfc2460" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5722" title='"Handling of Overlapping IPv6 Fragments"'>RFC5722</a>] such that the aforementioned
   attack vector is eliminated.  <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> contains a survey of the
   generation and processing of IPv6 atomic fragments in different
   versions of a number of popular IPv6 implementations.

   IPv6 atomic fragments:
      IPv6 packets that contain a Fragment Header with the Fragment
      Offset set to 0 and the M flag set to 0.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Generation%20of%20IPv6%20Atomic%20Fragments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments</span>

   <a href="./rfc2460#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC2460]</a> states:

      "In response to an IPv6 packet that is sent to an IPv4 destination
      (i.e., a packet that undergoes translation from IPv6 to IPv4), the
      originating IPv6 node may receive an ICMP Packet Too Big message
      reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280.  In that case, the IPv6
      node is not required to reduce the size of subsequent packets to
      less than 1280, but must include a Fragment header in those
      packets so that the IPv6-to-IPv4 translating router can obtain a
      suitable Identification value to use in resulting IPv4 fragments.
      Note that this means the payload may have to be reduced to 1232
      octets (1280 minus 40 for the IPv6 header and 8 for the Fragment
      header), and smaller still if additional extension headers are
      used."

   This means that any ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" message advertising a
   "Next-Hop MTU" smaller than 1280 could trigger the generation of the
   so-called "atomic fragments" (i.e., IPv6 datagrams that include a
   Fragment Header but that are composed of a single fragment, with both
   the "Fragment Offset" and the "M" fields of the Fragment Header set
   to 0).  This can be leveraged to perform a variety of fragmentation-
   based attacks [<a href="#ref-PREDICTABLE-ID">PREDICTABLE-ID</a>] [<a href="#ref-CPNI-IPv6">CPNI-IPv6</a>].

      For example, an attacker could forge IPv6 fragments with an
      appropriate {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address,
      Fragment Identification} tuple, such that these malicious
      fragments are incorrectly "reassembled" by the destination host
      together with some of the legitimate fragments of the original
      packet, thus leading to packet drops (and a potential denial of
      service).

   From a security standpoint, this situation is exacerbated by the
   following factors:

   o  Many implementations fail to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error messages, as recommended in <a href="./rfc4443#section-5.2">Section 5.2 of
      [RFC4443]</a> and documented in [<a href="./rfc5927" title='"ICMP Attacks against TCP"'>RFC5927</a>].  It should be noted that in
      some cases, such as when an ICMPv6 error message has (supposedly)
      been elicited by a connectionless transport protocol (or some
      other connectionless protocol being encapsulated in IPv6), it may
      be virtually impossible to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error messages.

   o  Upon receipt of one of the aforementioned ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big"
      error messages, the Destination Cache [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] is usually updated
      to reflect that any subsequent packets to that destination should
      include a Fragment Header.  This means that a single ICMPv6
      "Packet Too Big" error message might affect multiple communication
      instances (e.g., TCP connections) with that IPv6 destination
      address.

   o  Some implementations employ predictable Fragment Identification
      values, thus greatly improving the chances of an attacker
      successfully performing fragmentation-based attacks
      [<a href="#ref-PREDICTABLE-ID">PREDICTABLE-ID</a>].

   <a href="./rfc2460#section-4.5">Section 4.5 of [RFC2460]</a> and <a href="./rfc5722#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC5722]</a> are updated as
   follows:

      A host that receives an IPv6 packet that includes a Fragment
      Header with the "Fragment Offset" equal to 0 and the "M" flag
      equal to 0 MUST process that packet in isolation from any other
      packets/fragments, even if such packets/fragments contain the same
      set {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address, Fragment
      Identification}.  A received atomic fragment should be
      "reassembled" from the contents of that sole fragment.

         The Unfragmentable Part of the reassembled packet consists of
         all headers up to, but not including, the Fragment Header of
         the received atomic fragment.

         The Next Header field of the last header of the Unfragmentable
         Part of the reassembled packet is obtained from the Next Header
         field of the Fragment Header of the received atomic fragment.

         The Payload Length of the reassembled packet is obtained by
         subtracting the length of the Fragment Header (that is, 8) from
         the Payload Length of the received atomic fragment.

      Additionally, if any fragments with the same set {IPv6 Source
      Address, IPv6 Destination Address, Fragment Identification} are
      present in the fragment reassembly queue when the atomic fragment
      is received, such fragments MUST NOT be discarded upon receipt of
      the "colliding" IPv6 atomic fragment, since IPv6 atomic fragments
      MUST NOT interfere with "normal" fragmented traffic.

   This document describes how the traditional processing of IPv6 atomic
   fragments enables the exploitation of fragmentation-based attacks
   (such as those described in [<a href="#ref-PREDICTABLE-ID">PREDICTABLE-ID</a>] and [<a href="#ref-CPNI-IPv6">CPNI-IPv6</a>]).  This

   atomic fragments are processed independently of any other fragments,
   thus completely eliminating the aforementioned attack vector.
