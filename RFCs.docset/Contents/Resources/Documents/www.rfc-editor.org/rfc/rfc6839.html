            <span class="h1">Additional Media Type Structured Syntax Suffixes</span>

Abstract

   A content media type name sometimes includes partitioned meta-
   information distinguished by a structured syntax to permit noting an
   attribute of the media as a suffix to the name.  This document
   defines several structured syntax suffixes for use with media type
   registrations.  In particular, it defines and registers the "+json",
   "+ber", "+der", "+fastinfoset", "+wbxml" and "+zip" structured syntax
   suffixes, and provides a media type structured syntax suffix
   registration form for the "+xml" structured syntax suffix.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6839">RFC 6839</a>             Additional Media Type Suffixes         January 2013</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC3023">RFC3023</a>] created the +xml suffix convention that can be used when
   defining names for media types whose representation uses XML
   underneath.  That is, they could have been successfully parsed as if
   the media type had been application/xml in addition to their being
   parsed as their media type that is using the +xml suffix.  [<a href="./rfc6838" title='"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"'>RFC6838</a>]
   defines the media type "Structured Syntax Suffix Registry" to be used
   for such structured syntax suffixes.

   A variety of structured syntax suffixes have already been used in
   some media type registrations, in particular "+json", "+der",
   "+fastinfoset", and "+wbxml".  This document defines and registers
   these structured syntax suffixes in the Structured Syntax Suffix
   Registry, along with "+ber" and "+zip".  In addition, this document
   updates [<a href="./rfc3023" title='"XML Media Types"'>RFC3023</a>] to formally register the "+xml" structured syntax
   suffix according to the procedure defined in [<a href="./rfc6838" title='"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"'>RFC6838</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20When%20to%20Use%20These%20Structured%20Syntax%20Suffixes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  When to Use These Structured Syntax Suffixes</span>

   Each of the structured syntax suffixes defined in this document is
   appropriate for use when the media type identifies the semantics of
   the protocol payload.  That is, knowing the semantics of the specific
   media type provides for more specific processing of the content than
   that afforded by generic processing of the underlying representation.

   At the same time, using the suffix allows receivers of the media
   types to do generic processing of the underlying representation in
   cases where

      they do not need to perform special handling of the particular
      semantics of the exact media type, and

      there is no special knowledge needed by such a generic processor
      in order to parse that underlying representation other than what
      would be needed to parse any example of that underlying
      representation.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4627">RFC4627</a>] defines the "application/json" media type.  The suffix
   "+json" MAY be used with any media type whose representation follows
   that established for "application/json".  The media type structured
   syntax suffix registration form follows.  See [<a href="./rfc6838" title='"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"'>RFC6838</a>] for
   definitions of each of the registration form headings.

   Name:  JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

   +suffix:  +json

   References:  [<a href="./rfc4627" title='"The application/json Media Type for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)"'>RFC4627</a>]

   Encoding considerations:

      Per [<a href="./rfc4627" title='"The application/json Media Type for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)"'>RFC4627</a>], JSON is allowed to be represented using UTF-8,
      UTF-16, or UTF-32.  When JSON is written in UTF-8, JSON is 8bit
      compatible ([<a href="./rfc2045" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>RFC2045</a>]).  When JSON is written in UTF-16 or UTF-32,
      JSON is binary ([<a href="./rfc2045" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>RFC2045</a>]).

   Fragment identifier considerations:

      The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers specified for
      +json SHOULD be as specified for "application/json".  (At
      publication of this document, there is no fragment identification
      syntax defined for "application/json".)

      The syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a specific
      "xxx/yyy+json" SHOULD be processed as follows:

      For cases defined in +json, where the fragment identifier resolves
      per the +json rules, then process as specified in +json.

         For cases defined in +json, where the fragment identifier does
         not resolve per the +json rules, then process as specified in
         "xxx/yyy+json".

         For cases not defined in +json, then process as specified in
         "xxx/yyy+json".

   Interoperability considerations:  n/a

   The ITU defined the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) transfer syntax in
   [<a href="#ref-ITU.X690.2008">ITU.X690.2008</a>].  The suffix "+ber" MAY be used with any media type
   whose representation follows the BER transfer syntax.  (The Expert
   Reviewer for media type structured syntax suffix registrations ought
   to be aware of the relationship between BER and DER to aid in
   selecting the proper suffix.)  The media type structured syntax
   suffix registration form for +ber follows:

      BER has a type-length-value structure, and it is easy to construct
      malicious content with invalid length fields that can cause buffer
      overrun conditions.

      BER allows for arbitrary levels of nesting, which may make it
      possible to construct malicious content that will cause a stack
      overflow.

      Interpreters of the BER structures should be aware of these issues
      and should take appropriate measures to guard against buffer
      overflows and stack overruns in particular and malicious content
      in general.

   The ITU defined the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) transfer
   syntax in [<a href="#ref-ITU.X690.2008">ITU.X690.2008</a>].  The suffix "+der" MAY be used with any
   media type whose representation follows the DER transfer syntax.
   (The Expert Reviewer for media type structured syntax suffix

   documents further define the "application/fastinfoset" media type.
   The suffix "+fastinfoset" MAY be used with any media type whose

   The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Forum has defined the WAP
   Binary XML (WBXML) document format as a binary representation of XML
   in [<a href="#ref-WBXML" title='"Binary XML Content Format Specification"'>WBXML</a>].  This document further defines the "application/

   References:  [<a href="#ref-ZIP" title='"APPNOTE.TXT - .ZIP File Format Specification"'>ZIP</a>]

   Encoding considerations:  ZIP is a binary encoding.

   Fragment identifier considerations:

      The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers specified for
      +zip SHOULD be as specified for "application/zip".  (At
      publication of this document, there is no fragment identification
      syntax defined for "application/zip".)

      The syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a specific
      "xxx/yyy+zip" SHOULD be processed as follows:

         For cases defined in +zip, where the fragment identifier
         resolves per the +zip rules, then process as specified in +zip.

         For cases defined in +zip, where the fragment identifier does
         not resolve per the +zip rules, then process as specified in
         "xxx/yyy+zip".

         For cases not defined in +zip, then process as specified in
         "xxx/yyy+zip".

   Interoperability considerations:  n/a

   Security considerations:

      IP files support two forms of encryption: Strong Encryption and
      AES 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit encryption; see the
      specification for further details.  Each individual media type
      registered with a +zip suffix can have additional security
      considerations.

   Encoding considerations:

      Per [<a href="./rfc3023" title='"XML Media Types"'>RFC3023</a>], XML is allowed to be represented using both 7-bit
      and 8-bit encodings.  When XML is written in UTF-8, XML is 8bit
      compatible ([<a href="./rfc2045" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>RFC2045</a>]).  When XML is written in UTF-16 or UTF-32,
      XML is binary ([<a href="./rfc2045" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>RFC2045</a>]).

   Fragment identifier considerations:

      The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers specified for
      +xml SHOULD be as specified for "application/xml".  (At
      publication of this document, the fragment identification syntax
      considerations for "application/xml" are defined in [<a href="./rfc3023" title='"XML Media Types"'>RFC3023</a>],
      Sections <a href="#section-5">5</a> and <a href="#section-7">7</a>.)

   See the Security Considerations sections found in the media type
   structured syntax suffix registration forms from Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a> and <a href="#section-4">4</a>.

   When updating a +&lt;suffix&gt; registration, care should be taken to
   review all previously-registered xxx/yyy+&lt;suffix&gt; media types as to
   whether they might be affected by the updated +&lt;suffix&gt; registration.
   Because the generic fragment identifier processing rules take
   precedence over media-type-specific rules, introducing new or
   changing existing definitions may break the existing registrations of
   specific media types, as well as particular implementations of
   applications that process affected media types.  Such changes can
   introduce interoperability and security issues.

   When updating the fragment identifier processing rules for a specific
   xxx/yyy+&lt;suffix&gt; media type, care should be taken to review the
   generic fragment identifier processing rules for the +&lt;suffix&gt;
   registration and not introduce any conflicts.  Because the generic
   fragment identifier processing rules take precedence over media-type-
   specific rules, such conflicting processing requirements should be
   ignored by an implementation, but such conflicts can introduce
   interoperability and security issues.
