   The private key is encrypted with an encryption algorithm, which
   could be a password-based encryption scheme as that term is used in
   PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.1 as
   published in [<a href="./rfc2898" title='"PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.0"'>RFC2898</a>] and updated by [<a href="./rfc8018" title='"PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.1"'>RFC8018</a>].  This document
   registers the application/pkcs8-encrypted media type for the
   EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo type of PKCS #8 (as originally described in
   [<a href="./rfc5208" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification Version 1.2"'>RFC5208</a>], which was obsoleted by [<a href="./rfc5958" title='"Asymmetric Key Packages"'>RFC5958</a>]).  An instance of this
   media type carries a single encrypted private key [<a href="./rfc5958" title='"Asymmetric Key Packages"'>RFC5958</a>] BER-
   encoded as a single EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo value.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: pkcs8-encrypted

   Required parameters: None.

   Optional parameters:

      password-mapping:  The private key is encrypted with an encryption
        algorithm, which could be a password-based encryption scheme as
        that term is used in PKCS #5 ([<a href="./rfc2898" title='"PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.0"'>RFC2898</a>] and [<a href="./rfc8018" title='"PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.1"'>RFC8018</a>]).  Such
        algorithms take a password as input.  A "password" is a secret
        text value (see <a href="./rfc2898#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC2898]</a> and [<a href="./rfc8018" title='"PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.1"'>RFC8018</a>]), but for
        algorithmic purposes the term "password" refers to an octet
        string (see <a href="./rfc2898#section-2">Section 2 of [RFC2898]</a> and [<a href="./rfc8018" title='"PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.1"'>RFC8018</a>]).  Therefore,
        there must be some mapping between the text value (which might
        be user input) and the octet string.  <a href="./rfc2898#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC2898]</a>
        (which was replaced by [<a href="./rfc8018" title='"PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.1"'>RFC8018</a>]) recommends "that applications
        follow some common text encoding rules"; it then offers, but
        does not recommend, ASCII and UTF-8.

        While many modern applications support Unicode and Unicode-based
        encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, interchange is still needed
        with private key artifacts that are encrypted with passwords in
        other encodings.  Therefore, this parameter specifies the
        charset (see <a href="./rfc2978#section-1.3">Section 1.3 of [RFC2978]</a>) that a recipient should
        attempt first, in "reverse", when mapping from a sequence of
        characters to an octet string.  This parameter is not
        cryptographically protected, so recipients cannot rely on it as
        the exclusive mapping possibility.

        This parameter has similar semantics to the charset parameter
        from text/plain, except that it only applies to the user's input
        (text value) of a password.  There is no default value.

        The following special values, which all begin with "*" to
        distinguish them from registered charsets, are defined:

        *pkcs12      UTF-16LE with U+0000 NULL terminator: PKCS #12
                     style, see [<a href="./rfc7292" title='"PKCS #12: Personal Information Exchange Syntax v1.1"'>RFC7292</a>].

        *precis      Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of
                     Internationalized Strings (PRECIS) password
                     profile, i.e., OpaqueString from <a href="./rfc7613#section-4">Section 4 of
                     [RFC7613]</a>, which was obsoleted by [<a href="./rfc8265" title='"Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized Strings Representing Usernames and Passwords"'>RFC8265</a>]: always
                     UTF-8 in Normalization Form C (NFC).

        *precis-XXX  Any profile from the IANA "PRECIS Profiles"
                     registry where "XXX" is replaced by the profile
                     name as shown in the registry.

        *hex         hexadecimal input: the input is mapped to 0-9, A-F,
                     and then converted directly to octets.  If there
                     are an odd number of hex digits, either the final
                     digit 0 is appended or an error condition is
                     raised.  Compare with Annex M.4 of
                     [<a href="#ref-IEEE.802.11-2012">IEEE.802.11-2012</a>].

        *dtmf        The characters "0"-"9", "A"-"D", "*", and "#",
                     which map to their corresponding ASCII codes.
                     "A"-"D" map to the uppercase range 0x41 - 0x44.
                     (This is to support restricted-input devices, i.e.,
                     telephones and telephone-like equipment.)  User
                     input outside of these values is either ignored or
                     an error condition is raised.

        Otherwise, the value of this parameter is a charset, from the
        IANA "Character Sets" registry [<a href="#ref-CHARREG" title='"Character Sets"'>CHARREG</a>].

        This parameter is case insensitive.

   Encoding considerations: Binary.

   Security considerations:

      Carries a cryptographic private key.  See <a href="./rfc5958#section-6">Section 6 of [RFC5958]</a>.

      EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo PKCS #8 data contains exactly one private
      key.  Poor password choices, weak algorithms, or improper
      parameter selections (e.g., insufficient salting rounds) will make
      the confidential payloads much easier to compromise.

   Interoperability considerations:

      PKCS #8 is a widely recognized format for private key information
      on all modern cryptographic stacks.  The contents are exactly one
      private key (with optional key attributes), so there is no
      possibility for hidden "Easter eggs" in the payload such as
      unexpected certificates or miscellaneous secrets.

      The encrypted variation in this registration,
      EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, "Encrypted Private Key Info",
      of [<a href="./rfc5958" title='"Asymmetric Key Packages"'>RFC5958</a>], and <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> of PKCS #8 as originally described in
      [<a href="./rfc5208" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification Version 1.2"'>RFC5208</a>], which was obsoleted by [<a href="./rfc5958" title='"Asymmetric Key Packages"'>RFC5958</a>]), is less widely used
      for exchange than PKCS #12, but it is much simpler to implement.
      Actually, PKCS #12 incorporates the PKCS #8 types, so a PKCS #12
      processor ought to be able to process PKCS #8 data by embedding
      the PKCS #8 data in PKCS #12 "scaffolding".

      The password-mapping parameter aids in interoperability when the
      creator (who encrypted the keying material) and the user (who is
      attempting to decrypt the keying material) are not operating in
      the same character-encoding environment.  An anticipated scenario
      is that the creator may have created the keying material with a
      password in a Shift-JIS environment a long time ago, while the
      user is in a UTF-8 environment.  There are potentially many
      Unicode sequences that code for the same abstract character, such
      as precomposed and decomposed forms; yet, such an abstract
      character (however coded in Unicode) will tend to map to one
      coding in the legacy charset, if it can be represented at all.
      Therefore, the password-mapping parameter will almost never be
      ambiguous when mapping to legacy encodings.  When mapping from one
      Unicode form to another (such as an internal Unicode
      representation to *pkcs12), code sequences are either preserved or



<span class="grey">Leonard                       Informational                     [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8351">RFC 8351</a>       PKCS #8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo Media Type      June 2018</span>


      folded deterministically to common Unicode code points or
      sequences, producing the same holistic result as mapping to legacy
      encodings.

      It is possible that an abstract character might map to multiple
      legacy encodings under the same charset.  However, the possibility
      is sufficiently remote as to be ignored in this media type
      registration.  One possible workaround is to set the user's
      (decrypting party's) local operating environment to the password-
      mapping legacy encoding parameter for the purpose of generating
      the password octet string from user input.  Another possibility is
      to generate all possible legacy encoding combinations from the
      abstract text (i.e., Unicode text), attempting decryption with
      them.  Customized behavior can be defined by updating this media
      type registration with a new password-mapping special value,
      prefixed with *.

   Published specification:

      RSA Laboratories PKCS #8 v1.2 RSA Encryption Standard, November
