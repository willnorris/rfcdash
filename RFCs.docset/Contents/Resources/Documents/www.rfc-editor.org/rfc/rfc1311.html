                                                              March 1992


                     <span class="h1">Introduction to the STD Notes</span>

Status of this Memo

   This RFC describes a new sub-series of RFCs, called STDs (Standards).
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The STDs are a subseries of notes within the RFC series that are the
   Internet standards.  The intent is to identify clearly for the
   Internet community those RFCs which document Internet standards.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20Assignment%20of%20STD%20Numbers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The Assignment of STD Numbers</span>

   There is a need to be very clear about which specifications have
   completed the full process of standardization in the Internet.  To do
   this an STD number will be assigned to a specification when it
   reaches the Standard maturity level.  Note that specifications may be
   either Technical Specifications (TS) or Applicability Statements
   (AS).

   When a specification reaches the final stage of the standardization
   process and the IAB has designated it a standard for the Internet, an
   STD number will be assigned to that specification.

   The existing standards have been assigned STD numbers (see Appendix).

   The standard for a particular protocol will always have the same STD
   number.

      If at some future time a protocol is reworked and a new document
      is produced as the specification of that standard and the new
      specification is designated by the IAB as a standard for the
      Internet, then the new document will be labeled with the same STD
      number (of course, that new document will have a new RFC number).

   Multiple Documents for One Standard:

      A STD number identifies a standard not a document.  A document is
      identified by its RFC number.  If the specification of a standard
      is spread over several documents they will each carry the same STD
      number.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1311">RFC 1311</a>                    RFC on STD RFCs                   March 1992</span>


         For example, the Domain Name System (DNS) is currently
         specified by the combination of RFCs 1034 and 1035.  Both of
         these documents are now labeled STD-13.

            To be completely clear the DNS "Concepts and Facilities"
            document can be referenced as "STD-13/RFC-1034".

      In such cases, whenever possible, the set of documents defining a
      particular standard will cross reference each other.

   One Standard or Multiple Standards:

      One difficult decision is deciding whether a set of documents
      describe one standard or multiple standards.  In the Appendix, one
      can see that there are several cases in which one STD applies to
      multiple RFCs (see STDs 5, 13, and 20).  There is one case in
      which a family of specifications has multiple STD numbers; that is
      the Telnet Options.

      The general rule is that a separate STD number is used when the
      specification is logically separable.  That is, logically
      separable options are assigned distinct STD numbers while
      amendments and non-optional extensions use the same STD number as
      the base specification.

   Multiple Versions or Editions of a Standard:

      It may occur that the documentation of a standard is updated or
      replaced with a new document.  In such cases, the same STD number
      will be used to label the standard.  No version numbers will be
      attached to STD numbers.  There need be no confusion about having
      the up-to-date document about STD-9 since each version of the
      document will have a distinct RFC number (and of course a
      different date).

   The complete identification of a specification and its document is
   the combination of the STD and the RFC.  For example, "STD-13/RFC-
   1035" completely identifies the current version of the second part of
   the Domain Name System specification.

      To completely identify all of the DNS standard the citation would
      be "STD-13/RFC-1034/RFC-1035".

   One way to think of this is that an acronym (like TCP) refers to a
   concept, which is called a protocol.  An RFC number (like <a href="./rfc793">RFC-793</a>)
   indicates the specific version of the protocol specification.  An STD
   number (like STD-7) designates the status of the protocol.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1311">RFC 1311</a>                    RFC on STD RFCs                   March 1992</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Why%20an%20RFC%20Subseries%20%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Why an RFC Subseries ?</span>

   There are several reasons why the STDs are part of the larger RFC
   series of notes.

   The foremost reason is that the distribution mechanisms for RFCs are
   tried and true.  Anyone who can get an RFC, can automatically get a
   STD.  More important, anyone who knows of the RFC series can easily
   find the STDs.

   Another reason for making STDs part of the RFC series is that the
   maintenance mechanisms for RFCs are already in place.  It makes sense
   to maintain similar documents is a similar way.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Format%20Rules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Format Rules</span>

   Since the STDs are a part of the RFC series, they must conform to
   "Request for Comments on Request for Comments: Instructions to RFC
   Authors" (<a href="./rfc1111">RFC-1111</a>) with respect to format.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1%20%20Status%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>  Status Statement</span>

   Each STD RFC must include on its first page the "Status of this Memo"
   section which contains a paragraph describing the intention of the
   RFC.  This section is meant to convey the status approved by the
   Internet Activities Board (IAB).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Distribution%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Distribution Statement</span>

   Each STD RFC will also include a "distribution statement".  As the
   purpose of the STD series is to disseminate information, there is no
   reason for the distribution to be anything other than "unlimited".

   Typically, the distribution statement will simply be the sentence
   "Distribution of this memo is unlimited." appended to the "Status of
   this Memo" section.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   All STD RFCs must contain a section that discusses the security
   considerations of the procedures that are the main topic of the RFC.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Author%27s%20Address"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Author's Address</span>

   Each STD RFC must have at the very end a section giving the author's
   address, including the name and postal address, the telephone number,
   and the Internet email address.

   In the case of multiple authors, each of the authors will be listed.
   In the case of a document produced by a group, the editor of the
   document will be listed and optionally the chair of the group may be
   listed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20The%20STD%20Publication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. The STD Publication</span>

   New documents can only become STD RFCs through an action of the IAB.
   The publication of STDs will be performed by the RFC Editor.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20STD%20Announcements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  STD Announcements</span>

   New STD RFCs are announced to the RFC distribution list maintained by
   the Network Information Center (NIC).  Contact the NIC to be added or
   deleted from this mailing list by sending an email message to RFC-
   REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Obtaining%20STDs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Obtaining STDs</span>

   STD RFCs may be obtained in the same way as any RFC.

   Details on obtaining RFCs via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending
   an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help:
   ways_to_get_rfcs".  For example:

           To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
           Subject: getting rfcs

           help: ways_to_get_rfcs

   The current standards are listed in the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" (which is STD-1), whose current edition is <a href="./rfc1280">RFC-1280</a>.
