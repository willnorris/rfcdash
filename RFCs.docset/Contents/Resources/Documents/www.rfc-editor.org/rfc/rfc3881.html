<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Purpose"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Purpose</span>

   To help assure healthcare privacy and security in automated systems,
   usage data needs to be collected.  This data will be reviewed by
   administrative staff to verify that healthcare data is being used in
   accordance with the healthcare provider's data security requirements
   and to establish accountability for data use.  This data collection
   and review process is called security auditing.

   This document defines the format of the data to be collected and
   minimum set of attributes that need to be captured by healthcare
   application systems for subsequent use by an automation-assisted
   review application.  The data includes records of who accessed
   healthcare data, when, for what action, from where, and which

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3881">RFC 3881</a>         Security Audit &amp; Access Accountability   September 2004</span>


   patients' records were involved.  The data definition is an XML
   schema to be used as a reference by healthcare standards developers
   and application designers.

   This document consolidates previously disjointed viewpoints of
   security auditing from Health Level 7 (HL7) [<a href="#ref-HL7SASIG" title='"Common Audit Message"'>HL7SASIG</a>], Digital
   Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Working Group 14,
   Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) [<a href="#ref-IHETF-3" title='"IHE Technical Framework"'>IHETF-3</a>], the ASTM
   International Healthcare Informatics Technical Committee (ASTM E31)
   [<a href="#ref-E2147" title='"E2147-01 Standard Specification for Audit and Disclosure Logs for Use in Health Information Systems"'>E2147</a>], and the Joint NEMA/COCIR/JIRA Security and Privacy Committee
   [<a href="#ref-NEMASPC" title='"Security and Privacy Auditing in Health Care Information Technology"'>NEMASPC</a>].  It is intended as a reference for these groups and other
   healthcare standards developers.

   The purposes the document fulfills are to:

   1) Define data to be communicated for evidence of compliance with, or
      violations of, a healthcare enterprise's security and privacy
      policies and objectives.

      This document defines the audit message format and content for
      healthcare application systems.  The focus of auditing is to
      retrospectively detect and report security/privacy breaches.  This
      includes capturing data that supports individual accountability
      for patient record creation, access, updates, and deletions.

      This document does not define healthcare security and privacy
      policies or objectives.  It also does not include real-time access
      alarm actions since there is a perception in the healthcare
      community that security measures that inhibit access may also
      inhibit effective patient care, under some circumstances.

   2) Depict the data that would potentially reside in a common audit
      engine or database.

      Privacy and security audit data is to be collected on each
      hardware system, and there are likely to be separate local data
      stores for system-level and application-level audits.  Collating
      these records and providing a common view - transcending hardware
      system boundaries - is seen as necessary for cost-effective
      security and privacy policy administration.

      The data definitions in this document support such a collation,
      but the technical implementation alternatives are not covered in
      this document.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3881">RFC 3881</a>         Security Audit &amp; Access Accountability   September 2004</span>


   3) Depict data that allows useful queries against audited events.

      Audit data, in its raw form, reflects a sequential view of system
      activity.  Useful inquiries for security and privacy
      administration need workflow, business process, organizational,
      role, and person-oriented views.  Data definitions in this
      document anticipate and support creating those views and queries,
      but do not define them.

   4) Provide a common reference standard for healthcare IT standards
      development organizations.

      By specifying an XML schema, this document anticipates extensions
      to the base schema to meet requirements of healthcare standards
      bodies and application developers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Scope</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Data%20Collection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Data Collection</span>

   This document specifies audit data to be collected and communicated
   from automated systems.  It does not include non-automated processes.

   Data for events in the above categories may be selectively collected,
   based on healthcare organization policy.  This document does not
   specify any baseline or minimal policies.

   For each audited event, this document specifies the minimal data
   requirements plus optional data for the following event categories:

   1) Security administrative events - establishing and maintaining
      security policy definitions, secured object definitions, role
      definitions, user definitions, and the relationships among them.
      In general, these events are specific to the administrative
      applications.

   2) Audit access events - reflecting special protections implemented
      for the audit trail itself.

   3) Security-mediated events - recording entity identification and
      authentication, data access, function access, nonrepudiation,
      cryptographic operations, and data import/export for messages and
      reports.  In general, these events are generic to all protected
      resources, without regard to the application data content.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3881">RFC 3881</a>         Security Audit &amp; Access Accountability   September 2004</span>


   4) Patient care data events - documenting what was done, by whom,
      using which resources, from what access points, and to whose
      medical data.  In general, these audits are application-specific
      since they require knowledge of the application data content.

   Security subsystems found in most system infrastructures include a
   capability to capture system-level security relevant events like
   log-on and security object accesses.  This document does not preclude
   such functions being enabled to record and supply the data defined in
   this document, but transformation of the collected data to the common
   XML schema definition may be necessary to support requirements
   consolidated auditing views.

   Application-level events, such as patient record access, are not
   captured by system-level security audits.  The defined data support
   applications' record access auditing for healthcare institutional
   security and privacy assurance plus related policy administration
   functions.

   System-local data definitions for collection and storage of audit
   data, prior to transformation to a common schema and transmission to
   a common repository, are not included in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Anticipated%20Data%20End-uses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Anticipated Data End-uses</span>

   This document anticipates, but does not define, end-uses for the data
   collected.

   The typical healthcare IT environment contains many systems from
   various vendors and developers who have not implemented common or
   interoperable security administrative functions.  This document
   anticipates a requirement to transmit data from several unrelated
   systems to a common repository.  It also anticipates the aggregated
   data which may then be queried and viewed in a variety of ways.

   There are distinctions of detail granularity, specificity, and
   frequency between audit data required for surveillance versus
   forensic purposes.  While some surveillance data may be useful for
   forensics, the scope of this document is limited to surveillance.

   This document does not address access real-time policy violation
   alarm actions.  There is a perception in the healthcare community
   that security measures which inhibit access may also inhibit
   effective patient care, under some circumstances.

   This document does not define any data for patient care consents or
   patients' permissions for data disclosure.  It is conceivable that
   the proposed audit data could be input to such applications, however,
   assuming strict access controls for audit data have been established.

   This document does not define system-specific or application-specific
   data that may be collected and reported in addition to the defined
   elements.  For example, it is conceivable that audit mechanisms may
   be useful for tracking financial or payroll transactions.  At the
   same time, this document does not preclude extending the XML schema
   to incorporate additional data.

   There is a potential requirement for a set of administrative messages
   to be sent from a central source to each participating system to
   uniformly specify, control, enable, or disable audit data collection.
   Such messages are not included in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Conformance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Conformance</span>

   This document does not include any definitions of conformance
   practices.  Instead, it anticipates that standards development
   organizations that reference this document may specify their own
   conformance requirements.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Goals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Goals</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Effective%20Data%20Gathering"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Effective Data Gathering</span>

   The process of assuring that security policies are implemented
   correctly is essential to information security administration.  It is
   a set of interrelated tasks all aimed at maintaining an acceptable
   level of confidence that security protections are, in fact, working
   as intended.  These tasks are assisted by data from automated
   instrumentation of system and application functions.

   Data gathered from a secured environment is used to accumulate
   evidence that security systems are working as intended and to detect
   incidents and patterns of misuse for further actions.  Once messages
   have been collected, various reports may be created in support of
   security assurance and administration information requirements.

   When a site runs multiple heterogeneous applications, each
   application system may have its own security mechanisms - user log-
   on, roles, access right permissions and restrictions, etc.  Each
   application system also has its own security log file that records
   security relevant events, e.g., log-in, data access, and updates to
   the security policy databases.  A system administrator or security
   auditor must examine each of these log files to find security

   relevant incidents.  Not only is it difficult to examine each of
   these files separately, the format and contents of each file may be
   confusingly different.

   Resolving these issues requires a framework to:

   -  Maximize interoperability and the meaningfulness of data across
      applications and sites
   -  Minimize ambiguity among heterogeneous systems
   -  Simplify and limit the costs of administrative audit tasks.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Efficiency"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Efficiency</span>

   One of the leading concerns about auditing is the potential volume of
   data gathering and its impact on application system performance.
   Although this document does not prescribe specific implementations or
   strategies, the following are meant as informative guidance for
   development.

   1) Audits should be created for transactions or record-level data
      access, not for individual attribute-level changes to data.

   2) This document does not discourage locally optimized gathering of
      audit data on each application system.  Instead, it anticipates
      implementation-defined periodic gathering and transmission of data
      to a common repository.  This common repository would be optimized
      for after-the-fact audit queries and reporting, thus unburdening
      each application system of those responsibilities.  It is also
      important to keep the message size compact so that audit data will
      not penalize normal network operation.

   3) On each application system, a variety of policy-based methods
      could be employed to optimize data gathering and storage, e.g.,
      selective auditing of only events defined as important plus
      workload buffering and balancing.  Data gathering itself should be
      stateless to avoid the overhead of transactional semantics.  In
      addition, prior to transmission, some filtering, aggregation, and
      summarization of repeated events would reduce the number of
      messages.  Audit data storage and integrity on each application
      system need only be scaled for relatively low-volume and short-
      duration requirements, yet be consistent with implementation-
      defined minimums for holding the data for subsequent collection.

   4) Leveraging existing data collection should be considered.  For
      example, most commercial security subsystems record events in a
      local common log file, so the log file data can be extracted for
      communication to a common repository.  Also, it is common in some
      systems' designs to have a transaction log for data reconstruction



<span class="grey">Marshall                     Informational                      [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-8"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3881">RFC 3881</a>         Security Audit &amp; Access Accountability   September 2004</span>


      in event of database loss, so collecting data-update audit data
      within this subsystem could reduce impact on application system
      performance.

   5) A security audit repository would gather all audit message data
      from the different applications in one database with one standard
      structure.  This would allow easier evaluation and querying.  Once
      a suspicious pattern has been found in the audit log repository,
      investigation might proceed with more detail in the application
      specific audit log.  The presence of a common repository also
      simplifies and streamlines the implementation of policies for
      audit data storage, integrity, retention, and destruction.

   The following identifies representative trigger events for generating
   audit messages.  This is not a complete list of trigger events.

   For those events arising in the security infrastructure the "minimal"
   and "basic" level of auditing as outlined in the Common Criteria
   [<a href="#ref-ISO15408-2" title='"ISO/IEC 15408:1999 Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2: Security Functional Requirements"'>ISO15408-2</a>] should be used as a reference standard.

   This group includes all actions that create, maintain, query, and
   display definitions for securing data, functions, and the associated
   access policies.  For each trigger type, the creation, update or
   amendment, deletion, and activation or deactivation are auditable.

   application functions used for patient management, clinical
   processes, registry of business objects and methods, program creation
   and maintenance, etc.

   This reflects a basic policy decision that an event should or should
   not be audited.  Some, but not necessarily all, triggers or use cases
   must create an audit record.  The selection of what to audit depends
   on administrative policy decisions.  Note that, for integrity, this
   event should always be audited.

   by institutional privacy policies and expose the implementation of
   those policies, access to the data is highly sensitive.  This event
   should therefore always be audited.

   This includes instances where audit data is modified or deleted.
   While such operations are sometimes permitted by systems policies,
   modification or destruction of audit data may well be the result of

   for non-care functions, and support regulatory requirements need to
   be identified by application-domain standards developers and system
   implementers.

   This section defines and describes the data in the XML schema.  The
   actual XML schema definition is in <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>.

   The proposed data elements are grouped into these categories:

   1) Event Identification - what was done
   2) Active Participant Identification - by whom
   3) Network Access Point Identification - initiated from where
   4) Audit Source Identification - using which server
   5) Participant Object Identification - to what record

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Event%20Identification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Event Identification</span>

   The following data identifies the name, action type, time, and
   disposition of the audited event.  There is only one set of event
   identification data per audited event.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.1.%20%20Event%20ID"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.1" id="section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  Event ID</span>

   Description

      Identifier for a specific audited event, e.g., a menu item,
      program, rule, policy, function code, application name, or URL.
      It identifies the performed function.

   Optionality: Required

   Format / Values

      Coded value, either defined by the system implementers or as a
      reference to a standard vocabulary.  The "code" attribute must be
      unambiguous and unique, at least within Audit Source ID (see
      <a href="#section-5.4">section 5.4</a>).  Examples of Event IDs are program name, method
      name, or function name.

      For implementation defined coded values or references to
      standards, the XML schema defines these optional attributes:

         Attribute      Value

         CodeSystem     OID reference
         CodeSystemName Name of the coding system; strongly recommended

                                     method

   Rationale

      This broadly indicates what kind of action was done on the
      Participant Object.

   Notes

      Actions that are not enumerated above are considered an Execute of
      a specific function or object interface method or treated two or
      more distinct events.  An application action, such as an
      authorization, is a function Execute, and the Event ID would
      identify the function.

      For some applications, such as radiological imaging, a Query
      action may only determine the presence of data but not access the
      data itself.  Auditing need not make as fine a distinction.

      Compound actions, such as "Move," would be audited by creating
      audit data for each operation - read, create, delete - or as an
      Execute of a function or method.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.3.%20%20Event%20Date%2FTime"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.3" id="section-5.1.3">5.1.3</a>.  Event Date/Time</span>

   Description

      Universal coordinated time (UTC), i.e., a date/time specification
      that is unambiguous as to local time zones.

   Optionality: Required

   Format / Values

      A date/time representation that is unambiguous in conveying
      universal coordinated time (UTC), formatted according to the ISO
      8601 standard [<a href="#ref-ISO8601" title='"ISO 8601:2000 Data elements and interchange formats -- Information interchange -- Representation of dates and times"'>ISO8601</a>]

   Rationale

      This ties an event to a specific date and time.  Security audits
      typically require a consistent time base, e.g., UTC, to eliminate
      time-zone issues arising from geographical distribution.

   Notes

      In a distributed system, some sort of common time base, e.g., an
      NTP [<a href="./rfc1305" title='"Network Time Protocol (Version 3) Specification, Implementation"'>RFC1305</a>] server, is a good implementation tactic.

   Format / Values

      Enumeration:

      Value Meaning
       ---- ----------------------------------------------------
        0   Success
        4   Minor failure; action restarted, e.g., invalid password
            with first retry
        8   Serious failure; action terminated, e.g., invalid
            password with excess retries
       12   Major failure; action made unavailable, e.g., user
            account disabled due to excessive invalid log-on attempts

   Rationale

      Some audit events may be qualified by success or failure
      indicator.  For example, a Log-on might have this flag set to a
      non-zero value to indicate why a log-on attempt failed.

   Notes

      In some cases a "success" may be partial, for example, an
      incomplete or interrupted transfer of a radiological study.  For
      the purpose of establishing accountability, these distinctions are
      not relevant.

         OriginalText   Input value that was translated to the code

      Since events may be categorized in more than one way, there may be
      multiple values specified.

   Rationale

      This field enables queries of messages by implementation-defined
      event categories.

   The following data identify a user for the purpose of documenting
   accountability for the audited event.  A user may be a person, or a
   hardware device or software process for events that are not initiated
   by a person.

   Optionally, the user's network access location may be specified.

   There may be more than one user per event, for example, in cases of
   actions initiated by one user for other users, or in events that
   involve more than one user, hardware device, or system process.
   However, only one user may be the initiator/requestor for the event.

   Description

      Unique identifier for the user actively participating in the event

   Optionality: Required

   Format / Values

      User identifier text string from the authentication system.  It is
      a unique value within the Audit Source ID (see <a href="#section-5.4">section 5.4</a>).

   Rationale

      This field ties an audit event to a specific user.

   Notes

      For cross-system audits, especially with long retention, this user
      identifier will permanently tie an audit event to a specific user
      via a perpetually unique key.

      For node-based authentication -- where only the system hardware or
      process, but not a human user, is identified -- User ID would be
      the node name.

   Description

      Alternative unique identifier for the user

   Optionality: Optional

   Format / Values

      User identifier text string from authentication system.  This
      identifier would be one known to a common authentication system
      (e.g., single sign-on), if available.

   Rationale

   In some situations a user may authenticate with one identity but, to
   access a specific application system, may use a synonymous identify.
   For example, some "single sign on" implementations will do this.  The
   alternative identifier would then be the original identify used for
   authentication, and the User ID is the one known to and used by the
   application.

   Rationale

      The User ID and Alternative User ID may be internal or otherwise
      obscure values.  This field assists the auditor in identifying the
      actual user.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.4.%20%20User%20Is%20Requestor"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.4" id="section-5.2.4">5.2.4</a>.  User Is Requestor</span>

   Description

      Indicator that the user is or is not the requestor, or initiator,
      for the event being audited.

   Optionality: Optional

   Format / Values

      Boolean, default/assumed value is "true"

   Rationale

      This value is used to distinguish between requestor-users and
      recipient-users.  For example, one person may initiate a report-
      output to be sent to a another user.

   Description

      Specification of the role(s) the user plays when performing the
      event, as assigned in role-based access control security.

   Optionality: Optional; multi-valued

   Format / Values

      Coded value, with attribute "code" valued with the role code or
      text from authorization system.  More than one value may be
      specified.

      The codes may be implementation-defined or reference a standard
      vocabulary enumeration.  For implementation defined codes or
      references to standards, the XML schema defines these optional
      attributes:

         Attribute      Value description
         -------------- --------------------------------------------
         CodeSystem     OID reference
         CodeSystemName Name of the coding system; strongly recommended
                        to be valued for locally-defined code-sets.
         Display Name   The value to be used in displays and reports
         OriginalText   Input value that was translated to the code

   Rationale

      This value ties an audited event to a user's role(s).  It is an
      optional value that might be used to group events for analysis by
      user functional role categories.

   Notes

      Many security systems are unable to produce this data, hence it is
      optional.

      For the common message, this identifier would be the one known to
      a common authorization system, if available.  Otherwise, it is a
      unique value within the Audit Source ID (see <a href="#section-5.4">section 5.4</a>).
      Consider using a globally unique identifier associated with the
      role to avoid ambiguity in auditing data collected from multiple
      systems.

      Role ID is not a substitute for personal accountability.

      Ambiguities arise from composite roles and users with multiple
      roles, i.e., which role within a composite is being used or what
      privilege was a user employing?

   The network access point identifies the logical network location for
   application activity.  These data are paired 1:1 with the Active
   Participant Identification data.

      Enumeration:

         Value Meaning
         ----- --------------------------------
           1   Machine Name, including DNS name
           2   IP Address
           3   Telephone Number

   Rationale

      This datum identifies the type of network access point identifier
      of the user device for the audit event.  It is an optional value
      that may be used to group events recorded on separate servers for
      analysis of access according to a network access point's type.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.2.%20%20Network%20Access%20Point%20ID"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.2" id="section-5.3.2">5.3.2</a>.  Network Access Point ID</span>

   Description

      An identifier for the network access point of the user device for
      the audit event.  This could be a device id, IP address, or some
      other identifier associated with a device.

   Optionality: Optional

   Format / Values

      Text may be constrained to only valid values for the given Network
      Access Point Type, if specified.  Recommendation is to be as
      specific as possible where multiple options are available.

   Rationale

      This datum identifies the user's network access point, which may
      be distinct from the server that performed the action.  It is an
      optional value that may be used to group events recorded on
      separate servers for analysis of a specific network access point's
      data access across all servers.

   Note

      Network Access Point ID is not a substitute for personal
      accountability.  Internet IP addresses, in particular, are highly
      volatile and may be assigned to more than one person in a short
      time period.

   The following data are required primarily for application systems and
   processes.  Since multi-tier, distributed, or composite applications
   make source identification ambiguous, this collection of fields may
   repeat for each application or process actively involved in the
   event.  For example, multiple value-sets can identify participating
   web servers, application processes, and database server threads in an
   n-tier distributed application.  Passive event participants, e.g.,
   low-level network transports, need not be identified.

   Depending on implementation strategies, it is possible that the
   components in a multi-tier, distributed, or composite applications
   may generate more than one audit message for a single application
   event.  Various data in the audit message may be used to identify
   such cases, supporting subsequent data reduction.  This document
   anticipates that the repository and reporting mechanisms will perform
   data reduction when required, but does not specify those mechanism.

   Description

      Logical source location within the healthcare enterprise network,
      e.g., a hospital or other provider location within a multi-entity
      provider group.

   Optionality: Optional

   Format / Values

      Unique identifier text string within the healthcare enterprise.
      May be unvalued when the audit-generating application is uniquely
      identified by Audit Source ID.

   Rationale

      This value differentiates among the sites in a multi-site
      enterprise health information system.

   Notes

      This is defined by the application that generates the audit
      record.  It contains a unique code that identifies a business
      organization (owner of data) that is known to the enterprise.  The
      value further qualifies and disambiguates the Audit Source ID.
      Values may vary depending on type of business.  There may be
      levels of differentiation within the organization.

   Description

      Identifier of the source where the event originated.

   Optionality: Required

   Format / Values

      Unique identifier text string, at least within the Audit
      Enterprise Site ID

   Rationale

      This field ties the event to a specific source system.  It may be
      used to group events for analysis according to where the event
      occurred.

   Notes

      In some configurations, a load-balancing function distributes work
      among two or more duplicate servers.  The values defined for this
      field thus may be considered as an source identifier for a group
      of servers rather than a specific source system.

   Format / Values

      Coded-value enumeration, optionally defined by system implementers
      or a as a reference to a standard vocabulary.  Unless defined or
      referenced, the default values for the "code" attribute are:

         Value  Meaning

           1    End-user interface
           2    Data acquisition device or instrument
           3    Web server process tier in a multi-tier system
           4    Application server process tier in a multi-tier system
           5    Database server process tier in a multi-tier system
           6    Security server, e.g., a domain controller
           7    ISO level 1-3 network component
           8    ISO level 4-6 operating software
           9    External source, other or unknown type

      For implementation defined codes or references to standards, the
      XML schema defines these optional attributes:

         DisplayName    The value to be used in displays and reports
         OriginalText   Input value that was translated to the code

      Since audit sources may be categorized in more than one way, there
      may be multiple values specified.

   Rationale

      This field indicates which type of source is identified by the
      Audit Source ID.  It is an optional value that may be used to
      group events for analysis according to the type of source where
      the event occurred.

   The following data assist the auditing process by indicating specific
   instances of data or objects that have been accessed.

   These data are required unless the values for Event Identification,
   Active Participant Identification, and Audit Source Identification
   are sufficient to document the entire auditable event.  Production of

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3881">RFC 3881</a>         Security Audit &amp; Access Accountability   September 2004</span>


   audit records containing these data may be enabled or suppressed, as
   determined by healthcare organization policy and regulatory
   requirements.

   Because events may have more than one participant object, this group
   can be a repeating set of values.  For example, depending on
   institutional policies and implementation choices:

   -  Two participant object value-sets can be used to identify access
      to patient data by medical record number plus the specific health
      care encounter or episode for the patient.
   -  A patient participant and his authorized representative may be
      identified concurrently.
   -  An attending physician and consulting referrals may be identified
      concurrently.
   -  All patients identified on a worklist may be identified.
   -  For radiological studies, a set of related participant objects
      identified by accession number or study number, may be identified.

   Note, though, that each audit message documents only a single usage
   instance of such participant object relationships and does not serve
   to document all relationships that may be present or possible.

      User Identifier and URI [<a href="./rfc2396" title='"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC2396</a>] text strings are intended to be
      used for security administration trigger events to identify the
      objects being acted-upon.

      The codes may be the default set stated above, implementation-
      defined, or reference a standard vocabulary enumeration, such as
      HL7 version 2.4 table 207 or DICOM defined media types.  For
      implementation defined codes or references to standards, the XML

         Attribute      Value
         -------------- --------------------------------------------
         CodeSystem     OID reference
         CodeSystemName Name of the coding system; strongly recommended
                        to be valued for locally-defined code-sets.
         DisplayName    The value to be used in displays and reports
         OriginalText   Input value that was translated to the code

   Rationale

      Required to distinguish among various identifiers that may
      synonymously identify a participant object.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.5.5.%20%20Participant%20Object%20Sensitivity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.5.5" id="section-5.5.5">5.5.5</a>.  Participant Object Sensitivity</span>

   Description

      Denotes policy-defined sensitivity for the Participant Object ID
      such as VIP, HIV status, mental health status, or similar topics.

   Optionality: Optional

   Format / Values

      Values are institution- and implementation-defined text strings.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.5.6.%20%20Participant%20Object%20ID"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.5.6" id="section-5.5.6">5.5.6</a>.  Participant Object ID</span>

   Description

      Identifies a specific instance of the participant object.

   Optionality: Required

   Format / Values

      Text string.  Value format depends on Participant Object Type Code
      and the Participant Object ID Type Code.

   Rationale

      This field identifies a specific instance of an object, such as a
      patient, to detect/track privacy and security issues.

   Notes

      Consider this to be the primary unique identifier key for the
      object, so it may be a composite data field as implemented.

   Description

      An instance-specific descriptor of the Participant Object ID
      audited, such as a person's name.

   Optionality: Optional

   Format / Values

      Text string

   Rationale

      This field may be used in a query/report to identify audit events
      for a specific person, e.g., where multiple synonymous Participant
      Object IDs (patient number, medical record number, encounter
      number, etc.) have been used.

      Description

      The actual query for a query-type participant object.

   Optionality: Optional

   Format / Values

      Base 64 encoded data

   Rationale

      For query events it may be necessary to capture the actual query
      input to the query process in order to identify the specific
      event.  Because of differences among query implementations and
      data encoding for them, this is a base 64 encoded data blob.  It
      may be subsequently decoded or interpreted by downstream audit
      analysis processing.

   Description

      Implementation-defined data about specific details of the object
      accessed or used.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3881">RFC 3881</a>         Security Audit &amp; Access Accountability   September 2004</span>


   Optionality: Optional

   Format

      Type-value pair.  The "type" attribute is an implementation-
      defined text string.  The "value" attribute is a base 64 encoded
      data.

   Rationale

      Specific details or values from the object accessed may be desired
      in specific auditing implementations.  The type-value pair enables
      the use of implementation-defined and locally-extensible object
      type identifiers and values.  For example, a clinical diagnostic
      object may contain multiple test results, and this element could
      document the type and number and type of results.

      Many possible data encodings are possible for this elements, so
      the value is a base 64 encoded data blob.  It may be subsequently
      decoded or interpreted by downstream audit analysis processing.

   The schema specified in <a href="#section-6.1">section 6.1</a> may be extended and restricted to
   meet local implementation-specific requirements.  W3C Recommendation
   for XML Schema structure [<a href="#ref-W3CXML-1" title='"XML Schema Part 1: Structures"'>W3CXML-1</a>], section 4, is the governing
   standard for accomplishing this.

   As of the current version of this document, a public reference URI
   for the base schema has not been established.

   Local definitions reference the common audit message base schema.
   For example, here is a schema with a local vocabulary restriction for
   "Audit Enterprise Site ID" plus an extension adding a new "Audit
   Source Asset Number" element.

   The URI used to identify this schema (<a href="http://audit-message-uri">http://audit-message-uri</a>) is a
   syntactically valid example that does not represent an actual schema.
   Schema validators might report an error when attempting to import a
   schema using this URI.

   Audit data must be secured at least to the same extent as the
   underlying data and activities being audited.  This includes access
   controls as well as data integrity and recovery functions.  This
   document acknowledges the need for, but does not specify, the
   policies and technical methods to accomplish this.

   It is conceivable that audit data might have unintended uses, e.g.,
   tracking the frequency and nature of system use for productivity
   measures.  ASTM standard E2147-01 [<a href="#ref-E2147" title='"E2147-01 Standard Specification for Audit and Disclosure Logs for Use in Health Information Systems"'>E2147</a>] states, in paragraph
   5.3.10, "Prohibit use for other reasons than to enforce security and
   to detect security breaches in record health information systems, for
   example, the audits are not to be used to explore activity profiles
   or movement profiles of employees."

   Some audit data arises from security-relevant processes other than
   data access.  These are the trigger events listed in <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a> and
   4.2 of this document.  Audit data, defined in this document, can
   record the accountabilities for the results of these processes, as
   part of a complete security implementation.  A discussion of the
   associated authorities, reference standards, and implementation
