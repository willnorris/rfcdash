   This document creates an IANA registry for the response codes for the
   MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control Package [<a href="./rfc6231" title='"An Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Control Package for the Media Control Channel Framework"'>RFC6231</a>].

   There are no security considerations, other than those described in
   the MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control Package [<a href="./rfc6231" title='"An Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Control Package for the Media Control Channel Framework"'>RFC6231</a>].

   IANA has created the "MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control
   Package Status Codes" registry per this document.  New status codes
   are assigned using the Standards Action process defined in <a href="./rfc5226">RFC 5226</a>
   [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].
