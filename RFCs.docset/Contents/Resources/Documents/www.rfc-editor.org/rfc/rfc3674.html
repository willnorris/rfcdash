Abstract

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an extensible
   protocol with numerous elective features.  This document introduces a
   general mechanism for discovery of elective features and extensions
   which cannot be discovered using existing mechanisms.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Background%20and%20Intended%20Use"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Background and Intended Use</span>

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [<a href="./rfc3377" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Technical Specification"'>RFC3377</a>] is an
   extensible protocol with numerous elective features.  LDAP provides
   mechanisms for a client to discover supported protocol versions,
   controls, extended operations, Simple Authentication and Security
   Layer (SASL) mechanisms, and subschema information.  However, these
   mechanisms are not designed to support general feature discovery.

   This document describes a simple, general-purpose mechanism which
   clients may use to discover the set of elective features supported by
   a server.  For example, this mechanism could be used by a client to
   discover whether or not the server supports requests for all
   operational attributes, e.g., "+" [<a href="./rfc3673" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAPv3): All Operational Attributes"'>RFC3673</a>].  As another example,
   this mechanism could be used to discover absolute true, e.g., "(&amp;)"
   and false, e.g., "(|)", search filters [<a href="#ref-T-F" title='"LDAP True/False Filters"'>T-F</a>] support.

   This document extends the LDAP Protocol Mechanism registry [<a href="./rfc3383" title='"Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Considerations for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)"'>RFC3383</a>]
   to support registration of values of the supportedFeatures attribute.
   This registry is managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA).

   Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
   [<a href="./rfc2252" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Attribute Syntax Definitions"'>RFC2252</a>].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped)
   for readability.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Discovery%20of%20supported%20features"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Discovery of supported features</span>

   Each elective feature whose support may be discovered SHALL be
   identified by an Object Identifier (OID).  A server advertises its
   support for a given feature by providing the OID associated with the
   feature as a value of the 'supportedFeatures' attribute held in the
   root DSE.  A client may examine the values of this attribute to
   determine if a particular feature is supported by the server.  A
   client MUST ignore values it doesn't recognize as they refer to
   elective features it doesn't implement.

   Features associated with Standard Track protocol mechanisms MUST be
   registered.  Features associated with other protocol mechanisms
   SHOULD be registered.  Procedures for registering protocol mechanisms
   are described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp64">BCP 64</a> [<a href="./rfc3383" title='"Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Considerations for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)"'>RFC3383</a>].  The word "Feature" should be
   placed in the usage field of the submitted LDAP Protocol Mechanism
   template.

   The 'supportedFeatures' attribute type is described as follows:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.3.5
        NAME 'supportedFeatures'
        DESC 'features supported by the server'
        EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38
        USAGE dSAOperation )

   Servers MUST be capable of recognizing this attribute type by the
   name 'supportedFeatures'.  Servers MAY recognize the attribute type
   by other names.

   As rogue clients can discover features of a server by other means
   (such as by trial and error), this feature discovery mechanism is not
   believed to introduce any new security risk to LDAP.

   Future specifications detailing LDAP features are to register each
   feature as a LDAP Protocol Mechanism per guidance given in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp64">BCP 64</a>
   [<a href="./rfc3383" title='"Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Considerations for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)"'>RFC3383</a>].  A usage of "Feature" in a Protocol Mechanism registration
   template indicates that the value to be registered is associated with
   an LDAP feature.

   The IANA has registered the LDAP 'supportedFeatures' descriptor.  The
   following registration template is suggested:

      Subject: Request for LDAP Descriptor Registration
      Descriptor (short name): supportedFeatures
      Object Identifier: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.3.5
