Abstract

   Procedures and protocol mechanisms to enable efficient and accurate
   measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput in MPLS networks
   are defined in <a href="./rfc6374">RFC 6374</a>.

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the set of MPLS protocol
   functions applicable to the construction and operation of packet-
   switched transport networks.

   This document describes a profile of the general MPLS loss, delay,
   and throughput measurement techniques that suffices to meet the
   specific requirements of MPLS-TP.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

   Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput
   in MPLS networks are defined in [<a href="./rfc6374" title='"Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks"'>RFC6374</a>].  This document describes a
   profile, i.e., a simplified subset, of these procedures that suffices
   to meet the specific requirements of MPLS-based transport networks
   [<a href="./rfc5921" title='"A Framework for MPLS in Transport Networks"'>RFC5921</a>] as defined in [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>].  This profile is presented for the
   convenience of implementors who are concerned exclusively with the
   transport network context.

   The use of the profile specified in this document is purely optional.
   Implementors wishing to provide enhanced functionality that is within
   the scope of [<a href="./rfc6374" title='"Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks"'>RFC6374</a>] but outside the scope of this profile may do
   so, whether or not the implementation is restricted to the transport
   network context.

   The assumption of this profile is that the devices involved in a
   measurement operation are configured for measurement by a means
   external to the measurement protocols themselves, for example, via a
   Network Management System (NMS) or separate configuration protocol.
   The manageability considerations in [<a href="./rfc6374" title='"Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks"'>RFC6374</a>] apply, and further
   information on MPLS-TP network management can be found in [<a href="./rfc5950" title='"Network Management Framework for MPLS-based Transport Networks"'>RFC5950</a>].

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20MPLS-TP%20Measurement%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  MPLS-TP Measurement Considerations</span>

   The measurement considerations discussed in <a href="./rfc6374#section-2.9">Section 2.9 of [RFC6374]</a>
   apply also in the context of MPLS-TP, except for the following, which
   pertain to topologies excluded from MPLS-TP:

   o  Equal Cost Multipath considerations (<a href="./rfc6374#section-2.9.4">Section 2.9.4 of [RFC6374]</a>)

   o  Considerations for direct Loss Measurement (LM) in the presence of
      Label Switched Paths constructed via the Label Distribution
      Protocol (LDP) or utilizing Penultimate Hop Popping (<a href="./rfc6374#section-2.9.8">Section 2.9.8
      of [RFC6374]</a>)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Packet%20Loss%20Measurement%20%28LM%29%20Profile"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Packet Loss Measurement (LM) Profile</span>

   When an LM session is externally configured, the values of several
   protocol parameters can be fixed in advance at the endpoints involved
   in the session, so that negotiation of these parameters is not
   required.  These parameters, and their default values as specified by
   this profile, are as follows:

   Parameter                                 Default Value
   ----------------------------------------- --------------------------
   Query control code                        In-band Response Requested
   Byte/packet Count (B) Flag                Packet count
   Traffic-class-specific (T) Flag           Traffic-class-scoped
   Origin Timestamp Format (OTF)             Truncated IEEE 1588v2

   A simple implementation may assume that external configuration will
   ensure that both ends of the communication are using the default
   values for these parameters.  However, implementations are strongly
   advised to validate the values of these parameters in received
   messages so that configuration inconsistencies can be detected and
   reported.

   LM message rates (and test message rates, when inferred LM is used)
   should be configurable by the network operator on a per-channel
   basis.  The following intervals should be supported:

   Message Type   Supported Intervals
   -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
   LM Message     100 milliseconds, 1 second, 10 seconds, 1 minute, 10
                  minutes
   Test Message   10 milliseconds, 100 milliseconds, 1 second, 10
                  seconds, 1 minute

   When a DM session is externally configured, the values of several
   protocol parameters can be fixed in advance at the endpoints involved
   in the session, so that negotiation of these parameters is not
   required.  These parameters, and their default values as specified by
   this profile, are as follows:

   Parameter                                  Default Value
   ------------------------------------------ --------------------------
   Query control code                         In-band Response Requested
   Querier Timestamp Format (QTF)             Truncated IEEE 1588v2
   Responder Timestamp Format (RTF)           Truncated IEEE 1588v2
   Responder's Preferred Timestamp Format     Truncated IEEE 1588v2
   (RPTF)

   A simple implementation may assume that external configuration will
   ensure that both ends of the communication are using the default
   values for these parameters.  However, implementations are strongly
   advised to validate the values of these parameters in received
   messages so that configuration inconsistencies can be detected and
   reported.

   DM message rates should be configurable by the network operator on a
   per-channel basis.  The following message intervals should be
   supported: 1 second, 10 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes.

   This document delineates a subset of the procedures specified in
   [<a href="./rfc6374" title='"Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks"'>RFC6374</a>], and as such introduces no new security considerations in
   itself.  The security considerations discussed in [<a href="./rfc6374" title='"Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks"'>RFC6374</a>] also
   apply to the profile presented in this document.  General
   considerations for MPLS-TP network security can be found in
