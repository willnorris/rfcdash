[Categories:  A.5;

It is time to set serious schedules for the implementation of NCP's  and
Telnets.   To  facilitate  matters,  John  Heafner of Rand has agreed to
monitor each site's progress and test its implementation.

Network Liaison Contacts are hereby responsible for preparing a schedule
for  implementation  and  informing  John.  Such a schedule must include
dates of

   (a)  implementation of an NCP according to the specifications
        in Document #1 as modified by RFC #107;

   (b)  implementation of a user-Telnet which enables local users to
        login to foreign Hosts;

   (c)  implementation of a server-Telnet which enables foreign users to
        login on your Host;

   (d)  documentation of the mechanism for connecting to and logging in
        to your Host;

   (e)  documentation of the mechanism for obtaining job numbers,
        passwords, etc. to your Host;

   (f)  documentation of the services available on your Host; and

   (e) regular operation at advertised hours.

John is hereby responsible  for  prodding  Host  teams  to  prodcue  the
requisite  schedule,  software  and  documentation;  for testing out the
advertised  implementations;  and  for  probing  and  understanding  the
reasons  for  unseemly  delays.   Concomitantly,  John  is now the right
person  to  complain   to   about   ambiguities,   insufficiencies   and
misunderstandings of the protocols.

   Thank you for your cooperation.
