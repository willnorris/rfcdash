Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to routing within a Fibre Channel fabric, which is independent of the
   usage of a particular routing protocol.

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to the Fibre Channel network's Routing Table for routing within a
   Fabric.  Managed objects specific to particular routing protocols,
   such as the Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>], are
   not specified in this MIB module.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols, such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port



<span class="grey">DeSanti, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4625">RFC 4625</a>               FC Routing Information MIB         September 2006</span>


   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an
   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [<a href="#ref-FC-FS" title='"Fibre Channel - Framing and Signaling (FC-FS)"'>FC-FS</a>].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify
   the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has both an
   address identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the FC
   address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.  Each
   octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy,
   a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Routing%20Protocols"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Routing Protocols</span>

   The routing of frames within the Fabric is normally based on the
   standard routing protocol, called the Fabric Shortest Path First
   (FSPF) protocol.  The operation of FSPF (or of any other routing
   protocol) allows a switch to generate and maintain its own routing
   table of how to forward frames it receives; i.e., a table in which to
   look up the destination address of a received frame in order to
   determine the best link by which to forward that frame towards its
   destination.

   The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple
   Fabric Switch elements is [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>] (which replaces the previous
   revision, [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-3" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 3 (FC-SW-3)"'>FC-SW-3</a>]).  [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>] carries forward the existing
   specification for the operation of a single Fabric in a physical
   infrastructure, augmenting it with the definition of Virtual Fabrics
   and with the specification of how multiple Virtual Fabrics can
   operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.  The use of
   Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in its header to
   indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that frame is being
   transmitted on.  All frames entering a particular "Core Switch"
   [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>] (i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual Fabric are
   processed by the same "Virtual Switch" within that Core switch.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4625">RFC 4625</a>               FC Routing Information MIB         September 2006</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Relationship%20to%20Other%20MIBs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Relationship to Other MIBs</span>

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [<a href="./rfc2837" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fabric Element in Fibre Channel Standard"'>RFC2837</a>] was focussed
   on Fibre Channel switches.  It is being replaced by the more generic
   Fibre Channel Management MIB [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>], which defines basic
   information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including
   extensions to the standard IF-MIB [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>] for Fibre Channel
   interfaces.

   This MIB extends beyond [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>] to cover the routing of traffic
   within a Fabric of a Fibre Channel network.  The standard routing
   protocol for Fibre Channel is FSPF [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>].  Another MIB [<a href="./rfc4626" title="&quot;MIB for Fibre Channel's Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) Protocol&quot;">RFC4626</a>]
   specifies management information specific to FSPF.  This MIB contains
   routing information that is independent of FSPF (i.e., it would still
   apply even if a routing protocol other than FSPF were in use in the
   network).

   This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions from T11-TC-MIB,
   defined in [<a href="./rfc4439" title='"Fibre Channel Fabric Address Manager MIB"'>RFC4439</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20MIB%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  MIB Overview</span>

   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of,
   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of the FSPF
   protocol.  (Note that there are no definitions in this MIB module of
   "managed actions" that can be invoked via SNMP.)

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Fibre%20Channel%20Management%20Instance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Fibre Channel Management Instance</span>

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent with multiple AgentX [<a href="./rfc2741" title='"Agent Extensibility (AgentX) Protocol Version 1"'>RFC2741</a>] sub-agents, each
   sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>] as the index value that uniquely identifies each Fibre
   Channel management instance within the same SNMP context (<a href="./rfc3411#section-3.3.1">[RFC3411],
   SectionÂ 3.3.1</a>).










<span class="grey">DeSanti, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4625">RFC 4625</a>               FC Routing Information MIB         September 2006</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Switch%20Index"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Switch Index</span>

   The FC-MGMT-MIB [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of
   information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by Fibre
   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance
   can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,
   fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value
   that uniquely identifies a Fibre Channel switch among those (one or
   more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.%20%20Fabric%20Index"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Fabric Index</span>

   Whether operating on a physical Fabric (i.e., without Virtual
   Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the operation of FSPF within a
   Fabric is identical.  Therefore, this MIB defines all Fabric-related
   information in tables that are INDEX-ed by an arbitrary integer,
   named a "Fabric Index", the syntax of which is IMPORTed from the
   T11-TC-MIB.  When a device is connected to a single physical Fabric,
   without use of any virtual Fabrics, the value of this Fabric Index
   will always be 1.  In an environment of multiple virtual and/or
   physical Fabrics, this index provides a means to distinguish one
   Fabric from another.

   It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel
   switch will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical
   Fabrics.  Thus, in order to simplify a management protocol query
   concerning all the Fabrics to which a single switch is connected,
   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FcRouteFabricIndex when they
   both appear in the same INDEX clause.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.4.%20%20The%20t11FcRouteGroup%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" id="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  The t11FcRouteGroup Group</span>

   This MIB contains one object group, the t11FcRouteGroup, which
   contains objects to allow the displaying and the configuring of
   routes in the Fibre Channel Routing tables for the locally managed
   switches.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.5.%20%20The%20t11FcRouteTable%27s%20INDEX"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.5" id="section-5.5">5.5</a>.  The t11FcRouteTable's INDEX</span>

   It is normally valuable for a MIB table that contains routes to be
   ordered such that a management application is able to query the table
   based on some attribute, without having to read every row in the MIB
   table.  This requires that the rows in the table be ordered according
   to such attributes, and thus that those attributes be represented by
   objects included in the table's INDEX clause.  Examples of this can
   be seen in the ipCidrRouteTable [<a href="./rfc2096" title='"IP Forwarding Table MIB"'>RFC2096</a>] and, more recently, the
   inetCidrRouteTable in [<a href="./rfc4292" title='"IP Forwarding Table MIB"'>RFC4292</a>].

   While this useful feature results in an unusually large number (ten)
   of objects in the t11FcRouteTable's INDEX clause, all ten are either
   integers or strings of 3 (or zero) octet length, so the resulting
   OIDs are not unusually large.  (Specifically, the aggregate number of
   sub-identifiers to be appended to an OBJECT-TYPE's OID, when naming
   an instance of an object in the t11FcRouteTable, is at most 22 sub-
   identifiers; i.e., less than the *minimum* number to be appended for
   the inetCidrRouteTable table.)

           routes that are configured in and/or computed by any
           local switch for any Fabric.

           Such routes are used by a switch to forward frames (of user
           data) on a Fabric.  The conceptual process is based on
           extracting the Destination Fibre Channel Address Identifier
           (D_ID) out of a received frame (of user data) and comparing
           it to each entry of this table that is applicable to the
           given switch and Fabric.  Such comparison consists of first
           performing a logical-AND of the extracted D_ID with a mask
           (the value of t11FcRouteDestMask) and second comparing the
           result of that 'AND' operation to the value of
           t11FcRouteDestAddrId.  A similar comparison is made of the

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability are:

        t11FcRouteDomainId, t11FcRouteMetric, t11FcRouteType,
        t11FcRouteIfDown, t11FcRouteRowStatus
           -- configure new routes and/or modify existing routes.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  For example, the ability to change network
   topology or network speed may afford an attacker the ability to
   obtain better performance at the expense of other network users.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4625">RFC 4625</a>               FC Routing Information MIB         September 2006</span>


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  The objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability are: the write-able objects listed above
   plus one other:

        t11FcRouteLastChangeTime
           -- the time of the last routing table change.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="./rfc3410#section-8">[RFC3410], sectionÂ 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
