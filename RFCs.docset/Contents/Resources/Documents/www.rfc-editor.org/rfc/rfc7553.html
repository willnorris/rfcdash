<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7553">RFC 7553</a>                   URI Resource Record                 June 2015</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document explains the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) for
   the storage of URIs [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>] and how to resolve hostnames to such
   URIs that can be used by various applications using the URI resource
   record type.  For resolution, the application needs to know both the
   hostname and the protocol that the URI is to be used for.  The
   protocol is registered by IANA.

   Historically, uses of the DNS to map a domain name to a URL have
   relied on the Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) RRTYPEs [<a href="./rfc2915" title='"The Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) DNS Resource Record"'>RFC2915</a>] and
   then on the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) [<a href="./rfc3401" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS"'>RFC3401</a>]
   application framework with the DNS as a database as specified in <a href="./rfc3404">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3404">3404</a> [<a href="./rfc3404" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Four: The Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)"'>RFC3404</a>].  This has a number of implications such as the fact
   the RRSet returned will contain all URIs "connected" with the owner,
   and not only the ones related to a specific service.

   The URI resource record specified in this document enables the
   querying party to do the equivalent of selecting which of the NAPTR
   records one is interested in and have only those returned.  This is
   possible because data in the service field of the NAPTR record is
   included in the owner part of the URI resource record type.  It is
   also the case that as the URI resource record type includes the
   target URI directly as part of the RDATA, it is very easy to extract
   the correct target URI, instead of applying rewrite rules as in
   NAPTR.

   Querying for URI resource records is not replacing querying for NAPTR
   resource records (or use of S-NAPTR [<a href="./rfc3958" title='"Domain-Based Application Service Location Using SRV RRs and the Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS)"'>RFC3958</a>]).  Instead, the URI
   resource record type provides a complementary mechanism to be used
   when one already knows what service field is interesting.  With it,
   one can directly query for the specific subset of the otherwise
   possibly large RRSet returned when querying for NAPTR resource
   records.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Applicability%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Applicability Statement</span>

   In general, it is expected that URI records will be used by clients
   for applications where the relevant protocol to be used is known,
   but, for example, an extra abstraction is needed in order to separate
   a domain name from a point of service (as addressed by the URI).  One
   example of such a situation is when an organization has many domain
   names but only one official web page.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7553">RFC 7553</a>                   URI Resource Record                 June 2015</span>


   Applications need to know the specific service to prepend the
   hostname with.  Using repetitive queries for URI records is not a
   replacement for querying for NAPTR records according to the NAPTR
   (DDDS) or S-NAPTR algorithms.  NAPTR records serve the purpose of
   discovering the various services or the URIs (for looking up access
   points for a given service).  These are two very different kinds of
   needs.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20DNS%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  DNS Considerations</span>

   Using prefix labels, such as underscored service tags, for a specific
   owner name may cause a counter-intuitive effect when the owner name
   is a wildcard name.  For example, _s2._s1.*.example.net is not a
   wildcard name and cannot be used to return a synthesized answer for a
   query name of _s2._s1.a.example.net.  See <a href="./rfc4592#section-4.5">SectionÂ 4.5 of RFC 4592</a>
   [<a href="./rfc4592" title='"The Role of Wildcards in the Domain Name System"'>RFC4592</a>] for more details.  Besides, underscored service tags used
   for the URI RR (based on the "Service Name and Transport Protocol
   Port Number Registry") may have slightly different semantics than
   service tags used for underscored prefix labels that are used in
   combination with other (yet unspecified) RR types.  This may cause
   subtle management problems when delegation structure that has
   developed within the context of URI RRs is also to be used for other
   RR types.  Because the service labels might be overloaded,
   applications should carefully check that the application-level
   protocol is indeed the protocol they expect.

   Subtle management issues may also arise when the delegations from
   service to sub-service labels involve several parties and different
   stakeholders.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20Format%20of%20the%20URI%20RR"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The Format of the URI RR</span>

   This is the presentation format of the URI RR:

      Owner name TTL Class URI Priority Weight Target

   The URI RR does not cause any kind of Additional Section processing.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Owner%20Name%2C%20Class%2C%20and%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Owner Name, Class, and Type</span>

   The URI owner name is subject to special conventions.

   Just like the SRV RR [<a href="./rfc2782" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC2782</a>], the URI RR has service information
   encoded in its owner name.  In order to encode the service for a
   specific owner name, one uses service parameters.  Valid service
   parameters are those registered by IANA in the "Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" [<a href="./rfc6335" title='"Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry"'>RFC6335</a>] or as "Enumservice

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7553">RFC 7553</a>                   URI Resource Record                 June 2015</span>


   Registrations [<a href="./rfc6117" title='"IANA Registration of Enumservices: Guide, Template, and IANA Considerations"'>RFC6117</a>].  The Enumservice Registration parameters are
   reversed (i.e., subtype(s) before type), prepended with an underscore
   (_), and prepended to the owner name in separate labels.  The
   underscore is prepended to the service parameters to avoid collisions
   with DNS labels that occur in nature, and the order is reversed to
   make it possible to do delegations, if needed, to different zones
   (and therefore providers of DNS).

   For example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service with
   ENUM Service Parameter "A:B:C" for host example.com.  Then we would
   query for (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_C._B._A.example.com","URI").

   As another example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service
   with Service Name "A" and Transport Protocol "B" for host
   example.com.  Then we would query for
   (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_A._B.example.com","URI").

   The type number for the URI record is 256.

   The URI resource record is class independent.

   The URI RR has no special Time-to-Live (TTL) requirements.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Priority"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Priority</span>

   This field holds the priority of the target URI in this RR.  Its
   range is 0-65535.  A client MUST attempt to contact the URI with the
   lowest-numbered priority it can reach; URIs with the same priority
   SHOULD be selected according to probabilities defined by the weight
   field.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20Weight"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Weight</span>

   This field holds the server selection mechanism.  The weight field
   specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority.
   Larger weights SHOULD be given a proportionately higher probability
   of being selected.  The range of this number is 0-65535.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.4.%20%20Target"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" id="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Target</span>

   This field holds the URI of the target, enclosed in double-quote
   characters ('"'), where the URI is as specified in <a href="./rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>
   [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].  Resolution of the URI is according to the definitions for
   the Scheme of the URI.

   Since the URI will not be encoded as a &lt;character-string&gt; (see
   <a href="./rfc1035#section-3.3">SectionÂ 3.3 of RFC 1035</a> [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>]), there is no 255-character size
   limitation.

   The Target MUST NOT be an empty URI ("").

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.5.%20%20URI%20RDATA%20Wire%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" id="section-4.5">4.5</a>.  URI RDATA Wire Format</span>

   The RDATA for a URI RR consists of a 2-octet Priority field, a
   2-octet Weight field, and a variable-length Target field.

   Priority and Weight are unsigned integers in network byte order.

   The remaining data in the RDATA contains the Target field.  The
   Target field contains the URI as a sequence of octets (without the
   enclosing double-quote characters used in the presentation format).

   The length of the Target field MUST be greater than zero.

   The URI resource record type is not a replacement for the S-NAPTR.
   It is instead an extension and the second step of the S-NAPTR
   resolution can resolve a URI resource record instead of using SRV
   records and yet another algorithm for how to use SRV records for the
   specific protocol.

   $ORIGIN example.com.
   ;;                  order pref flags
              IN NAPTR 100   10   "D"   "EM:ProtA"  ( ; service
                       ""                             ; regexp
                       _http._tcp.example.com. )      ; replacement

   _http._tcp IN URI   10 1 "http://www.example.com/path"

   The URI resource record type, together with S-NAPTR, can be viewed as
   a replacement for U-NAPTR [<a href="./rfc4848" title='"Domain-Based Application Service Location Using URIs and the Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS)"'>RFC4848</a>].  The URI resource record type is
   only interesting when one know a base domain name, a protocol, and a
   service so that one can compose the record to look up.  NAPTR records
   of any kind are used to look up what services exist for a certain
   domain, which is one step before the URI resource record is used.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.4.%20%20Relation%20to%20SRV"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" id="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Relation to SRV</span>

   The URI resource record type can be viewed as a replacement for the
   SRV record.  This is because it, like the SRV record, can only be
   looked up if one knows the base domain, the protocol, and the
   service.  It has a similar functionality and uses the same registry
   for service names, but instead of returning a hostname and port
   number, the URI record returns a full URI.  As such, it can be viewed
   as a more powerful resource record than SRV.

   After an expert review in February 2011 (see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>), IANA
   allocated RRTYPE 256 for the URI resource record type in the registry
   named "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" (as defined in [<a href="#ref-BCP42" title='"Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations"'>BCP42</a>], which was
   <a href="./rfc6195">RFC 6195</a> at the time but has since been replaced by <a href="./rfc6895">RFC 6895</a>) located
   at &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters">http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters</a>&gt;.

   IANA has updated the reference for this registration to refer to this
   RFC.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20Registration%20of%20Services"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Registration of Services</span>

   No new registry is needed for the registration of services as the
   Service Name, Transport Protocol Port Numbers, Enumservices and the
   DNS SRV Service Type registries are also used for the URI resource
   record type.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Using the URI resource record together with security mechanisms that
   rely on verification of authentication of hostnames, like TLS, makes
   it important to choose the correct domain name when doing the
   comparison and ensure that the change in the hostname to be used is
   secured by DNSSEC so that it can be trusted in a similar way as a
   redirect in HTTP using TLS.

   If, for example, the URI resource record is not signed with the help
   of DNSSEC and then validated successfully, trusting the non-signed
   URI will effectively lead to a downgrade attack.

   The basic mechanism for successful use of URI works as follows:

   1.   Announce that example.com is hosted at example.org (with some
        URL) in DNS.

   2.   Secure the URI resource record with DNSSEC.  This is best done
        by doing validation in the application doing the lookup, but it
        could also be done in the local recursive resolver or in the
        trusted recursive resolver also doing validation.  All are
        according to the local trust policy.

   3.   Verify the TLS (for example) certificate for the connection to
        example.org matches, i.e., use the hostname in the URI and not
        the hostname used originally when looking up the URI resource
        record.

   4.   If needed, do application-layer authentication, etc., over the
        then encrypted connection.

   It is also possible that the URI in the resource record type has
   errors in it.  Applications using the URI resource record type for
   resolution should behave similarly as if the user typed (or copied
   and pasted) the URI.  At least it must be clear to the user that the
   error is not due to any error from his side.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20The%20Original%20RRTYPE%20Allocation%20Request"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  The Original RRTYPE Allocation Request</span>

   On February 22, 2011 IANA assigned RRTYPE 256 for the URI resource
   record based on a request that followed the procedure documented in
   [<a href="#ref-BCP42" title='"Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations"'>BCP42</a>] (which was <a href="./rfc6195">RFC 6195</a> at the time but has since been replaced
   by <a href="./rfc6895">RFC 6895</a>).  The DNS RRTYPE PARAMETER ALLOCATION form as submitted
   to IANA at that time is replicated below for reference.

   Note: Although "ownername" should be "owner name", "ownername" has
   been preserved below because it was part of the original request form
   submitted to IANA.

   A.   Submission Date:

        May 23, 2009

   B.   Submission Type:

        [<a id="ref-X">X</a>] New RRTYPE
        [ ] Modification to existing RRTYPE

        Other contact handles:
        (Note: This information will be publicly posted.)

   D.   Motivation for the new RRTYPE application?

        There is no easy way to get from a domain name to a URI.  Some
        mechanisms exists via use of the NAPTR [<a href="./rfc3403" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database"'>RFC3403</a>] resource
        record.  That implies quite complicated rules that are
        simplified via the S-NAPTR [<a href="./rfc3958" title='"Domain-Based Application Service Location Using SRV RRs and the Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS)"'>RFC3958</a>] specification.  But, the
        ability to directly look up a URI still exists.  This
        specification uses a prefix based naming mechanism originated in
        the definition of the SRV [<a href="./rfc2782" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC2782</a>] resource record, and the
        RDATA is a URI, encoded as one text field.

        See also above (<a href="#section-1">Section 1</a>).

   E.   Description of the proposed RR type.

        The format of the URI resource record is as follows:

        Ownername TTL Class URI Priority Weight Target

        The URI RR has service information encoded in its ownername.  In
        order to encode the service for a specific ownername one uses
        service parameters.  Valid service parameters used are either
        Enumservice Registrations registered by IANA, or prefixes used
        for the SRV resource record.

        The wire format of the RDATA is as follows:

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |          Priority             |          Weight               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      /                                                               /
      /                             Target                            /
      /                                                               /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   F.   What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that
        need and why are they unsatisfactory?

        The RRTYPE that come closest is the NAPTR resource record.  It
        is for example used in the DDDS and S-NAPTR algorithms.  The
        main problem with the NAPTR is that selection of what record (or
        records) one is interested in is based on data stored in the
        RDATA portion of the NAPTR resource record.  This, as explained
        in <a href="./rfc5507">RFC 5507</a> [<a href="./rfc5507" title='"Design Choices When Expanding the DNS"'>RFC5507</a>], is not optimal for DNS lookups.  Further,
        most applications using NAPTR resource records uses regular
        expression based rewrite rules for creation of the URI, and that
        has shown be complicated to implement.

        The second closest RRTYPE is the SRV record that given a
        prefixed based naming just like is suggested for the URI
        resource record, one get back a port number and domain name.
        This can also be used for creation of a URI, but, only URIs
        without path components.

   G.   What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

        URI

   H.   Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA Registry
        or require the creation of a new IANA sub-registry in DNS
        Parameters?

        Yes, partially.

        One of the mechanisms to select a service is to use the
        Enumservice Registry managed by IANA.  Another is to use
        services and protocols used for SRV records.

   I.   Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS servers/
        resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed as an
        unknown RRTYPE (see [<a href="./rfc3597" title='"Handling of Unknown DNS Resource Record (RR) Types"'>RFC3597</a>])?

        No
