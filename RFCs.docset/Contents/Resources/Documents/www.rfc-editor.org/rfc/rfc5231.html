<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5231">RFC 5231</a>              Sieve: Relational Extension           January 2008</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The RELATIONAL extension to the Sieve mail filtering language [<a href="#ref-Sieve" title='"Sieve: An Email Filtering Language"'>Sieve</a>]
   provides relational operators on the address, envelope, and header
   tests.  This extension also provides a way of counting the entities
   in a message header or address field.

   With this extension, the Sieve script may now determine if a field is
   greater than or less than a value instead of just equivalent.  One
   use is for the x-priority field: move messages with a priority
   greater than 3 to the "work on later" folder.  Mail could also be
   sorted by the from address.  Those userids that start with 'a'-'m' go
   to one folder, and the rest go to another folder.

   The Sieve script can also determine the number of fields in the
   header, or the number of addresses in a recipient field, for example,
   whether there are more than 5 addresses in the to and cc fields.

   The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
   document is "relational".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Conventions%20Used%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.

   Conventions for notations are as in [<a href="#ref-Sieve" title='"Sieve: An Email Filtering Language"'>Sieve</a>] <a href="#section-1.1">section 1.1</a>, including
   the use of [<a href="#ref-Kwds" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>Kwds</a>] and the use of [<a href="#ref-ABNF" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>ABNF</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Comparators"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Comparators</span>

   This document does not define any comparators or exempt any
   comparators from the require clause.  Any comparator used must be
   treated as defined in [<a href="#ref-Sieve" title='"Sieve: An Email Filtering Language"'>Sieve</a>].

   The "i;ascii-numeric" comparator, as defined in [<a href="./rfc4790" title='"Internet Application Protocol Collation Registry"'>RFC4790</a>], MUST be
   supported for any implementation of this extension.  The comparator
   "i;ascii-numeric" MUST support at least 32-bit unsigned integers.

   Larger integers MAY be supported.  Note: the "i;ascii-numeric"
   comparator does not support negative numbers.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5231">RFC 5231</a>              Sieve: Relational Extension           January 2008</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Match%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Match Types</span>

   This document defines two new match types.  They are the VALUE match
   type and the COUNT match type.

   The syntax is:

   MATCH-TYPE =/ COUNT / VALUE

   COUNT = ":count" relational-match

   VALUE = ":value" relational-match

   relational-match = DQUOTE
           ("gt" / "ge" / "lt" / "le" / "eq" / "ne") DQUOTE
           ; "gt" means "greater than", the C operator "&gt;".
           ; "ge" means "greater than or equal", the C operator "&gt;=".
           ; "lt" means "less than", the C operator "&lt;".
           ; "le" means "less than or equal", the C operator "&lt;=".
           ; "eq" means "equal to", the C operator "==".
           ; "ne" means "not equal to", the C operator "!=".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Match%20Type%20VALUE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Match Type VALUE</span>

   The VALUE match type does a relational comparison between strings.

   The VALUE match type may be used with any comparator that returns
   sort information.

   A value from the message is considered the left side of the relation.
   A value from the test expression, the key-list for address, envelope,
   and header tests, is the right side of the relation.

   If there are multiple values on either side or both sides, the test
   is considered true if any pair is true.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Match%20Type%20COUNT"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Match Type COUNT</span>

   The COUNT match type first determines the number of the specified
   entities in the message and does a relational comparison of the
   number of entities, as defined below, to the values specified in the
   test expression.

   The COUNT match type SHOULD only be used with numeric comparators.

   The Address Test counts the number of addresses (the number of
   "mailbox" elements, as defined in [<a href="./rfc2822" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC2822</a>]) in the specified fields.
   Group names are ignored, but the contained mailboxes are counted.



<span class="grey">Segmuller &amp; Leiba           Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5231">RFC 5231</a>              Sieve: Relational Extension           January 2008</span>


   The Envelope Test counts the number of addresses in the specified
   envelope parts.  The envelope "to" will always have only one entry,
   which is the address of the user for whom the Sieve script is
   running.  Using this test, there is no way a Sieve script can
   determine if the message was actually sent to someone else.  The
   envelope "from" will be 0 if the MAIL FROM is empty, or 1 if MAIL
   FROM is not empty.

   The Header Test counts the total number of instances of the specified
   fields.  This does not count individual addresses in the "to", "cc",
   and other recipient fields.

   In all cases, if more than one field name is specified, the counts
   for all specified fields are added together to obtain the number for
   comparison.  Thus, specifying ["to", "cc"] in an address COUNT test
   compares the total number of "to" and "cc" addresses; if separate
   counts are desired, they must be done in two comparisons, perhaps
   joined by "allof" or "anyof".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Interaction%20with%20Other%20Sieve%20Actions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Interaction with Other Sieve Actions</span>

   This specification adds two match types.  The VALUE match type only
   works with comparators that return sort information.  The COUNT match
   type only makes sense with numeric comparators.

   There is no interaction with any other Sieve operations, nor with any
   known extensions.  In particular, this specification has no effect on
   implicit KEEP, nor on any explicit message actions.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Example</span>

   Using the message:

      received: ...
      received: ...
      subject: example
      to: foo@example.com, baz@example.com
      cc: qux@example.com

   The test:

      address :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                      ["to", "cc"] ["3"]

   would evaluate to true, and the test

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5231">RFC 5231</a>              Sieve: Relational Extension           January 2008</span>


      anyof ( address :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                      ["to"] ["3"],
              address :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                      ["cc"] ["3"] )

   would evaluate to false.

   To check the number of received fields in the header, the following
   test may be used:

      header :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                      ["received"] ["3"]

   This would evaluate to false.  But

      header :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                      ["received", "subject"] ["3"]

   would evaluate to true.

   The test:

      header :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                      ["to", "cc"] ["3"]

   will always evaluate to false on an <a href="./rfc2822">RFC 2822</a> compliant message
   [<a href="./rfc2822" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC2822</a>], since a message can have at most one "to" field and at
   most one "cc" field.  This test counts the number of fields, not the
   number of addresses.

   o  Added definition comments to ABNF for "gt", "lt", etc.

   o  Clarified what <a href="./rfc2822">RFC 2822</a> elements are counted in the COUNT test.

   o  Removed the requirement to strip white space from header fields
      before comparing; a more general version of this requirement has
      been added to the Sieve base spec.
