Abstract

   Graceful OSPF Restart, as specified in <a href="./rfc3623">RFC 3623</a>, provides a mechanism
   whereby an OSPF router can stay on the forwarding path even as its
   OSPF software is restarted.  This document provides an implementation
   report for this extension to the base OSPF protocol.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Overview</span>

   Today, many Internet routers implement a separation of control and
   forwarding functions.  Certain processors are dedicated to control
   and management tasks such as OSPF routing, while other processors
   perform the data forwarding tasks.  This separation creates the
   possibility of maintaining a router's data forwarding capability
   while the router's control software is restarted/reloaded.  For the
   OSPF protocol [<a href="#ref-OSPF" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>OSPF</a>], the protocol mechanisms necessary to accomplish
   this are described in Graceful OSPF Restart [<a href="#ref-GRACE" title='"Graceful OSPF Restart"'>GRACE</a>].

   This document satisfies the <a href="./rfc1264">RFC 1264</a> [<a href="#ref-CRITERIA" title='"Internet Engineering Task Force Internet Routing Protocol Standardization Criteria"'>CRITERIA</a>] requirement for a
   report on implementation experience for Graceful OSPF Restart.
   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document contains the results of an implementation
   survey.  It also documents implementation differences between the
   vendors responding to the survey.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> contains a MIB
   reference.  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> provide an authentication reference.  <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>
   simply refers to the implementations listed in <a href="#section-2">section 2</a>.  <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>
   includes a minimal set of test scenarios.  Finally, <a href="#section-7">section 7</a>
   includes a disclaimer with respect to operational experience.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Implementation%20Experience"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Implementation Experience</span>

   Eleven vendors have implemented graceful OSPF and have completed the
   implementation survey.  These include Redback, Juniper, Motorola
   Computer Group (formerly Netplane Systems), Mahi Networks, Nexthop
   technologies, Force10 Networks, Procket, Alcatel, Laurel Networks,
   DCL (Data Connection Limited), and Ericsson.  All have implemented
   restart from the perspective of both a restarting and helper router.
   All but one vendor implemented both planned and unplanned restart.
   All implementations are original.  Seven successfully tested
   interoperability with Juniper.  Juniper successfully tested
   interoperability with Force10 Networks.  One vendor tested with John
   Moy's GNU Public License implementation [<a href="#ref-OSPFD" title='"OSPF Complete Implementation"'>OSPFD</a>].  Two vendors had not
   tested interoperability at the time of the survey.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Implementation%20Differences"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Implementation Differences</span>

   The first difference was whether strict LSA checking was implemented
   and, if so, whether it was configurable.  In the context of graceful
   OSPF restart, strict LSA checking indicates whether a changed LSA
   will result in the termination of graceful restart by a helping
   router.  Four vendors made it configurable (three defaulted it to
   enabled and one to disabled), another made it a compile option
   (shipping with strict LSA checking disabled), another didn't
   implement it at all, and five implemented strict LSA checking with no
   configuration option to disable it.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4167">RFC 4167</a>      Graceful OSPF Restart Implementation Report   October 2005</span>


   The second was whether a received grace LSA would be taken to apply
   only to the adjacency on which it was received or to all adjacencies
   with the restarting router.  This is a rather subtle difference since
   it only applies to helping and restarting routers with more than one
   full adjacency at the time of restart.  Eight vendors implemented the
   option of the received grace LSA only applying to the adjacency on
   which it was received.  Three vendors applied the grace LSA to all
   adjacencies with the grace LSA originator (i.e., the restarting
   router).

   The final difference was in whether additional extensions were
   implemented to accommodate other features such as protocol
   redistribution or interaction with MPLS VPNs [<a href="#ref-VPN" title='"BGP/MPLS IP VPNs"'>VPN</a>].  Five vendors
   implemented extensions and six did not.  It should be noted that such
   extensions are beyond the scope of Graceful OSPF Restart [<a href="#ref-GRACE" title='"Graceful OSPF Restart"'>GRACE</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20MIB%20Reference"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  MIB Reference</span>

   MIB objects for the Graceful OSPF Restart have been added to the OSPF
   Version 2 Management Information Base [<a href="#ref-OSPFMIB" title='"OSPF Version 2 Management Information Base"'>OSPFMIB</a>].  Additions include:

   -  Objects ospfRestartSupport, ospfRestartInterval, ospfRestartAge,
      ospfRestartExitReason, and ospfRestartStrictLsaChecking to
      ospfGeneralGroup.

   -  Objects ospfNbrRestartHelperStatus, ospfNbrRestartHelperAge, and
      ospfNbrRestartHelperExitReason to ospfNbrEntry.

   -  Objects ospfVirtNbrRestartHelperStatus,
      ospfVirtNbrRestartHelperAge, and
      ospfVirtNbrRestartHelperExitReason to ospfVirtNbrEntry.

   The authentication mechanisms are the same as those implemented by
   the base OSPF protocol [<a href="#ref-OSPF" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>OSPF</a>].

   A router implementing graceful restart should test, at a minimum, the
   following scenarios as both a restarting and helping router.  For all
   scenarios, monitoring data plane traffic may be used to ensure that
   the restart is non-disruptive:

   1. Operation over a broadcast network.

   2. Operation over a P2P network.

   3. Operation over a virtual link.

   4. Operation using OSPF MD5 authentication.

   5. Early graceful restart termination when an LSA inconsistency is
      detected.

   6. Early graceful restart termination when a flooded LSA changes (if
      implemented).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Operational%20Experience"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Operational Experience</span>

   Since OSPF graceful restart is configurable, it is difficult to gage
   operational experience at this juncture.  However, multiple service
   providers have tested and evaluated it.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document does not discuss implementation and interoperability
   aspects of the security mechanisms in great detail, as no new
   security mechanisms are introduced with Graceful OSPF Restart.
   Security considerations for the OSPF protocol are included in <a href="./rfc2328">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2328">2328</a> [<a href="#ref-OSPF" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>OSPF</a>].  Security considerations for Graceful OSPF Restart are
   included in [<a href="#ref-GRACE" title='"Graceful OSPF Restart"'>GRACE</a>].
