   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20General%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  General Overview</span>

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4936">RFC 4936</a>                   FC Zone Server MIB                August 2007</span>


   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an
   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally unique names.  These globally unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [<a href="#ref-FC-FS" title='"Fibre Channel - Framing and Signaling (FC-FS)"'>FC-FS</a>].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify
   the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has both an
   address identifier and a WWN.  For an Nx_Port, its WWN is called a
   N_Port_Name and its address identifier is called an N_Port_ID.  When
   a Fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are
   assigned by a switch.  Each octet of a 24-bit address represents a
   level in an address hierarchy, with a Domain_ID being the highest
   level of the hierarchy.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Zoning"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Zoning</span>

   Zones within a Fabric provide a mechanism to control frame delivery
   between Nx_Ports ("Hard Zoning") or to expose selected views of Name
   Server information ("Soft Zoning").

   Communication is only possible when the communicating endpoints are
   members of a common zone.  This technique is similar to virtual
   private networks in that the Fabric has the ability to group devices
   into Zones.

   Hard zoning and soft zoning are two different means of realizing
   this.  Hard zoning is enforced in the Fabric (i.e., switches) whereas
   soft zoning is enforced at the endpoints (e.g., host bus adapters
   (HBAs)) by relying on the endpoints to not send traffic to an
   N_Port_ID not obtained from the Name Server with a few exceptions for
   well-known N_Port_IDs used to bootstrap the Fabric (e.g., talk to the
   Name Server).

   Administrators create Zones to increase network security and to
   prevent data loss or corruption by controlling access between devices
   or user groups.  Zones may be specifically used to create:

      a) Barriers between devices that use different operating systems.
         It is often critical to separate servers and storage devices
         with different operating systems because accidental transfer of
         information from one to another may delete or corrupt data;

      b) Logical subsets of closed user groups.  Administrators may
         authorize access rights to specific Zones for specific user
         groups, thereby protecting confidential data from unauthorized
         access;

      c) Groups of devices that are separate from devices in the rest of
         a Fabric.  Zones allow certain processes to be performed on
         devices in a group without interrupting devices in other
         groups; or

      d) Temporary access between devices for specific purposes.
         Administrators may remove Zone restrictions temporarily, then
         restore Zone restrictions to perform normal processes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Zoning%20Configuration%20and%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Zoning Configuration and Management</span>

   Zones are configured via a Fabric Zone Server, using requests defined
   in [<a href="#ref-FC-GS-5" title='"Fibre Channel - Generic Services - 5 (FC-GS-5)"'>FC-GS-5</a>]), or via the T11-FC-ZONE-SERVER-MIB module defined in
   this memo, or via some other mechanism.

   An Nx_Port may be a member of one or more Zones.  Zone membership may
   be specified by:

      a) The N_Port_Name of the Nx_Port connected to the switch;
      b) The N_Port_ID assigned during Fabric Login;
      c) The Node_Name associated with the Nx_Port; note that the
         Node_Name may include more than one Nx_Port;
      d) The F_Port_Name of the Fx_Port to which the Nx_Port is
         connected; or
      e) The domain identifier (Domain_ID) and physical port number of
         the Switch Port to which the Nx_Port is attached.

   A Fabric's Zone Server may be used to create a Zone by specifying the
   Zone Members.  One or more Zones may be collected into a Zone Set,
   and a Zone may be a member of more than one Zone Set.  A Zone Set
   creates a collection of Zones that may be activated or deactivated as
   a single entity across all Switches in a Fabric (e.g., having two
   Zone Sets, one for normal operation, and a second for backup during
   off-hours).  Only one Zone Set may be activated at one time.

   Other terminology defined in [<a href="#ref-FC-GS-5" title='"Fibre Channel - Generic Services - 5 (FC-GS-5)"'>FC-GS-5</a>] is:  an Active Zone Set is the
   Zone Set currently enforced by a Fabric; a Zone Set Database is a
   database of the Zone Sets available to be activated within a Fabric;



<span class="grey">DeSanti, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4936">RFC 4936</a>                   FC Zone Server MIB                August 2007</span>


   and a Zoning Database is a generic term used to indicate a
   combination of an Active Zone Set and a Zone Set Database.

   Two distinct sets of management requests, Enhanced and Basic, are
   defined in [<a href="#ref-FC-GS-5" title='"Fibre Channel - Generic Services - 5 (FC-GS-5)"'>FC-GS-5</a>] to interact with a Fabric Zone Server.  Basic
   Zoning provides compatibility with [<a href="#ref-FC-GS-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Generic Services - 4 (FC-GS-4)"'>FC-GS-4</a>] and earlier versions of
   Fibre Channel's Generic Services specification.  If all the Switches
   in a Fabric support the Enhanced request set, then it may be used to
   manage zoning; otherwise, only the Basic request set may be used, in
   order to support backward compatibility.

   In the context of Enhanced Zoning Management, a management action
   (i.e., write access to the Zoning Database) to the Zone Server can
   only occur inside a server session.  A server session is set up using
   the FC-GS-5's Common Transport (CT) protocol defined in [<a href="#ref-FC-GS-5" title='"Fibre Channel - Generic Services - 5 (FC-GS-5)"'>FC-GS-5</a>].  A
   server session is delimited by CT protocol requests, Server Session
   Begin (SSB) and Server Session End (SSE), which are directed to the
   Management Service and which have the GS_Subtype specifying the Zone
   Server.  Query requests that result in read access to the Zoning
   Database are not required to be issued inside a server session,
   although the information returned is not guaranteed to be consistent
   when supplied outside of a server session.

   When setting up a server session for Enhanced Zoning, the Zone Server
   is required to lock the Fabric.  This ensures serialized management
   access to the Zoning Database and guarantees a deterministic
   behavior.  The switch that receives the SSB request is called the
   'managing' switch, and it tries to lock the Fabric using the Fabric
   Management Session Protocol (see section 10.6 of [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>]) by
   sending an Acquire Change Authorization (ACA) request to all other
   switches in the Fabric.  If any switch(es) respond with an SW_RJT
   indicating failure, then the attempt to lock the Fabric fails and the
   SSB request is rejected.  If all the other switches respond with an
   SW_ACC indicating success, then the Fabric is locked and the server
   session can be established.  The subsequent SSE request causes a
   Release Change Authorization (RCA) request to all other switches, and
   thus, the Fabric to be unlocked.

   For at least one application other than Zoning, the managing switch
   uses a different type of request to lock the Fabric, i.e., it sends
   an Enhanced Acquire Change Authorization (EACA) request to all other
   switches in the Fabric.  An EACA reserves local resources associated
   with a designated application to ensure the consistency of that
   application's data.  The application is identified in the EACA using
   an Application_ID (see Table 116 in [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>]).  A lock that was
   established via an EACA is released using an Enhanced Release Change
   Authorization (ERCA) request.

   Changes requested in a Zoning Database by Enhanced Zoning commands
   persist after the end of the Zoning (server) session only if the
   commands are followed, within the same server session, by a Commit
   Zone Changes (CMIT) request.  On receipt of a CMIT request, the Zone
   Server checks that the Zoning Database as modified by the outstanding
   changes will pass the applicable consistency checks, and then
   distributes it to all other switches in the Fabric using a Stage
   Fabric Configuration Update (SFC) request.  If all other switches
   accept the SFC request, then the "managing" switch sends an Update
   Fabric Configuration (UFC) Request to each other switch, and the
   staged Zoning Database thereby becomes the Fabric's (active) Zoning
   Database.

   The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple
   Fabric Switch elements is [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>].  [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>] carries forward the
   earlier specification for the operation of a single Fabric in a
   physical infrastructure, and augments it with the definition of
   Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how multiple Virtual
   Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.
   The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in
   its header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that
   frame is being transmitted on.  All frames entering a particular
   "Core Switch" [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>] (i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual
   Fabric are processed by the same "Virtual Switch" within that Core
   switch.

   The Fibre Channel Management MIB [<a href="./rfc4044" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>RFC4044</a>] defines basic information
   for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to the
   standard IF-MIB [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>] for Fibre Channel interfaces.

   This MIB extends beyond [<a href="./rfc4044" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>RFC4044</a>] to cover the management of Fibre
   Channel Zoning Servers, both for Basic Zoning Management and for
   Enhanced Zoning Management, as defined in the FC-GS-5 specification.

   This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions from T11-TC-MIB,
   defined in [<a href="./rfc4439" title='"Fibre-Channel Fabric Address Manager MIB"'>RFC4439</a>].  It also imports a TC from T11-FC-NAME-SERVER-
   MIB, defined in [<a href="./rfc4438" title='"Fibre-Channel Name Server MIB"'>RFC4438</a>], plus InetAddressType and InetAddress from
   INET-ADDRESS-MIB [<a href="./rfc4001" title='"Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses"'>RFC4001</a>].  It also includes a reference to
   snmpCommunitySecurityName defined in [<a href="./rfc3584" title='"Coexistence between Version 1, Version 2, and Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC3584</a>].

   This document defines two MIB modules: T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB and
   T11-FC-ZONE-SERVER-MIB.

   T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB supports FC-GS-5's generic capability of
   locking the Fabric for a particular "application" such as (the
   management of) Enhanced Zoning.  The MIB contains one table in which
   each entry represents a particular switch being the 'managing' switch
   of a particular application's Fabric lock.

   T11-FC-ZONE-SERVER-MIB is specific to the operation of Zone Servers,
   which can operate in Basic mode or in Enhanced mode.  This MIB module
   imports the T11NsGs4RejectReasonCode textual convention defined in
   T11-FC-NAME-SERVER-MIB [<a href="./rfc4438" title='"Fibre-Channel Name Server MIB"'>RFC4438</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Fibre%20Channel%20Management%20Instance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Fibre Channel Management Instance</span>

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [<a href="./rfc4044" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>RFC4044</a>] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [<a href="./rfc2741" title='"Agent Extensibility (AgentX) Protocol Version 1"'>RFC2741</a>] sub-agents, with
   each sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management
   instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [<a href="./rfc4044" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>RFC4044</a>] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel
   management instance, for example, within the same SNMP context
   (<a href="./rfc3411#section-3.3.1">[RFC3411], section 3.3.1</a>).

   The FC-MGMT-MIB [<a href="./rfc4044" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>RFC4044</a>] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of
   information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by Fibre
   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance
   can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,
   fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value
   to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or
   more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.

   Whether operating on a physical Fabric (i.e., without Virtual
   Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the operation of a Zone Server
   within a Fabric is identical.  Therefore, this MIB defines all
   Fabric-related information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary

   integer, named a "Fabric Index", having the syntax, T11FabricIndex,
   which is IMPORTed from the T11-TC-MIB [<a href="./rfc4439" title='"Fibre-Channel Fabric Address Manager MIB"'>RFC4439</a>].  When a device is
   connected to a single physical Fabric, without use of any Virtual
   Fabrics, the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.  In an
   environment of multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics, this index
   provides a means to distinguish one Fabric from another.

   It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel
   switch will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical
   Fabrics.  Thus, in order to simplify a management protocol query
   concerning all the Fabrics to which a single switch is connected,
   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before an object with FabricIndex as
   its syntax when both appear in the same INDEX clause.

   The T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB module provides for the management of
   locks on a Fibre Channel Fabric.  A Fibre Channel Fabric lock is used
   to ensure serialized access to some types of management data related
   to a Fabric, e.g., the Fabric's Zoning Database.

   Some (managing) applications obtain a lock by initiating server
   sessions and the Fabric is locked so as to reserve local resources in
   each Switch.  For this usage, the managing switch sends an Acquire
   Change Authorization (ACA) request to other switches in order to lock
   the Fabric.

   For some other applications, a managing switch locks the Fabric using
   an Enhanced Acquire Change Authorization (EACA) request, which
   identifies the application on whose behalf the Fabric is being locked
   with an Application_ID.  In this case, only local resources
   associated with the designated application are reserved.

   Locks established via ACAs and via EACAs are both represented in the
   t11FLockTable in the T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB.  The Application_ID
   provided by the EACA serves to distinguish between multiple
   concurrent locks established by EACAs.  In order to use this same
   mechanism to distinguish a lock established via an ACA from each of
   those established via EACAs, an additional (special) value of
   Application_ID has been assigned [<a href="#ref-APPL-ID" title='"FC-SW-5 Letter to T11.5"'>APPL-ID</a>] for use by this MIB
   module.  Specifically, this newly assigned value will never be used
   to indicate an Application locked by an EACA, and therefore this MIB
   module uses it to uniquely distinguish a lock established via an ACA.
   In other words, with this additional assignment, an Application_ID
   value can be used to uniquely identify any active lock amongst all
   those established (on the same Fabric) either by an EACA or an ACA.

   The t11ZsServerOperationMode object indicates whether a Fabric's Zone
   Server is operating in Basic mode or Enhanced mode.  These two modes
   have a sufficient amount of commonality to make it worthwhile to have
   one set of MIB objects that are used for the subset of functionality
   that is common to both modes.  To accommodate the differences,
   additional MIB objects are defined.

   For Enhanced mode, the additional objects are defined in a group,
   t11ZsEnhancedModeGroup, which is only required to be implemented in a
   Zone Server capable of supporting Enhanced mode.  The objects
   specific to Basic mode are always (even in Enhanced mode) expected to
   be implemented, but when in Enhanced mode, their values are either
   restricted or do not affect current operations, e.g.,

    - an example of "restricted" is:  the distribution of updates to the
      Zone Server database throughout the Fabric has to be requested
      explicitly in Basic mode; this functionality is provided in the
      MIB by the t11ZsServerDistribute object.  In contrast, in Enhanced
      mode, the distribution is an implicit part of the commit function
      which is initiated using the t11ZsServerCommit object.  Thus, when
      operating in Enhanced mode, t11ZsServerDistribute has a fixed
      value, and when operating in Basic mode, t11ZsServerCommit has a
      fixed value.

    - an example of "do not affect current operations" is:
      t11ZsServerHardZoning, which specifies whether a switch enforces
      hard Zoning on a Fabric when in Basic mode.  This object is
      instantiated and could even be modified while in Enhanced mode,
      but its value only takes effect when in Basic mode.  (Note that in
      Enhanced mode, t11ZsActiveZoneHardZoning specifies whether hard
      Zoning is enabled on a particular Zone.)

   A Zone Server Database for a given Fabric consists of the combination
   of many of the tables defined in this MIB module.  In order to ensure
   that such a Database is consistent, this MIB module defines just one
   object (t11ZsServerDatabaseStorageType) with a syntax of StorageType,
   whose value for a given Fabric is defined to be applicable to all of
   that Fabric's Zone Server Database as defined in all the tables in
   this MIB module.

   As described in FC-GS-5 [<a href="#ref-FC-GS-5" title='"Fibre Channel - Generic Services - 5 (FC-GS-5)"'>FC-GS-5</a>], one of the Zone Sets in the Zone
   Set Database can be activated to become the Active Zone Set, i.e.,
   the one which is enforced on the Fabric.  Get/Add/Remove-type
   requests are defined in FC-GS-5 to allow access to the Zone Set
   Database.  When the Zone Set Database is modified, such modifications
   don't affect the Active Zone Set unless and until a subsequent
   activation.  Interaction directly with the Active Zone Set is also
   possible via the FC-GS-5 requests: 'Activate Direct' and 'Get Active
   Zone Set'.  This is illustrated in the following rendition of Figure
   15 of [<a href="#ref-FC-GS-5" title='"Fibre Channel - Generic Services - 5 (FC-GS-5)"'>FC-GS-5</a>]:

   The T11-FC-ZONE-SERVER-MIB module, defined in <a href="#section-7">section 7</a>, models the
   above structure by having one set of MIB tables for the Zone Set
   Database and a separate set for the Active Zone Set, specifically:

    - seven tables for the Zone Set Database:  t11ZsSetTable,
      t11ZsZoneTable, t11ZsSetZoneTable, t11ZsAliasTable,
      t11ZsZoneMemberTable, t11ZsAttribBlockTable and t11ZsAttribTable.

    - four tables for the Active Zone Set:  t11ZsActiveTable,
      t11ZsActiveZoneTable, t11ZsActiveZoneMemberTable and
      t11ZsActiveAttribTable.

   When defining SNMP notifications for events that occur in the data-
   plane, the maximum frequency of their generation needs to be
   considered.  Unless there is some limiting factor, such notifications
   need to be flow-controlled in some way, e.g., defined such that after
   some maximum number have occurred within a specified time interval,
   further notifications are suppressed for some subsequent time
   interval.  However, as and when such a suppression occurs, the
   Network Management System (NMS) that didn't receive the notifications
   (because they were suppressed) needs an indication of how many were
   suppressed.  Therefore, an additional Counter32 object needs to be
   defined, and/or a new type of notification needs to be defined for
   use at the end of the interval.  While this is extra complexity, it
   is necessary for notifications that need to be flow-controlled.

   In contrast, for notifications such as all those defined in this MIB
   module, which are generated due to control-plane events (and are not
   able to start a chain reaction):

   - estimating the maximum number that could be generated per unit time
     for each type of notification is too simplistic.  For example, it's
     unreasonable to ask how many of the t11ZsDefZoneChangeNotify
     notifications can be generated in a time interval because it
     depends on several factors: how many operators can be re-
     configuring the network at the same time? and how frequently can
     each of them change the Default Zone Setting?

   - the extra complexity of flow-controlling these types of
     notifications is not warranted.

    DESCRIPTION
           "The MIB module for the management of locks on a Fibre
           Channel Fabric.  A Fibre Channel Fabric lock is used to
           ensure serialized access to some types of management data
           related to a Fabric, e.g., the Fabric's Zoning Database.

           Some (managing) applications generate Fabric locks by
           initiating server sessions.  Server sessions are
           defined generically in FC-GS-5 to represent a collection of
           one or more requests to the session's server, e.g., to the
           Zone Server.  Such a session is started by a Server Session
           Begin (SSB) request, and terminated by a Server Session End
           (SSE) request.  The switch receiving the SSB is called the
           'managing' switch.  Some applications require the
           'managing' switch to lock the Fabric for the particular
           application, e.g., for Enhanced Zoning, before it can
           respond successfully to the SSB.  On receipt of the
           subsequent SSE, the lock is released.  For this usage, the
           managing switch sends an Acquire Change Authorization (ACA)
           request to other switches to lock the Fabric.

           For some other applications, a managing switch locks the
           Fabric using an Enhanced Acquire Change Authorization (EACA)
           request, which identifies the application on whose behalf
           the Fabric is being locked with an Application_ID.

           Fabric locks can also be requested more directly, e.g.,
           through the use of this MIB.  In these situations, the term
           'managing' switch is used to indicate the switch that
           receives such a request and executes it by issuing either
           ACA or EACA requests to other switches in the Fabric.

           This MIB module defines information about the 'managing'
           switch for currently-active Fabric locks.

           Server sessions for several different types of servers
           are defined in FC-GS-5.  The behavior of a server with

           respect to commands received within a server session is
           specified for each type of server.  For some types,
           parameter changes can only be made within the context of a
           session, and the setting up of a session requires that the
           Fabric be locked.  A Fabric is locked by one switch, called
           the 'managing' switch, sending Acquire Change Authorization
           (ACA) requests to all other switches in the Fabric.

           For other applications, a Fabric lock is established by the
           'managing' switch sending Enhanced Acquire Change
           Authorization (EACA) requests to other switches in the
           Fabric.  Each EACA request includes an Application_ID
           value to identify the application requesting the lock.

           For the benefit of this MIB module, a distinct value of
           Application_ID has also been assigned/reserved (see
           ANSI INCITS T11/06-679v0, titled 'FC-SW-5 Letter to
           T11.5') as a means of distinguishing locks established via
           Acquire Change Authorization (ACA) requests.  This
           additional assignment allows an Application_ID to be used to
           uniquely identify any active lock amongst all those
           established by either an EACA or an ACA.

           Whenever a Fabric is locked, by the sending of either an ACA
           or an EACA, a row gets created in the representation of this
           table for the 'managing' switch.

           In order to process SNMP SetRequests that make parameter
           changes for the relevant types of servers (e.g., to the
           Zoning Database), the SNMP agent must get serialized access
           to the Fabric (for the relevant type of management data),
           i.e., the Fabric must be locked by creating an entry in
           this table via an SNMP SetRequest.  Creating an entry in
           this table via an SNMP SetRequest causes an ACA or an EACA
           to be sent to all other switches in the Fabric.  The value
           of t11FLockApplicationID for such an entry determines
           whether an ACA or an EACA is sent.

           If an entry in this table is created by an SNMP SetRequest,
           the value of the t11FLockInitiatorType object in that entry
           will normally be 'snmp'.  A row for which the value of
           t11FLockInitiatorType is not 'snmp' cannot be modified
           via SNMP.  In particular, it cannot be deleted via
           t11FLockRowStatus.  Note that it's possible for a row to be
           created by an SNMP SetRequest, but for the setup of the lock
           to fail, and immediately thereafter be replaced by a lock
           successfully set up by some other means; in such a case, the
           value of t11FLockInitiatorType would change as and when the

           lock was set up by the other means, and so the row could
           not thereafter be deleted via t11FLockRowStatus.

           FC-GS-5 mentions various error situations in which a
           Fabric lock is released so as to avoid a deadlock.  In
           such situations, the agent removes the corresponding row
           in this table as and when the lock is released.  This can
           happen for all values of t11FLockInitiatorType."

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4936">RFC 4936</a>                   FC Zone Server MIB                August 2007</span>


           Zoning Management, as defined in the FC-GS-5 specification.

           FC-GS-5 defines (in-band) management operations for
           manipulating the Zone Set Database, some for use in Basic
           mode (e.g., 'Add Zone Set (AZS)', etc.), and some for use in
           Enhanced mode (e.g., Create Zone Set (CZS)', etc.).  When
           Enhanced Zoning Management is in use, FC-GS-5 requires that
           these in-band management operations be rejected unless they
           are issued within the context of a GS-5 server session.  The
           use of a server session ensures serialized access to the
           Zoning Database since the Fabric lock for the Zone Server
           must be obtained as a part of establishing the server
           session to the Zone Server.

           Thus, if and when this MIB is used for Enhanced Zoning
           Management, SNMP SetRequests that request the modification
           of zoning definitions must be serialized with respect to
           the GS-5 requests to modify the Zoning Database.  This is
           achieved by requiring that an SNMP management application
           must first obtain the Fabric lock for the Zone Server
           before attempting to modify any zoning definitions.  The
           companion T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB module is defined as a means
           of obtaining the Fabric lock for the Zone Server (or any
           other server).

           In Enhanced Zoning Management, a Zone Server keeps track of
           changes requested in the zoning definitions, but does not
           update its Zone Set Database unless there is (and until
           there is) a 'commit' operation.  To model this behavior,
           this MIB module assumes that a Zone Server (in Enhanced
           mode) takes a snapshot of its Zone Set Database as and when
           the Fabric lock (for the Zone Server application) is
           obtained; this snapshot is used to create what is herein
           called the 'copy' database.  It is this 'copy' database
           that is then updated by SNMP SetRequests (while the Fabric
           is locked).  If and when a 'commit' operation is requested
           (while the Fabric is still locked), the 'copy' database is
           then used to overwrite the previously committed contents of
           the Zone Set Database, and the new Zone Set Database is
           distributed to all other switches in the Fabric.  When the
           lock is released, any changes made that were not
           'committed' are discarded.

           When this MIB is used for Basic Zoning Management, the same
           set of MIB objects as used for Enhanced mode are used to
           make changes to the Database of a Zone Server on a
           particular switch, but the changes take immediate effect at
           that switch without an explicit commit.  The distribution of

           those changes to Zone Servers on other switches in the
           Fabric is subsequently requested through the use of a
           separate set of MIB objects.

           The management information specified in this MIB module
           includes the Zoning Database for each of one or more Fibre
           Channel Fabrics.  A Zoning Database is a combination of the
           Fabric's Zone Set Database and its Active Zone Set.  The
           Active Zone Set is the Zone Set currently enforced by the
           Fabric; a Zone Set Database is a database of the Zone Sets
           available to be activated within a Fabric.  All the MIB
           objects representing a Zone Set Database are modifiable at
           any time (irrespective of the value of any RowStatus
           object), whereas all objects representing the Active Zone
           Set are always read-only (except to deactivate it and/or
           activate a different one).

   IANA has assigned two MIB OIDs:  one for the T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB
   module (159) and one for the T11-FC-ZONE-SERVER-MIB module (160),
   under the mib-2 subtree.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are many management objects defined in these MIB modules with a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   Specifically, unauthorized write access to *any* of the writable
   objects in these MIB modules could cause unauthorized manipulation of
   the Zoning information on a Zone Server, and/or the activation of an
   unauthorized Active Zone Set in a Fabric.  This could result in
   allowing unauthorized connectivity, and/or denying authorized
   connectivity, between hosts connected to the Fibre Channel network.
   It could also cause the suppression of notifications (e.g., of
   unauthorized operations), or the disruption of network operations due
   to the generation of unwanted notifications.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   Unauthorized read access to any of the readable objects in the
   t11ZsServerTable, t11ZsActiveZoneTable, t11ZsActiveZoneMemberTable,
   or t11ZsActiveAttribTable tables would reveal information about the

<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-80"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4936">RFC 4936</a>                   FC Zone Server MIB                August 2007</span>


   currently authorized connectivity between hosts connected to the
   Fibre Channel network.

   Unauthorized read access to any of the readable objects in the
   t11ZsSetTable, t11ZsZoneTable, t11ZsSetZoneTable, t11ZsAliasTable,
   t11ZsZoneMemberTable, t11ZsAttribBlockTable, or t11ZsAttribTable
   tables would reveal information about potential/alternative
   connectivity that could be authorized between hosts connected to the
   Fibre Channel network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="./rfc3410#section-8">[RFC3410], section 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
