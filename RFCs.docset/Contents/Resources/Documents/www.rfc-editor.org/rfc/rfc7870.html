<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Dual-Stack Lite [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>] is a solution that offers both IPv4 and
   IPv6 connectivity to customers crossing an IPv6-only infrastructure.
   One of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, which is used
   to provide IPv4 connectivity across a service provider's IPv6
   network.  Another key component is a carrier-grade IPv4-IPv4 Network
   Address Translation (NAT) to share service provider IPv4 addresses
   among customers.

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  This MIB module may be used for configuration and
   monitoring of Address Family Transition Routers (AFTRs) in a Dual-
   Stack Lite scenario.

   [RFC3410]</a>.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>], and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20IF-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Relationship to the IF-MIB</span>

   The Interfaces MIB [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  Each logical interface (physical or virtual)
   has an ifEntry.  Tunnels are handled by creating a logical interface
   (ifEntry) for each tunnel.  Each DS-Lite tunnel endpoint also acts as
   a virtual interface that has a corresponding entry in the IP Tunnel
   MIB and Interface MIB.  Those corresponding entries are indexed by
   ifIndex.

   The ifOperStatus in ifTable is used to represent whether the DS-Lite
   tunnel function has been triggered.  The ifInUcastPkts defined in
   ifTable will represent the number of IPv4 packets that have been
   encapsulated into IPv6 packets sent to a Basic Bridging BroadBand
   (B4).  The ifOutUcastPkts defined in ifTable contains the number of
   IPv6 packets that can be decapsulated to IPv4 in the virtual
   interface.  Also, the IF-MIB defines ifMtu for the MTU of this tunnel
   interface, so the DS-Lite MIB does not need to define the MTU for the
   tunnel.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Difference%20from%20the%20IP%20Tunnel%20MIB%20and%20NATV2-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Difference from the IP Tunnel MIB and NATV2-MIB</span>

   The key technologies for DS-Lite are IP-in-IP (IPv4-in-IPv6) tunnels
   and NAT (IPv4-to-IPv4 translation).

   Notes: According to <a href="./rfc6333#section-5.2">Section 5.2 of [RFC6333]</a>, DS-Lite only defines
   IPv4 in IPv6 tunnels at this moment, but other types of encapsulation
   could be defined in the future.  So, the DS-Lite MIB only supports
   IP-in-IP encapsulation.  If another RFC defines other tunnel types in
   the future, the DS-Lite MIB will be updated then.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7870">RFC 7870</a>                  DS-Lite MIB for AFTRs                June 2016</span>


   The NATV2-MIB [<a href="./rfc7659" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NATs)"'>RFC7659</a>] is designed to carry translation from any
   address family to any address family; therefore, it supports IPv4-to-
   IPv4 translation.

   The IP Tunnel MIB [<a href="./rfc4087" title='"IP Tunnel MIB"'>RFC4087</a>] is designed to manage tunnels of any type
   over IPv4 and IPv6 networks; therefore, it already supports IP-in-IP
   tunnels.  But in a DS-Lite scenario, the tunnel type is point-to-
   multipoint IP-in-IP tunnels.  The direct(2) defined in the IP Tunnel
   MIB only supports point-to-point tunnels.  So, it needs to define a
   new tunnel type for DS-Lite.

   However, the NATV2-MIB and IP Tunnel MIB together are not sufficient
   to support DS-Lite.  This document describes the specific features
   for the DS-Lite MIB, as below.

   In the DS-Lite scenario, the Address Family Transition Router (AFTR)
   is not only the tunnel-end concentrator, but also an IPv4-to-IPv4
   NAT.  So, as defined in [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>], when the IPv4 packets come back
   from the Internet to the AFTR, it knows how to reconstruct the IPv6
   encapsulation by doing a reverse lookup in the extended IPv4 NAT
   binding table (<a href="./rfc6333#section-6.6">Section 6.6 of [RFC6333]</a>).  The NAT binding table in
   the AFTR is extended to include the IPv6 address of the tunnel
   initiator.  However, the NAT binding information defined in the
   NATV2-MIB as natv2PortMapTable is indexed by the NAT instance,
   protocol, and external realm and address.  Because the
   tunnelIfTable defined in the TUNNEL-MIB [<a href="./rfc4087" title='"IP Tunnel MIB"'>RFC4087</a>] is indexed by the
   ifIndex, the DS-Lite MIB needs to define the tunnel objects to extend
   the NAT binding entry by interface.  Therefore, a combined MIB is
   necessary.

   An implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB is required for DS-Lite.  As
   the tunnel is not point-to-point in DS-Lite, it needs to define a new
   tunnel type for DS-Lite.  The tunnelIfEncapsMethod in the
   tunnelIfEntry should be set to dsLite(17), and a corresponding entry
   in the DS-Lite module will exist for every tunnelIfEntry with this
   tunnelIfEncapsMethod.  The tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress must be set to
   "::".

   The DS-Lite MIB provides a way to monitor and manage the devices
   (AFTRs) in a DS-Lite scenario through SNMP.

   The DS-Lite MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis.  It depends
   on several parts of the IF-MIB [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>], IP Tunnel MIB [<a href="./rfc4087" title='"IP Tunnel MIB"'>RFC4087</a>],
   and NATV2-MIB [<a href="./rfc7659" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NATs)"'>RFC7659</a>].

   The dsliteTunnel subtree describes managed objects used for managing
   tunnels in the DS-Lite scenario.  Because the
   tunnelInetConfigLocalAddress and the tunnelInetConfigRemoteAddress
   defined in the IP Tunnel MIB are not readable, a few new objects are
   defined in the DS-Lite MIB.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.2.%20%20The%20dsliteNAT%20Subtree"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1.2" id="section-6.1.2">6.1.2</a>.  The dsliteNAT Subtree</span>

   The dsliteNAT subtree describes managed objects used for
   configuration and monitoring of an AFTR that is capable of a NAT
   function.  Because the NATV2-MIB supports the NAT management function
   in DS-Lite, we may reuse it in the DS-Lite MIB.  The dsliteNAT
   subtree also provides the mapping information between the tunnel
   entry (dsliteTunnelEntry) and the NAT entry (dsliteNATBindEntry) by
   adding the IPv6 address of the B4 to the natv2PortMapEntry in the
   NATV2-MIB.  The mapping behavior, filtering behavior, and pooling
   behavior described in this subtree are all defined in [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>].

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      dsliteAFTRAlarmConnectNumber

      dsliteAFTRAlarmSessionNumber

      dsliteAFTRAlarmPortNumber

   Notification thresholds: An attacker setting an arbitrarily low
   threshold can cause many useless notifications to be generated.
   Setting an arbitrarily high threshold can effectively disable
   notifications, which could be used to hide another attack.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      entries in dsliteTunnelTable

      entries in dsliteNATBindTable

   Objects that reveal host identities: Various objects can reveal the
   identity of private hosts that are engaged in a session with external
   end nodes.  A curious outsider could monitor these to assess the
   number of private hosts being supported by the AFTR device.  Further,
   a disgruntled former employee of an enterprise could use the
   information to break into specific private hosts by intercepting the
   existing sessions or originating new sessions into the host.  If
   nothing else, unauthorized monitoring of these objects will violate
   individual subscribers' privacy.

   Unauthorized read access to the dsliteTunnelTable would reveal
   information about the tunnel topology.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [<a href="./rfc3410" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [<a href="./rfc3414" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC3414</a>] with the AES cipher algorithm [<a href="./rfc3826" title='"The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Cipher Algorithm in the SNMP User-based Security Model"'>RFC3826</a>].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [<a href="./rfc5591" title='"Transport Security Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5591</a>] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [<a href="./rfc5592" title='"Secure Shell Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5592</a>] or TLS/DTLS [<a href="./rfc6353" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC6353</a>].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
