      <span class="h1">IS-IS Route Preference for Extended IP and IPv6 Reachability</span>

Abstract

   In existing specifications, the route preferences for IPv4/IPv6
   Extended Reachability TLVs are not explicitly stated.  There are also
   inconsistencies in the definition of how the up/down bit applies to
   route preference when the prefix advertisement appears in Level 2
   Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs).  This document addresses these
   issues.

   This document updates <a href="./rfc5308">RFC 5308</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC5302">RFC5302</a>] defines the route preference rules as they apply to TLVs
   128 and 130.  [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>] introduced the IP Extended Reachability TLV
   135 but did not explicitly adapt the route preference rules defined
   in [<a href="./rfc5302" title='"Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with Two-Level IS-IS"'>RFC5302</a>] for the new TLV.  [<a href="./rfc5308" title='"Routing IPv6 with IS-IS"'>RFC5308</a>] defines the IPv6
   Reachability TLV 236 and does include an explicit statement regarding
   route preference -- but the statement introduces use of the up/down
   bit in advertisements that appear in Level 2 LSPs, which is
   inconsistent with statements made in [<a href="./rfc5302" title='"Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with Two-Level IS-IS"'>RFC5302</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>].  This
   document defines explicit route preference rules for TLV 135, revises
   the route preference rules for TLV 236, and clarifies the usage of
   the up/down bit when it appears in TLVs in Level 2 LSPs.  This
   document is a clarification (NOT a correction) of [<a href="./rfc5302" title='"Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with Two-Level IS-IS"'>RFC5302</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>]; it is a correction of the route preference rules defined
   in [<a href="./rfc5308" title='"Routing IPv6 with IS-IS"'>RFC5308</a>] to be consistent with the rules for IPv4.  It also makes
   explicit that the same rules apply to the Multi-Topology (MT)
   equivalent TLVs 235 and 237.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Use%20of%20the%20Up%2FDown%20Bit%20in%20Level%202%20LSPs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Use of the Up/Down Bit in Level 2 LSPs</span>

   The up/down bit was introduced in support of leaking prefixes
   downwards in the IS-IS level hierarchy.  Routes that are leaked
   downwards have the bit set to 1.  Such prefixes MUST NOT be leaked
   upwards in the hierarchy.  So long as we confine ourselves to a
   single IS-IS instance and the current number of supported levels
   (two), it is impossible to have a prefix advertised in a Level 2 LSP
   and have the up/down bit set to 1.  However, because [<a href="./rfc5302" title='"Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with Two-Level IS-IS"'>RFC5302</a>]
   anticipated a future extension to IS-IS that might support additional
   levels, it allowed for the possibility that the up/down bit might be
   set in a Level 2 LSP and supported easy migration in the event such
   an extension was introduced.  <a href="./rfc5302#section-3.3">Section 3.3 of [RFC5302]</a> states:

      ...it is RECOMMENDED that implementations ignore the up/down bit
      in L2 LSPs, and accept the prefixes in L2 LSPs regardless of
      whether the up/down bit is set.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5305">RFC5305</a>] addressed an additional case wherein an implementation
   included support for multiple virtual routers running IS-IS in
   different areas.  In such a case, it is possible to redistribute
   prefixes between two IS-IS instances in the same manner that prefixes
   are redistributed from other protocols into IS-IS.  This introduced



<span class="grey">Ginsberg, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7775">RFC 7775</a>                 IS-IS Route Preference            February 2016</span>


   the possibility that a prefix could be redistributed from Level 1 to
   Level 1 (as well as between Level 2 and Level 2), and in the event
   the redistributed route was leaked from Level 1 to Level 2, two
   different routers in different areas would be advertising the same
   prefix into the Level 2 sub-domain.  To prevent this, <a href="./rfc5305#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of
   [RFC5305]</a> specifies:

      If a prefix is advertised from one area to another at the same
      level, then the up/down bit SHALL be set to 1.

   However, the statement in [<a href="./rfc5302" title='"Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with Two-Level IS-IS"'>RFC5302</a>] that the up/down bit is ignored
   in Level 2 LSPs is not altered by [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>].

   The conclusion then is that there is no "L2 inter-area route";
   indeed, no such route type is defined by [<a href="./rfc5302" title='"Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with Two-Level IS-IS"'>RFC5302</a>].  However,
   [<a href="./rfc5308" title='"Routing IPv6 with IS-IS"'>RFC5308</a>] ignored this fact and introduced such a route type in
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> when it specified a preference for "Level 2 down prefix".
   This is an error that this document corrects.  As changing the use of
   the up/down bit in TLVs 236 and 237 may introduce interoperability
   issues, implementors may wish to support transition mechanisms from
   the behavior described in [<a href="./rfc5308" title='"Routing IPv6 with IS-IS"'>RFC5308</a>] to the behavior described in this
   document.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5302">RFC5302</a>] is the authoritative reference for the types of routes
   supported by TLVs 128 and 130.  However, a number of attributes
   supported by those TLVs are NOT supported by TLVs 135, 235, 236, and
   237.  Distinction between internal/external metrics is not supported.
   In the case of IPv4 TLVs (135 and 235), the distinction between
   internal and external route types is not supported.  However, the
   Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV defined in [<a href="#ref-PFXATTR" title='"IS-IS Prefix Attributes for Extended IP and IPv6 Reachability"'>PFXATTR</a>] reintroduces the
   distinction between internal and external route types.  The
   definitions below include references to the relevant attribute bits
   from [<a href="#ref-PFXATTR" title='"IS-IS Prefix Attributes for Extended IP and IPv6 Reachability"'>PFXATTR</a>].

   This section defines the types of route supported for IPv4 when using
   TLV 135 [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>] and/or TLV 235 [<a href="./rfc5120" title='"M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs)"'>RFC5120</a>].  The text follows as
   closely as possible the original text from [<a href="./rfc5302" title='"Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with Two-Level IS-IS"'>RFC5302</a>].

   L1 intra-area routes:  These are advertised in L1 LSPs, in TLV 135 or
      TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 0.  These IP prefixes are
      directly connected to the advertising router.  If the Prefix
      Attribute Flags sub-TLV is included, both the X-Flag and the
      R-Flag are set to 0.

   L1 external routes:  These are advertised in L1 LSPs, in TLV 135 or
      TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 0.  These IP prefixes are
      learned from other protocols and are usually not directly

      135 or TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 0.  These IP prefixes
      are learned via L1 routing and were derived during the L1 Shortest
      Path First (SPF) computation from prefixes advertised in L1 LSPs
      in TLV 135 or TLV 235.  If the Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV is
      included, the R-Flag is set to 1.

   This example documents a real-world interoperability issue that
   occurs because implementations from different vendors have
   interpreted the use of the up/down bit in Level 2 LSPs
   inconsistently.

           L2       L2       L2     L2|L2      L2
    10/8 - R0 ----- R1 ----- R2 ----- R3 ----- R4 ---- 10/8
                                      |
                   Figure 1

   In Figure 1, both R0 and R4 are advertising the prefix 10/8.  Two IS-
   IS Level 2 instances are running on R3 to separate the network into
   two areas.  R3 is performing route leaking and advertises prefixes
   from R4 to the other Level 2 process.  The network is using extended
   metrics (TLV 135 defined in [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>]).  R0 advertises 10/8 with
   metric 2000, and R3 advertises 10/8 with metric 100.  All links have
   a metric of 1.  When advertising 10/8 in its Level 2 LSP, R3 sets the
   down bit as specified in [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>].

   R1, R2, and R3 are from three different vendors (R1-&gt;Vendor1,
   R2-&gt;Vendor2, R3-&gt;Vendor3).  During interoperability testing, routing
   loops are observed in this scenario.

   o  R2 has two possible paths to reach 10/8: Level 2 route with metric
      2002 and up/down bit set to 0 (from R0) and Level 2 route with
      metric 101 and up/down bit set to 1 (from R3).  R2 selects R1 as
      the next hop to 10/8 because it prefers the route that does NOT
      have the up/down bit set.

   o  R3 has two possible paths to reach 10/8: Level 2 route with metric
      2003 and up/down bit set to 0 (from R0) and Level 2 route with
      metric 101 and up/down bit set to 0 (from R4).  R3 selects R4 as
      the next hop due to lowest metric.

   o  R1 has two possible paths to reach 10/8: Level 2 route with metric
      2001 and up/down bit set to 0 (from R0) and Level 2 route with
      metric 102 and up/down bit set to 1 (from R3).  R1 selects R2 as
      the next hop due to lowest metric.

   When R1 or R2 try to send traffic to 10/8, packets loop due to
   inconsistent routing decisions between R1 and R2.
