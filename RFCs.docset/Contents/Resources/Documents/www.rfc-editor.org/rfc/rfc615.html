                     <span class="h1">Standard Data Pathname Syntax</span>

There seems to be an increasing call for a Network Standard Data Pathname
(NSDP); that is, a standardized means of referring to a specific location
for/of a collection of bits somewhere on the Network.

The reasons for a standard or virtual anything have been discussed, at
length, elsewhere and will not be elaborated upon here. Rather than
attack the entire issue of virtual pathnames, I wish only to propose a
standardized SYNTAX for specifying pathnames. Such a standard will be
useful for 1) users who are unfamiliar with a site or who use several
different sites and do not want to have to remember each site's
idiosynchracies, 2) programs accessing data at several other sites, and
3) documentation:

The syntax allows the user to specify the necessary network, host,
peripheral device, directory, file, type, and site-specific fields.
Adding other fields, as needed, is expected to be quite simple.

First the BNF:

   &lt;NSDP&gt; ::= % &lt;bulk&gt; &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;

   &lt;bulk&gt; ::= &lt;field&gt; / &lt;field&gt; &lt;bulk&gt;

   &lt;field&gt; ::= &lt;key&gt; &lt;L-delim&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;R-delim&gt;

   &lt;key&gt; ::= NETWORK / HOST / PERIPHERAL/ DIRECTORY /
             FILE / TYPE / SITEPARM / N / H / P / D / F /
             T / S

&lt;L-delim&gt; ::= any printable character that is not in the
              succeeding &lt;name&gt; field and that is
              acceptable to the object site: For visual
              aesthetics and to facilitate human parsing,
              anytime &lt;L-delim&gt; is a left-bracket
              character (&lt;, [, (, _), &lt;R-delim&gt; must be
              the complementary right-bracket character
              (&gt;, ], ), |).

&lt;name&gt; ::=    any sequence of characters acceptable to the
              object site. This is the actual data field
              with the file, directory, device (or
              whatever) name.

&lt;R-delim&gt; ::= Either 1) the same character as &lt;L-delim&gt; or
              2) if the &lt;L-delim&gt; character is a
              left-bracket character (&lt;, [, (, _) then its
              complementary right-bracket (&gt;, ], ), |).


                                 -1-</pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">&lt;cr&gt; ::=      carriage-return

&lt;lf&gt; ::=      line-feed

And some elaboration:

The syntax allows &lt;name&gt; fields to be an arbitrary number of rs long.
Case is irrelevant to the syntax, though some sites will care about case
in &lt;name&gt; fields:

&lt;Key&gt; indicates what part of the pathname the next &lt;name&gt; is going to
refer to: The single-character keys are abbreviations for the respective
full-word keys:

&lt;Fields&gt; ARE order dependent, but defaulted ones may be omitted. The
order is as indicated for &lt;key&gt;s: That is, Network, Host, ..: Siteparm:

Fields may be repeated, as appropriate for the object site; that is,
multiple Directory fields, etc:

The validity of any combination of &lt;field&gt;s is entirely site-dependent:
For example, if a site will accept it, an NSDP with a Host field, and
nothing more, is permissible:

&lt;delim&gt; is used to delimit the beginning and end of the &lt;name&gt; field:

Explanation of &lt;key&gt;s:

       NETWORK or N:   Currently, only ARPA is defined.

       HOST or H:      Reference to host, by official name or
                       nickname or number: The default radix is
                       ten; a numeric string ending with "H"
                       indicates hexadecimal, "O"(oh) indicates
                       octal, and (gratuitously) "D" indicates
                       decimal:

      PERIPHERAL or P: Peripheral device being referred to:

      DIRECTORY or D:  Name of a directory which contains a
                       pointer to the entity (directory or
                       filename) specified in the following
                       &lt;field&gt;:

      FILE or F:       Basic name of the file or data set:

      TYPE or T:       Optional modifier to filename: (Tenex
                       calls it the extension.)

      SITEPARM or S:   A parameter, such as an access
                       specification or version number, peculiar
                       to the object site. The content of the
                       &lt;name&gt; field must serve to identify what
                       Siteparm is involved. Each site will be
                       responsible for defining the syntax of
                       Siteparm &lt;name&gt;s it will accept.

<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">Some reserved PERIPHERAL &lt;name&gt;s:

      DISK or DSK:     Immediately accessible, direct-access
                       storage.

      ONLINE or ONL:    Whatever immediately-accessible (measured
                        in fractions of a second) storage the
                        user accesses by default; usually disk:

      TAPE or TAP:      Industry-compatible magnetic tape:

      TAPE7 or TP7:     7-Track industry compatible tape:

      TAPE9 or TP9:     9-Track industry compatible tape:

      DECTAPE or DEC:   DEC Tape.

      OFFLINE or OFF:   Any tertiary storage; usually tape,
                        though "devices" like the Datacomputer
                        are permissible: The user should expect
                        to wait minutes or hours before being
                        able to access OFFLINE files:

      PRINTER or PTR:   Any available line-printer:

      DOCPRINTER or DOC:Upper-lower case line printer, preferably
                        with 8 1/2" X 11" unlined paper.

      PAPER or PAP:     Paper tape.

      PUNCH or PUN:     Standard 8O-column card punch.

      READER or RDR:    Standard 80-column card reader:

      OPERATOR or OPR:  System Operator's console.

      CONSULTANT or CON: On-line consultant.

Defaults:

Defaults will generally be context dependent. Consequently, the following
defaults are offered only as guidelines:

      Network:    ARPA

      Host:       The host interpreting the NVP

      Peripheral: ONLINE (DISK)

      Directory:  The user's current "working" directory,
                  usually set by the logon process:

      Filename:    None.

      Type:        None.

      Siteparm:     None.

<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">General Comments

The only field that must be considered in relation to any host's current
syntax is the escape-to-NVP field (The per-cent sign as the first
character of a pathname specification): It is not currently known to
conflict with any host's syntax:

Exclamation mark (!) is the only other character that seems permissible
(on the assumption that the character should be a graphic): Its use would
cause minor problems at Multics; but more importantly as a graphic, it is
too similar to the numeral "1":

The syntax is intended to be adequate for all hosts, so any given portion
of it may be inappropriate for any given host.

A site is expected to permit specifications in a given field iff that
site already has a way of accepting the same information:

I believe that any modifications to the syntax will be graceful
additions, rather than wholesale redesign, and thus can be deferred for a
while. Currently, any undefined attributes must be specified in a
Siteparm field:

Perhaps Version, Access protection and Accounting, as well as other types
of information, should be made standard &lt;key&gt;s, rather than buried as
Siteparms. I expect that the next version of the NSDP Syntax
specification will include them as &lt;key&gt;s, but I would like to wait for
some comments from the community.

The syntax does not currently allow addressing any collection of bits
smaller than a file: This can be remedied by adding PAGE, BYTE and other
&lt;key&gt;s; but, again, I would like to solicit some comments first:


Disclaimer

A pathname specified in the proposed syntax is fairly easy to type but is
quite ugly to read: So, at the expense of design cleanliness, the
&lt;L-delim&gt;/&lt;R-delim&gt; syntax was modified in an attempt to remedy the
problem somewhat: As you will see below, it is only partially successful.

The first draft of this document had a syntax that was a mix of Tenex and
Multics conventions: That is,

       (Network)[Host]Peripheral:Directory&gt;Filename:Type;Siteparm

Though visually more attractive and generally quicker to type, it lacks
extensibility. For example, adding Version number or Access protection as
standard fields would be difficult:

It is suggested that human interfaces be built to translate to/from NSDP
syntax and the user's standard environment.
