       <span class="h1">Comment on Resynchronization of Connection Status Proposal</span>


This is a comment on the proposal by Burchfiel and Tomlinson in <a href="./rfc467">RFC 467</a>
for a procedure in the host-to host protocol for resynchronization of
connection status.  I endorse their proposal with the following trivial
change.  The commands proposed might be more appropriately be called
"reset connection allocation sender" and "reset connection allocation
receiver" since the only aspect of the connection which is reset is the
allocation.  I therefore use the names RAS and RAR respectively.

The table below shows in overly concise notation my interpretation of
the resynchronizing procedure proposed by Burchfiel and Tomlinson, this
presentation is not intended to supersede their document but to clarify
the procedure.  The sequence shown here can be initiated by either the
sender or receiver either for internally generated reasons or upon the
receipt of a RAS or RAR, if this latter is the case then sender step 5
or receiver step 4 is satisfied.

SENDER                                 RECEIVER
