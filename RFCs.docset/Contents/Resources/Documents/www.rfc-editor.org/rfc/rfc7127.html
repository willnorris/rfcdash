<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   In the two decades after publication of <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a> [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>], the IETF
   has evolved its review processes of Proposed Standard RFCs, and thus
   <a href="./rfc2026#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1 of RFC 2026</a> no longer accurately describes IETF
   Proposed Standards.

   This document only updates the characterization of Proposed Standards
   from <a href="./rfc2026#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1 of RFC 2026</a> and does not speak to or alter the
   procedures for the maintenance of Standards Track documents from <a href="./rfc2026">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2026">2026</a> and <a href="./rfc6410">RFC 6410</a> [<a href="./rfc6410" title='"Reducing the Standards Track to Two Maturity Levels"'>RFC6410</a>].  For complete understanding of the
   requirements for standardization, those documents should be read in
   conjunction with this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20IETF%20Review%20of%20Proposed%20Standards"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  IETF Review of Proposed Standards</span>

   The entry-level maturity for the standards track is "Proposed
   Standard".  A specific action by the IESG is required to move a
   specification onto the Standards Track at the "Proposed Standard"
   level.

   Initially it was intended that most IETF technical specifications
   would progress through a series of maturity stages starting with
   Proposed Standard, then progressing to Draft Standard, then finally
   to Internet Standard (see <a href="./rfc2026#section-6">Section 6 of RFC 2026</a>).  For a number of
   reasons this progression is not common.  Many Proposed Standards are
   actually deployed on the Internet and used extensively, as stable
   protocols.  This proves the point that the community often deems it
   unnecessary to upgrade a specification to Internet Standard.  Actual
   practice has been that full progression through the sequence of
   standards levels is typically quite rare, and most popular IETF
   protocols remain at Proposed Standard.  Over time, the IETF has
   developed a more extensive review process.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7127">RFC 7127</a>         Characterization of Proposed Standards     January 2014</span>


   IETF Proposed Standards documents have been subject to open
   development and review by the Internet technical community, generally
   including a number of formal cross-discipline reviews and,
   specifically, a security review.  This is further strengthened in
   many cases by implementations and even the presence of interoperable
   code.  Hence, IETF Proposed Standards are of such quality that they
   are ready for the usual market-based product development and
   deployment efforts into the Internet.

   The text in the following section replaces <a href="./rfc2026#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1 of RFC 2026</a>.
   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> is a verbatim copy of the characterization of Internet
   Standards from <a href="./rfc2026#section-4.1.3">Section 4.1.3 of RFC 2026</a> and is provided for
   convenient reference.  The text only provides the characterization;
   process issues for Draft and Internet Standards are described in <a href="./rfc2026">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2026">2026</a> and its updates, specifically <a href="./rfc6410">RFC 6410</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Characterization%20of%20IETF%20Proposed%20Standard%20Specifications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Characterization of IETF Proposed Standard Specifications</span>

   The entry-level maturity for the standards track is "Proposed
   Standard".  A specific action by the IESG is required to move a
   specification onto the standards track at the "Proposed Standard"
   level.

   A Proposed Standard specification is stable, has resolved known
   design choices, has received significant community review, and
   appears to enjoy enough community interest to be considered valuable.

   Usually, neither implementation nor operational experience is
   required for the designation of a specification as a Proposed
   Standard.  However, such experience is highly desirable and will
   usually represent a strong argument in favor of a Proposed Standard
   designation.

   The IESG may require implementation and/or operational experience
   prior to granting Proposed Standard status to a specification that
   materially affects the core Internet protocols or that specifies
   behavior that may have significant operational impact on the
   Internet.

   A Proposed Standard will have no known technical omissions with
   respect to the requirements placed upon it.  Proposed Standards are
   of such quality that implementations can be deployed in the Internet.
   However, as with all technical specifications, Proposed Standards may
   be revised if problems are found or better solutions are identified,
   when experiences with deploying implementations of such technologies
   at scale is gathered.

   A specification for which significant implementation and successful
   operational experience has been obtained may be elevated to the
   Internet Standard level.  An Internet Standard (which may simply be
   referred to as a Standard) is characterized by a high degree of
   technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified
   protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet
   community.

   Occasionally, the IETF may choose to publish as Proposed Standard a
   document that contains areas of known limitations or challenges.  In
   such cases, any known issues with the document will be clearly and
   prominently communicated in the document, for example, in the
   abstract, the introduction, or a separate section or statement.
