systems.  The Dynamic Modeling/Computer Graphics PDP-10 system will be
placed at the disposal of the system programmers workshop, and DMCG

demonstrations. System programmers with operational Network capability
should plan to attend.

Tuesday the 28th and continue through Wednesday 29th, will be devoted to
workshops exploring and discussing issues associated with Network use.
Tentatively, the following five workshops are planned: (1) Network
climate research, (2) the Network service centers, (3) the Network NIC,
(4) Network on-line cooperative interaction, (5) a planning workshop for
an ICCC (The International Computer Communications Conference to be held
in Washington, D. C. in October of 1972) session and a demonstration.
