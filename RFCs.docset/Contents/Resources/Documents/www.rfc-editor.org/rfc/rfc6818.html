Abstract

   This document updates <a href="./rfc5280">RFC 5280</a>, the "Internet X.509 Public Key
   Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
   Profile".  This document changes the set of acceptable encoding
   methods for the explicitText field of the user notice policy
   qualifier and clarifies the rules for converting internationalized
   domain name labels to ASCII.  This document also provides some
   clarifications on the use of self-signed certificates, trust anchors,
   and some updated security considerations.

   This document updates the "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
   Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>].

   This document makes a recommendation that self-signed certificates
   used to convey trust anchor data be marked as certificate authority
   (CA) certificates, which is not always current practice.

   The use of self-signed certificates as trust anchors in <a href="./rfc5280#section-6.2">Section 6.2
   of [RFC5280]</a> is clarified.  While it is optional to use additional
   information in these certificates in the path validation process,
   [<a href="./rfc5937" title='"Using Trust Anchor Constraints during Certification Path Processing"'>RFC5937</a>] is noted as providing guidance in that regard.

   The acceptable and unacceptable encodings for the explicitText field
   of the user notice policy qualifier are updated to bring them in line
   with existing practice.

   The rules in <a href="./rfc5280#section-7.3">Section 7.3 of [RFC5280]</a> for ASCII encoding of
   Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) as Distinguished Names are
   aligned with the rules in <a href="#section-7.2">Section 7.2</a> of that document that govern
   IDN encoding as GeneralNames.

   In light of some observed attacks [<a href="#ref-Prins" title="&quot;DigiNotar Certificate Authority breach 'Operation Black Tulip'&quot;">Prins</a>], the Security
   Considerations section now gives added depth to the consequences of
   CA key compromise.  This section additionally notes that collision
   resistance is not a required property of one-way hash functions when
   used to generate key identifiers.

   This document also adds normative and informative references for
   Trust Anchor formats and how they may be used to initialize the path
   validation inputs.  These are needed as a result of the changes made
   in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   Add the following paragraph to the end of <a href="./rfc5280#section-3.2">RFC 5280, Section 3.2</a>:

| Consistent with <a href="#section-3.4.61">Section 3.4.61</a> of X.509 (11/2008) [<a href="#ref-X.509">X.509</a>], we note
| that use of self-issued certificates and self-signed certificates
| issued by entities other than CAs are outside the scope of this
| specification.  Thus, for example, a web server or client might
| generate a self-signed certificate to identify itself.  These

   <a href="./rfc5280#section-4.2.1.4">RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.4</a>, the tenth paragraph says:

  An explicitText field includes the textual statement directly in

   <a href="./rfc5280#section-6.2">RFC 5280, Section 6.2</a>, the third paragraph says:

  Where a CA distributes self-signed certificates to specify trust
  anchor information, certificate extensions can be used to specify
  recommended inputs to path validation.  For example, a policy
  constraints extension could be included in the self-signed
  certificate to indicate that paths beginning with this trust anchor
  should be trusted only for the specified policies.  Similarly, a name
  constraints extension could be included to indicate that paths
  beginning with this trust anchor should be trusted only for the
  specified name spaces.  The path validation algorithm presented in
  <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> does not assume that trust anchor information is provided
  in self-signed certificates and does not specify processing rules for

| Implementations that use self-signed certificates to specify trust

  The protection afforded private keys is a critical security factor.
  On a small scale, failure of users to protect their private keys will
  permit an attacker to masquerade as them or decrypt their personal
  information.  On a larger scale, compromise of a CA's private signing
| key may have a catastrophic effect.  If an attacker obtains the
| private key unnoticed, the attacker may issue bogus certificates and
| CRLs.  Existence of bogus certificates and CRLs will undermine
| confidence in the system.  If such a compromise is detected, all
| certificates issued to the compromised CA MUST be revoked, preventing
| services between its users and users of other CAs.  Rebuilding after
| such a compromise will be problematic, so CAs are advised to
| implement a combination of strong technical measures (e.g., tamper-
| resistant cryptographic modules) and appropriate management
| procedures (e.g., separation of duties) to avoid such an incident.

| inappropriate activity by an insider.  Existence of bogus
| certificates and CRLs will undermine confidence in the system.  Among
| many other possible attacks, the attacker may issue bogus
| certificates that have the same subject names as legitimate
| certificates in order impersonate legitimate certificate subjects.
| This could include bogus CA certificates in which the subject names
| in the bogus certificates match the names under which legitimate CAs
| issue certificates and CRLs.  This would allow the attacker to issue
| bogus certificates and CRLs that have the same issuer names, and
| possibly the same serial numbers, as certificates and CRLs issued by
