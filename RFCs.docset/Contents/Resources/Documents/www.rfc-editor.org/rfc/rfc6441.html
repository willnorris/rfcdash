       <span class="h1">Time to Remove Filters for Previously Unallocated IPv4 /8s</span>

Abstract

   It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic
   from and BGP prefixes of unallocated IPv4 address space.  Now that
   there are no longer any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more
   complicated, fragile, and expensive.  Network administrators are
   advised to remove filters based on the registration status of the
   address space.

   This document explains why any remaining packet and BGP prefix
   filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s should now be removed on border
   routers and documents those IPv4 unicast prefixes that should not be
   routed across the public Internet.

   It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic
   from and BGP prefixes of unallocated IPv4 address space.  Now that
   there are no longer any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more
   complicated, fragile, and expensive.  Network administrators are
   advised to remove filters based on the registration status of the
   address space.

   This document explains why any remaining packet and BGP prefix
   filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s should now be removed on border
   routers and documents those IPv4 unicast prefixes that should not be
   routed across the public Internet.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>

   Martians [<a href="./rfc1208" title='"Glossary of networking terms"'>RFC1208</a>] is a humorous term applied to packets that turn up
   unexpectedly on the wrong network because of bogus routing entries.
   It is also used as a name for a packet that has an altogether bogus
   (non-registered or ill-formed) Internet address.  Bogons [<a href="./rfc3871" title='"Operational Security Requirements for Large Internet Service Provider (ISP) IP Network Infrastructure"'>RFC3871</a>]
   are packets sourced from addresses that have not yet been allocated

   by IANA or the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), or addresses
   reserved for private or special use by RFCs [<a href="./rfc5735" title='"Special Use IPv4 Addresses"'>RFC5735</a>].  Bogons are
   referred to as "Dark IP" in some circles.

   Network administrators who implemented filters for unallocated IPv4
   /8s did so in the knowledge that those /8s were not a legitimate
   source of traffic on the Internet and that there was a small number
   of bogon filters to implement.  Now that there are no longer any
   unallocated unicast IPv4 /8s, there will be legitimate Internet
   traffic coming from all unicast /8s that are not reserved for special
   purposes in an RFC.

   Removing packet and prefix filters based on the registration status
   of the IPv4 address is a simple approach that will avoid blocking
   legitimate Internet traffic.  Network operators SHOULD remove both
   ingress and egress packet filters as well as BGP prefix filters for
   previously unallocated IPv4 /8s.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Continuing%20to%20Filter%20Traffic%20from%20Unallocated%20IPv4%20Space"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Continuing to Filter Traffic from Unallocated IPv4 Space</span>

   Some network administrators might want to continue filtering
   unallocated IPv4 addresses managed by the RIRs.  This requires
   significantly more granular ingress filters and the highly dynamic
   nature of the RIRs' address pools means that filters need to be
   updated on a daily basis to avoid blocking legitimate incoming
   traffic.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Prefixes%20That%20Should%20Not%20be%20Routed%20across%20the%20Internet"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Prefixes That Should Not be Routed across the Internet</span>

   Network operators may deploy filters that block traffic destined for
   Martian prefixes.  Currently, the Martian prefix table is defined by
   [<a href="./rfc5735" title='"Special Use IPv4 Addresses"'>RFC5735</a>] which reserves each Martian prefix for some specific,
   special use.  If the Martian prefix table ever changes, that change
   will be documented in an RFC that either updates or obsoletes
   [<a href="./rfc5735" title='"Special Use IPv4 Addresses"'>RFC5735</a>].

   The cessation of filters based on unallocated IPv4 /8 allocations is
   an evolutionary step towards reasonable security filters.  While
   these filters are no longer necessary, and in fact harmful, this does
   not obviate the need to continue other security solutions.  These
   other solutions are as necessary today as they ever were.
