   Querying and retrieving registration data from registries are defined
   in Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) [<a href="./rfc7480" title='"HTTP Usage in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)"'>RFC7480</a>] [<a href="./rfc7482" title='"Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"'>RFC7482</a>]
   [<a href="./rfc7483" title='"JSON Responses for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)"'>RFC7483</a>].  These documents do not specify where to send the queries.
   This document specifies a method to find which server is
   authoritative to answer queries for the requested scope.

   Top-Level Domains (TLDs), Autonomous System (AS) numbers, and network
   blocks are delegated by IANA to Internet registries such as TLD
   registries and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) that then issue
   further delegations and maintain information about them.  Thus, the
   bootstrap information needed by RDAP clients is best generated from
   data and processes already maintained by IANA; the relevant
   registries already exist at [<a href="#ref-ipv4reg" title='"IPv4 Address Space Registry"'>ipv4reg</a>], [<a href="#ref-ipv6reg" title='"IPv6 Global Unicast Address Assignments"'>ipv6reg</a>], [<a href="#ref-asreg" title='"Autonomous System (AS) Numbers"'>asreg</a>], and
   [<a href="#ref-domainreg">domainreg</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7484">RFC 7484</a>           Finding Authoritative RDAP Service         March 2015</span>


   Per this document, IANA has created new registries based on a JSON
   format specified in this document, herein named RDAP Bootstrap
   Service Registries.  These new registries are based on the existing
   entries of the above mentioned registries.  An RDAP client fetches
   the RDAP Bootstrap Service Registries, extracts the data, and then
   performs a match with the query data to find the authoritative
   registration data server and appropriate query base URL.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Conventions%20Used%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Structure%20of%20the%20RDAP%20Bootstrap%20Service%20Registries"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Structure of the RDAP Bootstrap Service Registries</span>

   The RDAP Bootstrap Service Registries, as specified in <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>
   below, have been made available as JSON [<a href="./rfc7159" title='"The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format"'>RFC7159</a>] objects, which can
   be retrieved via HTTP from locations specified by IANA.  The JSON
   object for each registry contains a series of members containing
   metadata about the registry such as a version identifier, a timestamp
   of the publication date of the registry, and a description.
   Additionally, a "services" member contains the registry items
   themselves, as an array.  Each item of the array contains a second-
   level array, with two elements, each of them being a third-level
   array.

   Each element of the Services Array is a second-level array with two
   elements: in order, an Entry Array and a Service URL Array.

   The Entry Array contains all entries that have the same set of base
   RDAP URLs.  The Service URL Array contains the list of base RDAP URLs
   usable for the entries found in the Entry Array.  Elements within
   these two arrays are not sorted in any way.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7484">RFC 7484</a>           Finding Authoritative RDAP Service         March 2015</span>


   An example structure of the JSON output of a RDAP Bootstrap Service
   Registry is illustrated:

   {
       "version": "1.0",
       "publication": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
       "description": "Some text",
       "services": [
         [
           ["entry1", "entry2", "entry3"],
           [
             "https://registry.example.com/myrdap/",
             "http://registry.example.com/myrdap/"
           ]
         ],
         [
           ["entry4"],
           [
             "http://example.org/"
           ]
         ]
       ]
   }

   The formal syntax is described in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   The "version" corresponds to the format version of the registry.
   This specification defines version "1.0".

   The syntax of the "publication" value conforms to the Internet date/
   time format [<a href="./rfc3339" title='"Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps"'>RFC3339</a>].  The value is the latest update date of the
   registry by IANA.

   The optional "description" string can contain a comment regarding the
   content of the bootstrap object.

   Per [<a href="./rfc7258" title='"Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack"'>RFC7258</a>], in each array of base RDAP URLs, the secure versions
   of the transport protocol SHOULD be preferred and tried first.  For
   example, if the base RDAP URLs array contains both HTTPS and HTTP
   URLs, the bootstrap client SHOULD try the HTTPS version first.

   Base RDAP URLs MUST have a trailing "/" character because they are
   concatenated to the various segments defined in [<a href="./rfc7482" title='"Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"'>RFC7482</a>].

   JSON names MUST follow the format recommendations of [<a href="./rfc7480" title='"HTTP Usage in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)"'>RFC7480</a>].  Any
   unrecognized JSON object properties or values MUST be ignored by
   implementations.

   Internationalized Domain Name labels used as entries or base RDAP
   URLs in the registries defined in this document MUST be only
   represented using their A-label form as defined in [<a href="./rfc5890" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Definitions and Document Framework"'>RFC5890</a>].

   All Domain Name labels used as entries or base RDAP URLs in the
   registries defined in this document MUST be only represented in
   lowercase.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Bootstrap%20Service%20Registry%20for%20Domain%20Name%20Space"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Bootstrap Service Registry for Domain Name Space</span>

   The JSON output of this registry contains domain label entries
   attached to the root, grouped by base RDAP URLs, as shown in this
   example.

   {
       "version": "1.0",
       "publication": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
       "description": "Some text",
       "services": [
         [
           ["net", "com"],
           [
             "https://registry.example.com/myrdap/"
           ]
         ],
         [
           ["org", "mytld"],
           [
             "http://example.org/"
           ]
         ],
         [
           ["xn--zckzah"],
           [
             "https://example.net/rdapxn--zckzah/",
             "http://example.net/rdapxn--zckzah/"
           ]
         ]
       ]
   }

   The domain name's authoritative registration data service is found by
   doing the label-wise longest match of the target domain name with the
   domain values in the Entry Arrays in the IANA Bootstrap Service
   Registry for Domain Name Space.  The match is done per label, from
   right to left.  If the longest match results in multiple entries,
   then those entries are considered equivalent.  The values contained

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7484">RFC 7484</a>           Finding Authoritative RDAP Service         March 2015</span>


   in the Service URL Array of the matching second-level array are the
   valid base RDAP URLs as described in [<a href="./rfc7482" title='"Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"'>RFC7482</a>].

   For example, a domain RDAP query for a.b.example.com matches the com
   entry in one of the arrays of the registry.  The base RDAP URL for
   this query is then taken from the second element of the array, which
   is an array of base RDAP URLs valid for this entry.  The client
   chooses one of the base URLs from this array; in this example, it
   chooses the only one available, "https://registry.example.com/
   myrdap/".  The segment specified in [<a href="./rfc7482" title='"Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"'>RFC7482</a>] is then appended to the
   base URL to complete the query.  The complete query is then
   "https://registry.example.com/myrdap/domain/a.b.example.com".

   If a domain RDAP query for a.b.example.com matches both com and
   example.com entries in the registry, then the longest match applies
   and the example.com entry is used by the client.

   If the registry contains entries such as com and goodexample.com,
   then a domain RDAP query for example.com only matches the com entry
   because matching is done on a per-label basis.

   The entry for the root of the domain name space is specified as "".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Bootstrap%20Service%20Registries%20for%20Internet%20Numbers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Bootstrap Service Registries for Internet Numbers</span>

   This section discusses IPv4 and IPv6 address space and Autonomous
   System numbers.

   For IP address space, the authoritative registration data service is
   found by doing a longest match of the target address with the values
   of the arrays in the corresponding RDAP Bootstrap Service Registry
   for Address Space.  The longest match is done the same way as for
   routing: the addresses are converted in binary form and then the
   binary strings are compared to find the longest match up to the
   specified prefix length.  The values contained in the second element
   of the array are the base RDAP URLs as described in [<a href="./rfc7482" title='"Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"'>RFC7482</a>].  The
   longest match method enables covering prefixes of a larger address
   space pointing to one base RDAP URL while more specific prefixes
   within the covering prefix are being served by another base RDAP URL.

   The JSON output of this registry contains IPv4 prefix entries,

   and grouped by RDAP URLs, as shown in this example.

           [

           ]
         ],
         [
           ["28.2.0.0/16", "192.0.2.0/24"],

         ]
       ]

   For example, a query for "192.0.2.1/25" matches the "192.0.0.0/8"
   entry and the "192.0.2.0/24" entry in the example registry above.
   The latter is chosen by the client given the longest match.  The base
   RDAP URL for this query is then taken from the second element of the
   array, which is an array of base RDAP URLs valid for this entry.  The
   client chooses one of the base URLs from this array; in this example,
   it chooses the only one available, "http://example.org/".  The
   {resource} specified in [<a href="./rfc7482" title='"Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"'>RFC7482</a>] is then appended to the base URL to
   complete the query.  The complete query is then "https://example.org/

       "description": "RDAP Bootstrap file for example registries.",
       "services": [
         [
           ["2001:0200::/23", "2001:db8::/32"],
           [
             "https://rir2.example.com/myrdap/"
           ]
         ],

   For example, a query for "2001:0200:1000::/48" matches the
   "2001:0200::/23" entry and the "2001:0200:1000::/36" entry in the
   example registry above.  The latter is chosen by the client given the
   longest match.  The base RDAP URL for this query is then taken from
   the second element of the array, which is an array of base RDAP URLs
   valid for this entry.  The client chooses one of the base URLs from
   this array; in this example, it chooses "https://example.net/
   rdaprir2/" because it's the secure version of the protocol.  The
   segment specified in [<a href="./rfc7482" title='"Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"'>RFC7482</a>] is then appended to the base URL to
   complete the query.  The complete query is, therefore,
   "https://example.net/rdaprir2/ip/2001:0200:1000::/48".  If the target
   RDAP server does not answer, the client can then use another URL
   prefix from the array.

   The JSON output of this contains Autonomous Systems number ranges
   entries, grouped by base RDAP URLs, as shown in this example.  The
   Entry Array is an array containing the list of AS number ranges
   served by the base RDAP URLs found in the second element.  The array
   always contains two AS numbers represented in decimal format that
   represents the range of AS numbers between the two elements of the
   array.  A single AS number is represented as a range of two identical
   AS numbers.

             "https://example.net/rdaprir2/"
           ]
         ]
       ]
   }

   For example, a query for AS 65411 matches the 64512-65534 entry in
   the example registry above.  The base RDAP URL for this query is then
   taken from the second element of the array, which is an array of base
   RDAP URLs valid for this entry.  The client chooses one of the base
   URLs from this array; in this example, it chooses
   "https://example.net/rdaprir2/".  The segment specified in [<a href="./rfc7482" title='"Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"'>RFC7482</a>]
   is then appended to the base URL to complete the query.  The complete
   query is, therefore, "https://example.net/rdaprir2/autnum/65411".  If
   the server does not answer, the client can then use another URL
   prefix from the array.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Entity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Entity</span>

   Entities (such as contacts, registrants, or registrars) can be
   queried by handle as described in [<a href="./rfc7482" title='"Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"'>RFC7482</a>].  Since there is no
   global namespace for entities, this document does not describe how to
   find the authoritative RDAP server for entities.  However, it is
   possible that, if the entity identifier was received from a previous
   query, the same RDAP server could be queried for that entity, or the
   entity identifier itself is a fully referenced URL that can be
   queried.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Non-existent%20Entries%20or%20RDAP%20URL%20Values"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Non-existent Entries or RDAP URL Values</span>

   The registries may not contain the requested value.  In these cases,
   there is no known RDAP server for that requested value, and the
   client SHOULD provide an appropriate error message to the user.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Deployment%20and%20Implementation%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Deployment and Implementation Considerations</span>

   This method relies on the fact that RDAP clients are fetching the
   IANA registries to then find the servers locally.  Clients SHOULD NOT
   fetch the registry on every RDAP request.  Clients SHOULD cache the
   registry, but use underlying protocol signaling, such as the HTTP
   Expires header field [<a href="./rfc7234" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching"'>RFC7234</a>], to identify when it is time to
   refresh the cached registry.

   If the query data does not match any entry in the client cached
   registry, then the client may implement various methods, such as the
   following:

   o  In the case of a domain object, the client may first query the DNS
      to see if the respective entry has been delegated or if it is
      mistyped information by the user.  The DNS query could be to fetch
      the NS records for the TLD domain.  If the DNS answer is negative,
      then there is no need to fetch the new version of the registry.
      However, if the DNS answer is positive, this may mean that the
      currently cached registry is no longer current.  The client could
      then fetch the registry, parse, and then do the normal matching as
      specified above.  This method may not work for all types of RDAP
      objects.

   o  If the client knows the existence of an RDAP aggregator or
      redirector and its associated base URL, and trusts that service,
      then it could send the query to the redirector, which would
      redirect the client if it knows the authoritative server that
      client has not found.

   Some authorities of registration data may work together on sharing
   their information for a common service, including mutual redirection
   [<a href="#ref-REDIRECT-RDAP">REDIRECT-RDAP</a>].

   When a new object is allocated, such as a new AS range, a new TLD, or
   a new IP address range, there is no guarantee that this new object
   will have an entry in the corresponding bootstrap RDAP registry,
   since the setup of the RDAP server for this new entry may become live
   and registered later.  Therefore, the clients should expect that even
   if an object, such as TLD, IP address range, or AS range is
   allocated, the existence of the entry in the corresponding bootstrap
   registry is not guaranteed.

   This method does not provide a direct way to find authoritative RDAP
   servers for any other objects than the ones described in this

   with the method described in this document:

   o  entities

   o  queries using search patterns that do not contain a terminating
      string that matches some entries in the registries

   o  nameservers

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/11.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11" id="section-11">11</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   By providing a bootstrap method to find RDAP servers, this document
   helps to ensure that the end users will get the RDAP data from an
   authoritative source, instead of from rogue sources.  The method has
   the same security properties as the RDAP protocols themselves.  The
   transport used to access the registries can be more secure by using
   TLS [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>], which IANA supports.

   Additional considerations on using RDAP are described in [<a href="./rfc7481" title='"Security Services for the Registration Data Access Protocol"'>RFC7481</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/12.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12" id="section-12">12</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has created the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries, listed
   below, and made them available as JSON objects.  The contents of
   these registries are described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>, and
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>, with the formal syntax specified in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   The process for adding or updating entries in these registries
   differs from the normal IANA registry processes: these registries are
   generated from the data, processes, and policies maintained by IANA
   in their allocation registries ([<a href="#ref-ipv4reg" title='"IPv4 Address Space Registry"'>ipv4reg</a>], [<a href="#ref-ipv6reg" title='"IPv6 Global Unicast Address Assignments"'>ipv6reg</a>], [<a href="#ref-asreg" title='"Autonomous System (AS) Numbers"'>asreg</a>], and
   [<a href="#ref-domainreg">domainreg</a>]), with the addition of new RDAP server information.

   IANA will create and update RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries
   entries from the allocation registries as those registries are
   updated.

   This document does not change any policies related to the allocation
   registries; IANA has provided a mechanism for collecting the RDAP
   server information.  The RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries will
   start empty and will be gradually populated as registrants of domains
   and address spaces provide RDAP server information to IANA.

   IANA has created a new top-level category on the Protocol Registries
   page, &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/protocols">http://www.iana.org/protocols</a>&gt;.  The group is called
   "Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)".  Each of the RDAP
   Bootstrap Services Registries has been made available for general
   public on-demand download in the JSON format, and that registry's URI
   is listed directly on the Protocol Registries page.

   Other normal registries will be added to this group by other
   documents, but the reason the URIs for these registries are clearly
   listed on the main page is to make those URIs obvious to implementers
   -- these are registries that will be accessed by software, as well as
   by humans using them for reference information.





<span class="grey">Blanchet                     Standards Track                   [Page 13]</span></pre>

   Because these registries will be accessed by software, the download
   demand for the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries may be unusually
   high compared to normal IANA registries.  The technical
   infrastructure by which registries are published will need to be
   reviewed and might need to be augmented.

   As discussed in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>, software that accesses these registries
   will depend on the HTTP Expires header field to limit their query
   rate.  It is, therefore, important for that header field to be
   properly set to provide timely information as the registries change,
   while maintaining a reasonable load on the IANA servers.  The HTTP
   Content-Type returned to clients accessing these JSON- formatted
   registries MUST be "application/json", as defined in [<a href="./rfc7159" title='"The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format"'>RFC7159</a>].

   Because of how information in the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries
   is grouped and formatted, the registry entries may not be sortable.
   It is, therefore, not required or expected that the entries be sorted
   in any way.
