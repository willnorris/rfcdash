Abstract

   This memo describes RSA and DSA key and signature encoding, and
   binary key encoding for version 2 of the KeyNote trust-management
   system.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   KeyNote is a simple and flexible trust-management system designed to
   work well for a variety of large- and small-scale Internet-based
   applications.  It provides a single, unified language for both local
   policies and credentials.  KeyNote policies and credentials, called
   `assertions', contain predicates that describe the trusted actions
   permitted by the holders of specific public keys.  KeyNote assertions
   are essentially small, highly-structured programs.  A signed
   assertion, which can be sent over an untrusted network, is also
   called a `credential assertion'.  Credential assertions, which also
   serve the role of certificates, have the same syntax as policy
   assertions but are also signed by the principal delegating the trust.
   For more details on KeyNote, see [<a href="#ref-BFIK99" title='"The KeyNote Trust-Management System Version 2"'>BFIK99</a>].  This document assumes
   reader familiarity with the KeyNote system.

   Cryptographic keys may be used in KeyNote to identify principals.  To
   facilitate interoperation between different implementations and to
   allow for maximal flexibility, keys must be converted to a normalized
   canonical form (depended on the public key algorithm used) for the
   purposes of any internal comparisons between keys.  For example, an

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2792">RFC 2792</a>         Key and Signature Encoding for KeyNote       March 2000</span>


   RSA [<a href="#ref-RSA78" title='"A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems"'>RSA78</a>] key may be encoded in base64 ASCII in one credential, and
   in hexadecimal ASCII in another.  A KeyNote implementation must
   internally convert the two encodings to a normalized form that allows
   for comparison between them.  Furthermore, the internal structure of
   an encoded key must be known for an implementation to correctly
   decode it.

   In some applications, other types of values, such as a passphrase or
   a random nonce, may be used as principal identifiers.  When these
   identifiers contain characters that may not appear in a string (as
   defined in [<a href="#ref-BFIK99" title='"The KeyNote Trust-Management System Version 2"'>BFIK99</a>]), a simple ASCII encoding is necessary to allow
   their use inside KeyNote assertions.  Note that if the identifier
   only contains characters that can appear in a string, it may be used
   as-is.  Naturally, such identifiers may not be used to sign an
   assertion, and thus no related signature encoding is defined.

   This document specifies RSA and DSA [<a href="#ref-DSA94" title='"Digital Signature Standard"'>DSA94</a>] key and signature
   encodings, and binary key encodings for use in KeyNote.

   DSA keys in KeyNote are identified by four values:

   - the public value, y
   - the p parameter
   - the q parameter
   - the g parameter

   Where the y, p, q, and g are the DSA parameters corresponding to the
   notation of [<a href="#ref-Sch96" title="Applied Cryptography 2nd Edition">Sch96</a>]. These four values together make up the DSA key
   normalized form used in KeyNote.  All DSA key comparisons in KeyNote
   occur between normalized forms.

   RSA keys in KeyNote are identified by two values:

   - the public exponent
   - the modulus

   These two values together make up the RSA key normalized form used in
   KeyNote.  All RSA key comparisons in KeyNote occur between normalized
   forms.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3%20%20Binary%20Identifier%20Normalized%20Form"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>  Binary Identifier Normalized Form</span>

   The normalized form of a Binary Identifier is the binary identifier's
   data.  Thus, Binary Identifier comparisons are essentially binary-
   string comparisons of the Identifier values.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Key%20Encoding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Key Encoding</span>

   DSA keys in KeyNote are encoded as an ASN1 SEQUENCE of four ASN1
   INTEGER objects.  The four INTEGER objects are the public value and
   the p, q, and g parameters of the DSA key, in that order.

   For use in KeyNote credentials, the ASN1 SEQUENCE is then ASCII-
   encoded (e.g., as a string of hex digits or base64 characters).

   DSA keys encoded in this way in KeyNote must be identified by the
   "dsa-XXX:" algorithm name, where XXX is an ASCII encoding ("hex" or
   "base64").  Other ASCII encoding schemes may be defined in the
   future.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2%20%20RSA%20Key%20Encoding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>  RSA Key Encoding</span>

   RSA keys in KeyNote are encoded as an ASN1 SEQUENCE of two ASN1
   INTEGER objects.  The two INTEGER objects are the public exponent and
   the modulus of the DSA key, in that order.

   For use in KeyNote credentials, the ASN1 SEQUENCE is then ASCII-
   encoded (e.g., as a string of hex digits or base64 characters).

   RSA keys encoded in this way in KeyNote must be identified by the
   "rsa-XXX:" algorithm name, where XXX is an ASCII encoding ("hex" or
   "base64").  Other ASCII encoding schemes may be defined in the
   future.

   Binary Identifiers in KeyNote are assumed to have no internal
   encoding, and are treated as a sequence of binary digits.  The Binary
   Identifiers are ASCII-encoded, similarly to RSA or DSA keys.

   Binary Identifiers encoded in this way in KeyNote must be identified
   by the "binary-XXX:" algorithm name, where XXX is an ASCII encoding
   ("hex" or "base64").  Other ASCII encoding schemes may be defined in
   the future.

   DSA signatures in KeyNote are computed over the assertion body
   (starting from the beginning of the first keyword, up to and
   including the newline character immediately before the "Signature:"
   keyword) and the signature algorithm name (including the trailing
   colon character, e.g., "sig-dsa-sha1-base64:")

   DSA signatures are then encoded as an ASN1 SEQUENCE of two ASN1
   INTEGER objects.  The two INTEGER objects are the r and s values of a
   DSA signature [<a href="#ref-Sch96" title="Applied Cryptography 2nd Edition">Sch96</a>], in that order.

   For use in KeyNote credentials, the ASN1 SEQUENCE is then ASCII-
   encoded (as a string of hex digits or base64 characters).

   DSA signatures encoded in this way in KeyNote must be identified by
   the "sig-dsa-XXX-YYY:" algorithm name, where XXX is a hash function
   name ("sha1", for the SHA1 [<a href="#ref-SHA1-95" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>SHA1-95</a>] hash function is currently the
   only hash function that may be used with DSA) and YYY is an ASCII
   encoding ("hex" or "base64").

   RSA signatures in KeyNote are computed over the assertion body
   (starting from the beginning of the first keyword, up to and
   including the newline character immediately before the "Signature:"
   keyword) and the signature algorithm name (including the trailing
   colon character, e.g., "sig-rsa-sha1-base64:")

   RSA signatures are then encoded as an ASN1 OCTET STRING object,
   containing the signature value.

   For use in KeyNote credentials, the ASN1 OCTET STRING is then ASCII-
   encoded (as a string of hex digits or base64 characters).

   RSA signatures encoded in this way in KeyNote must be identified by
   the "sig-rsa-XXX-YYY:" algorithm name, where XXX is a hash function
   name ("md5" or "sha1", for the MD5 [<a href="#ref-Riv92" title='"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>Riv92</a>] and SHA1 [<a href="#ref-SHA1-95" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>SHA1-95</a>] hash
   algorithms respectively, may be used with RSA) and YYY is an ASCII
   encoding ("hex" or "base64").

   Binary Identifiers are unstructured sequences of binary digits, and
   are not associated with any cryptographic algorithm.  Thus, they may
   not be used to validate an assertion.

   This document discusses the format of RSA and DSA keys and signatures
   and of Binary principal identifiers as used in KeyNote.  The security
   of KeyNote credentials utilizing such keys and credentials is
   directly dependent on the strength of the related public key
   algorithms.  On the security of KeyNote itself, see [<a href="#ref-BFIK99" title='"The KeyNote Trust-Management System Version 2"'>BFIK99</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   Per [<a href="#ref-BFIK99" title='"The KeyNote Trust-Management System Version 2"'>BFIK99</a>], IANA should provide a registry of reserved algorithm
   identifiers.  The following identifiers are reserved by this document
   as public key and binary identifier encodings:

   - "rsa-hex"
   - "rsa-base64"
   - "dsa-hex"
   - "dsa-base64"
   - "binary-hex"
   - "binary-base64"

   The following identifiers are reserved by this document as signature
   encodings:

   - "sig-rsa-md5-hex"
   - "sig-rsa-md5-base64"
   - "sig-rsa-sha1-hex"
   - "sig-rsa-sha1-base64"
   - "sig-dsa-sha1-hex"
   - "sig-dsa-sha1-base64"

   Note that the double quotes are not part of the algorithm
   identifiers.
