NIC 22383                                                 March 27, 1974

                 <span class="h1">SCENARIO FOR USING THE NETWORK JOURNAL</span>

Network users may send mail to individuals and to groups, input as
messages or entire files, through the Network Journal, using SNDMSG or
their site's mail system.  The mail is converted at NIC into NLS files,
Journalized, and sent to specified recipients.  Short messages may be
received as messages, longer ones as citations to files which may be
retrieved immediately, and also later, by using FTP.  Mail sent to NIC
with a "/" in the user-name field invokes the Net Journal.

SENDING THE MESSAGE OR FILE BY TELEX SNDMSG

   Construct user field with slash and NIC idents:

      [Users:] sender ident/addressee ident(s)@NIC

   e.g. "JEW/DHC MAP@NIC". To send to a group, use group ident, e.g.
   "JEW/NLG@NIC". To combine Journal SNDMSG with SNDMSG to others, add
   others' Network addresses after commas, e.g. "JEW/DHC@NIC,PRATT@ISI".
   See ARPANET Directory for NIC idents and Network addresses.

   [@] SNDMSG &lt;CR&gt;
   [Type ? for help]
   [Users:] JEW/NGG &lt;SP&gt; DHC@NIC, PRATT@ISI &lt;CR&gt;
   [Subject:] Title of Message &lt;CR&gt;
   [Message (? for help):] Text of message ...
      Note: ^B allows insertion of a sequential file as the message or
      at any point in the test of the message:

      ^B [(Insert file:)] &lt;directory&gt;file &lt;ALT&gt; [ext ...EOF)]
   &lt;^Z&gt;
   [jew/ngg dhc@nic -- ok]   (or [ -- queued -- timed-out])
   [pratt@isi -- ok]

   When using SNDMSG through TELNET, change TELNET escape character, to
   ^Q for example, allowing ^Z to be used for end-of-message.

RETRIEVING THE FILE FROM NETWORK JOURNAL

   Substitute the citation received, for example "&lt;GJOURNAL&gt;21695", for
   "&lt;journal&gt;number" and supply a filename in the following:

   [@] FTP &lt;CR&gt;
   [HOST FTP User process x.xx.x]

   Using Other Mail Systems:

      It is not possible to give a generalized scenario for use with all
      local mail systems.

      The general procedure, to be applied to the local mail system, is
      to supply:

         "NIC" as the host name, and

         Sender's NIC ident / Addressee's NIC ident as user name

   See <a href="./rfc543">RFC543</a>, NIC 17777, for more detail on Network Journal.
