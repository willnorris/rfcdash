   The initial effort of the PCE (Path Computation Element) WG focused
   mainly on solving the path computation problem within a domain or
   over different domains in MPLS networks.  As with MPLS, service
   providers (SPs) have also come up with requirements for path
   computation in GMPLS-controlled networks [<a href="./rfc3945" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Architecture"'>RFC3945</a>], such as those
   based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), Time Division
   Multiplexing (TDM), or Ethernet.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4655">RFC4655</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4657" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements"'>RFC4657</a>] discuss the framework and requirements for
   PCE on both packet MPLS networks and GMPLS-controlled networks.  This
   document complements those RFCs by providing considerations of GMPLS
   applications in the intradomain and interdomain networking
   environments and indicating a set of requirements for the extended
   definition of PCE-related protocols.

   Note that the requirements for interlayer and inter-area traffic
   engineering (TE) described in [<a href="./rfc6457" title='"PCC-PCE Communication and PCE Discovery Requirements for Inter-Layer Traffic Engineering"'>RFC6457</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4927" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCECP) Specific Requirements for Inter-Area MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering"'>RFC4927</a>] are outside of
   the scope of this document.

   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) computation within a domain or
   over domains for signaling GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is
   usually more stringent than that of MPLS TE LSPs [<a href="./rfc4216" title='"MPLS Inter-Autonomous System (AS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Requirements"'>RFC4216</a>], because
   the additional constraints, e.g., interface switching capability,
   link encoding, link protection capability, Shared Risk Link Group
   (SRLG) [<a href="./rfc4202" title='"Routing Extensions in Support of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)"'>RFC4202</a>], and so forth, need to be considered to establish
   GMPLS LSPs.  The GMPLS signaling protocol [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] is designed
   taking into account bidirectionality, switching type, encoding type,
   and protection attributes of the TE links spanned by the path, as
   well as LSP encoding and switching type of the endpoints,
   appropriately.

   This document provides requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in
   support of GMPLS path computation, included are requirements for both
   intradomain and interdomain environments.

   Figure 1 depicts a model GMPLS network, consisting of an ingress
   link, a transit link, as well as an egress link.  We will use this
   model to investigate consistent guidelines for GMPLS path
   computation.  Each link at each interface has its own switching
   capability, encoding type, and bandwidth.

               Figure 1: Path Computation in GMPLS Networks

   For the simplicity in consideration, the following basic assumptions
   are made when the LSP is created.

   (1)  Switching capabilities of outgoing links from the ingress and
        egress nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure 1) are consistent
        with each other.

   (2)  Switching capabilities of all transit links, including incoming
        links to the ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) are
        consistent with switching type of an LSP to be created.

   (3)  Encoding types of all transit links are consistent with the
        encoding type of an LSP to be created.

   GMPLS-controlled networks (e.g., GMPLS-based TDM networks) are
   usually responsible for transmitting data for the client layer.
   These GMPLS-controlled networks can provide different types of
   connections for customer services based on different service
   bandwidth requests.

   The applications and the corresponding additional requirements for
   applying PCE to GMPLS-based TDM networks are described in this
   section.  In order to simplify the description, this document only
   discusses the scenario in Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)
   networks as an example (see Figure 2).  The scenarios in Synchronous
   Optical Network (SONET) or Optical Transport Network (OTN) are
   similar.

                   Figure 2: A Simple TDM (SDH) Network

   Figure 2 shows a simple TDM (SDH) network topology, where N1, N2, N3,
   N4, and N5 are all SDH switches; A1 and A2 are client devices (e.g.,
   Ethernet switches).  Assume that one Ethernet service with 100 Mbit/s
   bandwidth is required from A1 to A2 over this network.  The client
   Ethernet service could be provided by a Virtual Container 4 (VC-4)
   container from N1 to N4; it could also be provided by three
   concatenated VC-3s (contiguous or virtual concatenation) from N1 to
   N4.




<span class="grey">Otani, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

   In this scenario, when the ingress node (e.g., N1) receives a client
   service transmitting request, the type of containers (one VC-4 or
   three concatenated VC-3s) could be determined by the PCC (Path
   Computation Client), e.g., N1 or Network Management System (NMS).
   However, it could also be determined automatically by the PCE based
   on policy [<a href="./rfc5394" title='"Policy-Enabled Path Computation Framework"'>RFC5394</a>].  If it is determined by the PCC, then the PCC
   should be capable of specifying the ingress node and egress node,
   signal type, the type of the concatenation, and the number of the
   concatenation in a PCReq (Path Computation Request) message.  The PCE
   should consider those parameters during path computation.  The route
   information (co-routing or diverse routing) should be specified in a
   PCRep (Path Computation Reply) message if path computation is
   performed successfully.

   As described above, the PCC should be capable of specifying TE
   attributes defined in the next section, and the PCE should compute a
   path accordingly.

   Where a GMPLS network consists of interdomain (e.g., inter-AS or
   inter-area) GMPLS-controlled networks, requirements on the path
   computation follow [<a href="./rfc5376" title='"Inter-AS Requirements for the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCECP)"'>RFC5376</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4726" title='"A Framework for Inter-Domain Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering"'>RFC4726</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Unnumbered%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Unnumbered Interface</span>

   GMPLS supports unnumbered interface IDs as defined in [<a href="./rfc3477" title='"Signalling Unnumbered Links in Resource ReSerVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)"'>RFC3477</a>]; this
   means that the endpoints of the path may be unnumbered.  It should
   also be possible to request a path consisting of the mixture of
   numbered links and unnumbered links, or a P2MP (Point-to-Multipoint)
   path with different types of endpoints.  Therefore, the PCC should be
   capable of indicating the unnumbered interface ID of the endpoints in
   the PCReq message.

   Per [<a href="./rfc6387" title='"GMPLS Asymmetric Bandwidth Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC6387</a>], GMPLS signaling can be used for setting up an
   asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP.  If a PCE is responsible for
   path computation, it should be capable of computing a path for the
   bidirectional LSP with asymmetric bandwidth.  This means that the PCC
   should be able to indicate the asymmetric bandwidth requirements in
   forward and reverse directions in the PCReq message.

   As for path computation in GMPLS-controlled networks as discussed in
   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, the PCE should appropriately consider the GMPLS TE
   attributes listed below once a PCC or another PCE requests a path
   computation.  The path calculation request message from the PCC or
   the PCE must contain the information specifying appropriate
   attributes.  According to [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>], [<a href="#ref-PCE-WSON-REQ">PCE-WSON-REQ</a>], and RSVP
   procedures such as explicit label control (ELC), the additional
   attributes introduced are as follows:

   (1)   Switching capability/type: as defined in [<a href="./rfc3471" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Functional Description"'>RFC3471</a>], [<a href="./rfc4203" title='"OSPF Extensions in Support of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)"'>RFC4203</a>],
         and all current and future values.

   (2)   Encoding type: as defined in [<a href="./rfc3471" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Functional Description"'>RFC3471</a>], [<a href="./rfc4203" title='"OSPF Extensions in Support of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)"'>RFC4203</a>], and all
         current and future values.

   (3)   Signal type: as defined in [<a href="./rfc4606" title='"Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Extensions for Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) Control"'>RFC4606</a>] and all current and future
         values.

   (4)   Concatenation type: In SDH/SONET and OTN, two kinds of
         concatenation modes are defined: contiguous concatenation,
         which requires co-routing for each member signal and that all
         the interfaces along the path support this capability, and
         virtual concatenation, which allows diverse routing for member
         signals and requires that only the ingress and egress
         interfaces support this capability.  Note that for the virtual
         concatenation, it may also specify co-routing or diverse
         routing.  See [<a href="./rfc4606" title='"Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Extensions for Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) Control"'>RFC4606</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4328" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Extensions for G.709 Optical Transport Networks Control"'>RFC4328</a>] about concatenation
         information.

   (5)   Concatenation number: Indicates the number of signals that are
         requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated.  Also
         see [<a href="./rfc4606" title='"Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Extensions for Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) Control"'>RFC4606</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4328" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Extensions for G.709 Optical Transport Networks Control"'>RFC4328</a>].

   (6)   Technology-specific label(s): as defined in [<a href="./rfc4606" title='"Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Extensions for Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) Control"'>RFC4606</a>],
         [<a href="./rfc6060" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Control of Ethernet Provider Backbone Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE)"'>RFC6060</a>], [<a href="./rfc6002" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Data Channel Switching Capable (DCSC) and Channel Set Label Extensions"'>RFC6002</a>], or [<a href="./rfc6205" title='"Generalized Labels for Lambda- Switch-Capable (LSC) Label Switching Routers"'>RFC6205</a>].

   (7)   End-to-End (E2E) path protection type: as defined in [<a href="./rfc4872" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions in Support of End-to-End Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Recovery"'>RFC4872</a>],
         e.g., 1+1 protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting,
         etc.

   (8)   Administrative group: as defined in [<a href="./rfc3630" title='"Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2"'>RFC3630</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Requirements%20on%20Path%20Computation%20Reply"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Requirements on Path Computation Reply</span>

   As described above, a PCE should compute the path that satisfies the
   constraints specified in the PCReq message.  Then, the PCE should
   send a PCRep message, including the computation result, to the PCC.
   For a Path Computation Reply message (PCRep) in GMPLS networks, there
   are some additional requirements.  The PCEP (PCE communication
   protocol) PCRep message must be extended to meet the following
   requirements.

   (1)  Path computation with concatenation

        In the case of path computation involving concatenation, when a
        PCE receives the PCReq message specifying the concatenation
        constraints described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>, the PCE should compute a
        path accordingly.

        For path computation involving contiguous concatenation, a
        single route is required, and all the interfaces along the route
        should support contiguous concatenation capability.  Therefore,
        the PCE should compute a path based on the contiguous
        concatenation capability of each interface and only one ERO that
        should carry the route information for the response.

        For path computation involving virtual concatenation, only the
        ingress/egress interfaces need to support virtual concatenation
        capability, and there may be diverse routes for the different
        member signals.  Therefore, multiple EROs may be needed for the
        response.  Each ERO may represent the route of one or multiple
        member signals.  When one ERO represents multiple member
        signals, the number must be specified.

   (2)  Label constraint

        In the case that a PCC does not specify the exact label(s) when
        requesting a label-restricted path and the PCE is capable of
        performing the route computation and label assignment
        computation procedure, the PCE needs to be able to specify the
        label of the path in a PCRep message.

        Wavelength restriction is a typical case of label restriction.
        More generally, label switching and selection constraints may
        apply in GMPLS-controlled networks, and a PCC may request a PCE
        to take label constraint into account and return an ERO
        containing the label or set of labels that fulfill the PCC
        request.

   (3)  Roles of the routes

        When a PCC specifies the protection type of an LSP, the PCE
        should compute the working route and the corresponding
        protection route(s).  Therefore, the PCRep should allow to
        distinguish the working (nominal) and the protection routes.
        According to these routes, the RSVP-TE procedure appropriately
        creates both the working and the protection LSPs, for example,
        with the ASSOCIATION object [<a href="./rfc6689" title='"Usage of the RSVP ASSOCIATION Object"'>RFC6689</a>].

   This document does not change any of the management or operational
   details for networks that utilize PCE.  (Please refer to [<a href="./rfc4655" title='"A Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture"'>RFC4655</a>]
   for manageability considerations for a PCE-based architecture.)
   However, this document proposes the introduction of several PCEP
   objects and data for the better integration of PCE with GMPLS
   networks.  Those protocol elements will need to be visible in any
   management tools that apply to the PCE, PCC, and PCEP.  That
   includes, but is not limited to, adding appropriate objects to
   existing PCE MIB modules that are used for modeling and monitoring
   PCEP deployments [<a href="#ref-PCEP-MIB" title='"PCE communication protocol (PCEP) Management Information Base"'>PCEP-MIB</a>].  Ideas for what objects are needed may
   be guided by the relevant GMPLS extensions in GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB
   [<a href="./rfc4802" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Management Information Base"'>RFC4802</a>].

   PCEP extensions to support GMPLS should be considered under the same

   list of security considerations in PCEP.  At the time [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>] was
