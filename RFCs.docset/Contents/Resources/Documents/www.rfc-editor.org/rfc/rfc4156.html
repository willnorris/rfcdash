Abstract

   This document specifies the wais Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme that was originally specified in <a href="./rfc1738">RFC 1738</a>.  The purpose of
   this document is to allow <a href="./rfc1738">RFC 1738</a> to be made obsolete while keeping
   the information about the scheme on standards track.


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   URIs were previously defined in <a href="./rfc2396">RFC 2396</a> [<a href="./rfc2396" title='"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC2396</a>], which was updated
   by <a href="./rfc3986">RFC 3986</a> [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].  Those documents also specify how to define
   schemes for URIs.

   The first definitions for many URI schemes appeared in <a href="./rfc1738">RFC 1738</a>
   [<a href="./rfc1738" title='"Uniform Resource Locators (URL)"'>RFC1738</a>].  Because that document has been made obsolete, this
   document copies the wais URI scheme from it to allow that material to
   remain on standards track.


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Scheme%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Scheme Definition</span>

   The WAIS URL scheme is used to designate WAIS databases, searches, or
   individual documents available from a WAIS database.  The WAIS
   protocol is described in <a href="./rfc1625">RFC 1625</a> [<a href="./rfc1625" title='"WAIS over Z39.50-1988"'>RFC1625</a>].  Although the WAIS
   protocol is based on Z39.50-1988, the WAIS URL scheme is not intended
   for use with arbitrary Z39.50 services.

   Historical note: The WAIS protocol was not widely implemented and
   almost no WAIS servers are in use today.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4156">RFC 4156</a>                  The wais URI Scheme                August 2005</span>


   A WAIS URL takes one of the following forms:

      wais://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;database&gt;
      wais://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;database&gt;?&lt;search&gt;
      wais://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;database&gt;/&lt;wtype&gt;/&lt;wpath&gt;

   If :&lt;port&gt; is omitted, the port defaults to 210.  The first form
   designates a WAIS database that is available for searching.  The
   second form designates a particular search. &lt;database&gt; is the name of
   the WAIS database being queried.

   The third form designates a particular document, within a WAIS
   database, to be retrieved.  In this form &lt;wtype&gt; is the WAIS
   designation of the type of the object.  Many WAIS implementations
   require that a client know the "type" of an object prior to
   retrieval; the type is returned along with the internal object
   identifier in the search response.  The &lt;wtype&gt; is included in the
   URL in order to give the client interpreting the URL adequate
   information to actually retrieve the document.

   The &lt;wpath&gt; of a WAIS URL consists of the WAIS document-id.  The WAIS
   document-id should be treated opaquely; it may only be decomposed by
   the server that issued it.

   Many security considerations for URI schemes are discussed in
   [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].  There are no security considerations listed in [<a href="./rfc1625" title='"WAIS over Z39.50-1988"'>RFC1625</a>],
   but it should be noted that there is no privacy nor authentication
   specified in the WAIS protocol.
