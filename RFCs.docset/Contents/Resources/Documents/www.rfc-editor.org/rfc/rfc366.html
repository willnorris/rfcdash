RFC # 366                                        11 July 1972

Obsoletes:  None

                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

     This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from June 19
to June 30.

     No testing was done on June 20 due to an attempt to install the
new IMP system.

     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing as
they are presently intended to be users only. Included here are the
Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, RADC,
NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, ARPA, and BBN*).  This category also
includes the Network Control Center computer (Network address 5) which
is used solely for gathering statistics from the Network. Finally,
included among these Hosts are the following:
          Network
          Address            Site                 Computer
          -------            ----                 --------

              7             Rand                  IBM - 360/65
             73             Harvard               PDP-1
            138             Lincoln               TSP
             12             Illinois              PDP-11
             19             NBS                   PDP-11
             23             USC                   IBM-360/44

     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status
for this period.

*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as
such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used
to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)

F = Full (Destination Host opened a connection, informed user that all
    Network ports were in use, and immediately closed the connection.)

H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)

R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
    connection within 60 seconds.)
_______________
*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a Network
 Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to
 test NETRJS. We are assuming that initial connection to the NETRJS
 logger indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
#These sites advertise that they may not have their system available
 at these times.
