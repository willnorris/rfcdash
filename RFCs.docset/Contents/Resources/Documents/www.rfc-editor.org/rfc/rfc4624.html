Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   used for managing Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) (<a href="./rfc3618">RFC</a>

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   used for managing Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)"'>1</a>]
   speakers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20Internet-Standard%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework</span>

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="./rfc3410#section-7">section 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework"'>7</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>4</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>5</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>6</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   This MIB module contains four scalars and four tables, one
   deprecated.  The tables are:

   o  The deprecated Requests Table, containing the longest-match table
      used to determine the peer to send SA-Requests to for a given
      group.  This table is deprecated because Requests were removed
      from MSDP before it became an RFC.

   o  The Peer Table, containing information on the system's peers.

   o  The Source-Active (SA) Cache Table, containing the SA cache
      entries.

   o  The Mesh Group Table, containing the list of MSDP mesh groups to
      which this system belongs.

   This MIB module uses the IpAddress SYNTAX, making it only suitable
   for IPv4 systems.  Although the desired direction for MIBs is to use
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs to allow both IPv4 and IPv6 (and
   future formats as well), the MSDP protocol itself is IPv4-only, and
   the MSDP working group made an explicit decision not to create an
   IPv6 version of the protocol.

   This MIB module is somewhat disorganized, with scalars before and
   after tables, holes in the OID space, tables with the RowStatus in
   the middle, and so on.  This is because objects were added and
   removed as necessary as the MSDP protocol evolved, and the plan was
   to renumber the whole MIB when moving to the standard mib-2 tree.
   The MSDP Working Group then changed direction, publishing the MSDP
   protocol as Experimental.  Since there were existing implementations
   using the strange object order under the experimental OID, the WG
   decided not to renumber the MIB and to publish it as experimental,
   keeping the experimental OID.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   msdpEnabled
      Obviously, by modifying msdpEnabled, an attacker could simply
      disable MSDP processing on the router.

   msdpCacheLifetime
      If allowed to modify msdpCacheLifetime, an attacker could set the
      value to a value lower than a peer's refresh interval, causing all
      state to time out and be refreshed.

   msdpRequestsPeer, msdpRequestsStatus
      If allowed to modify entries in the msdpRequestsTable, an attacker
      could cause this system to send MSDP Requests to an unknown
      system, or could simply remove the proper configuration.  Note
      that the msdpRequestsTable is deprecated, and the MSDP Request
      functionality is not in the published MSDP spec.

   msdpPeerTable objects
      The writable objects in the msdpPeerTable are:
      msdpPeerLocalAddress, msdpPeerConnectRetryInterval,
      msdpPeerHoldTimeConfigured, msdpPeerKeepAliveConfigured,
      msdpPeerDataTtl, msdpPeerProcessRequestsFrom, msdpPeerStatus, and
      msdpPeerEncapsulationType.  Of these, modifying msdpPeerIpAddress
      and msdpPeerStatus could cause a changed or deleted peer
      configuration.  Modifying any of the other values could cause
      subtle protocol misbehavior.

   msdpSACacheStatus
      This writable object can be used to remove valid values from the
      router's SA cache.

   msdpRPAddress
      Changing this object can cause a failure of the Peer-RPF rules for
      SA messages sourced by this router.

   msdpMeshGroupStatus
      This object can be used to change this router's idea of its mesh
      group membership and those of its peers.  Misconfiguration of mesh
      groups can cause subtle protocol misbehavior.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4624">RFC 4624</a>                        MSDP MIB                    October 2006</span>


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The entire msdpPeerTable.  Peer information can result in
      discovering internal topology, which many want to keep secret.

   o  msdpNumSACacheEntries.  The size of the SA Cache could reveal
      whether this system has MSDP entries for public and/or private
      groups.

   o  The entire msdpSACacheTable.  The active sources and groups in a
      network could be private.

   o  The entire msdpMeshGroupTable.  This information can also lead to
      internal topology information.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>6</a>], Section 8), including full
   support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication
   and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   Since this MIB is for an experimental protocol, it uses an
   experimental OID.
