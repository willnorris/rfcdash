Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo

   This RFC is NOT a standard. It is an official public record of a

   conjunction with the Photuris key management protocol.

Purpose

   This Request for Comments records a grant by IBM Corporation to
   permit the conditional free use of one of its patents.  This grant is
   made to help facilitate adoption of the Internet Key Management
   Protocol contribution IBM has offered to the IETF. It should be noted

   made in this RFC and parties have it even if they do not request a
   confirmation from IBM.

A Grant of Rights to Use IBM US Patent 5,148,479

   IBM hereby covenants that it will not assert its US Patent 5,148,479
   or its non-US counterparts against any party that implements Photuris
   or any derivative that includes IBM's IKMP contribution, and operates
   in compliance with Photuris or such derivative, when Photuris or such
   derivative is employed in connection with any Internet Protocol.

   This grant of rights will terminate with respect to any party that
   asserts a patent it owns, directly or indirectly, against IBM for
   IBM's implementation of and operation in compliance with Photuris or
   any derivative, as defined above.  The termination will occur as of
   the date the patent is asserted against IBM.
