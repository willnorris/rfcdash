Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is
   unlimited.

Abstract

   This bibliography offers a short list of recent information resources
   that will help the network novice become familiar with the Internet,
   including its associated networks, resources, protocols, and history.
   This FYI RFC includes references to free sources of information
   available on-line as well as traditional publications.  A short
   section at the end includes information for accessing the on-line
   files.  This FYI is intentionally brief so it can be easily used as a
   handout by user services personnel.

Acknowledgments

   This document is based upon the work of the User Documents Working
   Group in the User Services Area of the Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF).

Bibliography of Introductory Readings

   The following list includes a number of sources for learning about
   the Internet.  If you have more questions about the Internet, the
   best source of information is your network service provider.  For
   those interested in finding out about getting Internet connectivity,
   the books listed will help you locate a network service provider.

      * Items with an asterisk are available at no charge on-line on the
        Internet--see the final section for information on how to obtain
        these.
