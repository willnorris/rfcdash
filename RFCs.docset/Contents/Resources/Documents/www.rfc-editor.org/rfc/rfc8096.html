               <span class="h1">The IPv6-Specific MIB Modules Are Obsolete</span>

Abstract

   In 2005-2006, the IPv6 MIB update group published updated versions of
   the IP-MIB, UDP-MIB, TCP-MIB, and IP-FORWARD-MIB modules, which use
   the InetAddressType/InetAddress construct to handle IPv4 and IPv6 in
   the same table.  This document contains versions of the obsoleted
   IPV6-MIB, IPV6-TC, IPV6-ICMP-MIB, IPV6-TCP-MIB, and IPV6-UDP-MIB
   modules for the purpose of updating MIB module repositories.  This
   document obsoletes RFCs 2452, 2454, 2465, and 2466 (i.e., the RFCs
   containing these MIBs) and reclassifies them as Historic.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8096">RFC 8096</a>                IPv6 MIB Modules Obsolete             April 2017</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Motivation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Motivation</span>

   In 2005-2006, the IPv6 MIB update group published updated versions of
   the IP-MIB [<a href="./rfc4293" title='"Management Information Base for the Internet Protocol (IP)"'>RFC4293</a>], UDP-MIB [<a href="./rfc4113" title='"Management Information Base for the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)"'>RFC4113</a>], TCP-MIB [<a href="./rfc4022" title='"Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)"'>RFC4022</a>], and IP-
   FORWARD-MIB [<a href="./rfc4292" title='"IP Forwarding Table MIB"'>RFC4292</a>] modules, which use the InetAddressType/
   InetAddress construct to handle IPv4 and IPv6 in the same table.  The
   RFC Editor marked these documents as obsoleting the corresponding
   IPV6-MIBs, but the extracted content of these MIBs never changed in
   MIB repositories, and the original RFCs (as is normal IETF policy)
   never changed from being Proposed Standard.

   Note that the timeline of these MIB modules is as shown below (and it
   is the added support for IPv6 in the later revision of the original
   modules that people often overlook).

                          IPv6-MIB--------X
                                           \
                 IP-MIB-------------------IP-MIB---&gt;

   This causes an unclear situation when simply looking at MIB
   repositories, so we are simply republishing these MIB modules with
   the Structure of Management Information (SMI) status changed to
   obsolete.  This is an unusual step, and it is not the intended path
   with every obsolete MIB module; the special history of these modules
   led to this special step.

         zero is object-specific and must therefore be

         which uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of
         zero might include situations where interface was
         unknown, or when none or all interfaces need to be
