   [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>], and [<a href="./rfc5508" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP"'>RFC5508</a>] contributed to enhance Network
   Address Translation (NAT) interoperability and conformance.
   Operational experience gained through widespread deployment and
   evolution of NAT indicates that some areas of the original documents
   need further clarification or updates.  This document provides such
   clarifications and updates.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Scope</span>

   The goal of this document is to clarify and update the set of
   requirements listed in [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>], and [<a href="./rfc5508" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP"'>RFC5508</a>].  The
   document focuses exclusively on NAT44.

   The scope of this document has been set so that it does not create
   new requirements beyond those specified in the documents cited above.

   Requirements related to Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) are defined in
   [<a href="./rfc6888" title='"Common Requirements for Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs)"'>RFC6888</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology defined in
   [<a href="./rfc2663" title='"IP Network Address Translator (NAT) Terminology and Considerations"'>RFC2663</a>], [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>], and [<a href="./rfc5508" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP"'>RFC5508</a>].

   In this document, the term "NAT" refers to both "Basic NAT" and
   "Network Address/Port Translator (NAPT)" (see <a href="./rfc4787#section-3">Section 3 of
   [RFC4787]</a>).  As a reminder, Basic NAT and NAPT are two variations of
   traditional NAT in that translation in Basic NAT is limited to IP
   addresses alone, whereas translation in NAPT is extended to include
   IP addresses and transport identifiers (such as a TCP/UDP port or
   ICMP query ID); refer to <a href="./rfc3022#section-2">Section 2 of [RFC3022]</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20TCP%20Session%20Tracking"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  TCP Session Tracking</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC5382">RFC5382</a>] specifies TCP timers associated with various connection
   states but does not specify the TCP state machine a NAT44 should
   follow as a basis to apply such timers.

   Update:  The TCP state machine depicted in Figure 1, adapted from
      [<a href="./rfc6146" title='"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6146</a>], SHOULD be implemented by a NAT for TCP session tracking
      purposes.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7857">RFC 7857</a>         Updates to NAT Behavioral Requirements       April 2016</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20TCP%20Transitory%20Connection%20Idle-Timeout"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  TCP Transitory Connection Idle-Timeout</span>

   The transitory connection idle-timeout is defined as the minimum time
   a TCP connection in the partially open or closing phases must remain
   idle before the NAT considers the associated session a candidate for
   removal (REQ-5 of [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>]).  However, [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>] does not clearly
   state whether these can be configured separately.

   Clarification:  This document clarifies that a NAT SHOULD provide
      different configurable parameters for configuring the open and
      closing idle timeouts.

      To accommodate deployments that consider a partially open timeout
      of 4 minutes as being excessive from a security standpoint, a NAT
      MAY allow the configured timeout to be less than 4 minutes.
      However, a minimum default transitory connection idle-timeout of 4
      minutes is RECOMMENDED.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20TCP%20RST"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  TCP RST</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC5382">RFC5382</a>] leaves the handling of TCP RST packets unspecified.

   Update:  This document adopts a similar default behavior as in
      [<a href="./rfc6146" title='"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6146</a>].  Concretely, when the NAT receives a TCP RST matching
      an existing mapping, it MUST translate the packet according to the
      NAT mapping entry.  Moreover, the NAT SHOULD wait for 4 minutes
      before deleting the session and removing any state associated with
      it if no packets are received during that 4-minute timeout.

      Notes:

      *  Admittedly, the NAT has to verify whether received TCP RST
         packets belong to a connection.  This verification check is
         required to avoid off-path attacks.

      *  If the NAT immediately removes the NAT mapping upon receipt of
         a TCP RST message, stale connections may be maintained by
         endpoints if the first RST message is lost between the NAT and
         the recipient.

   REQ-1 from [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>] and REQ-1 from [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>] specify a specific port
   overlapping behavior; that is, the external IP address and port can
   be reused for connections originating from the same internal source
   IP address and port irrespective of the destination.  This is known
   as Endpoint-Independent Mapping (EIM).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7857">RFC 7857</a>         Updates to NAT Behavioral Requirements       April 2016</span>


   Update:  This document clarifies that this port overlapping behavior
      may be extended to connections originating from different internal
      source IP addresses and ports as long as their destinations are
      different.

      The following mechanism MAY be implemented by a NAT:

         If destination addresses and ports are different for outgoing
         connections started by local clients, a NAT MAY assign the same
         external port as the source ports for the connections.  The
         port overlapping mechanism manages mappings between external
         packets and internal packets by looking at and storing their
         5-tuple (protocol, source address, source port, destination
         address, and destination port).

      This enables concurrent use of a single NAT external port for
      multiple transport sessions, which allows a NAT to successfully
      process packets in a network that has a limited number of IP
      addresses (e.g., deployment with a high address space
      multiplicative factor (refer to <a href="./rfc6269#appendix-B">Appendix B of [RFC6269]</a>)).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Address%20Pooling%20Paired%20%28APP%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Address Pooling Paired (APP)</span>

   The "IP address pooling" behavior of "Paired" (APP) was recommended
   in REQ-2 from [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], but the behavior when an external IPv4 runs
   out of ports was left undefined.

   Clarification:  This document clarifies that if APP is enabled, new
      sessions from a host that already has a mapping associated with an
      external IP that ran out of ports SHOULD be dropped.  A
      configuration parameter MAY be provided to allow a NAT to start
      using ports from another external IP address when the one that
      anchored the APP mapping ran out of ports.  Tweaking this
      configuration parameter is a trade-off between service continuity
      and APP strict enforcement.  Note, this behavior is sometimes
      referred to as "soft-APP".

      As a reminder, the recommendation for the particular case of a CGN
      is that an implementation must use the same external IP address
      mapping for all sessions associated with the same internal IP
      address, be they TCP, UDP, ICMP, something else, or a mix of
      different protocols [<a href="./rfc6888" title='"Common Requirements for Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs)"'>RFC6888</a>].

   Update:  This behavior SHOULD apply also for TCP.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7857">RFC 7857</a>         Updates to NAT Behavioral Requirements       April 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Endpoint-Independent%20Mapping%20%28EIM%29%20Protocol%20Independence"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Endpoint-Independent Mapping (EIM) Protocol Independence</span>

   REQ-1 from [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>] and REQ-1 from [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>] do not specify whether
   EIM are protocol dependent or protocol independent.  For example, if
   an outbound TCP SYN creates a mapping, it is left undefined whether
   outbound UDP packets can reuse such mapping.

   Update:  EIM mappings SHOULD be protocol dependent.  A configuration
      parameter MAY be provided to allow protocols that multiplex TCP
      and UDP over the same source IP address and port number to use a
      single mapping.  The default value of this configuration parameter
      MUST be protocol-dependent EIM.

      This update is consistent with the stateful Network Address and
      Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64)
      [<a href="./rfc6146" title='"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6146</a>] that clearly specifies three binding information bases
      (TCP, UDP, and ICMP).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Endpoint-Independent%20Filtering%20%28EIF%29%20Protocol%20Independence"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) Protocol Independence</span>

   REQ-8 from [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>] and REQ-3 from [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>] do not specify whether
   mappings with Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) are protocol
   independent or protocol dependent.  For example, if an outbound TCP
   SYN creates a mapping, it is left undefined whether inbound UDP
   packets matching that mapping should be accepted or rejected.

   Update:  EIF filtering SHOULD be protocol dependent.  A configuration
      parameter MAY be provided to make it protocol independent.  The
      default value of this configuration parameter MUST be protocol-
      dependent EIF.

      This behavior is aligned with the update in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

      Applications that can be transported over a variety of transport
      protocols and/or support transport fallback schemes won't
      experience connectivity failures if the NAT is configured with
      protocol-independent EIM and protocol-independent EIF.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Endpoint-Independent%20Filtering%20%28EIF%29%20Mapping%20Refresh"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) Mapping Refresh</span>

   The NAT mapping Refresh direction may have a "NAT Inbound refresh
   behavior" of "True" according to REQ-6 from [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], but [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>]
   does not clarify how this behavior applies to EIF mappings.  The
   issue in question is whether inbound packets that match an EIF
   mapping but do not create a new session due to a security policy
   should refresh the mapping timer.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7857">RFC 7857</a>         Updates to NAT Behavioral Requirements       April 2016</span>


   Clarification:  This document clarifies that even when a NAT has an
      inbound refresh behavior set to "TRUE", such packets SHOULD NOT
      refresh the mapping.  Otherwise, a simple attack of a packet every
      two minutes can keep the mapping indefinitely.

   Update:  This behavior SHOULD apply also for TCP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.1.%20%20Outbound%20Mapping%20Refresh%20and%20Error%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" id="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Outbound Mapping Refresh and Error Packets</span>

   Update:  In the case of NAT outbound refresh behavior, ICMP Errors or
      TCP RST outbound packets sent as a response to inbound packets
      SHOULD NOT refresh the mapping.  Other packets that indicate the
      host is not interested in receiving packets MAY be configurable to
      also not refresh state, such as a Session Traversal Utilities for
      NAT (STUN) error response [<a href="./rfc5389" title='"Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5389</a>] or IKE INVALID_SYNTAX
      [<a href="./rfc7296" title='"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC7296</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Port%20Parity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Port Parity</span>

   Update:  A NAT MAY disable port parity preservation for all dynamic
      mappings.  Nevertheless, A NAT SHOULD support means to explicitly
      request to preserve port parity (e.g., [<a href="./rfc7753" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP) Extension for Port-Set Allocation"'>RFC7753</a>]).

      Note: According to [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>], dynamic mappings are said to be
      dynamic in the sense that they are created on demand, either
      implicitly or explicitly:

      1.  Implicit dynamic mappings refer to mappings that are created
          as a side effect of traffic such as an outgoing TCP SYN or
          outgoing UDP packet.  Implicit dynamic mappings usually have a
          finite lifetime, though this lifetime is generally not known
          to the client using them.

      2.  Explicit dynamic mappings refer to mappings that are created
          as a result, for example, of explicit Port Control Protocol
          (PCP) MAP and PEER requests.  Explicit dynamic mappings have a
          finite lifetime, and this lifetime is communicated to the
          client.

   Update:  A NAT SHOULD follow the recommendations specified in
      <a href="./rfc6056#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC6056]</a>, especially:

         A NAPT that does not implement port preservation [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>]
         [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>] SHOULD obfuscate selection of the ephemeral port of a
         packet when it is changed during translation of that packet.




<span class="grey">Penno, et al.             Best Current Practice                 [Page 9]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-10"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7857">RFC 7857</a>         Updates to NAT Behavioral Requirements       April 2016</span>


         A NAPT that does implement port preservation SHOULD obfuscate
         the ephemeral port of a packet only if the port must be changed
         as a result of the port being already in use for some other
         session.

         A NAPT that performs parity preservation and that must change
         the ephemeral port during translation of a packet SHOULD
         obfuscate the ephemeral ports.  The algorithms described in
         this document could be easily adapted such that the parity is
         preserved (i.e., force the lowest order bit of the resulting
         port number to 0 or 1 according to whether even or odd parity
         is desired).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.%20%20IP%20Identification%20%28IP%20ID%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" id="section-10">10</a>.  IP Identification (IP ID)</span>

   Update:  A NAT SHOULD handle the Identification field of translated
      IPv4 packets as specified in <a href="./rfc6864#section-5.3.1">Section 5.3.1 of [RFC6864]</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/11.%20%20ICMP%20Query%20Mappings%20Timeout"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11" id="section-11">11</a>.  ICMP Query Mappings Timeout</span>

   <a href="./rfc5508#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC5508]</a> specifies that ICMP Query mappings are to be
   maintained by a NAT.  However, the specification doesn't discuss
   Query mapping timeout values.  <a href="./rfc5508#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of [RFC5508]</a> only
   discusses ICMP Query session timeouts.

   Update:  ICMP Query mappings MAY be deleted once the last session
      using the mapping is deleted.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/12.%20%20Hairpinning%20Support%20for%20ICMP%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12" id="section-12">12</a>.  Hairpinning Support for ICMP Packets</span>

   REQ-7 from [<a href="./rfc5508" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP"'>RFC5508</a>] specifies that a NAT enforcing Basic NAT must
   support traversal of hairpinned ICMP Query sessions.

   Clarification:  This implicitly means that address mappings from
      external address to internal address (similar to Endpoint-
      Independent Filters) must be maintained to allow inbound ICMP
      Query sessions.  If an ICMP Query is received on an external
      address, a NAT can then translate to an internal IP.

   REQ-7 from [<a href="./rfc5508" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP"'>RFC5508</a>] specifies that all NATs must support the
   traversal of hairpinned ICMP Error messages.

   Clarification:  This behavior requires a NAT to maintain address
      mappings from external IP address to internal IP address in
      addition to the ICMP Query mappings described in <a href="./rfc5508#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of
      [RFC5508]</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7857">RFC 7857</a>         Updates to NAT Behavioral Requirements       April 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/13.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-13" id="section-13">13</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   NAT behavioral considerations are discussed in [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>],
   and [<a href="./rfc5508" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP"'>RFC5508</a>].

   Because some of the clarifications and updates (e.g., <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) are
   inspired from NAT64, the security considerations discussed in
   <a href="./rfc6146#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC6146]</a> apply also for this specification.

   The update in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> allows for an optimized NAT resource usage.
   In order to avoid service disruption, the NAT must not invoke this
   functionality unless the packets are to be sent to distinct
   destination addresses.

   Some of the updates (e.g., Sections <a href="#section-7">7</a>, <a href="#section-9">9</a>, and <a href="#section-11">11</a>) allow for increased
   security compared to [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>], and [<a href="./rfc5508" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP"'>RFC5508</a>].
   Particularly,

   o  the updates in Sections <a href="#section-7">7</a> and <a href="#section-11">11</a> prevent an illegitimate node to
      maintain mappings activated in the NAT while these mappings should
      be cleared, and

   o  port randomization (<a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>) complicates tracking hosts located
      behind a NAT.

   Sections <a href="#section-4">4</a> and <a href="#section-12">12</a> propose updates that increase the serviceability of
   a host located behind a NAT.  These updates do not introduce any
   additional security concerns to [<a href="./rfc4787" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], [<a href="./rfc5382" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>], and [<a href="./rfc5508" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP"'>RFC5508</a>].

   The updates in Sections <a href="#section-5">5</a> and <a href="#section-6">6</a> allow for a better NAT transparency
   from an application standpoint.  Hosts that require a restricted
   filtering behavior should enable specific policies (e.g., Access
   Control List (ACL)) either locally or by soliciting a dedicated
   security device (e.g., firewall).  How a host updates its filtering
   policies is out of scope of this document.

   The update in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> induces security concerns that are specific
   to the protocol used to interact with the NAT.  For example, if PCP
   is used to explicitly request parity preservation for a given
   mapping, the security considerations discussed in [<a href="./rfc6887" title='"Port Control Protocol (PCP)"'>RFC6887</a>] should be
   taken into account.

   The update in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> may have undesired effects on the
   performance of the NAT in environments in which fragmentation is
   massively experienced.  Such an issue may be used as an attack vector
   against NATs.
