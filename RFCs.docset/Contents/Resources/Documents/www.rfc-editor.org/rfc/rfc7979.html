  <span class="h1">Response to the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG)</span>
    <span class="h1">Request for Proposals on the IANA Protocol Parameters Registries</span>

Abstract

   The U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration
   (NTIA) solicited a request from the Internet Corporation for Assigned
   Names and Numbers (ICANN) to propose how the NTIA should end its
   oversight of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   functions.  After broad consultations, ICANN in turn created the IANA
   Stewardship Transition Coordination Group.  That group solicited
   proposals for the three major IANA functions: names, numbers, and
   protocol parameters.  This document contains the IETF response to
   that solicitation for protocol parameters.  It was included in an
   aggregate response to the NTIA alongside those for names and
   numbering resources that are being developed by their respective
   operational communities.  A reference to that response may be found
   in the introduction, and additional correspondence is included in the
   Appendix.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7979">RFC 7979</a>                    IANA ICG Response                August 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20IETF%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  IETF Introduction</span>

   In March of 2014, the U.S. National Telecommunications and
   Information Administration (NTIA) announced its intent to transition
   oversight of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions
   [<a href="#ref-NTIA-Announce">NTIA-Announce</a>].  In that announcement, NTIA asked the Internet
   Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to establish a
   process to deliver a proposal for transition.  As part of that
   process, the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was
   formed.  The charter for the ICG can be found in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  The ICG
   in turn solicited proposals regarding post-transition arrangements
   from the names, numbers, and protocol parameters communities in order
   to put forth a proposal to the NTIA.  The final request for proposal
   (RFP) can be found in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  The response from the ICG to the
   NTIA may be found at [<a href="#ref-ICG-Response">ICG-Response</a>].

   While there are interactions between all of the IANA functions and
   IETF standards, this document specifically addresses the protocol
   parameters registries function.  <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> (this section) contains an
   introduction that is sourced solely within the IETF.  <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>
   contains the questionnaire that was written by the ICG and a formal
   response by the IETF.  We have quoted questions from that
   questionnaire with "&gt;&gt;&gt; ", and we have prefaced answers to questions
   being asked with "IETF Response:".  Note that there are small changes
   to the questions asked in order to match the RFC format.

   We note that the following text was stated as a footnote in the
   original RFP:

             In this RFP, "IANA" refers to the functions currently
         specified in the agreement between NTIA and ICANN
         [http://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/iana-functions-purchase-order] as
         well as any other functions traditionally performed by the IANA
         functions operator. SAC-067
         [https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-067-en.pdf]
         provides one description of the many different meanings of the
         term "IANA" and may be useful reading in addition to the
         documents constituting the agreement itself.

   IETF Response:
                     Protocol Parameters

   This response states the existing practice of the IETF, and also
   represents the views of the Internet Architecture Board and the IETF.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; I. Description of Community's Use of IANA Functions
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; This section should list the specific, distinct IANA services
   &gt;&gt;&gt; or activities your community relies on. For each IANA service
   &gt;&gt;&gt; or activity on which your community relies, please provide the
   &gt;&gt;&gt; following:
   &gt;&gt;&gt; A description of the service or activity.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   Many IETF protocols make use of commonly defined protocol parameters.
   These parameters are used by implementers, who are the primary users
   of the IETF standards and other documents.  To ensure consistent
   interpretation of these parameter values by independent
   implementations, and to promote universal interoperability, these
   IETF protocol specifications define and require globally available
   registries containing the parameter values and a pointer to any
   associated documentation.  The IETF uses the IANA protocol parameters
   registries to store this information in a public location.  The IETF
   community presently accesses the protocol parameter registries via
   references based on the iana.org domain name, and makes use of the
   term "IANA" in the protocol parameter registry processes [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].

   ICANN currently operates the .ARPA top level domain on behalf of the
   Internet Architecture Board (IAB).  This zone is used for certain
   Internet infrastructure services that are delegated beneath it.  The
   IETF considers .ARPA part of the protocol parameters registries for
   purposes of this response.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; A description of the customer(s) of the service or activity.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   The IANA protocol parameters registries operator maintains the
   protocol parameters registries for the IETF in conformance with all
   relevant IETF policies, in accordance with the Memorandum of
   Understanding [<a href="./rfc2860" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>] and associated supplemental agreements that
   include service level agreements (SLAs) established between the IETF
   and ICANN [<a href="#ref-MOUSUP" title='"Supplements to RFC 2860 (the Memorandum of Understanding between the IETF and ICANN)"'>MOUSUP</a>].

   The IETF is a global organization that produces voluntary standards,
   whose mission is to produce high quality, relevant technical and
   engineering documents that influence the way people design, use, and
   manage the Internet in such a way as to make the Internet work better
   [<a href="./rfc3935" title='"A Mission Statement for the IETF"'>RFC3935</a>].  IETF standards are published in the RFC series.  The IETF
   is responsible for the key standards that are used on the Internet
   today, including IP, TCP, DNS, BGP, and HTTP, to name but a few.

   The IETF operates in an open and transparent manner [<a href="./rfc6852" title='"Affirmation of the Modern Paradigm for Standards"'>RFC6852</a>].  The
   processes that govern the IETF are also published in the RFC series.
   The Internet Standards Process is documented in [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>].  That
   document explains not only how standards are developed, but also how
   disputes about decisions are resolved.  <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a> has been amended a
   number of times [<a href="#ref-BCP9info" title='"Information on "'>BCP9info</a>].  The standards process can be amended in
   the same manner that standards are approved.  That is, someone
   proposes a change by submitting a temporary document known as an
   Internet-Draft, the community discusses it, and if rough consensus
   can be found the change is approved by the Internet Engineering
   Steering Group (IESG), who also have day-to-day responsibility for
   declaring IETF consensus on technical decisions, including those that
   affect the IANA protocol parameters registries.  Anyone may propose a
   change during a Last Call, and anyone may participate in the
   community discussion.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; What registries are involved in providing the service or
   &gt;&gt;&gt; activity.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   The protocol parameters registries are the product of IETF work.
   These also include the top-level registry for the entire IP address
   space and some of its sub-registries, autonomous system number space,
   and a number of special use registries with regard to domain names.
   For more detail please refer to the documentation in the "overlaps or
   interdependencies" section.

   Administration of the protocol parameters registries is the service
   that is provided to the IETF.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; A description of any overlaps or interdependencies between your
   &gt;&gt;&gt; IANA requirements and the functions required by other customer
   &gt;&gt;&gt; communities.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   In this context, the IETF considers "overlap" to be where there is in
   some way shared responsibility for a single registry across multiple
   organizations.  In this sense, there is no overlap between
   organizations because responsibility for each registry is carefully
   delineated.  There are, however, points of interaction between other
   organizations, and a few cases where the IETF may further define the
   scope of a registry for technical purposes.  This is the case with
   both names and numbers, as described in the paragraphs below.  In all
   cases, the IETF coordinates with the appropriate organizations.

   It is important to note that the IETF does not have formal
   membership.  The term "the IETF" includes anyone who wishes to
   participate in the IETF, and IETF participants may also be members of
   other communities.  Staff and participants from ICANN and the
   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) regularly participate in IETF
   activities.

   o  The IETF has specified a number of special use registries with
      regard to domain names.  These registries require coordination
      with ICANN as the policy authority for the DNS root, including
      community groups that are responsible for ICANN policy on domain
      names such as the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) and
      the Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO).  There are

<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-7"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7979">RFC 7979</a>                    IANA ICG Response                August 2016</span>


      already mechanisms in place to perform this coordination, and the
      capacity to modify those mechanisms to meet new conditions as they
      might arise.  [<a href="./rfc6761" title='"Special-Use Domain Names"'>RFC6761</a>]

   o  The IETF specifies the DNS protocol.  From time to time there have
      been and will be updates to that protocol.  As we make changes we
      will broadly consult the operational community about the impact of
      those changes, as we have done in the past.

   o  The IETF specifies minimum requirements for root servers.
      [<a href="./rfc2870" title='"Root Name Server Operational Requirements"'>RFC2870</a>] Those requirements are currently under review, in
      consultations with the root server community.

   o  The routing architecture has evolved over time, and is expected to
      continue to do so.  Such evolution may have an impact on
      appropriate IP address allocation strategies.  If and when that
      happens, the IETF will consult and coordinate with the RIR
      community, as we have done in the past.

   o  The IETF is responsible for policy relating to the entire IP
      address space and AS number space.  Through the IANA protocol
      parameters registries, the IETF delegates unicast IP address and
      AS number ranges to the RIRs [<a href="./rfc7020" title='"The Internet Numbers Registry System"'>RFC7020</a>],[<a href="./rfc7249" title='"Internet Numbers Registries"'>RFC7249</a>].  Special address
      allocation, such as multicast and anycast addresses, often require
      coordination.  Another example of IP addresses that are not
      administered by the RIR system is Unique Local Addresses (ULAs)
      [<a href="./rfc4193" title='"Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses"'>RFC4193</a>], where local networks employ a prefix that is not
      intended to be routed on the public Internet.  New special address
      allocations are added, from time to time, related to the evolution
      of the standards.  In all cases, these special assignments are
      listed in the IANA protocol paramters registries.

   o  The IETF maintains sub-registries for special IPv4 and IPv6
      assignments.  These are specified in [<a href="./rfc3307" title='"Allocation Guidelines for IPv6 Multicast Addresses"'>RFC3307</a>], [<a href="./rfc5771" title='"IANA Guidelines for IPv4 Multicast Address Assignments"'>RFC5771</a>], and
      [<a href="./rfc6890" title='"Special-Purpose IP Address Registries"'>RFC6890</a>].  The IETF coordinates such assignments with the RIRs.

   o  Changes to IETF standards may have impact on operations of RIRs
      and service providers.  A recent example is the extensions to BGP
      to carry the Autonomous System numbers as four-octet entities
      [<a href="./rfc6793" title='"BGP Support for Four-Octet Autonomous System (AS) Number Space"'>RFC6793</a>].  It is important to note that this change occurred out
      of operational necessity, and it demonstrated strong alignment
      between the RIRs and the IETF.

   &gt;&gt;&gt; II.  Existing, Pre-Transition Arrangements

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; This section should describe how existing IANA-related
   &gt;&gt;&gt; arrangements work, prior to the transition.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; A. Policy Sources
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; This section should identify the specific source(s) of policy
   &gt;&gt;&gt; which must be followed by the IANA functions operator in its
   &gt;&gt;&gt; conduct of the services or activities described above.  If there
   &gt;&gt;&gt; are distinct sources of policy or policy development for
   &gt;&gt;&gt; different IANA activities, then please describe these
   &gt;&gt;&gt; separately. For each source of policy or policy development,
   &gt;&gt;&gt; please provide the following:
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; Which IANA service or activity (identified in Section I) is
   &gt;&gt;&gt; affected.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   The protocol parameters registries.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; A description of how policy is developed and established and
   &gt;&gt;&gt; who is involved in policy development and establishment.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   Policy for overall management of the protocol parameters registries
   is stated in [<a href="./rfc6220" title='"Defining the Role and Function of IETF Protocol Parameter Registry Operators"'>RFC6220</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  The first of these documents
   explains the model for how the registries are to be operated, how
   policy is set, and how oversight takes place.  <a href="./rfc5226">RFC 5226</a> specifies the
   policies that specification writers may employ when they define new
   protocol registries in the "IANA Considerations" section of each
   specification.  All policies at the IETF begin with a proposal in the
   form of an Internet-Draft.  Anyone may submit such a proposal.  If
   there is sufficient interest, a working group whose scope includes
   the proposed work may choose to adopt it, the IESG may choose to
   create a working group, or an Area Director may choose to sponsor the
   draft.  In any case, anyone may comment on the proposal as it
   progresses.  A proposal cannot be passed by the IESG unless it enjoys
   sufficient community support as to indicate rough consensus
   [<a href="./rfc7282" title='"On Consensus and Humming in the IETF"'>RFC7282</a>].  In each case, a "Last Call" is made so that there is
   notice of any proposed change to a policy or process.  Anyone may

   comment during a Last Call.  For example, this process is currently
   being used to update <a href="./rfc5226">RFC 5226</a> [<a href="#ref-I-D.leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis">I-D.leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis</a>].

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; A description of how disputes about policy are resolved.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   Most disputes are handled at the lowest level through the working
   group and rough consensus processes.  Should anyone disagree with any
   action, <a href="./rfc2026#section-6.5">Section 6.5 of [RFC2026]</a> specifies a multi-level conflict
   resolution and appeals process that includes the responsible Area
   Director, the IESG, and the IAB.  Should appeals be upheld, an
   appropriate remedy is applied.  In the case where someone claims that
   the procedures themselves are insufficient or inadequate in some way
   to address a circumstance, one may appeal an IAB decision to the
   Internet Society Board of Trustees.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; References to documentation of policy development and dispute
   &gt;&gt;&gt; resolution processes.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   As mentioned above, <a href="./rfc2026#section-6.5">[RFC2026] Section 6.5</a> specifies a conflict
   resolution and appeals process.  [<a href="./rfc2418" title='"IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures"'>RFC2418</a>] specifies working group
   procedures.  Note that both of these documents have been amended in
   later RFCs as indicated in the [<a href="#ref-RFC-INDEX">RFC-INDEX</a>].

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; B. Oversight and Accountability
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; This section should describe all the ways in which oversight is
   &gt;&gt;&gt; conducted over IANA functions operator's provision of the
   &gt;&gt;&gt; services and activities listed in Section I and all the ways in
   &gt;&gt;&gt; which IANA functions operator is currently held accountable for

   IETF Response:

   The protocol parameters registries.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; If not all policy sources identified in Section II.A are
   &gt;&gt;&gt; affected, identify which ones are affected.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   All policy sources relating to the protocol parameters registry are
   affected.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; A description of the entity or entities that provide oversight
   &gt;&gt;&gt; or perform accountability functions, including how individuals
   &gt;&gt;&gt; are selected or removed from participation in those entities.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is an oversight body of the
   IETF whose responsibilities include, among other things, confirming
   appointment of IESG members, managing appeals as discussed above,
   management of certain domains, including .ARPA [<a href="./rfc3172" title='"Management Guidelines &amp; Operational Requirements for the Address and Routing Parameter Area Domain ("'>RFC3172</a>], and general
   architectural guidance to the broader community.  The IAB must
   approve the appointment of an organization to act as IANA operator on
   behalf of the IETF.  The IAB is also responsible for establishing
   liaison relationships with other organizations on behalf of the IETF.
   The IAB's charter is to be found in [<a href="./rfc2850" title='"Charter of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)"'>RFC2850</a>].

   The IAB members are selected and may be recalled through a Nominating
   Committee (NOMCOM) process, which is described in [<a href="./rfc3777" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>] and its
   updates.  This process provides for selection of active members of
   the community who themselves agree upon a slate of candidates.  The
   active members are chosen randomly from volunteers with a history of
   participation in the IETF, with limits regarding having too many
   active members with the same affiliation.  The selection of the
   active members is performed in a manner that makes it possible for
   anyone to verify that the correct procedure was followed.  The slate
   of candidates selected by the active members are sent to the Internet
   Society Board of Trustees for confirmation.  In general, members are
   appointed for terms of two years.  The IAB selects its own chair.

   The IAB provides oversight of the protocol parameters registries of
   the IETF, and is responsible for selecting appropriate operator(s)
   and related per-registry arrangements.  Especially when relationships

   among protocols call for it, registries are at times operated by, or
   in conjunction with, other bodies.  Unless the IAB or IETF has
   concluded that special treatment is needed, the operator for
   registries is currently ICANN.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; A description of the mechanism (e.g., contract, reporting
   &gt;&gt;&gt; scheme, auditing scheme, etc.). This should include a
   &gt;&gt;&gt; description of the consequences of the IANA functions operator
   &gt;&gt;&gt; not meeting the standards established by the mechanism, the
   &gt;&gt;&gt; extent to which the output of the mechanism is transparent and
   &gt;&gt;&gt; the terms under which the mechanism may change.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   A memorandum of understanding (MoU) between ICANN and the IETF
   community has been in place since 2000.  It can be found in
   [<a href="./rfc2860" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>].  The MoU defines the work to be carried out by the IANA
   functions operator for the IETF and the Internet Research Task Force
   (IRTF), a peer organization to the IETF that focuses on
   research.[<a href="./rfc2014" title='"IRTF Research Group Guidelines and Procedures"'>RFC2014</a>] Each year a service level agreement is negotiated
   that supplements the MoU.

   Day-to-day administration and contract management is the
   responsibility of the IETF Administrative Director (IAD).  The IETF
   Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) oversees the IAD.  The
   members of the IAOC are also the trustees of the IETF Trust, whose
   main purpose is to hold certain intellectual property for the benefit
   of the IETF as a whole.  IAOC members are appointed by the Internet
   Society Board of Trustees, the IAB, the IESG, and the NOMCOM
   [<a href="./rfc4071" title='"Structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)"'>RFC4071</a>].  The IAOC works with the IANA functions operator to
   establish annual IANA performance metrics [<a href="#ref-METRICS" title='"Performance Standards Metrics Report"'>METRICS</a>] and operational
   procedures, and the resulting document is adopted as an supplement to
   the MoU each year [<a href="#ref-MOUSUP" title='"Supplements to RFC 2860 (the Memorandum of Understanding between the IETF and ICANN)"'>MOUSUP</a>].  Starting from 2014, in accordance with
   these supplements, an annual audit is performed to ensure that
   protocol parameter requests are being processed according to the
   established policies.  The conclusions of this audit will be
   available for anyone in the world to review.

   To date there have been no unresolvable disputes or issues between
   the IETF and the current IANA functions operator.  [<a href="./rfc2860" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>]
   specifies that should a technical dispute arise, "the IANA shall seek
   and follow technical guidance exclusively from the IESG."  In the
   unlikely event that a more difficult situation should arise, the IAOC
   and the IAB would engage ICANN management to address the matter.  The
   MoU also provides an option for either party to terminate the
   arrangement with six months notice.  Obviously such action would only

   be undertaken after serious consideration.  In that case a new IANA
   functions operator would be selected, and a new agreement with that
   operator would be established.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;  Jurisdiction(s) in which the mechanism applies and the legal

   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response

   This mechanism is global in nature.  The current agreement does not
   specify a jurisdiction.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;III.  Proposed Post-Transition Oversight and Accountability
   &gt;&gt;&gt;Arrangements

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; This section should describe what changes your community is
   &gt;&gt;&gt; proposing to the arrangements listed in Section II.B in light of
   &gt;&gt;&gt; the transition. If your community is proposing to replace one or
   &gt;&gt;&gt; more existing arrangements with new arrangements, that
   &gt;&gt;&gt; replacement should be explained and all of the elements listed
   &gt;&gt;&gt; in Section II.B should be described for the new
   &gt;&gt;&gt; arrangements. Your community should provide its rationale and
   &gt;&gt;&gt; justification for the new arrangements.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; If your community's proposal carries any implications for
   &gt;&gt;&gt; existing policy arrangements described in Section II.A, those
   &gt;&gt;&gt; implications should be described here.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; If your community is not proposing changes to arrangements
   &gt;&gt;&gt; listed in Section II.B, the rationale and justification for that
   &gt;&gt;&gt; choice should be provided here.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   No new organizations or structures are required.  Over the years
   since the creation of ICANN, the IETF, ICANN, and IAB have together
   created a system of agreements, policies, and oversight mechanisms
   that already cover what is needed.  This system has worked well
   without any operational involvement from the NTIA.

   IANA protocol parameters registry updates will continue to function
   day-to-day, as they have been doing for the last decade or more.  The
   IETF community is very satisfied with the current arrangement with




<span class="grey">Lear &amp; Housley                Informational                    [Page 12]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-13"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7979">RFC 7979</a>                    IANA ICG Response                August 2016</span>


   ICANN.  <a href="./rfc2860">RFC 2860</a> remains in force and has served the IETF community
   very well.  <a href="./rfc6220">RFC 6220</a> has laid out an appropriate service description
   and requirements.

   However in the absence of the NTIA contract a few new arrangements
   may be needed in order to ensure the IETF community's expectations
   are met.  Those expectations are the following:

   o  The protocol parameters registries are in the public domain.  It
      is the preference of the IETF community that all relevant parties
      acknowledge that fact as part of the transition.

   o  It is possible in the future that the operation of the protocol
      parameters registries may be transitioned from ICANN to subsequent
      operator(s).  It is the preference of the IETF community that, as
      part of the NTIA transition, ICANN acknowledge that it will carry
      out the obligations established under C.7.3 and I.61 of the
      current IANA functions contract between ICANN and the NTIA
      [<a href="#ref-NTIA-Contract">NTIA-Contract</a>] to achieve a smooth transition to subsequent
      operator(s), should the need arise.  Furthermore, in the event of
      a transition it is the expectation of the IETF community that
      ICANN, the IETF, and subsequent operator(s) will work together to
      minimize disruption in the use the protocol parameters registries
      or other resources currently located at iana.org.

   In developing our response we have been mindful of the following
   points that the IETF community has discussed over the last year
   [<a href="#ref-ProtoParamEvo14">ProtoParamEvo14</a>] that have led to the following guiding principles
   for IAB efforts that impact IANA protocol parameter registries.
   These principles must be taken together; their order is not
   significant.

   1.  The IETF protocol parameters registries function has been and
   continues to be capably provided by the Internet technical community.

   The strength and stability of the function and its foundation within
   the Internet technical community are both important given how
   critical protocol parameters are to the proper functioning of IETF
   protocols.

   We think the structures that sustain the protocol parameters
   registries function need to be strong enough that they can be offered
   independently by the Internet technical community, without the need
   for backing from external parties.  And we believe we largely are
   there already, although the system can be strengthened further, and
   continuous improvements are being made.





<span class="grey">Lear &amp; Housley                Informational                    [Page 13]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-14"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7979">RFC 7979</a>                    IANA ICG Response                August 2016</span>


   2.  The protocol parameters registries function requires openness,
   transparency, and accountability.

   Existing documentation of how the function is administered and
   overseen is good [<a href="./rfc2860" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>], [<a href="./rfc6220" title='"Defining the Role and Function of IETF Protocol Parameter Registry Operators"'>RFC6220</a>].  Further articulation and
   clarity may be beneficial.  It is important that the whole Internet
   community can understand how the function works, and that the
   processes for registering parameters and holding those who oversee
   the protocol parameters function accountable for following those
   processes are understood by all interested parties.  We are committed
   to making improvements here if necessary.

   3.  Any contemplated changes to the protocol parameters registries
   function should respect existing Internet community agreements.

   The protocol parameters registries function is working well.  The
   existing Memorandum of Understanding in <a href="./rfc2860">RFC 2860</a> defines "the
   technical work to be carried out by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force and the
   Internet Research Task Force."  Any modifications to the protocol
   parameters registries function should be made using the IETF process
   to update <a href="./rfc6220">RFC 6220</a> and other relevant RFCs.  Put quite simply:
   evolution, not revolution.

   4.  The Internet architecture requires and receives capable service
   by Internet registries.

   The stability of the Internet depends on capable provision of not
   just IETF protocol parameters, but IP numbers, domain names, and
   other registries.  Furthermore, DNS and IPv4/IPv6 are IETF-defined
   protocols.  Thus we expect the role of the IETF in standards
   development, architectural guidance, and allocation of certain name/
   number parameters to continue.  IP multicast addresses and special-
   use DNS names are two examples where close coordination is needed.
   The IETF will continue to coordinate with ICANN, the RIRs, and other
   parties that are mutually invested in the continued smooth operation
   of the Internet registries.  We fully understand the need to work
   together.

   5.  The IETF will continue management of the protocol parameter
   registry function as an integral component of the IETF standards
   process and the use of resulting protocols.

   <a href="./rfc6220">RFC 6220</a> specifies the role and function of the protocol parameters
   registry, which is critical to IETF standards processes and IETF
   protocols.  The IAB, on behalf of the IETF, has the responsibility to
   define and manage the relationship with the protocol registry
   operator role.  This responsibility includes the selection and



<span class="grey">Lear &amp; Housley                Informational                    [Page 14]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-15"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7979">RFC 7979</a>                    IANA ICG Response                August 2016</span>


   management of the protocol parameter registry operator, as well as
   management of the parameter registration process and the guidelines
   for parameter allocation.

   6.  The protocol parameters registries are provided as a public
   service.

   Directions for the creation of protocol parameters registries and the
   policies for subsequent additions and updates are specified in RFCs.
   The protocol parameters registries are available to everyone, and
   they are published in a form that allows their contents to be
   included in other works without further permission.  These works
   include, but are not limited to, implementations of Internet
   protocols and their associated documentation.

   These principles will guide the IAB, IAOC, and the rest of the IETF
   community as they work with ICANN to establish future IANA
   performance metrics and operational procedures.

   &gt;&gt;&gt; IV Transition Implications

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; This section should describe what your community views as the
   &gt;&gt;&gt; implications of the changes it proposed in Section III. These
   &gt;&gt;&gt; implications may include some or all of the following, or other
   &gt;&gt;&gt; implications specific to your community:
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt;  o Description of operational requirements to achieve continuity
   &gt;&gt;&gt;    of service and possible new service integration throughout
   &gt;&gt;&gt;    the transition.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;  o Risks to operational continuity
   &gt;&gt;&gt;  o Description of any legal framework requirements in the
   &gt;&gt;&gt;    absence of the NTIA contract
   &gt;&gt;&gt;  o Description of how you have tested or evaluated the
   &gt;&gt;&gt;    workability of any new technical or operational methods
   &gt;&gt;&gt;    proposed in this document and how they compare to established
   &gt;&gt;&gt;    arrangements.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   No structural changes are required for the handling of protocol
   parameters.  The principles listed above will guide IAB, IAOC, and
   the rest of the IETF community as they work with ICANN to establish
   future IANA performance metrics and operational procedures, as they
   have in the past.





<span class="grey">Lear &amp; Housley                Informational                    [Page 15]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7979">RFC 7979</a>                    IANA ICG Response                August 2016</span>


   As no services are expected to change, no continuity issues are
   anticipated, and there are no new technical or operational methods
   proposed by the IETF to test.  The IETF leadership, ICANN, and the
   RIRs maintain an ongoing informal dialog to spot any unforeseen
   issues that might arise as a result of other changes.

   What is necessary as part of transition is the completion of any
   supplemental agreement(s) necessary to achieve the requirements
   outlined in our response in Section III of this RFP.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; V.  NTIA Requirements
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, NTIA has established that the transition proposal
   &gt;&gt;&gt; must meet the following five requirements:
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt;     "Support and enhance the multistakeholder model;"
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   Because the IETF is open to everyone, participation is open to all
   stakeholders.  IETF processes outlined in Section I were used to
   develop this proposal.  Those same processes have been and shall be
   used to amend governance of the protocol parameters function.  As
   mentioned previously, anyone may propose amendments to those
   processes, and anyone may take part in the decision process.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; "Maintain the security, stability, and resiliency of the
   &gt;&gt;&gt;  Internet DNS;"
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   No changes are proposed in this document that affect the security,
   stability, and resiliency of the DNS.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; "Meet the needs and expectation of the global customers and
   &gt;&gt;&gt;  partners of the IANA services;"
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   Implementers and their users from around the world make use of the
   IETF standards and the associated IANA protocol parameters
   registries.  The current IANA protocol parameters registries system



<span class="grey">Lear &amp; Housley                Informational                    [Page 16]</span></pre>

   is meeting the needs of these global customers.  This proposal
   continues to meet their needs by maintaining the existing processes
   that have served them well in the past.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; "Maintain the openness of the Internet."
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   This proposal maintains the existing open framework that allows
   anyone to participate in the development of IETF standards, including
   the IANA protocol parameters registries policies.  Further, an
   implementer anywhere in the world has full access to the protocol
   specification published in the RFC series and the protocol parameters
   registries published at iana.org.  Those who require assignments in
   the IANA protocol registries will continue to have their requests
   satisfied, as specified by the existing policies for those
   registries.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; "The proposal must not replace the NTIA role with a
   &gt;&gt;&gt;  government-led or an inter-governmental organization solution."
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   Policy oversight is performed by the IAB, which is neither a
   government-led or an intergovernmental organization.

   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; VI.  Community Process
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; This section should describe the process your community used for
   &gt;&gt;&gt; developing this proposal, including:
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; o The steps that were taken to develop the proposal and to
   &gt;&gt;&gt;   determine consensus.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   The IESG established the IANAPLAN working group to develop this
   response.  Anyone was welcome to join the discussion and participate
   in the development of this response.  An open mailing list
   (ianaplan@ietf.org) has been associated with the working group.  In
   addition, IETF's IANA practices have been discussed in the broader
   community, and all input has been welcome.  Normal IETF procedures

   [<a id="ref-RFC2026">RFC2026</a>] [<a href="./rfc2418" title='"IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures"'>RFC2418</a>] were used to determine rough consensus.  The
   chairs of the working group reviewed open issues and, after an
   internal working group last call, determined that all had been
   satisfactorily addressed, and subsequently the IESG did a formal
   IETF-wide Last Call followed by a formal review and determined that

   &gt;&gt;&gt; An assessment of the level of consensus behind your community's
   &gt;&gt;&gt; proposal, including a description of areas of contention or
   &gt;&gt;&gt; disagreement.
   &gt;&gt;&gt;

   IETF Response:

   This document has attained rough consensus of the IETF Working Group
   and of the IETF community as a whole, as judged first by the working
   group chairs and then by the sponsoring Area Director, and then by
   the IESG in accordance with [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>] during the 18 December 2014
   IESG telechat.  The IESG has approved the draft, pending insertion of
   this answer in this section and the IAB approval note.  The IAB
   approved a statement for inclusion in the document on 19 December
   2014.

   Over the course of the development of the document, several
   suggestions were raised that did not enjoy sufficient support to be
   included.  Two general areas of suggestion that generated much
   discussion were

   o  A suggestion for a stronger statement over what terms the IAOC
      should negotiate.

   o  A suggestion that "iana.org" and other associated marks be
      transferred to the IETF trust.

   At the end of the working group process, although there was not
   unanimous support for the results, the working group chairs concluded
   that rough consensus existed in the working group.  The document
   shepherd's summary of the WG consensus for this document can be found
   here:

   During IETF last call, additional people voiced support for the
   document.  There were several editorial comments that resulted in
   changes, as well as some discussion of more substantial comments some

   of which resulted in text changes.  There was some discussion of
   comments already discussed earlier in the process, and but no new
   objections were raised during the IETF last call.  A summary of the
   last call comments can be found from here:

   New draft versions were prepared that took into account all the
   agreed changes from the last call.  The final version was then
   approved by the IESG.

   While the agreement, supplements, policies, and procedures around the
   IANA function have shown strong resiliency, the IETF will continue to
   work with all relevant parties to facilitate improvements while
   maintaining availability of the IANA registries.

             (ICG)

   Charter for the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group V.10

   (August 27, 2014)

   The IANA stewardship transition coordination group (ICG) has one
   deliverable: a proposal to the U.S.  Commerce Department National
   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) regarding
   the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions to the
   global multi-stakeholder community.  The group will conduct itself
   transparently, consult with a broad range of stakeholders, and ensure
   that its proposals support the security and stability of the IANA
   functions.

   The group's mission is to coordinate the development of a proposal
   among the communities affected by the IANA functions.  The IANA
   functions are divided into three main categories: domain names,
   number resources, and other protocol parameters.  The domain names
   category falls further into the country code and generic domain name
   sub-categories.  While there is some overlap among all of these
   categories, each poses distinct organizational, operational and
   technical issues, and each tends to have distinct communities of
   interest and expertise.  For those reasons it is best to have work on
   the three categories of IANA parameters proceed autonomously in
   parallel and be based in the respective communities.

   The IANA stewardship transition process is taking place alongside a
   parallel and related process on enhancing ICANN accountability.
   While maintaining the accountability of Internet identifier
   governance is central to both processes, this group's scope is
   focused on the arrangements required for the continuance of IANA
   functions in an accountable and widely accepted manner after the
   expiry of the NTIA-ICANN contract.  Nevertheless, the two processes
   are interrelated and interdependent and should appropriately
   coordinate their work.

   The coordination group has four main tasks:
   (i) Act as liaison to all interested parties, including the three
       "operational communities" (i.e., those with direct operational
       or service relationship with IANA; namely names, numbers,
       protocol parameters). This task consists of:
        a. Soliciting proposals from the operational communities
        b. Soliciting the input of the broad group of communities
           affected by the IANA functions
   (ii) Assess the outputs of the three operational communities for
        compatibility and interoperability

   (iii) Assemble a complete proposal for the transition
   (iv) Information sharing and public communication
   Describing each in more detail:
      (i) Liaison
        a. Solicit proposals

   The ICG expects a plan from the country code and generic name
   communities (possibly a joint one), a plan from the numbers
   community, and a plan from the protocol parameters community.
   Members of the ICG will ensure that the communities from which they
   are drawn are working on their part of the transition plans.  This
   involves informing them of requirements and schedules, tracking
   progress, and highlighting the results or remaining issues.  The role
   of a coordination group member during this phase is to provide status
   updates about the progress of his or her community in developing
   their component, and to coordinate which community will develop a
   transition proposal for each area of overlap (e.g., special-use
   registry).

   While working on the development of their proposals, the operational
   communities are expected to address common requirements and issues
   relating to the transition, in as far as they affect their parts of
   the stewardship of IANA functions.

   b.  Solicit broader input

   The ICG is open for input and feedback from all interested parties.
   While no set of formal requirements related to a transition proposal
   will be requested outside the operational communities, everyone's
   input is welcome across all topics.

   The ICG expects that all interested parties get involved as early as
   possible in the relevant community processes.  Input received
   directly by the ICG may be referred to the relevant community
   discussion.

   The ICG members chosen from a particular community are the official
   communication channel between the ICG and that community.

   (ii) Assessment

   When the group receives output from the communities it will discuss
   and assess their compatibility and interoperability with the
   proposals of the other communities.  Each proposal should be
   submitted with a clear record of how consensus has been reached for
   the proposal in the community, and provide an analysis that shows the

   proposal is in practice workable.  The ICG should also compile the
   input it has received beyond the operational communities, and review
   the impacts of this input.

   The ICG might at some point detect problems with the component
   proposals.  At that point the role of the ICG is to communicate that
   back to the relevant communities so that they (the relevant
   communities) can address the issues.  It is not in the role of the
   ICG to develop proposals or to select from among competing proposals.

   (iii) Assembling and submitting a complete proposal

   The assembly effort involves taking the proposals for the different
   components and verifying that the whole fulfills the intended scope,
   meets the intended criteria, that there are no missing parts, and
   that the whole fits together.  The whole also needs to include
   sufficient independent accountability mechanisms for running the IANA
   function.  The ICG will then develop a draft final proposal that
   achieves rough consensus within the ICG itself.  The ICG will then
   put this proposal up for public comment involving a reasonable period
   of time for reviewing the draft proposal, analyzing and preparing
   supportive or critical comments.  The ICG will then review these
   comments and determine whether modifications are required.  If no
   modifications are needed, and the coordination group agrees, the
   proposal will be submitted to NTIA.

   If changes are required to fix problems or to achieve broader
   support, the ICG will work with the operational communities in a
   manner similar to what was described in task (ii) above.  Updates are
   subject to the same verification, review, and consensus processes as
   the initial proposals.  If, in the ICG's opinion, broad public
   support for the proposal as articulated by the NTIA is not present,
   the parts of the proposal that are not supported return to the
   liaison phase.

   (iv) Information sharing

   The ICG serves as a central clearinghouse for public information
   about the IANA stewardship transition process.  Its secretariat
   maintains an independent, publicly accessible and open website, under
   its own domain, where status updates, meetings and notices are
   announced, proposals are stored, the ICG members are listed, etc.  As
   the development of the transition plans will take some time, it is
   important that information about ongoing work is distributed early
   and continuously.  This will enable sharing of ideas and the
   detection of potential issues.

   IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group Request for Proposals

   8 September 2014

   Introduction

   Under the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG)
   Charter, the ICG has four main tasks:

   (i) Act as liaison to all interested parties in the IANA
       stewardship transition, including the three "operational
       communities" (i.e., those with direct operational or service
       relationships with the IANA functions operator; namely names,
       numbers, protocol parameters). This task consists of:

      a. Soliciting proposals from the operational communities
      b. Soliciting the input of the broad group of communities
         affected by the IANA functions

   (ii) Assess the outputs of the three operational communities for
        compatibility and interoperability

   (iii) Assemble a complete proposal for the transition

   (iv) Information sharing and public communication

   This Request for Proposals (RFP) addresses task (i) of the ICG
   Charter. This RFP does not preclude any form of input from the
   non-operational communities.

   0. Complete Formal Responses

   The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) seeks
   complete formal responses to this RFP through processes which are to
   be convened by each of the "operational communities" of IANA (i.e.,
   those with direct operational or service relationships with the IANA
   functions operator, in connection with names, numbers, or protocol
   parameters).

   Proposals should be supported by the broad range of stakeholders
   participating in the proposal development process. Proposals should
   be developed through a transparent process that is open to and
   inclusive of all stakeholders interested in participating in the
   development of the proposal. In order to help the ICG maintain its
   light coordination role, all interested and affected parties are

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7979">RFC 7979</a>                    IANA ICG Response                August 2016</span>


   strongly encouraged to participate directly in these community
   processes.

   The following link provides information about ongoing community
   processes and how to participate in them, and that will continue to
   be updated over time:

   <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/stewardship/community">https://www.icann.org/en/stewardship/community</a>

   In this RFP, "IANA" refers to the functions currently specified in
   the agreement between NTIA and ICANN
   [http://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/iana-functions-purchase-order] as well
   as any other functions traditionally performed by the IANA functions
   operator. SAC-067

   [https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-067-en.pdf]
   provides one description of the many different meanings of the term
   "IANA" and may be useful reading in addition to the documents
   constituting the agreement itself.

   Communities are asked to adhere to open and inclusive processes in
   developing their responses, so that all community members may fully
   participate in and observe those processes. Communities are also
   asked to actively seek out and encourage wider participation by any
   other parties with interest in their response.

   A major challenge of the ICG will be to identify and help to
   reconcile differences between submitted proposals, in order to
   produce a single plan for the transition of IANA
   stewardship. Submitted Proposals should therefore focus on those
   elements that are considered to be truly essential to the transition
   of their specific IANA functions.  The target deadline for all
   complete formal responses to this RFP is 15 January 2015.

   I. Comments

   While the ICG is requesting complete formal proposals through
   processes convened by each of the operational communities, and that
   all interested parties get involved as early as possible in the
   relevant community processes, some parties may choose to provide
   comments directly to the ICG about specific aspects of particular
   proposals, about the community processes, or about the ICG's own
   processes. Comments may be directly submitted to the ICG any time
   via email to icg-forum@icann.org. Comments will be publicly archived
   at &lt;<a href="http://forum.icann.org/lists/icg-forum/">http://forum.icann.org/lists/icg-forum/</a>&gt;.

   Commenters should be aware that ICG will direct comments received to
   the relevant operational communities if appropriate. The ICG will
   review comments received as time and resources permit and in
   accordance with the overall timeline for the transition. That is,
   comments received about specific proposals may not be reviewed until
   those proposals have been submitted to the ICG. The ICG may
   establish defined public comment periods about specific topics in
   the future, after the complete formal responses to the RFP have been
   received.

   Required Proposal Elements

   The ICG encourages each community to submit a single proposal that
   contains the elements described in this section.

   Communities are requested to describe the elements delineated in the
   sections below in as much detail possible, and according to the
   suggested format/structure, to allow the ICG to more easily
   assimilate the results. While each question is narrowly defined to
   allow for comparison between answers, respondents are encouraged to
   provide further information in explanatory sections, including
   descriptive summaries of policies/practices and associated
   references to source documents of specific policies/practices. In
   this way, the responses to the questionnaire will be useful at the
   operational level as well as to the broader stakeholder communities.

   In the interest of completeness and consistency, proposals should
   cross-reference wherever appropriate the current IANA Functions
   Contract[3] when describing existing arrangements and proposing
   changes to existing arrangements.

   0. Proposal type

   Identify which category of the IANA functions this submission
   proposes to address:
    [ ] Names [ ] Numbers [ ] Protocol Parameters

   I. Description of Community's Use of IANA Functions

   This section should list the specific, distinct IANA functions your
   community relies on. For each IANA function on which your community
   relies, please provide the following:

    o A description of any overlaps or interdependencies between your
      IANA requirements and the functions required by other customer
      communities.

   If your community relies on any other IANA service or activity
   beyond the scope of the IANA functions contract, you may describe
   them here. In this case please also describe how the service or
   activity should be addressed by the transition plan.

   II. Existing, Pre-Transition Arrangements

   This section should describe how existing IANA-related arrangements
   work, prior to the transition.

   A. Policy Sources

   This section should identify the specific source(s) of policy which
   must be followed by the IANA functions operator in its conduct of
   the services or activities described above. If there are distinct
   sources of policy or policy development for different IANA
   functions, then please describe these separately. For each source of
   policy or policy development, please provide the following:

    o Which IANA function (identified in Section I) are affected.
    o A description of how policy is developed and established and who
      is involved in policy development and establishment.
    o A description of how disputes about policy are resolved.
    o References to documentation of policy development and dispute
      resolution processes.

   B. Oversight and Accountability

   This section should describe all the ways in which oversight is
   conducted over the IANA functions operator's provision of the
   services and activities listed in Section I and all the ways in
   which the IANA functions operator is currently held accountable for
   the provision of those services. For each oversight or
   accountability mechanism, please provide as many of the following as
   are applicable:

   Which IANA functions (identified in Section I) are affected.  If the
   policy sources identified in Section II.A are affected, identify
   which ones are affected and explain in what way.

    o A description of the entity or entities that provide oversight or
      perform accountability functions, including how individuals are
      selected or removed from participation in those entities.
    o A description of the mechanism (e.g., contract, reporting scheme,
      auditing scheme, etc.). This should include a description of the
      consequences of the IANA functions operator not meeting the
      standards established by the mechanism, the extent to which the
      output of the mechanism is transparent and the terms under which
      the mechanism may change.
    o Jurisdiction(s) in which the mechanism applies and the legal basis
      on which the mechanism rests.

   III. Proposed Post-Transition Oversight and Accountability
        Arrangements

   This section should describe what changes your community is
   proposing to the arrangements listed in Section II.B in light of the
   transition. If your community is proposing to replace one or more
   existing arrangements with new arrangements, that replacement should
   be explained and all of the elements listed in Section II.B should
   be described for the new arrangements. Your community should provide
   its rationale and justification for the new arrangements.

   If your community's proposal carries any implications for the
   interface between the IANA functions and existing policy arrangements
   described in Section II.A, those implications should be described
   here.

   If your community is not proposing changes to arrangements listed in
   Section II.B, the rationale and justification for that choice should
   be provided here.

   IV. Transition Implications

   This section should describe what your community views as the
   implications of the changes it proposed in Section III. These
   implications may include some or all of the following, or other
   implications specific to your community:

   Description of operational requirements to achieve continuity of
   service and possible new service integration throughout the
   transition.

   Risks to operational continuity and how they will be addressed.
   Description of any legal framework requirements in the absence of the
   NTIA contract. Description of how you have tested or evaluated the
   workability of any new technical or operational methods proposed in
   this document and how they compare to established arrangements.

   Description of how long the proposals in Section III are expected to
   take to complete, and any intermediate milestones that may occur
   before they are completed.

   V. NTIA Requirements

   Additionally, NTIA has established that the transition proposal must
   meet the following five requirements:
    o Support and enhance the multistakeholder model;
    o Maintain the security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet
      DNS;
    o Meet the needs and expectation of the global customers and
      partners of the IANA functions;
    o Maintain the openness of the Internet;
    o The proposal must not replace the NTIA role with a government-led
      or an inter-governmental organization solution.

   This section should explain how your community's proposal meets these
   requirements and how it responds to the global interest in the IANA
   functions.

   VI. Community Process

   This section should describe the process your community used for
   developing this proposal, including:
    o The steps that were taken to develop the proposal and to determine
      consensus.
    o Links to announcements, agendas, mailing lists, consultations and
      meeting proceedings.
    o An assessment of the level of consensus behind your community's
      proposal, including a description of areas of contention or
      disagreement.

   &gt; the numbers and protocol parameters communities be willing to
   &gt; modify their proposals to reconcile them?

   We do not observe incompatibilities between the proposals from the
   numbers and protocol parameters communities.  The numbers
   community expresses a preference to transfer the trademark and
   domain, while the IETF proposal does not oppose such transfer.
   This is not an incompatibility, it is something that can be
   satisfied by implementation of both number and protocol
   parameters community's proposals, as already specified.

   To confirm this, and to determine whether the transfer
   of the trademark and domain would be acceptable,
   we consulted the community.  It is the opinion of the
   IANAPLAN working group that they would support a
   decision by the IETF Trust to hold the trademark and domain
   on behalf of the Internet community.  For details, see
   <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ianaplan/current/msg01659.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ianaplan/current/msg01659.html</a>

   The IETF Trust also looked at this issue.  The trustees decided that
   the IETF Trust would be willing to hold intellectual property rights
   relating to the IANA function, including the IANA trademark and the
   IANA.ORG domain name.  For details, see
   <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ianaplan/current/msg01664.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ianaplan/current/msg01664.html</a>

   In short, we find no incompatibility between the proposals and no
   need to modify the protocol parameters proposal.

   Date: 5 Jun 2015 13:39:50 GMT+3
   To: Alissa Cooper &lt;alissa@cooperw.in&gt;
   Cc: ICG &lt;internal-cg@ianacg.org&gt;

   This is a response to a query regarding transition finalisation and
   implementation time frames, sent to the IANAPLAN working
   group list by the chairs of the IANA Transition Coordination
   Group (ICG) on May 27th.

   While I am carrying this response back to the ICG, the substance
   of this response has been discussed in the IANAPLAN working
   group and the relevant parts of IETF leadership.  I believe this
   response represents the (rough) consensus opinion that
   emerged in the discussion, as well as the current state
   of IANA arrangement updates that our leadership bodies
   have been working on.

   The IETF is ready today to take the next steps in the
   implementation of the transition of the stewardship.
   In our case, most of the necessary framework is already
   in place and implemented in preceding years.

   The remaining step is an updated agreement with
   ICANN which addresses two issues.  These issues are
   outlined in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.III in the Internet Draft
   <a href="./draft-ietf-ianaplan-icg-response-09.txt">draft-ietf-ianaplan-icg-response-09.txt</a>:

   o The protocol parameters registries are in the public domain.  It
   is the preference of the IETF community that all relevant parties
   acknowledge that fact as part of the transition.

   o It is possible in the future that the operation of the protocol
   parameters registries may be transitioned from ICANN to subsequent
   operator(s).  It is the preference of the IETF community that, as
   part of the NTIA transition, ICANN acknowledge that it will carry
   out the obligations established under C.7.3 and I.61 of the
   current IANA functions contract between ICANN and the NTIA
   [<a href="#ref-NTIA-Contract">NTIA-Contract</a>] to achieve a smooth transition to subsequent
   operator(s), should the need arise.  Furthermore, in the event of
   a transition it is the expectation of the IETF community that

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7979">RFC 7979</a>                    IANA ICG Response                August 2016</span>


   ICANN, the IETF, and subsequent operator(s) will work together to
   minimize disruption in the use of the protocol parameters registries
   or other resources currently located at iana.org.

   The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) has
   decided to use an update of our yearly IETF-ICANN Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) as the mechanism for this updated
   agreement.  They have drafted the update and from our
   perspective it could be immediately executed.  Once the updated
   agreement is in place, the transition would be substantially
   complete, with only the NTIA contract lapse or termination
   as a final step.

   Of course, we are not alone in this process.  Interactions
   with other parts of the process may bring additional
   tasks that need to be executed either before or
   after the transition.  First, the ICG, the RIRs,
   and IETF have discussed the possibility of aligning
   the treatment of IANA trademarks and domains.  The
   IETF Trust has signalled that it would be willing to do this,
   if asked.  We are awaiting coordination on this
   to complete, but see no problem in speedy
   execution once the decision is made.  From our
   perspective this is not a prerequisite for the transition,
   however.

   In addition, the names community has proposed the
   creation of a 'Post Transition IANA' (PTI).  If the existing
   agreements between the IETF and ICANN remain in place
   and the SLAs discussed above are not affected, the IETF
   transition would take place as described above.  That is
   our preference.  If the final details of the PTI plan require
   further action from the IETF, more work and community
   agreement would be required.  The timeline for that work
   cannot be set until the scope is known.

   Subject: [Internal-cg] Response from IETF IANAPLAN WG regarding the
   ICG question on coordination
   Date: 8 Oct 2015 10:13:07 GMT+3
   To: IANA etc etc Coordination Group &lt;internal-cg@ianacg.org&gt;


   The IANAPLAN working group has discussed the coordination
   question from the ICG.  In the working group's opinion,



<span class="grey">Lear &amp; Housley                Informational                    [Page 36]</span></pre>

   informal coordination exists today and will continue, which
   is consistent with the commitment requested by the ICG.

   This is also consistent with an overall coordination commitment
   already indicated in the IANAPLAN proposal.  The proposal
   is a consensus document of the IETF.  From the proposal:

   The IETF will continue to coordinate with ICANN, the RIRs, and other
   parties that are mutually invested in the continued smooth operation
   of the Internet registries.

   The coordination approach is also consistent with the
   comments that were sent by the IAB to the ICG during the
   public comment period.  See
