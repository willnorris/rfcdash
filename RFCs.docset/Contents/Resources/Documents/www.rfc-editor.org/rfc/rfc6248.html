   <span class="h1">RFC 4148 and the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Registry of Metrics</span>
                              <span class="h1">Are Obsolete</span>

Abstract

   This memo reclassifies <a href="./rfc4148">RFC 4148</a>, "IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
   Metrics Registry", as Obsolete, and withdraws the IANA IPPM Metrics
   Registry itself from use because it is obsolete.  The current
   registry structure has been found to be insufficiently detailed to
   uniquely identify IPPM metrics.  Despite apparent efforts to find
   current or even future users, no one responded to the call for
   interest in the <a href="./rfc4148">RFC 4148</a> registry during the second half of 2010.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework [<a href="./rfc2330" title='"Framework for IP Performance Metrics"'>RFC2330</a>] describes
   several ways to record options and metric parameter settings, in
   order to account for sources of measurement variability.  For
   example, <a href="./rfc2330#section-13">Section 13 of [RFC2330]</a> describes the notion of "Type P" so
   that metrics can be specified in general, but the specifics (such as
   payload length in octets and protocol type) can replace P to
   disambiguate the results.

   When the IPPM Metrics Registry [<a href="./rfc4148" title='"IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Metrics Registry"'>RFC4148</a>] was designed, the
   variability of the "Type P" notion, and the variability possible with
   the many metric parameters (see <a href="./rfc2679#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of [RFC2679]</a>), were not
   fully appreciated.  Further, some of the early metric definitions
   only indicate Poisson streams [<a href="./rfc2330" title='"Framework for IP Performance Metrics"'>RFC2330</a>] (see the metrics in
   [<a href="./rfc2679" title='"A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2679</a>], [<a href="./rfc2680" title='"A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2680</a>], and [<a href="./rfc3393" title='"IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)"'>RFC3393</a>]), but later work standardized the
   methods for Periodic Stream measurements [<a href="./rfc3432" title='"Network performance measurement with periodic streams"'>RFC3432</a>], adding to the
   variability possible when characterizing a metric exactly.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6248">RFC 6248</a>                  <a href="./rfc4148">RFC 4148</a> is Obsolete                April 2011</span>


   It is not believed to be feasible or even useful to register every
   possible combination of Type P, metric parameters, and Stream
   parameters using the current structure of the IPPM Metrics Registry.

   The IPPM Metrics Registry is believed to have very few users, if any.
   Evidence of this was provided by the fact that one registry entry was
   syntactically incorrect for months after [<a href="./rfc5644" title='"IP Performance Metrics (IPPM): Spatial and Multicast"'>RFC5644</a>] was published.
   The text ":=" was used for the metrics in that document instead of
   "::=".  It took eight months before someone offered that a parser
   found the error.  Even the original registry author agrees that the
   current registry is not efficient, and has submitted a proposal to
   effectively create a new registry.

   Despite apparent efforts to find current or even future users, no one
   responded to the call for interest in the <a href="./rfc4148">RFC 4148</a> registry during
   the second half of 2010.  Therefore, the IETF now declares the
   registry Obsolete without any further reservations.

   When a registry is designated Obsolete, it simply prevents the IANA
   from registering new objects, in this case new metrics.  So, even if
   a registry user was eventually found, they could continue to use the
   current registry, and its contents will continue to be available.

   The most recently published memo that added metrics to the registry
   is [<a href="./rfc6049" title='"Spatial Composition of Metrics"'>RFC6049</a>].  This memo updates all previous memos that registered
   new metrics, including [<a href="./rfc4737" title='"Packet Reordering Metrics"'>RFC4737</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5560" title='"A One-Way Packet Duplication Metric"'>RFC5560</a>], so that the
   registry's Obsolete status will be evident.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Action%20to%20Reclassify%20RFC%204148%20and%20the%20Corresponding%20IANA%20Registry%20as"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Action to Reclassify <a href="./rfc4148">RFC 4148</a> and the Corresponding IANA Registry as</span>
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Obsolete"></a>    Obsolete</span>

   Due to the ambiguities between the current metrics registrations and
   the metrics used, and the apparent minimal adoption of the registry
   in practice, it is required that:

   o  the IETF reclassify [<a href="./rfc4148" title='"IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Metrics Registry"'>RFC4148</a>] as Obsolete.

   o  the IANA withdraw the current IPPM Metrics Registry from further
      updates and note that it too is Obsolete.

   It is assumed that parties who wish to establish a replacement
   registry function will work to specify such a registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This memo and its recommendations have no known impact on the
   security of the Internet (especially if there is a zombie apocalypse
   on the day it is published; humans will have many more security
   issues to worry about stemming from the rise of the un-dead).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   Metrics defined in the IETF have been typically registered in the
   IANA IPPM Metrics Registry as described in the initial version of the
   registry [<a href="./rfc4148" title='"IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Metrics Registry"'>RFC4148</a>].  However, areas for improvement of this registry
   have been identified, and the registry structure has to be revisited
   when there is working group consensus to do so.

   The current consensus is to designate the IPPM Metrics Registry,
   originally described in [<a href="./rfc4148" title='"IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Metrics Registry"'>RFC4148</a>], as Obsolete.

   The DESCRIPTION of the registry MIB has been modified as follows, and
   the first two sentences should be included on any IANA-maintained web
   page describing this registry or its contents:

   DESCRIPTION

      "With the approval and publication of <a href="./rfc6248">RFC 6248</a>, this module is
      designated Obsolete.

      The registry will no longer be updated, and the current contents
      will be maintained as-is on the day that <a href="./rfc6248">RFC 6248</a> was published.

      The original Description text follows below:

      This module defines a registry for IP Performance Metrics.

      ... "

   Henk Uijterwaal suggested additional rationale for the recommendation
   in this memo.
