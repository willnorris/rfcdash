Abstract

   This document describes methods and procedures for the graceful
   transition from an ATMARP LIS[1] to an NHRP LIS[2] network model over
   ATM.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>6</a>].

   ATMARP defines an initial application of classical IP and ARP in an
   ATM network environment configured as a LIS[1].  ATMARP only
   considers application of ATM as a direct replacement for the "wires"
   and local LAN segments connecting IP end-stations and routers
   operating in the "classical" LAN-based paradigm.

   The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) allows a source station
   (a host or router), wishing to communicate over a Non-Broadcast,
   Multi-Access (NBMA) subnetwork, to determine the internetworking
   layer addresses and NBMA addresses of suitable "NBMA next hops"
   toward a destination station. If the destination is connected to the
   NBMA subnetwork and direct communication is administratively allowed,
   then the NBMA next hop is the destination station itself.  Otherwise,
   the NBMA next hop is the egress router from the NBMA subnetwork that
   is "nearest" to the destination station.  For the purposes of this
   document, the NBMA network is of type ATM.

   It is reasonable to expect that ATMARP Clients and NHRP Clients will
   initially coexist within a LIS.  Thus, it is necessary to define a
   graceful transition, including a period of coexistance, from the use
   of ATMARP to the use of NHRP for address resolution in the LIS
   [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Classical IP and ARP over ATM"'>1</a>][2]. In short, NHSs will be required to respond to ATMARP Client
   queries in a fashion which will permit continued use of the ATMARP
   Client within the LIS during the ATMARP to NHRP transition period.
   Note that this document places no protocol requirements upon
   ATMARP[1] servers.

   For the following, it will be assumed that the reader is familiar
   with the terminology as described in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Classical IP and ARP over ATM"'>1</a>][2][<a href="#ref-3" title='"Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP)"'>3</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Service%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Service Requirements</span>

   If NHRP is to be used in a LIS then only NHSs will be used in the
   LIS; that is, there will not be a mixture of NHSs and ATMARP servers
   within the same LIS.  Since ATMARP servers will not be able to
   understand NHCs and since, as described below, NHSs will respond to
   ATMARP Clients, this is a reasonable simplifying restriction.

   This document will only address SVC based environments and will not
   address PVC environments.  This document will refer only to ATM AAL5
   as the NBMA and IP as the protocol layer since ATMARP only addresses
   these protocols.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1%20NHRP%20Server%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a> NHRP Server Requirements</span>

   If NHRP Servers (NHS) are to be deployed in a LIS which contains both
   ATMARP Clients and NHRP Clients then NHSs MUST respond to
   ATMARP_Requests sent by ATMARP Clients in the same fashion that an
   ATMARP Server would respond as described in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Classical IP and ARP over ATM"'>1</a>].  To do this, the NHS
   MUST first recognize the LLC/SNAP ATMARP code point with LLC=0xAA-
   AA-03, OUI=0x00-00-00, and ethertype=0x08-06.  Further, the NHS MUST
   recognize the packet formats described in Section 8.7 of [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Classical IP and ARP over ATM"'>1</a>].
   However, since this document does not extend to PVC environments,

   NHSs MUST only receive/respond to values of ar$op of 1,2,10
   (Decimal).  If an NHS receives an ATMARP message with ar$op values
   other than those previously noted then the NHS MUST discard the
   packet and MUST NOT take any further action.

   When an NHS receives a valid (as defined in the previous paragraph)
   ATMARP_Request packet, the NHS MUST follow the rules described in
   Section 8.4 of [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Classical IP and ARP over ATM"'>1</a>] with the following additional processing:






<span class="grey">Luciani                      Informational                      [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2336">RFC 2336</a>         Classical IP and ARP over ATM to NHRP         July 1998</span>


     1) When an ATMARP_Request causes a new table entry in the NHS for
        an ATMARP Client, that table entry MUST be marked as being of
        type "ATMARP" so that it can be differentiated from an NHRP
        sourced entry.

     2) An ATMARP_Request MUST NOT cause an ATMARP_Reply to be sent if
        that ATMARP_Request contains an off-LIS protocol address.  This
        should never happen because the IP stack on the requesting
        machine should automatically send the packet to the default
        router.  If this does occur then the ATMARP_Request MUST cause
        an ATMARP_NAK to be sent to the originator.

   In [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Classical IP and ARP over ATM"'>1</a>], an ATMARP_Request packet also serves as a
   registraion/registration-update packet which would cause a server to
   add an entry to a server's cache or to update a previously existing
   entry.  When an NHS receives an ATMARP_Request which causes the
   creation of a new cache entry in the NHS or updates an existing entry
   then that cache entry will have a holding time of 20 minutes (this is
   the default value in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Classical IP and ARP over ATM"'>1</a>]).

   An NHS receiving an NHRP Resolution Request MUST NOT send a positive
   NHRP Resolution Reply for a station which registered via ATMARP if
   the station sending the NHRP Resolution Request is outside the LIS of
   the station which registered itself via ATMARP.  This is because the
   station which registered via ATMARP is almost certainly not prepared
   to accept a cut-through.   When this occurs, the replying NHS must
   send NHRP Resolution Reply which contains a CIE code of "4 -
   Administratively Prohibited" as described in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)"'>2</a>].  This type of reply
   does not preclude the station sending the NHRP Resolution Request
   from sending its data packets along the routed path but it does
   preclude that station from setting up a cut-through VC.

   Since NHRP servers may work in a multi-server environment on a per
   LIS basis during the transition, it is necessary to know how cache
   synchronization occurs. These rules may be found in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"A Distributed NHRP Service Using SCSP"'>5</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   Not all of the security issues relating to IP over ATM are clearly
   understood at this time, due to the fluid state of ATM
   specifications, newness of the technology, and other factors.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2336">RFC 2336</a>         Classical IP and ARP over ATM to NHRP         July 1998</span>


   It is believed that ATM and IP facilities for authenticated call
   management, authenticated end-to-end communications, and data
   encryption will be needed in globally connected ATM networks.  Such
   future security facilities and their use by IP networks are beyond
   the scope of this memo.

   There are known security issues relating to host impersonation via
   the address resolution protocols used in the Internet [<a href="#ref-4" title="Bellovin">4</a>].  No
   special security mechanisms have been added to ATMARP.  While NHRP
   supplies some mechanisms for authentication, ATMARP does not.  Since
   any security mechanism is only as good as its weakest link, it should
   be assumed that when NHRP and ATMARP exist with a given LIS, the
   security of a combination is only as good as that supplied by ATMARP.
