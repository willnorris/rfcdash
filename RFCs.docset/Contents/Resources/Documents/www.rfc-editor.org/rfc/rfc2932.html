<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This MIB describes objects used for managing IP Multicast Routing
   [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Multicast Routing in a Datagram Internetwork"'>16</a>], independent of the specific multicast routing protocol [17-21]
   in use.  Managed objects specific to particular multicast routing
   protocols are specified elsewhere.  Similarly, this MIB does not
   support management of multicast routing for other address families,
   including IPv6.  Such management may be supported by other MIBs.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20SNMP%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The SNMP Management Framework</span>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in <a href="./rfc2571">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>1</a>].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>2</a>], STD 16, <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>3</a>] and <a href="./rfc1215">RFC 1215</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>4</a>].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, <a href="./rfc2578">RFC</a>
        <a href="./rfc2578">2578</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>5</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>6</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>7</a>].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>8</a>].  A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="./rfc1901">RFC 1901</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>9</a>] and
        <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>10</a>].  The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>10</a>], <a href="./rfc2572">RFC 2572</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>11</a>] and
        <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>12</a>].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>8</a>].  A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in <a href="./rfc1905">RFC 1905</a>
        [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>13</a>].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in <a href="./rfc2573">RFC 2573</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"SNMPv3 Applications"'>14</a>] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in <a href="./rfc2575">RFC 2575</a>
        [<a href="#ref-15" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>15</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2932">RFC 2932</a>               IPv4 Multicast Routing MIB           October 2000</span>


   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   This MIB module contains one scalar and five tables.  The tables are:

   (1)  the IP Multicast Route Table containing multicast routing
        information for IP datagrams sent by particular sources to the
        IP multicast groups known to a router.

   (2)  the IP Multicast Routing Next Hop Table containing information
        on the next-hops for the routing IP multicast datagrams.  Each
        entry is one of a list of next-hops on outgoing interfaces for
        particular sources sending to a particular multicast group
        address.

   (3)  the IP Multicast Routing Interface Table containing multicast
        routing information specific to interfaces.

   (4)  the IP Multicast Scope Boundary Table containing the boundaries
        configured for multicast scopes [<a href="#ref-22" title='"Administratively Scoped IP Multicast"'>22</a>].

   (5)  the IP Multicast Scope Name Table containing human-readable
        names of multicast scope.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   The ipMRouteRtProto, ipMRouteNextHopProtocol,
   ipMRouteInterfaceProtocol, and ipMRouteProtocol use textual
   conventions imported from the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB.  The purpose of
   defining these textual conventions in a separate MIB module is to
   allow additional values to be defined without having to issue a new
   version of this document.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA) is responsible for the assignment of all Internet numbers,
   including various SNMP-related numbers; it will administer the values
   associated with these textual conventions.

   The rules for additions or changes to the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB are
   outlined in the DESCRIPTION clause associated with its MODULE-
   IDENTITY statement.

   The current versions of the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB can be accessed from the
   IANA home page at: "<a href="http://www.iana.org/">http://www.iana.org/</a>".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to multicast routing, including information on what machines
   are sending to which groups.  There are also a number of objects that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create, such as
   those which allow an administrator to configure multicast boundaries.

   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause
   a denial of service, or could cause wider distribution of packets
   intended only for local distribution.  Hence, the support for SET
   operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can
   have a negative effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>12</a>] and the View-based
   Access Control Model <a href="./rfc2575">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="#ref-15" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>15</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to access them.
