<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20TIFF-FX%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. TIFF-FX Definition</span>

   TIFF-FX (Tag Image File Format Fax eXtended), is defined in detail by
   <a href="./rfc2301">RFC 2301</a> "File Format for Internet Fax" [<a href="#ref-TIFF-FX" title='"File Format for Internet Fax"'>TIFF-FX</a>].

   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this
   section as background information, the reader is directed to the
   original TIFF-FX specification (File Format for Internet Fax) to
   obtain complete feature and technical details.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1%20TIFF-FX%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a> TIFF-FX Scope</span>

   This document defines a TIFF-based file format specification for
   enabling standardized messaging-based fax over the Internet.  It
   specifies the TIFF fields and field values required for compatibility
   with the existing ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 black-and-white,
   grayscale and color facsimile.  TIFF has historically been used for
   handling fax image files in applications such as store-and-forward
   messaging.  Implementations that support this file format
   specification for import/export may elect to support it as a native
   format.  This document recommends a TIFF file structure that is
   compatible with low-memory and page-level streaming implementations.

   Unless otherwise noted, the current TIFF specification [<a href="#ref-TIFF" title="June 3">TIFF</a>] and
   selected TIFF Technical Notes [TTN1, TTN2] are the primary references
   for describing TIFF and defining TIFF fields.  This document is the
   primary reference for defining TIFF field values for fax
   applications.

   Some of the features of TIFF-FX are:

      -  TIFF-FX is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-
         color, full-color and mixed content image data.

      -  TIFF-FX includes a number of compression schemes that allow
         developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff for their
         applications.

      -  TIFF-FX is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully
         as new needs arise.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20MIME%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. MIME Definition</span>

   This document defines the image/tiff-fx MIME sub-type to refer to
   TIFF-FX Profiles J, C, L and M encoded image data and any future
   TIFF-FX extensions, or a subset.  The image/tiff-fx content type may
   be used when black-and-white image data is encoded using TIFF-FX
   Profiles S or F, or a subset.

   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/tiff-fx

   MIME media type name: image

   MIME subtype name: tiff-fx

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding Considerations: This media type consists of binary
   data.  The base64 encoding should be used on transports that
   cannot accommodate binary data directly.

   Security considerations:

      TIFF-FX utilizes a structure which can store image data and
      attributes of this image data.  The fields defined in the
      TIFF-FX specification are of a descriptive nature and provide
      information that is useful to facilitate viewing and
      rendering of images by a recipient.  As such, the fields
      currently defined in the TIFF-FX specification do not in
      themselves create additional security risks, since the
      fields are not used to induce any particular behavior by the
      recipient application.

      TIFF-FX has an extensible structure, so that it is
      theoretically possible that fields could be defined in the
      future which could be used to induce particular actions on
      the part of the recipient, thus presenting additional
      security risks, but this type of capability is not supported
      in the referenced TIFF-FX specification.  Indeed, the
      definition of fields which would include such processing
      instructions is inconsistent with the goals and spirit of the
      TIFF-FX specification.

   Interoperability considerations:

      The ability of implementations to handle all the defined
      applications (or profiles within applications) of TIFF-FX may
      not be ubiquitous.  As a result, implementations may decode
      and attempt to display the encoded TIFF-FX image data only to
      determine that the image cannot be rendered.

      TIFF-FX (Tag Image File Format Fax eXtended) is defined in:
