<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Overview%20and%20Rationale"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Overview and Rationale</span>

   Secure Shell (SSH) is a common protocol for secure communication on
   the Internet.  Security protocols and primitives are an active area
   for research and help to suggest updates to SSH.

   <a href="./rfc4253#section-8">Section 8 of [RFC4253]</a> contains a small error in point 3 regarding
   checking the Peer's DH Public Key.  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of this document
   provides the correction.

   Due to security concerns with SHA-1 [<a href="./rfc6194" title='"Security Considerations for the SHA-0 and SHA-1 Message-Digest Algorithms"'>RFC6194</a>] and with MODP groups
   with less than 2048 bits [<a href="#ref-NIST-SP-800-131Ar1">NIST-SP-800-131Ar1</a>], implementers and users
   should request support for larger Diffie-Hellman (DH) MODP group
   sizes with data-integrity verification by using the SHA-2 family of
   secure hash algorithms and by having MODP groups provide more
   security.  The use of larger MODP groups and the move to the SHA-2
   family of hashes are important features to strengthen the key
   exchange algorithms available to the SSH client and server.

   DH primes being adopted by this document are all "safe primes" such
   that p = 2q + 1 where q is also a prime.  New MODP groups are being
   introduced starting with the MODP 3072-bit group15.  All use SHA512
   as the hash algorithm.

   The DH 2048-bit MODP group14 is already present in most SSH
   implementations and most implementations already have a SHA256
   implementation, so "diffie-hellman-group14-sha256" is provided as
   easy to implement.

   It is intended that these new MODP groups with SHA-2-based hashes
   update <a href="./rfc4253#section-6.4">Section 6.4 of [RFC4253]</a> and <a href="./rfc4250#section-4.10">Section 4.10 of [RFC4250]</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8268">RFC 8268</a>             More MODP DH KEX Groups for SSH       December 2017</span>


   The United States Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) at the
   National Security Agency (NSA) has published "Commercial National
   Security Algorithm Suite and Quantum Computing Frequently Asked
   Questions".  [<a href="#ref-MFQ-U-OO-815099-15">MFQ-U-OO-815099-15</a>] is addressed to organizations that
   run classified or unclassified national security systems (NSS) and
   vendors that build products used in NSS.

   This FAQ document indicates that NSS should no longer use:

   o  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and Elliptic Curve Digital
      Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with NIST P-256.  (For SSH, this would
      suggest avoiding [<a href="./rfc5656" title='"Elliptic Curve Algorithm Integration in the Secure Shell Transport Layer"'>RFC5656</a>] Key Exchange Algorithm
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp256" and Public Key Algorithm
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256".)

   o  SHA-256 (For SSH, this would suggest avoiding any Key Exchange
      Method using SHA1, SHA224, or SHA256 in favor of using SHA384 or
      SHA512.)

   o  AES-128 (For SSH, this would suggest avoiding Encryption
      Algorithms [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] "aes128-cbc" and [<a href="./rfc4344" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Encryption Modes"'>RFC4344</a>] "aes128-ctr".)

   o  RSA with 2048-bit keys (For SSH, this would suggest avoiding
      [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] "ssh-rsa" using RSA with SHA1 as well as [<a href="./rfc6187" title='"X.509v3 Certificates for Secure Shell Authentication"'>RFC6187</a>]
      "x509v3-rsa2048-sha256" as well as any other RSA key that has a
      length less than 3072-bits or uses a hash less than SHA384.)

   o  Diffie-Hellman with 2048-bit keys (For SSH, this would suggest
      avoiding use of [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] both of "diffie-hellman-group1-sha1" and
      "diffie-hellman-group14-sha1" as well as avoiding
      "diffie-hellman-group14-sha256" added by this document.)

   The FAQ also states that NSS users should select DH groups based upon
   well-established and validated parameter sets that comply with the
   minimum required sizes.  Some specific examples include:

   o  Elliptic Curves are currently restricted to the NIST P-384 group
      only for both ECDH and ECDSA, in accordance with existing NIST and
      National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) standards.  (For
      SSH, this means using [<a href="./rfc5656" title='"Elliptic Curve Algorithm Integration in the Secure Shell Transport Layer"'>RFC5656</a>] "ecdh-sha2-nistp384" for key
      exchange and "ecdsa-sha2-nistp384" for Public Key Algorithm
      Names.)

   o  RSA moduli should have a minimum size of 3072 bits (other than the
      noted PKI exception), and keys should be generated in accordance
      with all relevant NIST standards.

   o  For Diffie-Hellman, use a Diffie-Hellman prime modulus of at least
      3072 bits.  (For bit sizes as specified in [<a href="./rfc3526" title='"More Modular Exponential (MODP) Diffie-Hellman groups for Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>RFC3526</a>], this would
      allow for any of group15, group16, group17, group18 to be used.)

   Although SSH may not always be used to protect Top Secret
   communications, this document adopts the use of the DH groups
   provided as an example in the FAQ as well as the use of SHA512 rather
   than SHA256 for the new DH groups.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Key%20Exchange%20Algorithms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Key Exchange Algorithms</span>

   This document adds some new Key Exchange Algorithm Method Names to
   what originally appeared in [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4250" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Assigned Numbers"'>RFC4250</a>].

   This document adopts the style and conventions of [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] in
   specifying how the use of new data key exchange is indicated in SSH.

   The following new key exchange method algorithms are defined:

   o  diffie-hellman-group14-sha256

   o  diffie-hellman-group15-sha512

   o  diffie-hellman-group16-sha512

   o  diffie-hellman-group17-sha512

   o  diffie-hellman-group18-sha512

   The SHA-2 family of secure hash algorithms is defined in [<a href="./rfc6234" title='"US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)"'>RFC6234</a>].

   The method of key exchange used for the name "diffie-hellman-
   group14-sha256" is the same as that for "diffie-hellman-group14-sha1"
   except that the SHA256 hash algorithm is used.  It is recommended
   that "diffie-hellman-group14-sha256" SHOULD be supported to smooth
   the transition to newer group sizes.

   The group15 through group18 names are the same as those specified in
   [<a href="./rfc3526" title='"More Modular Exponential (MODP) Diffie-Hellman groups for Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>RFC3526</a>]: 3072-bit MODP group15, 4096-bit MODP group16, 6144-bit
   MODP group17, and 8192-bit MODP group18.

   The SHA512 algorithm is to be used when "sha512" is specified as a
   part of the key exchange method name.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Checking%20the%20Peer%27s%20DH%20Public%20Key"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Checking the Peer's DH Public Key</span>

   <a href="./rfc4253#section-8">Section 8 of [RFC4253]</a> contains a small error in point 3.  When
   checking e (client Public Key) and f (server Public Key) values, an
   incorrect range is provided.  The erroneous text is:

      Values of 'e' or 'f' that are not in the range [1, p-1] MUST NOT
      be sent or accepted by either side.  If this condition is
      violated, the key exchange fails.

   The problem is that the range should have been an open interval
   excluding the endpoint values. (i.e., "(1, p-1)").  This document
   amends that document text as follows:

      DH Public Key values MUST be checked and both conditions:

         1 &lt; e &lt; p-1

         1 &lt; f &lt; p-1

      MUST be true.  Values not within these bounds MUST NOT be sent or
      accepted by either side.  If either one of these conditions is
      violated, then the key exchange fails.

   This simple check ensures that:

   o  The remote peer behaves properly.

   o  The local system is not forced into the two-element subgroup.

   The security considerations of [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] apply to this document.

   The security considerations of [<a href="./rfc3526" title='"More Modular Exponential (MODP) Diffie-Hellman groups for Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>RFC3526</a>] suggest that MODP group14
   through group18 have security strengths that range between 110 bits
   of security through 310 bits of security.  They are based on
   "Determining Strengths For Public Keys Used For Exchanging Symmetric
   Keys" [<a href="./rfc3766" title='"Determining Strengths For Public Keys Used For Exchanging Symmetric Keys"'>RFC3766</a>].  Care should be taken to use sufficient entropy and/
   or deterministic random-bit generator (DRBG) algorithms to maximize
   the true security strength of the key exchange and ciphers selected.

   Using a fixed set of Diffie-Hellman parameters makes them a high
   value target for pre-computation.  Generating additional sets of
   primes to be used, or moving to larger values mitigates this issue.
