Abstract

   This document is an addendum to <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a>, which specifies the RTP
   payload format for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB)
   speech codec.  This document specifies some updates in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a> to
   enable support for the new operating mode of VMR-WB standard (i.e.,
   VMR-WB mode 4).  These updates do not affect the existing modes of
   VMR-WB already specified in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a>.

   The payload formats and their associated parameters, as well as all
   provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc., that are
   specified in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a> are applicable to the new operating mode with
   no exception.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document is an addendum to <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload Format for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) Audio Codec"'>2</a>] and contains the
   necessary updates for the support of the new operating mode of 3GPP2
   VMR-WB standard [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Source-Controlled Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband Speech Codec (VMR-WB) Service Options 62 and 63 for Spread Spectrum Systems"'>1</a>].  The new mode of VMR-WB standard (VMR-WB mode
   4), although operating at a lower data rate, has similar
   characteristics and functionalities compared to the existing modes of
   VMR-WB already included in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a> (e.g., variable bit rate,
   narrowband/wideband input/output speech/audio processing capability,
   continuous and discontinuous transmission, etc.).  Therefore, all
   provisions and restrictions specified in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a> are applicable to
   all modes of the VMR-WB standard including the new mode, which is
   specified in this document.  As a result, no new media type
   registration is required.

   The VMR-WB file format for transport of VMR-WB speech data in storage
   mode applications is specified in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Source-Controlled Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband Speech Codec (VMR-WB) Service Options 62 and 63 for Spread Spectrum Systems"'>1</a>,<a href="#ref-4" title='"3GPP2 File Formats for Multimedia Services"'>4</a>] and includes support for the
   new mode of operation.

   The following sections provide the necessary updates to <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a> to
   enable support of VMR-WB mode 4.

   VMR-WB is the wideband speech-coding standard developed by the Third
   Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) for encoding/decoding
   wideband/narrowband speech content in multimedia services in 3G CDMA
   cellular systems [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Source-Controlled Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband Speech Codec (VMR-WB) Service Options 62 and 63 for Spread Spectrum Systems"'>1</a>].  VMR-WB is a source-controlled variable-rate
   multimode wideband speech codec.  It has a number of operating modes,
   where each mode is a trade-off between voice quality and average data
   rate.  The operating mode in VMR-WB (as shown in Table 2) is chosen
   based on the traffic condition of the network and the desired quality

   of service.  The desired average data rate (ADR) in each mode is
   obtained by encoding speech frames at permissible rates (as shown in
   Tables 1 and 3) compliant with CDMA2000 system depending on the
   instantaneous characteristics of input speech and the maximum and
   minimum rate constraints imposed by the network operator.

   The capabilities of the VMR-WB codec were extended through the
   addition of a new mode operating at lower average data rates,
   resulting in improved system capacity in IP and non-IP networks [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Source-Controlled Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband Speech Codec (VMR-WB) Service Options 62 and 63 for Spread Spectrum Systems"'>1</a>].

   As a result of this extension, certain reserved table entries in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc4348">4348</a> are used to include support for the new operating mode.  VMR-WB
   mode 4 is compliant with all applicable provisions and restrictions
   specified in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload Format for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) Audio Codec"'>2</a>].  Note that the existing table entries of
   <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a> remain unchanged (e.g., frame types) and the original modes
   of VMR-WB are not affected by these updates.

   The existing flexibility in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a> for future extensions allows the
   addition of the new mode without any impact on the interoperability
   with earlier implementations of <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a>.

   The following sections provide the necessary updates that are
   required to be made in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC 4348</a>.

   The provisions and considerations for implementation, congestion
   control, and security remain identical to those specified in <a href="./rfc4348">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc4348">4348</a>.
