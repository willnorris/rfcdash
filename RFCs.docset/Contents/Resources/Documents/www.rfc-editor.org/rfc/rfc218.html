     <span class="h1">To help us expand our role as NCC, we will be changing the</span>
status reporting facility of the IMP.  The change will take place
within the next month and should be transparent to the hosts.

     The text status reports will be removed.  They have already
been completely superseded by a binary version sent directly to
the NCC and are now just excess baggage.

     The status reports will remain with the statistics program
on fake host 3, but will no longer be affected by any of the
PARAMETER CHANGE parameters.  This will prevent the Hosts from
inadvertently interfering with the operation of the NCC.
