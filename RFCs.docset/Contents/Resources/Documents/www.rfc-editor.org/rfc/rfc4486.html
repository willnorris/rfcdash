Abstract

   This document defines several subcodes for the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION
   message that would provide more information to aid network operators
   in correlating network events and diagnosing BGP peering issues.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document defines several subcodes for the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION
   message that would provide more information to aid network operators
   in correlating network events and diagnosing BGP peering issues.  It
   also recommends that a BGP speaker implement a backoff mechanism in
   re-trying a BGP connection after the speaker receives a NOTIFICATION
   message with certain CEASE subcode.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Subcode%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Subcode Definition</span>

   The following subcodes are defined for the Cease NOTIFICATION
   message:

      Subcode     Symbolic Name

         1        Maximum Number of Prefixes Reached
         2        Administrative Shutdown
         3        Peer De-configured
         4        Administrative Reset
         5        Connection Rejected
         6        Other Configuration Change
         7        Connection Collision Resolution
         8        Out of Resources

   If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its peering with a neighbor
   because the number of address prefixes received from the neighbor
   exceeds a locally configured upper bound (as described in [<a href="#ref-BGP-4" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP-4</a>]),
   then the speaker MUST send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message
   with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Maximum Number of
   Prefixes Reached".  The message MAY optionally include the Address
   Family information [<a href="#ref-BGP-MP" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>BGP-MP</a>] and the upper bound in the "Data" field,
   as shown in Figure 1, where the meaning and use of the &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;
   tuple is the same as defined in [<a href="#ref-BGP-MP" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>BGP-MP</a>], Section 7.

                  +-------------------------------+
                  | AFI (2 octets)                |
                  +-------------------------------+
                  | SAFI (1 octet)                |
                  +-------------------------------+
                  | Prefix upper bound (4 octets) |
                  +-------------------------------+

                     Figure 1: Optional Data Field

   If a BGP speaker decides to administratively shut down its peering
   with a neighbor, then the speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message
   with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Administrative
   Shutdown".

   If a BGP speaker decides to de-configure a peer, then the speaker
   SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the
   Error Subcode "Peer De-configured".

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4486">RFC 4486</a>        BGP Cease Notification Message Subcodes       April 2006</span>


   If a BGP speaker decides to administratively reset the peering with a
   neighbor, then the speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with
   the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Administrative Reset".

   If a BGP speaker decides to disallow a BGP connection (e.g., the peer
   is not configured locally) after the speaker accepts a transport
   protocol connection, then the BGP speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION
   message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Connection
   Rejected".

   If a BGP speaker decides to administratively reset the peering with a
   neighbor due to a configuration change other than the ones described
   above, then the speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with the
   Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Other Configuration Change".

   If a BGP speaker decides to send a NOTIFICATION message with the
   Error Code Cease as a result of the collision resolution procedure
   (as described in [<a href="#ref-BGP-4" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP-4</a>]), then the subcode SHOULD be set to
   "Connection Collision Resolution".

   If a BGP speaker runs out of resources (e.g., memory) and decides to
   reset a session, then the speaker MAY send a NOTIFICATION message
   with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Out of Resources".

   It is RECOMMENDED that a BGP speaker behave as though the
   DampPeerOscillations attribute [<a href="#ref-BGP-4" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP-4</a>] were true for this peer when
   re-trying a BGP connection after the speaker receives a Cease
   NOTIFICATION message with a subcode of "Administrative Shutdown",
   "Peer De-configured", "Connection Rejected", or "Out of Resources".
   An implementation SHOULD impose an upper bound on the number of
   consecutive automatic retries.  Once this bound is reached, the
   implementation would stop re-trying any BGP connections until some
   administrative intervention, i.e., set the AllowAutomaticStart
   attribute [<a href="#ref-BGP-4" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP-4</a>] to FALSE.

   This document defines the subcodes 1 - 8 for the BGP Cease
   NOTIFICATION message.  Future assignments are to be made using either
   the Standards Action process defined in [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC-2434</a>], or the Early IANA
   Allocation process defined in [<a href="./rfc4020" title='"Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points"'>RFC-4020</a>].  Assignments consist of a
   name and the value.

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing BGP.
