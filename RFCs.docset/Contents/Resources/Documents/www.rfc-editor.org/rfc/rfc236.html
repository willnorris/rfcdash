                          <span class="h1">STANDARD HOST NAMES</span>


In RFC #226, Peggy Karp suggested that there be a set of standard host names,
that the names be 6 characters in length, and gave a partial list.  In RFC
#229, I suggested 8 character names and gave a longer list.  Here I present
my list again with some modifications.

I also suggest that as far as possible the Standard host names be consistent
with the site names used by the Network Information Center.  It also seems
to me to be a good idea to consult with each host's technical liaison officer
before assigning that host's name.

It has been brought to my attention that programmers are lazy and don't like
to deal with character strings longer than one computer word or containing
characters other than the capital letters A-Z or the digits 0-9.  Thus, I
have included an alternate list which is limited to 4 character names using
only the alphanumerics.
