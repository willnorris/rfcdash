RFC #233, NIC #7650                                     Bob Metcalfe

                 Standardization of Host Call Letters
                 ------------------------------------

We agree with Peggy Karp (See RFC #226) that there would be some
benefit in standardizing the symbolic host names used in TELNET
programs.  It should be recognized that there is a trade-off
between brevity and mnemonicism.  It is our feeling that a good
set of host call letters can be developed using only four
characters (see Jim White's in RFC #206.)  Each host should
suggest its own call letters.  Upper and lower case letters
should be used interchangeably.  The following is our currently
recommended list:

       Host Number    Name-4            Name-8
       -----------    ------            ------
             1          sex             sex-ucla
