Obsoletes  None

      <span class="h1">This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from November</span>
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8%20%20to"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>  to  </span>November 19.  On November 18, however, the BBN prototype Terminal
IMP (Network Address 158) was inaccessible due to hardware debugging.

      Several Hosts are  currently  excluded  fron  the  daily  testing.
These Hosts fall into two categories:

      1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on
          the Network as servers (available for use from
          other sites) for at least two weeks.  Included here
          are:

          Network
          Address        Site             Computer

            71           Rand             PDP-10
            74           Lincoln          TX2
            13           Case             PDP-10
            14           Carnegie         PDP-10
            15           Ames             B6500
            16           Ames             IBM-360/67

      2)  Hosts which are curently intended to be users only.
          Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are
          presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, and BBN*).
          This category also includes the Network Control
          Center Computer (Network Address 5) which is used
          solely for gathering statistics from the Network.
          Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:

          Network
          Address        Site             Computer

             7           Rand             IBM-360/65
            73           Harvard          PDP-1
            12           Illinois         PDP-11

      During these two weeks the Lincoln Labs TX2 Hosts became a Network
User.  The SDC IBM 360/67 is now a server.

* The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and
as such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being
used to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

   D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to
             network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN
             Terminal IMP.)

   R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

   T = Timed out (Destination Host did not respond in any way to the
             initial RFC, although not dead.)

   H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
             immediately closed it, or did not respond further.)

   O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to
             users.)


   * The UCLA IBM-360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS),
     but has not implemented a full server Telnet System.  The BBN
     Terminal IMP is not equipped to test NETRJS; however, we are
     assuming that receipt of the UCLA explanatory message indicates
     that NETRJS is also functioning.

   # These sites advertise that they may not have their system
     available at these times.
