Request for Comments: 1096                    Carnegie Mellon University
                                                              March 1989


                    <span class="h1">Telnet X Display Location Option</span>

Status of This Memo

   This RFC specifies a standard for the Internet community.  Hosts on
   the Internet that transmit the X display location within the Telnet
   protocol are expected to adopt and implement this standard.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

   This standard is modelled on <a href="./rfc1079">RFC 1079</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Telnet Terminal Speed Option"'>1</a>], the telnet terminal speed
   option.  Much of the text of this document is copied from that RFC.

Motivation

   When a user is running the Telnet client under the X window system,
   it is useful for the remote Telnet to know the X display location of
   that client.  For example, the user might wish to start other X
   applications from the remote host using the same display location as
   the Telnet client.  The purpose of this option is to make this
   information available through telnet connections.

      IAC WILL X-DISPLAY-LOCATION

         Sender is willing to send the X display location in a
         subsequent sub-negotiation.

      IAC WON'T X-DISPLAY-LOCATION

         Sender refuses to send the X display location.

      IAC DO X-DISPLAY-LOCATION

         Sender is willing to receive the X display location in a
         subsequent sub-negotiation.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1096">RFC 1096</a>            Telnet X Display Location Option          March 1989</span>


      IAC DON'T X-DISPLAY-LOCATION

         Sender refuses to accept the X display location.

      IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION SEND IAC SE

         Sender requests receiver to transmit his (the receiver's) X
         display location.  The code for SEND is 1.  (See below.)

      IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION IS ... IAC SE

         Sender is stating his X display location.  The code for IS is
         0.  (See below.)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Default"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Default</span>

      WON'T X-DISPLAY-LOCATION

         The X display location will not be exchanged.

      DON'T X-DISPLAY-LOCATION

         The X display location will not be exchanged.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Description%20of%20the%20Option"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Description of the Option</span>

   WILL and DO are used only to obtain and grant permission for future
   discussion.  The actual exchange of status information occurs within
   option subcommands (IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION...).

   Once the two hosts have exchanged a WILL and a DO, the sender of the
   DO X-DISPLAY-LOCATION is free to request the X display location.
   Only the sender of the DO may send requests (IAC SB X-DISPLAY-
   LOCATION SEND IAC SE) and only the sender of the WILL may transmit
   actual X display location (within an IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION IS ...
   IAC SE command).  The X display location may not be sent
   spontaneously, but only in response to a request.

   The X display location is an NVT ASCII string.  This string follows
   the normal Unix convention used for the DISPLAY environment variable,
   e.g.,

         &lt;host&gt;:&lt;dispnum&gt;[.&lt;screennum&gt;]

   No extraneous characters such as spaces may be included.

      The following is an example of use of the option:

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1096">RFC 1096</a>            Telnet X Display Location Option          March 1989</span>


         Host1: IAC DO X-DISPLAY-LOCATION

         Host2: IAC WILL X-DISPLAY-LOCATION

      (Host1 is now free to request status information at any time.)

         Host1: IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION SEND IAC SE

         Host2: IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION IS "SRI-NIC.ARPA:0.0" IAC SE

      (This command is 22 octets.)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20Implementation%20Suggestions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. Implementation Suggestions</span>

   Since the X display location may not contain a hostname on the client
   host, i.e., ":0" or "unix:0.0", the Telnet client will need to modify
   the location appropriately before sending it on to the remote Telnet.
