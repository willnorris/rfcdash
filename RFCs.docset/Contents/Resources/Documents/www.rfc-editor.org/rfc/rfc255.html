   This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from October 12
   to October 22.  (Monday, October 11 was Columbus Day.)  During these
   two weeks, the general status of these Hosts remained as it had been
   previously.

   The table on the following page summarizes the daily information on
   Host status for this period.

   where

      D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to
      network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal
      IMP.)

      R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

      T = Timed out (Destination Host did not respond in any way to the
      initial RFC, although not dead.)

      H = 1/2  Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then
      either immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

      O = Opened (Destination Host opened a connection and was
      accessible to user.)

      * The UCLA IMB-360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS),
      but has not implemented a full server Telnet System.  The BBN
      Terminal IMP is not equipped to test NETRJS however, we are
      assuming that receipt of the UCLA explanatory message indicates
      that NETRJS is also functioning.

      # These sites advertise that they may not have their system
      available at these times.
