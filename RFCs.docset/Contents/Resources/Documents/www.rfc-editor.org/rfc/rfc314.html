   A block of rooms has been reserved at the Tysons Corner
   Holiday Inn which is approximately 1 mile from Mitre (see

      In addition, we have an Imlac on loan.

   If there is sufficient interest, a banquet will be arranged at
   a local inn.

   Washington should be very attractive at this time of year with
   the cherry trees in bloom. I look forward to seeing all of you
   again!
