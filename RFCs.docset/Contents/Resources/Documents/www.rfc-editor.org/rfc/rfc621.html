RFC # 621                                             SRI-ARC
NIC # 21994                                           March 6, 1974


                    <span class="h1">NIC USER DIRECTORIES AT SRI-ARC</span>


On Friday evening 8-Mar-74, we will delete all those directories at
SRI-ARC that belonged to NIC users who were transferred to OFFICE-1.

Simultaneous1y, there is to be a change at each Network Host such that
the Hostname "NIC" will refer to OFFICE-1 (Host 53 octal), not to SRI-
ARC. (See RFC# 620, NIC# 21993)

The effect of these changes is that Network mail sent to NIC users in
the form
    "nicusername@NIC"
will be delivered to OFFICE-1, as it should.

But if such mail is sent to
    "nicusername@SRI-ARC"
it will not be accepted at SRI-ARC, because the NIC user's username will
be no longer be known there.

PLEASE NOTE THAT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO READ ANY NETWORK MAIL THAT
WAS DELIVERED TO YOU AT SRI-ARC PRIOR TO FRIDAY EVENING 8-MARCH.  THIS
MAIL WILL BE DELETED AT THAT TIME.
