Abstract

   This document describes a number of changes to TLS and DTLS IANA
   registries that range from adding notes to the registry all the way
   to changing the registration policy.  These changes were mostly
   motivated by WG review of the TLS- and DTLS-related registries
   undertaken as part of the TLS 1.3 development process.

   This document updates the following RFCs: 3749, 5077, 4680, 5246,
   5705, 5878, 6520, and 7301.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Per this document, IANA has made changes to a number of IANA
   registries related to Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  These changes were almost entirely
   motivated by the development of TLS 1.3 [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>].

   The changes introduced by this document range from simple, e.g.,
   adding notes, to complex, e.g., changing a registry's registration
   policy.  Instead of listing the changes and their rationale here in
   the introduction, each section provides rationale for the proposed
   change(s).

   This document proposes no changes to the registration policies for
   TLS Alerts [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>], TLS ContentType [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>], TLS HandshakeType
   [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>], and TLS Certificate Status Types [<a href="./rfc6961" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Multiple Certificate Status Request Extension"'>RFC6961</a>] registries; the
   existing policies (Standards Action for the first three; IETF Review
   for the last), are appropriate for these one-byte code points because
   of their scarcity.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Adding%20%22TLS%22%20to%20Registry%20Names"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Adding "TLS" to Registry Names</span>

   For consistency amongst TLS registries, IANA has prepended "TLS" to
   the following registries:

   o  Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs
      [<a href="./rfc7301" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension"'>RFC7301</a>],

   o  ExtensionType Values,

   o  Heartbeat Message Types [<a href="./rfc6520" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Heartbeat Extension"'>RFC6520</a>], and

   o  Heartbeat Modes [<a href="./rfc6520" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Heartbeat Extension"'>RFC6520</a>].

   IANA has updated the reference for these four registries to also
   refer to this document.  The remainder of this document will use the
   registry names with the "TLS" prefix.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8447">RFC 8447</a>         IANA Registry Updates for TLS and DTLS      August 2018</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Aligning%20with%20RFC%208126"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Aligning with <a href="./rfc8126">RFC 8126</a></span>

   Many of the TLS-related IANA registries had the registration
   procedure "IETF Consensus", which was changed to "IETF Review" by
   [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  To align with the new terminology, IANA has updated the
   following registries to "IETF Review":

   o  TLS Authorization Data Formats [<a href="./rfc4680" title='"TLS Handshake Message for Supplemental Data"'>RFC4680</a>]

   o  TLS Supplemental Data Formats (SupplementalDataType) [<a href="./rfc5878" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authorization Extensions"'>RFC5878</a>]

   This is not a universal change, as some registries originally defined
   with "IETF Consensus" are undergoing other changes either as a result
   of this document, [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>], or [<a href="./rfc8422" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Versions 1.2 and Earlier"'>RFC8422</a>].

   IANA has updated the reference for these two registries to also refer
   to this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Adding%20%22Recommended%22%20Column"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Adding "Recommended" Column</span>

   Per this document, a "Recommended" column has been added to many of
   the TLS registries to indicate parameters that are generally
   recommended for implementations to support.  Adding a "Recommended"
   parameter (i.e., "Y") to a registry or updating a parameter to
   "Recommended" status requires Standards Action.  Not all parameters
   defined in Standards Track documents need to be marked as
   "Recommended".

   If an item is not marked as "Recommended" (i.e., "N"), it does not
   necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the
   item either has not been through the IETF consensus process, has
   limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.

   The nomenclature for the registry entries in the TLS ExtensionType
   Values registry correspond to the presentation language field name
   except for entry 35.  To ensure that the values in the registry are
   consistently identified in the registry, IANA:

   o  has renamed entry 35 to "session_ticket (renamed from
      "SessionTicket TLS")" [<a href="./rfc5077" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Resumption without Server-Side State"'>RFC5077</a>].

   o  has added a reference to this document in the "Reference" column
      for entry 35.

   Experience has shown that the IETF Review registry policy for TLS
   extensions was too strict.  Based on WG consensus, the decision was
   taken to change the registration policy to Specification Required
   [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] while reserving a small part of the code space for private
   use.  Therefore, IANA has updated the TLS ExtensionType Values
   registry as follows:

   o  Changed the registry policy to:

      Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are
      assigned via Specification Required [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  Values with the
      first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].

   o  Updated the "Reference" to also refer to this document.

   See <a href="#section-17">Section 17</a> for additional information about the designated expert
   pool.

   Despite wanting to "loosen" the registration policies for TLS
   extensions, it is still useful to indicate in the IANA registry which
   extensions the WG recommends be supported.  Therefore, IANA has
   updated the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:

   o  Added a "Recommended" column with the contents as listed below.
      This table has been generated by marking Standards Track RFCs as
      "Y" and all others as "N".  The "Recommended" column is assigned a
      value of "N" unless explicitly requested, and adding a value with
      a "Recommended" value of "Y" requires Standards Action [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].
      IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y-&gt;N transition.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8447">RFC 8447</a>         IANA Registry Updates for TLS and DTLS      August 2018</span>


   IANA has added the following notes:

   Note:  The role of the designated expert is described in <a href="./rfc8447">RFC 8447</a>.
      The designated expert [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] ensures that the specification is
      publicly available.  It is sufficient to have an Internet-Draft
      (that is posted and never published as an RFC) or a document from
      another standards body, industry consortium, university site, etc.
      The expert may provide more in-depth reviews, but their approval
      should not be taken as an endorsement of the extension.

   Note:  As specified in [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>], assignments made in the Private Use
      space are not generally useful for broad interoperability.  It is
      the responsibility of those making use of the Private Use range to
      ensure that no conflicts occur (within the intended scope of use).
      For widespread experiments, temporary reservations are available.

   Note:  If an item is not marked as "Recommended", it does not
      necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the
      item either has not been through the IETF consensus process, has
      limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.

   The extensions added by [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>] are omitted from the above table;
   additionally, token_binding is omitted, since [<a href="#ref-TOKBIND" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extension for Token Binding Protocol Negotiation"'>TOKBIND</a>] specifies the
   value of the "Recommended" column for this extension.

   [<a id="ref-RFC8446">RFC8446</a>] also uses the TLS ExtensionType Values registry originally
   created in [<a href="./rfc4366" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions"'>RFC4366</a>].  The following text is from [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>] and is
   included here to ensure alignment between these specifications.

   o  IANA has updated this registry to include the "key_share",
      "pre_shared_key", "psk_key_exchange_modes", "early_data",
      "cookie", "supported_versions", "certificate_authorities",
      "oid_filters", "post_handshake_auth", and
      "signature_algorithms_cert" extensions with the values defined in
      [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>] and the "Recommended" value of "Y".

   o  IANA has updated this registry to include a "TLS 1.3" column that
      lists the messages in which the extension may appear.  This column
      has been initially populated from the table in <a href="./rfc8446#section-4.2">SectionÂ 4.2 of
      [RFC8446]</a> with any extension not listed there marked as "-" to
      indicate that it is not used by TLS 1.3.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20TLS%20Cipher%20Suites%20Registry"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  TLS Cipher Suites Registry</span>

   Experience has shown that the IETF Consensus registry policy for TLS
   Cipher Suites was too strict.  Based on WG consensus, the decision
   was taken to change the TLS Cipher Suites registry's registration
   policy to Specification Required [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] while reserving a small
   part of the code space for private use.  Therefore, IANA has updated
   the TLS Cipher Suites registry's policy as follows:

      Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are
      assigned via Specification Required [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  Values with the
      first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].

   See <a href="#section-17">Section 17</a> for additional information about the designated expert
   pool.

   The TLS Cipher Suites registry has grown significantly and will
   continue to do so.  To better guide those not intimately involved in
   TLS, IANA has updated the TLS Cipher Suites registry as follows:

   o  Added a "Recommended" column to the TLS Cipher Suites registry.
      The cipher suites that follow in the two tables are marked as "Y".
      All other cipher suites are marked as "N".  The "Recommended"
      column is assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly requested, and
      adding a value with a "Recommended" value of "Y" requires
      Standards Action [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y-&gt;N
      transition.

   The cipher suites that follow are Standards Track server-
   authenticated (and optionally client-authenticated) cipher suites
   that are currently available in TLS 1.2.

   Cipher Suite Name                             | Value

   The cipher suites that follow are Standards Track ephemeral pre-
   shared key cipher suites that are available in TLS 1.2.

   Cipher Suite Name                             | Value

   TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256     | {0xCC,0xAD}

   The TLS 1.3 cipher suites specified by [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>] are not listed here;
   that document provides for their "Recommended" status.

   Despite the following behavior being misguided, experience has shown
   that some customers use the IANA registry as a checklist against
   which to measure an implementation's completeness, and some
   implementers blindly implement cipher suites.  Therefore, IANA has
   added the following warning to the registry:

   WARNING:  Cryptographic algorithms and parameters will be broken or
      weakened over time.  Blindly implementing cipher suites listed
      here is not advised.  Implementers and users need to check that
      the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide the
      expected level of security.

   IANA has added the following note to ensure that those that focus on
   IANA registries are aware that TLS 1.3 [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>] uses the same
   registry but defines ciphers differently:

   Note:  Although TLS 1.3 uses the same cipher suite space as previous
      versions of TLS, TLS 1.3 cipher suites are defined differently,
      only specifying the symmetric ciphers and hash function, and
      cannot be used for TLS 1.2.  Similarly, TLS 1.2 and lower cipher
      suite values cannot be used with TLS 1.3.

   IANA has added the following notes to document the rules for
   populating the "Recommended" column:

   Note:  CCM_8 cipher suites are not marked as "Recommended".  These
      cipher suites have a significantly truncated authentication tag
      that represents a security trade-off that may not be appropriate
      for general environments.

   Note:  If an item is not marked as "Recommended", it does not
      necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the
      item either has not been through the IETF consensus process, has
      limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.

   IANA has added the following notes for additional information:

   Note:  The role of the designated expert is described in <a href="./rfc8447">RFC 8447</a>.
      The designated expert [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] ensures that the specification is

      another standards body, industry consortium, university site, etc.
      The expert may provide more in-depth reviews, but their approval
      should not be taken as an endorsement of the cipher suite.

   Note:  As specified in [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>], assignments made in the Private Use
      space are not generally useful for broad interoperability.  It is
      the responsibility of those making use of the Private Use range to
      ensure that no conflicts occur (within the intended scope of use).
      For widespread experiments, temporary reservations are available.

   IANA has updated the reference for this registry to also refer to
   this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20TLS%20Supported%20Groups"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  TLS Supported Groups</span>

   Similar to cipher suites, supported groups have proliferated over
   time, and some use the registry to measure implementations.
   Therefore, IANA has added a "Recommended" column with a "Y" for
   secp256r1, secp384r1, x25519, and x448, while all others are "N".
   These "Y" groups are taken from Standards Track RFCs; [<a href="./rfc8422" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Versions 1.2 and Earlier"'>RFC8422</a>]
   elevates secp256r1 and secp384r1 to Standards Track.  Not all groups
   from [<a href="./rfc8422" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Versions 1.2 and Earlier"'>RFC8422</a>], which is Standards Track, are marked as "Y"; these
   groups apply to TLS 1.3 [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>] and previous versions of TLS.  The
   "Recommended" column is assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly
   requested, and adding a value with a "Recommended" value of "Y"
   requires Standards Action [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a
   Y-&gt;N transition.

   IANA has added the following notes:

   Note:  If an item is not marked as "Recommended", it does not

   IANA has updated the reference for this registry to also refer to

   The value 0 (0x0000) has been marked as reserved.

   Experience has shown that the IETF Consensus registry policy for TLS
   ClientCertificateType Identifiers is too strict.  Based on WG
   consensus, the decision was taken to change the registration policy
   to Specification Required [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] while reserving some of the code

   for private use.  Therefore, IANA has updated the TLS
   ClientCertificateType Identifiers registry's policy as follows:

      Values in the range 0-63 are assigned via Standards Action.
      Values 64-223 are assigned via Specification Required [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].

   To align with TLS implementations and to align the naming
   nomenclature with other Handshake message types, IANA:

   o  has renamed entry 4 in the TLS HandshakeType registry to
      "new_session_ticket (renamed from NewSessionTicket)" [<a href="./rfc5077" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Resumption without Server-Side State"'>RFC5077</a>].

   To aid those reviewers who start with the IANA registry, IANA has
   added:

   o  The following note to the TLS Exporter Labels registry:

   Note:  [<a href="./rfc5705" title='"Keying Material Exporters for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC5705</a>] defines keying material exporters for TLS in terms
      of the TLS PRF.  [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>] replaced the PRF with HKDF, thus
      requiring a new construction.  The exporter interface remains the
      same; however, the value is computed differently.

   o  A "Recommended" column to the TLS Exporter Labels registry.  The
      table that follows has been generated by marking Standards Track
      RFCs as "Y" and all others as "N".  The "Recommended" column is
      assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly requested, and adding a
      value with a "Recommended" value of "Y" requires Standards Action
      [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y-&gt;N transition.

   To provide additional information for the designated experts, IANA
   has added the following notes:

   Note:  The role of the designated expert is described in <a href="./rfc8447">RFC 8447</a>.
      The designated expert [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] ensures that the specification is
      publicly available.  It is sufficient to have an Internet-Draft
      (that is posted and never published as an RFC) or a document from
      another standards body, industry consortium, university site, etc.
      The expert may provide more in-depth reviews, but their approval
      should not be taken as an endorsement of the exporter label.  The
      expert also verifies that the label is a string consisting of
      printable ASCII characters beginning with "EXPORTER".  IANA MUST
      also verify that one label is not a prefix of any other label.
      For example, labels "key" or "master secretary" are forbidden.

   Note:  If an item is not marked as "Recommended", it does not
      necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the
      item either has not been through the IETF consensus process, has

   IANA has added the following entry to the TLS Alerts registry; the
   entry was omitted from the IANA instructions in [<a href="./rfc7301" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension"'>RFC7301</a>]:

   Experience has shown that the IETF Consensus registry policy for TLS
   Certificate Types is too strict.  Based on WG consensus, the decision
   was taken to change registration policy to Specification Required
   [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] while reserving a small part of the code space for private
   use.  Therefore, IANA has changed the TLS Certificate Types registry
   as follows:

   o  Changed the registry policy to:

      Values in the range 0-223 (decimal) are assigned via Specification
      Required [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  Values in the range 224-255 (decimal) are
      reserved for Private Use [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].

   o  Added a "Recommended" column to the registry.  X.509 and Raw
      Public Key are "Y".  All others are "N".  The "Recommended" column
      is assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly requested, and adding
      a value with a "Recommended" value of "Y" requires Standards
      Action [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y-&gt;N
      transition.

   See <a href="#section-17">Section 17</a> for additional information about the designated expert
   pool.

   IANA has added the following notes:

   Note:  The role of the designated expert is described in <a href="./rfc8447">RFC 8447</a>.
      The designated expert [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] ensures that the specification is
      publicly available.  It is sufficient to have an Internet-Draft
      (that is posted and never published as an RFC) or a document from
      another standards body, industry consortium, university site, etc.
      The expert may provide more in-depth reviews, but their approval
      should not be taken as an endorsement of the certificate type.

   Note:  If an item is not marked as "Recommended", it does not
      necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the
      item either has not been through the IETF consensus process, has
      limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.

   IANA has updated the reference for this registry to also refer this
   document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/15.%20%20Orphaned%20Registries"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-15" id="section-15">15</a>.  Orphaned Registries</span>

   To make it clear that (D)TLS 1.3 has orphaned certain registries
   (i.e., they are only applicable to version of (D)TLS protocol
   versions prior to 1.3), IANA:

   o  has added the following to the TLS Compression Method Identifiers
      registry [<a href="./rfc3749" title='"Transport Layer Security Protocol Compression Methods"'>RFC3749</a>]:

   Note:  Value 0 (NULL) is the only value in this registry applicable
      to (D)TLS protocol version 1.3 or later.

   o  has added the following to the TLS HashAlgorithm [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>] and TLS
      SignatureAlgorithm registries [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>]:

   Note:  The values in this registry are only applicable to (D)TLS
      protocol versions prior to 1.3.  (D)TLS 1.3 and later versions'
      values are registered in the TLS SignatureScheme registry.

   o  has updated the "Reference" field in the TLS Compression Method
      Identifiers, TLS HashAlgorithm and TLS SignatureAlgorithm
      registries to also refer to this document.

   o  has updated the TLS HashAlgorithm registry to list values 7 and
      9-223 as "Reserved" and the TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry to
      list values 4-6 and 9-223 as "Reserved".

   o  has added the following to the TLS ClientCertificateType
      Identifiers registry [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>]:

   Note:  The values in this registry are only applicable to (D)TLS
      protocol versions prior to 1.3.

   Despite the fact that the TLS HashAlgorithm and SignatureAlgorithm
   registries are orphaned, it is still important to warn implementers
   of pre-TLS1.3 implementations about the dangers of blindly
   implementing cryptographic algorithms.  Therefore, IANA has added the
   following warning to the TLS HashAlgorithm and SignatureAlgorithm
   registries:

   WARNING:  Cryptographic algorithms and parameters will be broken or
      weakened over time.  Blindly implementing the cryptographic
      algorithms listed here is not advised.  Implementers and users
      need to check that the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to
      provide the expected level of security.

   IANA has added the following warning and note to the TLS
   SignatureScheme registry:

   WARNING:  Cryptographic algorithms and parameters will be broken or
      weakened over time.  Blindly implementing signature schemes listed
      here is not advised.  Implementers and users need to check that
      the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide the
      expected level of security.

   Note:  As specified in [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>], assignments made in the Private Use
      space are not generally useful for broad interoperability.  It is
      the responsibility of those making use of the Private Use range to
      ensure that no conflicts occur (within the intended scope of use).
      For widespread experiments, temporary reservations are available.

   IANA has added the following notes to the TLS PskKeyExchangeMode
   registry:

   Note:  If an item is not marked as "Recommended", it does not
      necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the
      item either has not been through the IETF consensus process, has
      limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.

   Note:  The role of the designated expert is described in <a href="./rfc8447">RFC 8447</a>.
      The designated expert [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] ensures that the specification is
      publicly available.  It is sufficient to have an Internet-Draft
      (that is posted and never published as an RFC) or a document from
      another standards body, industry consortium, university site, etc.
      The expert may provide more in depth reviews, but their approval
      should not be taken as an endorsement of the key exchange mode.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/17.%20%20Designated%20Expert%20Pool"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-17" id="section-17">17</a>.  Designated Expert Pool</span>

   Specification Required [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] registry requests are registered
   after a three-week review period on the &lt;tls-reg-review@ietf.org&gt;
   mailing list, on the advice of one or more designated experts.
   However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
   the designated experts may approve registration once they are
   satisfied that such a specification will be published.

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review SHOULD use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register value in TLS bar
   registry").






<span class="grey">Salowey &amp; Turner             Standards Track                   [Page 16]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-17"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8447">RFC 8447</a>         IANA Registry Updates for TLS and DTLS      August 2018</span>


   Within the review period, the designated experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.  Denials SHOULD include an explanation and, if
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.
   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than
   21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   &lt;iesg@ietf.org&gt; mailing list) for resolution.

   Criteria that SHOULD be applied by the designated experts includes
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   useful only for a single application, and whether the registration
   description is clear.

   IANA MUST only accept registry updates from the designated experts
   and SHOULD direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

   It is suggested that multiple designated experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification, in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   Expert, that Expert SHOULD defer to the judgment of the other
   Experts.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/18.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-18" id="section-18">18</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The change to Specification Required from IETF Review lowers the
   amount of review provided by the WG for cipher suites and supported
   groups.  This change reflects reality in that the WG essentially
   provided no cryptographic review of the cipher suites or supported
   groups.  This was especially true of national cipher suites.

   Recommended algorithms are regarded as secure for general use at the
   time of registration; however, cryptographic algorithms and
   parameters will be broken or weakened over time.  It is possible that
   the "Recommended" status in the registry lags behind the most recent
   advances in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and users need to check that
   the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide the expected
   level of security.

   Designated experts ensure the specification is publicly available.
   They may provide more in-depth reviews.  Their review should not be
   taken as an endorsement of the cipher suite, extension, supported
   group, etc.
