   This document provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding the registration of values related to the
   Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), defined in [<a href="./rfc2661" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)"'>RFC2661</a>], in
   accordance with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp26">BCP 26</a>, [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC2434</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a> Terminology</span>

   The following terms are used here with the meanings defined in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp26">BCP 26</a>:  "name space", "assigned value", "registration".

   The following policies are used here with the meanings defined in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp26">BCP 26</a>: "Private Use", "First Come First Served", "Expert Review",
   "Specification Required", "IETF Consensus", "Standards Action".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. IANA Considerations</span>

   L2TP [<a href="./rfc2661" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)"'>RFC2661</a>] defines a number of "magic" numbers to be maintained
   by the IANA.  This section updates the criteria to be used by the
   IANA to assign additional numbers in each of these lists.

   Each of the values identified in this document that require a
   registration criteria update are currently maintained by IANA and
   have a range of values from 0 to 65 535, of which a very small number
   have been allocated (the maximum number allocated within any one
   range is 46) [<a href="#ref-L2TP-IANA" title="&quot;Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 'L2TP' - RFC 2661&quot;">L2TP-IANA</a>].  Given the nature of these values, it is
   not expected that any will ever run into a resource allocation
   problem if registration allocation requirements are relaxed from
   their current state.

   The recommended criteria changes for IANA registration are listed in
   the following sections.  In one case, the registration criteria is
   currently defined as First Come First Served and should be made more
   strict, others are defined as IETF Consensus and need to be relaxed.
   The relaxation from IETF Consensus is motivated by specific cases in
   which values that were never intended to be vendor-specific have had
   to enter early field trials or be released in generally available
   products with vendor-specific values while awaiting documents to be
   formalized.  In most cases, this results in products that have to
   support both the vendor-specific value and IETF value indefinitely.

   For registration requests where a Designated Expert should be
   consulted, the responsible IESG Area Director should appoint the
   Designated Expert.

   For registration requests requiring Expert Review, the Designated
   Expert should consult relevant WGs as appropriate (e.g., the l2tpext
   WG at the time of this writing).

   The basic guideline for the Expert Review process will be to approve
   the assignment of a value only if there is a document being advanced
   that clearly defines the values to be assigned, and there is active

   implementation development (perhaps entering early field or
   interoperability trails, requiring assigned values to proceed without
   having to resort to a chosen vendor-specific method).

   IANA manages the "Control Message Attribute Value Pairs" [<a href="#ref-L2TP-IANA" title="&quot;Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 'L2TP' - RFC 2661&quot;">L2TP-IANA</a>]
   name space, of which 0 - 46 have been assigned.  The criteria for
   assignment was originally IETF Consensus.  Further values should be
   assigned upon Expert Review.

   IANA manages the "Message Type AVP (Attribute Type 0) Values" [L2TP-
   IANA] name space, of which 0 - 16 have been assigned.  The criteria
   for assignment was originally IETF Consensus.  Further values should
   be assigned upon Expert Review.

   IANA maintains a list of "Result Code values for the StopCCN
   message," "Result Code values for the CDN message," and "General
   Error Codes" [<a href="#ref-L2TP-IANA" title="&quot;Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 'L2TP' - RFC 2661&quot;">L2TP-IANA</a>].  The criteria for Error Code assignment was
   originally First Come First Served, and the criteria for CDN and
   StopCCN Result Codes were originally IETF Consensus.  Further values
   for all Result and Error codes should be assigned upon Expert Review.
