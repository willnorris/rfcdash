 <span class="h1">Shortest Path First (SPF) Back-Off Delay Algorithm for Link-State IGPs</span>

Abstract

   This document defines a standard algorithm to temporarily postpone or
   "back off" link-state IGP Shortest Path First (SPF) computations.
   This reduces the computational load and churn on IGP nodes when
   multiple temporally close network events trigger multiple SPF
   computations.

   Having one standard algorithm improves interoperability by reducing
   the probability and/or duration of transient forwarding loops during
   the IGP convergence when the IGP reacts to multiple temporally close
   IGP events.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Link-state IGPs, such as IS-IS [<a href="#ref-ISO10589">ISO10589</a>], OSPF [<a href="./rfc2328" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>RFC2328</a>], and OSPFv3
   [<a href="./rfc5340" title='"OSPF for IPv6"'>RFC5340</a>], perform distributed route computation on all routers in
   the area/level.  In order to have consistent routing tables across
   the network, such distributed computation requires that all routers
   have the same version of the network topology (Link-State Database
   (LSDB)) and perform their computation essentially at the same time.

   In general, when the network is stable, there is a desire to trigger
   a new Shortest Path First (SPF) computation as soon as a failure is
   detected in order to quickly route around the failure.  However, when
   the network is experiencing multiple failures over a short period of
   time, there is a conflicting desire to limit the frequency of SPF
   computations, which would allow a reduction in control plane
   resources used by IGPs and all protocols/subsystems reacting to the
   attendant route change, such as LDP [<a href="./rfc5036" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC5036</a>], RSVP-TE [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>], BGP
   [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>], Fast Reroute computations (e.g., Loop-Free Alternates
   (LFAs) [<a href="./rfc5286" title='"Basic Specification for IP Fast Reroute: Loop-Free Alternates"'>RFC5286</a>]), FIB updates, etc.  This also reduces network churn
   and, in particular, reduces side effects (such as micro-loops
   [<a href="./rfc5715" title='"A Framework for Loop-Free Convergence"'>RFC5715</a>]) that ensue during IGP convergence.

   To allow for this, IGPs usually implement an SPF Back-Off Delay
   algorithm that postpones or backs off the SPF computation.  However,
   different implementations chose different algorithms.  Hence, in a
   multi-vendor network, it's not possible to ensure that all routers
   trigger their SPF computation after the same delay.  This situation
   increases the average and maximum differential delay between routers
   completing their SPF computation.  It also increases the probability
   that different routers compute their FIBs based on different LSDB
   versions.  Both factors increase the probability and/or duration of
   micro-loops as discussed in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   This document specifies a standard algorithm to allow multi-vendor
   networks to have all routers delay their SPF computations for the
   same duration.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20High-Level%20Goals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  High-Level Goals</span>

   The high-level goals of this algorithm are the following:

   o  very fast convergence for a single event (e.g., link failure),

   o  paced fast convergence for multiple temporally close IGP events
      while IGP stability is considered acceptable,

   o  delayed convergence when IGP stability is problematic (this will
      allow the IGP and related processes to conserve resources during
      the period of instability), and

   o  avoidance of having different SPF_DELAY timer values (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>)
      across different routers in the area/level.  This requires
      specific consideration as different routers may receive IGP
      messages at different intervals, or even in different orders, due
      to differences both in the distance from the originator of the IGP
      event and in flooding implementations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Definitions%20and%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Definitions and Parameters</span>

   IGP event: The reception or origination of an IGP LSDB change
   requiring a new routing table computation.  Some examples are a
   topology change, a prefix change, and a metric change on a link or
   prefix.  Note that locally triggering a routing table computation is
   not considered an IGP event since other IGP routers are unaware of
   this occurrence.

   Routing table computation, in this document, is scoped to the IGP;
   so, this is the computation of the IGP RIB, performed by the IGP,
   using the IGP LSDB.  No distinction is made between the type of
   computation performed, e.g., full SPF, incremental SPF, or Partial
   Route Computation (PRC); the type of computation is a local
   consideration.  This document may interchangeably use the terms
   "routing table computation" and "SPF computation".

   SPF_DELAY: The delay between the first IGP event triggering a new
   routing table computation and the start of that routing table
   computation.  It can take the following values:

    INITIAL_SPF_DELAY: A very small delay to quickly handle a single
    isolated link failure, e.g., 0 milliseconds.

    SHORT_SPF_DELAY: A small delay to provide fast convergence in the
    case of a single component failure (such as a node failure or Shared
    Risk Link Group (SRLG) failure) that leads to multiple IGP events,
    e.g., 50-100 milliseconds.

    LONG_SPF_DELAY: A long delay when the IGP is unstable, e.g., 2
    seconds.  Note that this allows the IGP network to stabilize.


   TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL: This is the maximum duration typically needed
   to learn all the IGP events related to a single component failure
   (such as router failure or SRLG failure), e.g., 1 second.  It's
   mostly dependent on failure detection time variation between all
   routers that are adjacent to the failure.  Additionally, it may
   depend on the different IGP implementations/parameters across the
   network and their relation to the origination and flooding of link
   state advertisements.

   HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL: The time required with no received IGP event
   before considering the IGP to be stable again and allowing the
   SPF_DELAY to be restored to INITIAL_SPF_DELAY, e.g., a
   HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL of 3 seconds.  The HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL MUST be
   defaulted or configured to be longer than the TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Principles%20of%20the%20SPF%20Delay%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Principles of the SPF Delay Algorithm</span>

   For the first IGP event, we assume that there has been a single
   simple change in the network, which can be taken into account using a
   single routing computation (e.g., link failure, prefix (metric)
   change), and we optimize for very fast convergence by delaying the
   initial routing computation for a small interval, INITIAL_SPF_DELAY.
   Under this assumption, there is no benefit in delaying the routing
   computation.  In a typical network, this is the most common type of
   IGP event.  Hence, it makes sense to optimize this case.

   If subsequent IGP events are received in a short period of time
   (TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL), we then assume that a single component
   failed, but that this failure requires the knowledge of multiple IGP
   events in order for IGP routing to converge.  Under this assumption,
   we want fast convergence since this is a normal network situation.
   However, there is a benefit in waiting for all IGP events related to
   this single component failure: the IGP can then compute the post-
   failure routing table in a single additional route computation.  In
   this situation, we delay the routing computation by SHORT_SPF_DELAY.

   If IGP events are still received after TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL from
   the initial IGP event received in QUIET state (see <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>), then
   the network is presumably experiencing multiple independent failures.
   In this case, while waiting for network stability, the computations
   are delayed for a longer time, which is represented by
   LONG_SPF_DELAY.  This SPF delay is used until no IGP events are
   received for HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL.

   Note that in order to increase the consistency network wide, the
   algorithm uses a delay (TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL) from the initial IGP
   event rather than the number of SPF computations performed.  Indeed,
   as all routers may receive the IGP events at different times, we
   cannot assume that all routers will perform the same number of SPF
   computations.  For example, assuming that the SPF delay is 50
   milliseconds, router R1 may receive three IGP events (E1, E2, E3) in
   those 50 milliseconds and hence will perform a single routing
   computation, while another router R2 may only receive two events (E1,
   E2) in those 50 milliseconds and hence will schedule another routing
   computation when receiving E3.

   This section specifies the Finite State Machine (FSM) intended to
   control the timing of the execution of SPF calculations in response
   to IGP events.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20State%20Machine"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  State Machine</span>

   The FSM is initialized to the QUIET state with all three timers
   (SPF_TIMER, HOLDDOWN_TIMER, and LEARN_TIMER) deactivated.

   The events that may change the FSM states are an IGP event or the
   expiration of one timer (SPF_TIMER, HOLDDOWN_TIMER, or LEARN_TIMER).

   The following diagram briefly describes the state transitions.

   The naming and semantics of each state corresponds directly to the
   SPF delay used for IGP events received in that state.  Three states
   are defined:

   QUIET: This is the initial state, when no IGP events have occurred
   for at least HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL since the last routing table
   computation.  The state is meant to handle link failures very
   quickly.

   SHORT_WAIT: This is the state entered when an IGP event has been
   received in QUIET state.  This state is meant to handle a single

   LONG_WAIT: This is the state reached after TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL in
   state SHORT_WAIT.  This state is meant to handle multiple independent
   component failures during periods of IGP instability.

   SPF_TIMER: This is the FSM timer that uses the computed SPF delay.
   Upon expiration, the routing table computation (as defined in
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) is performed.

   HOLDDOWN_TIMER: This is the FSM timer that is (re)started when an IGP
   event is received and set to HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL.  Upon expiration, the
   FSM is moved to the QUIET state.

   LEARN_TIMER: This is the FSM timer that is started when an IGP event
   is received while the FSM is in the QUIET state.  Upon expiration,
   the FSM is moved to the LONG_WAIT state.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Parameters</span>

   All the parameters MUST be configurable at the protocol instance
   level.  They MAY be configurable on a per IGP LSDB basis (e.g., IS-IS
   level, OSPF area, or IS-IS Level 1 area).  All the delays
   (INITIAL_SPF_DELAY, SHORT_SPF_DELAY, LONG_SPF_DELAY,
   TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL, and HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL) SHOULD be configurable
   with a granularity of a millisecond.  They MUST be configurable with
   a granularity of at least a tenth of a second.  The configurable
   range for all the parameters SHOULD be from 0 milliseconds to at
   least 6000 milliseconds.  The HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL MUST be defaulted or
   configured to be longer than the TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL.

   If this SPF Back-Off algorithm is enabled by default, then in order
   to have consistent SPF delays between implementations with default
   configuration, the following default values SHOULD be implemented:

      INITIAL_SPF_DELAY         50 ms
      SHORT_SPF_DELAY          200 ms
      LONG_SPF_DELAY          5000 ms
      TIME_TO_LEARN_INTERVAL   500 ms
      HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL      10000 ms

   In order to satisfy the goals stated in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, operators are
   RECOMMENDED to configure delay intervals such that INITIAL_SPF_DELAY
   &lt;= SHORT_SPF_DELAY and SHORT_SPF_DELAY &lt;= LONG_SPF_DELAY.

   When setting (default) values, one should consider the customers and
   their application requirements, the computational power of the
   routers, the size of the network as determined primarily by the
   number of IP prefixes advertised in the IGP, the frequency and number

   of IGP events, and the number of protocol reactions/computations
   triggered by IGP SPF computation (e.g., BGP, Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP), Traffic Engineering Constrained SPF
   (CSPF), and Fast Reroute computations).  Note that some or all of
   these factors may change over the life of the network.  In case of
   doubt, it's RECOMMENDED that timer intervals should be chosen
   conservatively (i.e., longer timer values).

   For the standard algorithm to be effective in mitigating micro-loops,
   it is RECOMMENDED that all routers in the IGP domain, or at least all
   the routers in the same area/level, have exactly the same configured
   values.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Partial%20Deployment"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Partial Deployment</span>

   In general, the SPF Back-Off Delay algorithm is only effective in
   mitigating micro-loops if it is deployed with the same parameters on
   all routers in the IGP domain or, at least, all routers in an IGP
   area/level.  The impact of partial deployment is dependent on the
   particular event, the topology, and the algorithm(s) used on other
   routers in the IGP area/level.  In cases where the previous SPF Back-
   Off Delay algorithm was implemented uniformly, partial deployment
   will increase the frequency and duration of micro-loops.  Hence, it
   is RECOMMENDED that all routers in the IGP domain, or at least within
   the same area/level, be migrated to the SPF algorithm described
   herein at roughly the same time.

   Note that this is not a new consideration; over time, network
   operators have changed SPF delay parameters in order to accommodate
   new customer requirements for fast convergence, as permitted by new
   software and hardware.  They may also have progressively replaced an
   implementation using a given SPF Back-Off Delay algorithm with
   another implementation using a different one.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Impact%20on%20Micro-loops"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Impact on Micro-loops</span>

   Micro-loops during IGP convergence are due to a non-synchronized or
   non-ordered update of FIBs [<a href="./rfc5715" title='"A Framework for Loop-Free Convergence"'>RFC5715</a>] [<a href="./rfc6976" title='"Framework for Loop-Free Convergence Using the Ordered Forwarding Information Base (oFIB) Approach"'>RFC6976</a>] [<a href="#ref-SPF-MICRO">SPF-MICRO</a>].  FIBs are
   installed after multiple steps, such as flooding of the IGP event
   across the network, SPF wait time, SPF computation, FIB distribution
   across line cards, and FIB update.  This document only addresses the
   contribution from the SPF wait time.  This standardized procedure
   reduces the probability and/or duration of micro-loops when IGPs
   experience multiple temporally close events.  It does not prevent all
   micro-loops; however, it is beneficial and is less complex and costly
   to implement when compared to full solutions such as Distributed
   Tunnels [<a href="./rfc5715" title='"A Framework for Loop-Free Convergence"'>RFC5715</a>], Synchronized FIB Update [<a href="./rfc5715" title='"A Framework for Loop-Free Convergence"'>RFC5715</a>], or the ordered
   FIB approach [<a href="./rfc6976" title='"Framework for Loop-Free Convergence Using the Ordered Forwarding Information Base (oFIB) Approach"'>RFC6976</a>].

   The algorithm presented in this document does not compromise IGP
   security.  An attacker having the ability to generate IGP events
   would be able to delay the IGP convergence time.  The LONG_SPF_DELAY
   state may help mitigate the effects of Denial-of-Service (DoS)
   attacks generating many IGP events.
