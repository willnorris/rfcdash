   The present document seeks to register a media type for Downloadable
   Sounds (DLSes).  The DLS format is used to define instruments for
   widely used wavetable synthesizers associated with the standards
   [<a href="#ref-DLS1" title='"Downloadable Sounds Level 1.1b"'>DLS1</a>, <a href="#ref-DLS2" title='"Downloadable Sounds Level 2.1"'>DLS2</a>, <a href="#ref-MDLS" title='"Mobile Downloadable Sounds 1.0"'>MDLS</a>].  DLSes and their associated standards are
   maintained and defined by two organizations, the Musical Instrument
   Digital Interface (MIDI) Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the
   Association of the Musical Electronics Industry (AMEI).

   The media type defined here is needed to identify DLS files correctly
   when they are served over HTTP, included in multi-part documents, or
   used in other places where media types are used.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The DLS format may contain audio, displayable text data, and modeling
   parameters (a.k.a. articulation parameters).  In addition, the DLS
   format contains a so-called conditional chunk that is 'active' in the
   sense that it affects the execution of a DLS file parser.  However,
   the DLS format does not currently define any scripting mechanism.

   Clearly, it is possible to author malicious files that, for example,
   contain large amounts of data always blocked by a conditional
   statement; i.e., no synthesizer loads the instruments.

   However, for DLS, clients can and usually do protect themselves
   against these kinds of attacks.  A key point is that conditional
   chunks are optional, that is, a parser does not have to execute a
   conditional chunk.  However, if a parser evaluates a conditional
   chunk, it is still possible to parse its content and draw to a
   conclusion as to whether it is usable for a particular synthesizer
   engine.

   Note that selected metadata fields may include information partly
   intended to protect the media against unauthorized use or
   distribution.  In this case, the intention is that alteration or
   removal of the data in the field would be treated as an offense under
   national agreements based on World Intellectual Property Organization
   (WIPO) treaties.

   DLS have an extensible structure, making it theoretically possible to
   define metadata fields or media formats in the future that could be
   used to induce particular actions of the recipient, and thus that
   would present additional security risks.  However, this type of
   capability is currently not supported in the referenced
   specifications.

   There is no current provision in the DLS standard for encryption,
   signing, or authentication within the file formats.

   The IANA has registered the media type audio/dls, as specified in
   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.  The registration uses the template present in
   [<a href="./rfc4288" title='"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"'>RFC4288</a>].

   Type name:                         audio

   Subtype name:                      dls

   Required parameters:               None

   Optional parameters:               'dls-type'
                                      A comma-separated list of the
                                      dls types (one or more) that the
                                      file content conforms to.  The
                                      following values are specified:
                                      0, 1, and 2 signify Downloadable
                                      Sounds Level 1.1b content,
                                      Downloadable Sounds Level 2.1
                                      content, and Mobile Downloadable
                                      Sound content, respectively.  All
                                      types that the content conforms
                                      to should be indicated.  Further
                                      values (integers) may be
                                      specified in the future, and any
                                      unknown values shall be ignored.
                                      If the parameter is not
                                      specified, it corresponds to a
                                      value equal to 0; i.e., the
                                      content conforms to Downloadable
                                      Sound level 1.1b.

   Encoding considerations:           DLS files are binary and should
                                      be transmitted in a suitable
                                      encoding without CR/LF
                                      conversion, 7-bit stripping
                                      etc.; base64 [<a href="./rfc3548" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>RFC3548</a>] is a
                                      suitable encoding.

   Security considerations:           see the security considerations
                                      in <a href="./rfc4613#section-2">SectionÂ 2 of RFC 4613</a>.

   Interoperability considerations:   This media type is for
                                      consumption by a MIDI player
                                      capable of utilizing
                                      downloadable sounds for its
                                      synthesizers.  A general-purpose
                                      audio player will not be capable
                                      of utilizing the audio within
                                      the format without explicit
                                      support of the format.
