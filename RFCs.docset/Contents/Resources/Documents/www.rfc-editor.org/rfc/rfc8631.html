Abstract

   Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that
   are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service
   provider.  Often, these sets of resources are referred to as "Web
   services" or "Web APIs".  This specification defines link relations
   that represent relationships from Web services or APIs to resources
   that provide documentation, descriptions, metadata, or status
   information for these resources.  Documentation is primarily intended
   for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for
   automated consumers.  Metadata provides information about a service's
   context.  This specification also defines a link relation to identify
   status resources that are used to represent information about service
   status.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   One of the defining aspects of the Web is that it is possible to
   interact with Web resources without any prior knowledge of the
   specifics of the resource.  Following the practices described in Web
   architecture [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-webarch-20041215">W3C.REC-webarch-20041215</a>] by using URIs, HTTP, and
   media types, the Web's uniform interface allows interactions with
   resources without the more complex binding procedures often necessary
   with other approaches.

   Many resources on the Web are provided as part of a set of resources
   that are referred to as a "Web service" or a "Web API".  In many
   cases, these services or APIs are defined and managed as a whole, and
   it may be desirable for clients to be able to discover this service
   information.

   Service information that provides information on how to use service
   resources can be broadly separated into two categories: One category
   primarily targets human users and often uses generic representations
   for human readable documents, such as HTML or PDF.  The other
   category is structured information that follows a more formalized
   description model and is primarily intended for consumption by
   machines -- for example, tools and code libraries.

   In the context of this memo, the human-oriented variant is referred
   to as "documentation", and the machine-oriented variant is referred
   to as "description".

   These two categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as
   representations have been proposed that are intended for both human
   consumption and interpretation by machine clients.  In addition, a
   typical pattern for service documentation/descriptions is that there
   is human-oriented, high-level documentation that is intended to put a
   service in context and explain the general model, which is
   complemented by machine-level descriptions that are intended as
   detailed technical descriptions of the service.  These two resources
   could be interlinked, but since they are intended for different
   audiences, it can make sense to provide entry points for both of
   them.

   In addition, while both documentation and descriptions may be
   provided as part of a Web service, there may be other information as
   well.  Generally speaking, a Web service may have any metadata/
   resources associated with it (with documentation and descriptions
   being two specific kinds of resources).  If there is a way in which
   all of these metadata/resources can be represented, then it should be
   possible to find such a resource that provides access to general Web
   service metadata.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8631">RFC 8631</a>          Link Relation Types for Web Services         July 2019</span>


   In addition to these resources about mostly static aspects of a Web
   service, this memo also defines a link relation that allows providers
   of a Web service to link to a resource that represents status
   information about the service.  This information often represents
   operational information that allows service consumers to retrieve
   information about "service health" and related issues.

   This memo places no constraints on the specific representations used
   for all of these resources.  It simply allows providers of a Web
   service to make the documentation, descriptions, metadata, and status
   of their services discoverable and defines link relations that serve
   that purpose.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Web%20Services"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Web Services</span>

   "Web Services" or "Web APIs" (sometimes also referred to as "HTTP
   API" or "REST API") expose information and services on the Web.
   Following the principles of Web architecture
   [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-webarch-20041215">W3C.REC-webarch-20041215</a>], they expose URI-identified resources,
   which are then accessed and transferred using a specific
   representation.  Many services use representations that contain
   links, and these links are often typed links.

   Using typed links, resources can identify relationship types to other
   resources.  <a href="./rfc8288">RFC 8288</a> [<a href="./rfc8288" title='"Web Linking"'>RFC8288</a>] establishes a framework of registered
   link relation types, which are identified by simple strings and
   registered in an IANA registry.  Any resource that supports typed
   links according to <a href="./rfc8288">RFC 8288</a> can then use these identifiers to
   represent resource relationships on the Web without having to
   reinvent registered relation types.

   In recent years, Web services, as well as their documentation and
   description languages, have gained popularity due to the general
   popularity of the Web as a platform for providing information and
   services.  However, the design of documentation and description
   languages varies according to a number of factors, such as the
   general application domain, the preferred application data model, and
   the preferred approach for exposing services.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8631">RFC 8631</a>          Link Relation Types for Web Services         July 2019</span>


   This specification allows service providers to use a unified method
   to link to service documentation and/or descriptions.  This link
   should not make any assumptions about the provided type of
   documentation and/or descriptions, so service providers can choose
   those that best fit their services and needs.

   This specification also allows service providers to link to general
   service metadata.  One part of the metadata may have links to
   documentation and/or description as well as other information about a
   service, such as deployment or operational information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Documenting%20Web%20Services"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Documenting Web Services</span>

   In the context of this specification, "documentation" refers to
   information that is primarily intended for human consumption.
   Typical representations of this kind of documentation are HTML and
   PDF.

   Documentation is often structured, but its structure depends on the
   structure of the service in question as well as the specific way in
   which the authors choose to present it.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Describing%20Web%20Services"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Describing Web Services</span>

   In the context of this specification, "description" refers to
   information that is primarily intended for machine consumption.
   Typical representations are dictated by the technology underlying the
   service itself, which means that description formats in today's
   technology landscape are based on XML, JSON, Resource Description
   Framework (RDF), and a variety of other structured data models.  In
   each of those technologies, there may be a variety of languages
   defined to serve the same general purpose of describing a Web
   service.

   Descriptions are always structured, but the structuring principles
   depend on the nature of the described service.  For example, one of
   the earlier service description approaches, the Web Services
   Description Language (WSDL), uses "operations" as its core concept,
   which are essentially identical to function calls because the
   underlying model is based on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model.
   Other description languages for non-RPC approaches to services will
   use different structuring approaches, such as structuring service
   descriptions by URIs and/or URI patterns.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Unified%20Documentation%2FDescription"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Unified Documentation/Description</span>

   If service providers use an approach where there is no distinction
   between service documentation (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) and service description
   (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>), then they may not feel the need to use two separate
   links.  In such a case, an alternative approach is to use the
   previously defined "service" link relation type [<a href="./rfc5023" title='"The Atom Publishing Protocol"'>RFC5023</a>], which does
   not indicate whether it links to documentation or description and
   thus may be a better fit if no such differentiation is required.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Link%20Relations%20for%20Web%20Services"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Link Relations for Web Services</span>

   In order to allow Web services to represent the relation of
   individual resources to service documentation/description and
   metadata, this specification introduces and registers three new link
   relation types.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20The%20service-doc%20Link%20Relation%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  The service-doc Link Relation Type</span>

   The "service-doc" link relation type is used to represent the fact
   that a resource or a set of resources is documented at a specific
   URI.  The target resource is expected to provide documentation that
   is primarily intended for human consumption.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20The%20service-desc%20Link%20Relation%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  The service-desc Link Relation Type</span>

   The "service-desc" link relation type is used to represent the fact
   that a resource or a set of resources is described at a specific URI.
   The target resource is expected to provide a service description that
   is primarily intended for machine consumption.  In many cases, it is
   provided in a representation that is consumed by tools, code
   libraries, or similar components.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20The%20service-meta%20Link%20Relation%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  The service-meta Link Relation Type</span>

   The "service-meta" link relation type is used to link to available
   metadata for the service context of a resource.  Service metadata is
   any kind of data that may be of interest to existing or potential
   service users, with documentation/description being only two possible
   facets of service metadata.  The target resource is expected to
   provide a representation that is primarily intended for machine
   consumption.  In many cases, it is provided in a representation that
   is consumed by tools, code libraries, or similar components.

   Since service metadata can have many different purposes and use many
   different representations, it may make sense for representations
   using the "service-meta" link relation to offer additional hints
   about the specific kind or format of metadata that is being linked.



<span class="grey">Wilde                         Informational                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8631">RFC 8631</a>          Link Relation Types for Web Services         July 2019</span>


   This definition of the "service-meta" link relation makes no specific
   assumptions about how these link hints will be represented, and the
   specific mechanism will depend on the context where the "service-
   meta" link relation is being used.

   One example is that a "service-desc" link may identify an OpenAPI
   description, which is supposed to be the machine-readable description
   of a Web API.  A "service-meta" link may identify a resource that
   contains additional metadata about the Web API, such as labels that
   classify the API according to a labeling scheme and a privacy policy
   that makes statements about how the Web API manages personally
   identifiable information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Web%20Service%20Status%20Resources"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Web Service Status Resources</span>

   Web services providing access to one or more resources often are
   hosted and operated in an environment for which status information
   may be available.  This information may be as simple as confirming
   that a service is operational, or it may provide additional
   information about different aspects of a service and/or a history of
   status information, possibly listing incidents and their resolution.

   The "status" link relation type can be used to link to such a status
   resource, allowing service consumers to retrieve information about a
   Web service's status.  Such a link may not be available for and from
   all resources provided by a Web service -- only from key resources
   such as a Web service's metadata resource and/or a service's home
   resource (i.e., a resource analogous to the home page of a Web site).

   This memo does not restrict the representation of a status resource
   in any way.  It may be primarily focused on human or machine
   consumption or a combination of both.  It may be a simple "traffic
   light" indicator for service health or a more sophisticated
   representation conveying more detailed information, such as service
   subsystems and/or a status history.

   Web service providers should be aware that service descriptions and
   documentation may be used by attackers to gain additional information
   about a service (particularly its implementation) and to test for
   known security issues.  It may thus be advisable to restrict service
   descriptions and documentation to aspects of a service that are
   necessary and to exclude any details that are not necessary for using
   the service.

   Another potential security issue for Web service providers is that
   publishing service descriptions and documentation may generally allow
   clients (both malicious and otherwise) more automated and systematic
   access to a service.  It may therefore be possible that more of a
   service's potential vulnerabilities are made easier to find and
   exploit or simply that a service might receive more load because it
   is accessed by automated clients.

   Web service consumers should be aware that service descriptions and
   documentation can be out of sync or simply incorrect.  Blindly
   trusting service descriptions and documentation (particularly when
   descriptions are retrieved and interpreted programmatically) is not a
   safe practice.  Web service consumers SHOULD always assume that
   service descriptions and documentation may be incorrect and SHOULD
