<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6573">RFC 6573</a>         The Item and Collection Link Relations       April 2012</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc5988">RFC 5988</a> standardized a means of indicating the relationships between
   resources on the Web. This specification defines a pair of reciprocal
   link relation types that may be used to express the relationship
   between a collection and its members.

   These link relation types can be applied to a wide range of use cases
   across multiple media types.  For example, the 'collection' and
   'item' link relation types are used in these media types:

   1.  OpenSearch 1.1: see Section 4.5.4.1 of [<a href="#ref-OpenSearch" title='"Open Search 1.1"'>OpenSearch</a>]

   2.  Maze+XML: see [<a href="#ref-Maze" title='"Maze+XML - Format"'>Maze</a>]

   3.  Collection+JSON: see [<a href="#ref-CollectionJSON" title='"Collection+JSON - Document Format"'>CollectionJSON</a>]

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Link%20Relations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Link Relations</span>

   The following link relations are defined.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20%27item%27"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  'item'</span>

   When included in a resource that represents a collection, the 'item'
   link relation identifies a target resource that represents a member
   of that collection.

   For example, if a resource represents a catalog of products, that
   same representation may include one or more links to resources that
   represent members of that catalog.

   &lt;html&gt;
   ...
     &lt;h1&gt;Product Group X Listing&lt;/h1&gt;
     ...
     &lt;a href="..." rel="item"&gt;View Product X001&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href="..." rel="item"&gt;View Product X002&lt;/a&gt;
     ...
   &lt;/html&gt;

   or, in the case of a Link Header field

   Link: &lt;...&gt;; rel="item"; title="View Product X001"
   Link: &lt;...&gt;; rel="item"; title="View Product X002"







<span class="grey">Amundsen                      Informational                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6573">RFC 6573</a>         The Item and Collection Link Relations       April 2012</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20%27collection%27"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  'collection'</span>

   When included in a resource that represents a member of a collection,
   the 'collection' link relation identifies a target resource that
   represents a collection of which the context resource is a member.

   For example, if a resource represents a single product in a catalog,
   that same representation may include a link to a resource that
   represents a product group to which this single product belongs:

   &lt;a href="..." rel="collection"&gt;Return to Product Group X&lt;/a&gt;

   or, in the case of a Link Header field

   Link: &lt;...&gt;; rel="collection"; title="Return to Product Group X"

   Since it is possible that a resource could be a member of multiple
   collections, multiple 'collection' link relations may appear within
   the same representation:

   &lt;a href="..." rel="collection"&gt;View other widgets&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href="..." rel="collection"&gt;View all discontinued items&lt;/a&gt;

   The target resource representation need not be restricted to
   representing a list.  It may simply be a document that provides
   details on the collection of which the context resource is a member:

   Link: &lt;...&gt;; rel="collection";
         title="Shakespeare's Collected Works - A History"

   It should also be noted that the same link might represent an 'item'
   in one collection as well as a 'collection' itself.  In this case,
   both link relation values can be applied to the same link:

   Link: &lt;...&gt;; rel="collection item";
         title="A Review of Issac Asimov's Collected Works - Vol. I"

   IANA has registered the 'collection' and 'item' link relations below
   as per [<a href="./rfc5988" title='"Web Linking"'>RFC5988</a>].

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource that is a member of the
      collection represented by the context IRI.

   Reference:

      See <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>

   Relation Name:

      collection

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource that represents the collection
      resource for the context IRI.

   The two link relation types defined in this document do not introduce
   any new security issues to those which are discussed in <a href="./rfc5988#section-7">Section 7 of
   RFC5988</a> [<a href="./rfc5988" title='"Web Linking"'>RFC5988</a>].

   The 'item' and 'collection' link relation types do not have any
   internationalization considerations other than those which are
   discussed in <a href="./rfc5988#section-8">Section 8 of RFC5988</a> [<a href="./rfc5988" title='"Web Linking"'>RFC5988</a>].
