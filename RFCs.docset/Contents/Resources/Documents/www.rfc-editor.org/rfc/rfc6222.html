Abstract

   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a
   persistent transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the
   Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may
   change if a collision is detected or when the RTP application is
   restarted, its RTCP CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP
   endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP
   media streams.  For proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be
   unique within the participants of an RTP session.  However, the
   existing guidelines for choosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP
   standard are insufficient to achieve this uniqueness.  This memo
   updates those guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique RTCP
   CNAMEs.

   In <a href="#section-6.5.1">Section 6.5.1</a> of the RTP specification, [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], there are a
   number of recommendations for choosing a unique RTCP CNAME for an RTP
   endpoint.  However, in practice, some of these methods are not
   guaranteed to produce a unique RTCP CNAME.  This memo updates
   guidelines for choosing RTCP CNAMEs, superseding those presented in
   <a href="./rfc3550#section-6.5.1">Section 6.5.1 of [RFC3550]</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6222">RFC 6222</a>                 Choosing an RTCP CNAME               April 2011</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Deficiencies%20with%20Earlier%20Guidelines%20for%20Choosing%20an%20RTCP%20CNAME"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Deficiencies with Earlier Guidelines for Choosing an RTCP CNAME</span>

   The recommendation in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] is to generate an RTCP CNAME of the
   form "user@host" for multiuser systems, or "host" if the username is
   not available.  The "host" part is specified to be the fully
   qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host from which the real-time
   data originates.  While this guidance was appropriate at the time
   [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] was written, FQDNs are no longer necessarily unique and can
   sometimes be common across several endpoints in large service
   provider networks.  This document replaces the use of FQDN as an RTCP
   CNAME by alternative mechanisms.

   IPv4 addresses are also suggested for use in RTCP CNAMEs in
   [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], where the "host" part of the RTCP CNAME is the numeric
   representation of the IPv4 address of the interface from which the
   RTP data originates.  As noted in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], the use of private
   network address space [<a href="./rfc1918" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>] can result in hosts having network
   addresses that are not globally unique.  Additionally, this shared
   use of the same IPv4 address can also occur with public IPv4
   addresses if multiple hosts are assigned the same public IPv4 address
   and connected to a Network Address Translation (NAT) device
   [<a href="./rfc3022" title='"Traditional IP Network Address Translator (Traditional NAT)"'>RFC3022</a>].  When multiple hosts share the same IPv4 address, whether
   private or public, using the IPv4 address as the RTCP CNAME leads to
   RTCP CNAMEs that are not necessarily unique.

   It is also noted in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] that if hosts with private addresses
   and no direct IP connectivity to the public Internet have their RTP
   packets forwarded to the public Internet through an RTP-level
   translator, they could end up having non-unique RTCP CNAMEs.  The
   suggestion in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] is that such applications provide a
   configuration option to allow the user to choose a unique RTCP CNAME;
   this technique puts the burden on the translator to translate RTCP
   CNAMEs from private addresses to public addresses if necessary to
   keep private addresses from being exposed.  Experience has shown that
   this does not work well in practice.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Choosing%20an%20RTCP%20CNAME"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Choosing an RTCP CNAME</span>

   It is difficult, and in some cases impossible, for a host to
   determine if there is a NAT between itself and its RTP peer.
   Furthermore, even some public IPv4 addresses can be shared by
   multiple hosts in the Internet.  Using the numeric representation of
   the IPv4 address as the "host" part of the RTCP CNAME is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6222">RFC 6222</a>                 Choosing an RTCP CNAME               April 2011</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Persistent%20RTCP%20CNAMEs%20versus%20Per-Session%20RTCP%20CNAMEs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Persistent RTCP CNAMEs versus Per-Session RTCP CNAMEs</span>

   The RTCP CNAME can be either persistent across different RTP sessions
   for an RTP endpoint or unique per session, meaning that an RTP
   endpoint chooses a different RTCP CNAME for each RTP session.

   An RTP endpoint that is emitting multiple related RTP streams that
   require synchronization at the other endpoint(s) MUST use the same
   RTCP CNAME for all streams that are to be synchronized.  This
   requires a short-term persistent RTCP CNAME that is common across
   several RTP streams, and potentially across several related RTP
   sessions.  A common example of such use occurs when lip-syncing audio
   and video streams in a multimedia session, where a single participant
   has to use the same RTCP CNAME for its audio RTP session and for its
   video RTP session.  Another example might be to synchronize the
   layers of a layered audio codec, where the same RTCP CNAME has to be
   used for each layer.

   A longer-term persistent RTCP CNAME is sometimes useful to facilitate
   third-party monitoring, consistent with [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  One such use
   might be to allow network management tools to correlate the ongoing
   quality of service for a participant across multiple RTP sessions for
   fault diagnosis, and to understand long-term network performance
   statistics.  An implementation that wishes to discourage this type of
   third-party monitoring can generate a unique RTCP CNAME for each RTP
   session, or group of related RTP sessions, that it joins.  Such a
   per-session RTCP CNAME cannot be used for traffic analysis, and so
   provides some limited form of privacy (note that there are non-RTP
   means that can be used by a third party to correlate RTP sessions, so
   the use of per-session RTCP CNAMEs will not prevent a determined
   traffic analyst from monitoring such sessions).

   This memo defines several different ways by which an implementation
   can choose an RTCP CNAME.  It is possible, and legitimate, for
   independent implementations to make different choices of RTCP CNAME
   when running on the same host.  This can hinder third-party
   monitoring, unless some external means is provided to configure a
   persistent choice of RTCP CNAME for those implementations.

   Note that there is no backwards compatibility issue (with [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>]-
   compatible implementations) introduced in this memo, since the RTCP
   CNAMEs are opaque strings to remote peers.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Requirements</span>

   RTP endpoints will choose to generate RTCP CNAMEs that are persistent
   or per-session.  An RTP endpoint that wishes to generate a persistent
   RTCP CNAME MUST use one of the following two methods:

   o  To produce a long-term persistent RTCP CNAME, an RTP endpoint MUST
      generate and store a Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID)
      [<a href="./rfc4122" title='"A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"'>RFC4122</a>] for use as the "host" part of its RTCP CNAME.  The UUID
      MUST be version 1, 2, or 4, as described in [<a href="./rfc4122" title='"A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"'>RFC4122</a>], with the
      "urn:uuid:" stripped, resulting in a 36-octet printable string
      representation.

   o  To produce a short-term persistent RTCP CNAME, an RTP endpoint
      MUST either (a) use the numeric representation of the layer-2
      (Media Access Control (MAC)) address of the interface that is used
      to initiate the RTP session as the "host" part of its RTCP CNAME
      or (b) generate and use an identifier by following the procedure
      described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  In either case, the procedure is
      performed once per initialization of the software.  After
      obtaining an identifier by doing (a) or (b), the least significant
      48 bits are converted to the standard colon-separated hexadecimal
      format [<a href="./rfc5342" title='"IANA Considerations and IETF Protocol Usage for IEEE 802 Parameters"'>RFC5342</a>], e.g., "00:23:32:af:9b:aa", resulting in a
      17-octet printable string representation.

   In the two cases above, the "user@" part of the RTCP CNAME MAY be
   omitted on single-user systems and MAY be replaced by an opaque token
   on multi-user systems, to preserve privacy.

   An RTP endpoint that wishes to generate a per-session RTCP CNAME MUST
   use the following method:

   o  For every new RTP session, a new CNAME is generated following the
      procedure described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  After performing that
      procedure, the least significant 96 bits are used to generate an
      identifier (to compromise between packet size and security), which
      is converted to ASCII using Base64 encoding [<a href="./rfc4648" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>RFC4648</a>].  This
      results in a 16-octet string representation.  The RTCP CNAME
      cannot change over the life of an RTP session [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>]; hence,
      only the initial SSRC value chosen by the endpoint is used.  The
      "user@" part of the RTCP CNAME is omitted when generating
      per-session RTCP CNAMEs.

   It is believed that obtaining uniqueness (with a high probability) is
   an important property that requires careful evaluation of the method.
   This document provides a number of methods, at least one of which
   would be suitable for all deployment scenarios.  This document
   therefore does not provide for the implementor to define and select
   an alternative method.

   A future specification might define an alternative method for
   generating RTCP CNAMEs, as long as the proposed method has
   appropriate uniqueness and there is consistency between the methods
   used for multiple RTP sessions that are to be correlated.  However,
   such a specification needs to be reviewed and approved before
   deployment.

   The mechanisms described in this document are to be used to generate
   RTCP CNAMEs, and they are not to be used for generating general-
   purpose unique identifiers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Procedure%20to%20Generate%20a%20Unique%20Identifier"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Procedure to Generate a Unique Identifier</span>

   The algorithm described below is intended to be used for locally
   generated unique identifiers.

   1.  Obtain the current time of day in 64-bit NTP format [<a href="./rfc5905" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>RFC5905</a>].

   2.  Obtain a modified EUI-64 identifier from the system running this
       algorithm [<a href="./rfc4291" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>].  If such a system does not exist, an
       identifier can be created from a 48-bit MAC address, as specified
       in [<a href="./rfc4291" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>].  If one cannot be obtained or created, a suitably
       unique identifier, local to the node, should be used (e.g.,
       system serial number).

   3.  Concatenate the time of day with the system-specific identifier
       in order to create a key.

   4.  If generating a per-session CNAME, also concatenate the RTP
       endpoint's initial SSRC, the source and destination IP addresses,
       and ports to the key.

   5.  Compute the 256-bit output of the SHA-256 digest of the key, as
       specified in [<a href="./rfc4634" title='"US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and HMAC-SHA)"'>RFC4634</a>].

   The security considerations of [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] apply to this memo.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20Considerations%20on%20Uniqueness%20of%20RTCP%20CNAMEs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Considerations on Uniqueness of RTCP CNAMEs</span>

   The recommendations given in this document for RTCP CNAME generation
   ensure that a set of cooperating participants in an RTP session will,
   with very high probability, have unique RTCP CNAMEs.  However,
   neither [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] nor this document provides any way to ensure that
   participants will choose RTCP CNAMEs appropriately, and thus
   implementations MUST NOT rely on the uniqueness of CNAMEs for any
   essential security services.  This is consistent with [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>],
   which does not require that RTCP CNAMEs are unique within a session
   but instead says that condition SHOULD hold.  As described in the
   Security Considerations section of [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], because each
   participant in a session is free to choose its own RTCP CNAME, they
   can do so in such a way as to impersonate another participant.  That
   is, participants are trusted to not impersonate each other.  No
   recommendation for generating RTCP CNAMEs can prevent this
   impersonation, because an attacker can neglect the stipulation.
   Secure RTP (SRTP) [<a href="./rfc3711" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>] keeps unauthorized entities out of an RTP
   session, but it does not aim to prevent impersonation attacks from
   unauthorized entities.

   This document uses a hash function to ensure the uniqueness of RTCP
   CNAMEs.  A cryptographic hash function is used because such functions
   provide the randomness properties that are needed.  However, no
   security assumptions are made on the hash function.  The hash
   function is not assumed to be collision resistant, preimage
   resistant, or second preimage resistant in an adversarial setting; as
   described above, an attacker attempting an impersonation attack could
   merely set the RTCP CNAME directly rather than attacking the hash
   function.  Similarly, the hash function is not assumed to be a one-
   way function or pseudorandom in a cryptographic sense.

   No confidentiality is provided on the data used as input to the RTCP
   CNAME generation algorithm.  It might be possible for an attacker who
   observes an RTCP CNAME to determine the inputs that were used to
   generate that value.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20Session%20Correlation%20Based%20on%20RTCP%20CNAMEs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Session Correlation Based on RTCP CNAMEs</span>

   In some environments, notably telephony, a fixed RTCP CNAME value
   allows separate RTP sessions to be correlated and eliminates the
   obfuscation provided by IPv6 privacy addresses [<a href="./rfc4941" title='"Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6"'>RFC4941</a>] or IPv4
   Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) [<a href="./rfc3022" title='"Traditional IP Network Address Translator (Traditional NAT)"'>RFC3022</a>].  SRTP [<a href="./rfc3711" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>]
   can help prevent such correlation by encrypting Secure RTCP (SRTCP),

   but it should be noted that SRTP only mandates SRTCP integrity
   protection (not encryption).  Thus, RTP applications used in such
   environments should consider encrypting their SRTCP or generate a
   per-session RTCP CNAME as discussed in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.
