   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this
   section as background information, the reader is directed to the
   original TIFF specification [<a href="#ref-TIFF" title="June 3">TIFF</a>] to obtain complete feature and
   technical details.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1%20%20TIFF%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>  TIFF Scope</span>

   TIFF describes image data that typically comes from scanners, frame
   grabbers, and paint- and photo-retouching programs.  TIFF is not a
   printer language or page description language.  The purpose of TIFF
   is to describe and store raster image data.  A primary goal of TIFF
   is to provide a rich environment within which applications can
   exchange image data.  This richness is required to take advantage of
   the varying capabilities of scanners and other imaging devices.
   Though TIFF is a rich format, it can easily be used for simple
   scanners and applications as well because the number of required
   fields is small.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2%20%20TIFF%20Features"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>  TIFF Features</span>

   Some of the features of TIFF (from [<a href="#ref-TIFF" title="June 3">TIFF</a>]) are:

      -  TIFF is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-
         color, and full-color image data in several color spaces.

      -  TIFF includes a number of compression schemes that allow
         developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff for their
         applications.

      -  TIFF is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as
         new needs arise.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3302">RFC 3302</a>                       image/tiff                 September 2002</span>


      -  TIFF allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or
         special-purpose information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20MIME%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  MIME Definition</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1%20%20image%2Ftiff"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>  image/tiff</span>

   The image/tiff content-type was previously defined in <a href="./rfc1528">RFC 1528</a> as
   containing TIFF 6.0 encoded image data, with specific reference made
   to a subset known as TIFF Class F.  This document redefines the
   original image/tiff definition to refer to TIFF 6.0 [<a href="#ref-TIFF" title="June 3">TIFF</a>] encoded
   image data, consistent with existing practice for TIFF aware Internet
   applications.  This definition is further enhanced by introducing the
   new "application parameter" (<a href="#section-6.2">section 6.2</a>) to enable identification of
   a specific subset of TIFF and TIFF extensions for the encoded image
   data.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2%20%20Application%20parameter"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>  Application parameter</span>

   There are cases where it may be useful to identify the application
   applicable to the content of an image/tiff body.  Typically, this
   would be used to assist the recipient in dispatching a suitable
   rendering package to handle the display or processing of the image
   file.  As a result, an optional "application" parameter is defined
   for image/tiff to identify a particular application's subset of TIFF
   and TIFF extensions for the encoded image data, if it is known.  No
   values are defined in this document.

      Example:

               Content-type: image/tiff; application=foo

   There is no default value for application, as the absence of the
   application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF image is
   Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to identify the
   application.  It is up to the recipient's implementation to determine
   the application (if necessary) and render the image to the user.

   New values for the image/tiff application parameter must be approved
   by the IESG prior to registration.  As a result, the publication of a
   description of parameter values in an RFC is required.

   Guidelines on writing IANA considerations for RFCs can be found in
   <a href="./rfc2434">RFC 2434</a>.

   An application parameter is a hint to the receiver.  It MUST NOT be
   used as a blind request to execute some arbitrary program.

   Instead, it should be viewed rather as an indication of what sort of
   application would be able to handle the content most appropriately.

      Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/tiff

      MIME media type name: image

      MIME subtype name: tiff

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters: application

         There is no format specified for the value of this parameter
         in addition to that specified by [<a href="#ref-MIME1" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME1</a>].  Various
         applications of TIFF may define values as required as hints
         to the receiver.  There is no default value for application,
         as the absence of the application parameter indicates that
         the encoded TIFF image is Baseline TIFF or that it is not
         necessary to identify the application.  It is up to the
         implementation to determine the application (if necessary)
         and render the image to the user.

      Encoding considerations:

         This media type consists of binary data.  The base64 encoding
         should be used on transports that cannot accommodate binary
         data directly.

      Security considerations:

         TIFF utilizes a structure which can store image data and
         attributes of this image data.  The fields defined in the TIFF
         specification are of a descriptive nature and provide
         information that is useful to facilitate the viewing and
         rendering of images by a recipient.  As such, the fields
         currently defined in the TIFF specification do not in
         themselves create additional security risks, since the fields
         are not used to induce any particular behavior by the
         recipient application.

         TIFF has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically
         possible that fields could be defined in the future which
         could be used to induce particular actions on the part of the
         recipient, thus presenting additional security risks, but



<span class="grey">Parsons &amp; Rafferty          Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

         this type of capability is not supported in the referenced
         TIFF specification.  Indeed, the definition of fields which
         would include such processing instructions is inconsistent
         with the goals and spirit of the TIFF specification as
         defined to date.

      Interoperability considerations:

         The ability of implementations to handle all the defined
         applications (or profiles within applications) of TIFF may
         not be ubiquitous.  As a result, implementations may decode
         and attempt to display the encoded TIFF image data only to
         determine that the image cannot be rendered.  The presence of
         the application parameter may aid in allowing this
         determination before dispatching for rendering.  However, it
         should be noted that the parameter value is not intended to
         convey levels of capabilities for a particular application.
