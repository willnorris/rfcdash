<span class="grey">The USAF Environmental Technical Applications Center (ETAC) is</span>
providing weather data for the ARPA Network.  Ultimately there
will be ten years of high quality surface and upper air weather
observations, as well as hemispheric grid point analyses.  The
observations are generated by approximately 5000 surface and

The data is to be available via the datacomputer, a specialized
node of the ARPA Network that is dedicated to the management of
shared data bases and designed to accommodate large ones.  The
datacomputer, currently under development by Computer Corporation
of America (CCA), will provide services* for the use of these
data bases, including the weather data.

A working group has been formed to design the data base,
coordinate its implementation with the development of the
datacomputer, plan testing, project uses, and resolve a variety
of technical issues associated with its size and complexity.
