This note is a revision of NWG/RFC #3

The Network Working Group seems to consist of Steve Carr at Utah, Elmer
Shapiro and Bill English SRI, Steve Crocker at UCLA, John Haefner at
RAND, Paul Rovner and Jim Curry at Lincoln Labs.  Membership is not closed.

The Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software, the
strategies for using the network, and initial experience with the network.

Documentation of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.  Notes
may be produced at any site by anybody and included in this series.

CONTENT

The content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related to
the HOST software or other aspect of the network.  Notes are encouraged to
be timely rather than polished.  Philosophical positions without examples
or other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques
without introductory or background explication, and explicit questions
without any attempted answers are all acceptable.  The minimum length for
a NWG note is one sentence.

These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto
authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of
considerably less than authoritative ideas.  Second, there is a natural
hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this
inhibition.

FORM

Every NWG note should bear the following information:

        1.  "Network Working Group"
            "Request for Comments:"x (x underscored)
            where x is a serial number (x underscored)
            Serial numbers are assigned by Steve Crocker at UCLA

        2.  Author and affiliation

        3.  Date

        4.  Title.  The title need not be unique.
