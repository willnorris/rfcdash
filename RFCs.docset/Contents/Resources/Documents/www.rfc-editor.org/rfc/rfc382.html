MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE ON THE ARPA NETWORK

There have been several efforts in the past few years to develop high
quality libraries of mathematical and statistical subroutines.  Some
of the projects mentioned in the literature include:

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20The%20Bell%20Laboratories%20numerical%20mathematics%20program%20library%20project."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  The Bell Laboratories numerical mathematics program library project.</span>

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20IMSL%20Inc.%3A"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  IMSL Inc.:  </span>IMSL Library I, mathematical-statistical computer
    subroutines

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20The%20NATS%20%28National%20Science%20Foundation%2CArgonne%20Laboratories%2C%20Stanford"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  The NATS (National Science Foundation,Argonne Laboratories, Stanford</span>
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/and%20Texas%29%20joint%20project%20on%20the%20Wilkinson%20linear%20algebra%20routines."></a>    and Texas) joint project on the Wilkinson linear algebra routines.</span>

The ARPA Network could further enhance the desirability of such libraries
as they would become another sharable network resource.  Although the
diversity of network computing no doubt requires an equally diverse set
of mathematical software, and in spite of the fact everyone has their
own software hangups - not to mention hardware!, it seems everyone
could benefit from some type of information interchange regarding mathe-
matical software of interest.

In particular I would welcome any information on your experiences with
mathematical and statistical libraries, especially regarding those
mentioned above.

We do plan on obtaining the NATS library and with the project's cooperation,
intend to make it available on several Network IBM/360-370's and PDP-10's.
Those interested should send me a message via NIC (ident LM) or get in
touch with me at (217) 333-8497.
