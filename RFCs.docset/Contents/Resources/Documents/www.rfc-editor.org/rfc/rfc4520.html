Abstract

   This document provides procedures for registering extensible elements
   of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  The document
   also provides guidelines to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA) describing conditions under which new values can be assigned.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>] (LDAP) is an
   extensible protocol.  LDAP supports:

      -  the addition of new operations,
      -  the extension of existing operations, and
      -  the extensible schema.

   This document details procedures for registering values used to
   unambiguously identify extensible elements of the protocol, including
   the following:

      - LDAP message types
      - LDAP extended operations and controls
      - LDAP result codes
      - LDAP authentication methods
      - LDAP attribute description options
      - Object Identifier descriptors

   These registries are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA).

   In addition, this document provides guidelines to IANA describing the
   conditions under which new values can be assigned.

   The terms "IESG Approval", "Standards Action", "IETF Consensus",
   "Specification Required", "First Come First Served", "Expert Review",
   and "Private Use" are used as defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp26">BCP 26</a> [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC2434</a>].

   The term "registration owner" (or "owner") refers to the party
   authorized to change a value's registration.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20IANA%20Considerations%20for%20LDAP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  IANA Considerations for LDAP</span>

   This section details each kind of protocol value that can be
   registered and provides IANA guidelines on how to assign new values.

   IANA may reject obviously bogus registrations.

   LDAP values specified in RFCs MUST be registered.  Other LDAP values,
   except those in private-use name spaces, SHOULD be registered.  RFCs
   SHOULD NOT reference, use, or otherwise recognize unregistered LDAP
   values.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Object%20Identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Object Identifiers</span>

   Numerous LDAP schema and protocol elements are identified by Object
   Identifiers (OIDs) [<a href="#ref-X.680" title='"Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) - Specification of Basic Notation"'>X.680</a>].  Specifications that assign OIDs to
   elements SHOULD state who delegated the OIDs for their use.

   For IETF-developed elements, specifications SHOULD use OIDs under
   "Internet Directory Numbers" (1.3.6.1.1.x).  For elements developed
   by others, any properly delegated OID can be used, including those
   under "Internet Directory Numbers" (1.3.6.1.1.x) or "Internet Private
   Enterprise Numbers" (1.3.6.1.4.1.x).

   Internet Directory Numbers (1.3.6.1.1.x) will be assigned upon Expert
   Review with Specification Required.  Only one OID per specification
   will be assigned.  The specification MAY then assign any number of
   OIDs within this arc without further coordination with IANA.

   Internet Private Enterprise Numbers (1.3.6.1.4.1.x) are assigned by
   IANA &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl">http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl</a>&gt;.  Practices for IANA
   assignment of Internet Private Enterprise Numbers are detailed in <a href="./rfc2578">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2578">2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>].

   To avoid interoperability problems between early implementations of a
   "work in progress" and implementations of the published specification
   (e.g., the RFC), experimental OIDs SHOULD be used in "works in
   progress" and early implementations.  OIDs under the Internet
   Experimental OID arc (1.3.6.1.3.x) may be used for this purpose.
   Practices for IANA assignment of these Internet Experimental numbers
   are detailed in <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>].

   LDAP provides a number of Root DSA-Specific Entry (DSE) attributes
   for discovery of protocol mechanisms identified by OIDs, including
   the supportedControl, supportedExtension, and supportedFeatures
   attributes [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>].



<span class="grey">Zeilenga                 Best Current Practice                  [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4520">RFC 4520</a>              IANA Considerations for LDAP             June 2006</span>


   A registry of OIDs used for discovery of protocol mechanisms is
   provided to allow implementors and others to locate the technical
   specification for these protocol mechanisms.  Future specifications
   of additional Root DSE attributes holding values identifying protocol
   mechanisms MAY extend this registry for their values.

   Protocol mechanisms are registered on a First Come First Served
   basis.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20LDAP%20Syntaxes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  LDAP Syntaxes</span>

   This registry provides a listing of LDAP syntaxes [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>].  Each
   LDAP syntax is identified by an OID.  This registry is provided to
   allow implementors and others to locate the technical specification
   describing a particular LDAP Syntax.

   LDAP Syntaxes are registered on a First Come First Served with
   Specification Required basis.

   Note: Unlike object classes, attribute types, and various other kinds
         of schema elements, descriptors are not used in LDAP to
         identify LDAP Syntaxes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Object%20Identifier%20Descriptors"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Object Identifier Descriptors</span>

   LDAP allows short descriptive names (or descriptors) to be used
   instead of a numeric Object Identifier to identify select protocol
   extensions [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>], schema elements [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>], LDAP URL [<a href="./rfc4516" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Uniform Resource Locator"'>RFC4516</a>]
   extensions, and other objects.

   Although the protocol allows the same descriptor to refer to
   different object identifiers in certain cases and the registry
   supports multiple registrations of the same descriptor (each
   indicating a different kind of schema element and different object
   identifier), multiple registrations of the same descriptor are to be
   avoided.  All such multiple registration requests require Expert
   Review.

   Descriptors are restricted to strings of UTF-8 [<a href="./rfc3629" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>RFC3629</a>] encoded
   Unicode characters restricted by the following ABNF:

      name = keystring

   Descriptors are case insensitive.

   Multiple names may be assigned to a given OID.  For purposes of
   registration, an OID is to be represented in numeric OID form (e.g.,
   1.1.0.23.40) conforming to the following ABNF:



<span class="grey">Zeilenga                 Best Current Practice                  [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4520">RFC 4520</a>              IANA Considerations for LDAP             June 2006</span>


      numericoid = number 1*( DOT number )

   While the protocol places no maximum length restriction upon
   descriptors, they should be short.  Descriptors longer than 48
   characters may be viewed as too long to register.

   A value ending with a hyphen ("-") reserves all descriptors that
   start with that value.  For example, the registration of the option
   "descrFamily-" reserves all options that start with "descrFamily-"
   for some related purpose.

   Descriptors beginning with "x-" are for Private Use and cannot be
   registered.

   Descriptors beginning with "e-" are reserved for experiments and will
   be registered on a First Come First Served basis.

   All other descriptors require Expert Review to be registered.

   The registrant need not "own" the OID being named.

   The OID name space is managed by the ISO/IEC Joint Technical
   Committee 1 - Subcommittee 6.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.5.%20%20AttributeDescription%20Options"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" id="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  AttributeDescription Options</span>

   An AttributeDescription [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>] can contain zero or more options
   specifying additional semantics.  An option SHALL be restricted to a
   string of UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters limited by the following
   ABNF:

      option = keystring

   Options are case insensitive.

   While the protocol places no maximum length restriction upon option
   strings, they should be short.  Options longer than 24 characters may
   be viewed as too long to register.

   Values ending with a hyphen ("-") reserve all option names that start
   with the name.  For example, the registration of the option
   "optionFamily-" reserves all options that start with "optionFamily-"
   for some related purpose.

   Options beginning with "x-" are for Private Use and cannot be
   registered.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4520">RFC 4520</a>              IANA Considerations for LDAP             June 2006</span>


   Options beginning with "e-" are reserved for experiments and will be
   registered on a First Come First Served basis.

   All other options require Standards Action or Expert Review with
   Specification Required to be registered.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.6.%20%20LDAP%20Message%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6" id="section-3.6">3.6</a>.  LDAP Message Types</span>

   Each protocol message is encapsulated in an LDAPMessage envelope
   [RFC4511.  The protocolOp CHOICE indicates the type of message
   encapsulated.  Each message type consists of an ASN.1 identifier in
   the form of a keyword and a non-negative choice number.  The choice
   number is combined with the class (APPLICATION) and data type
   (CONSTRUCTED or PRIMITIVE) to construct the BER tag in the message's
   encoding.  The choice numbers for existing protocol messages are
   implicit in the protocol's ASN.1 defined in [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].

   New values will be registered upon Standards Action.

   Note: LDAP provides extensible messages that reduce but do not
         eliminate the need to add new message types.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.7.%20%20LDAP%20Authentication%20Method"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7" id="section-3.7">3.7</a>.  LDAP Authentication Method</span>

   The LDAP Bind operation supports multiple authentication methods
   [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].  Each authentication choice consists of an ASN.1
   identifier in the form of a keyword and a non-negative integer.

   The registrant SHALL classify the authentication method usage using
   one of the following terms:

         COMMON      - method is appropriate for common use on the
                       Internet.
         LIMITED USE - method is appropriate for limited use.
         OBSOLETE    - method has been deprecated or otherwise found to
                       be inappropriate for any use.

   Methods without publicly available specifications SHALL NOT be
   classified as COMMON.  New registrations of the class OBSOLETE cannot
   be registered.

   New authentication method integers in the range 0-1023 require
   Standards Action to be registered.  New authentication method
   integers in the range 1024-4095 require Expert Review with
   Specification Required.  New authentication method integers in the
   range 4096-16383 will be registered on a First Come First Served
   basis.  Keywords associated with integers in the range 0-4095 SHALL
   NOT start with "e-" or "x-".  Keywords associated with integers in

   the range 4096-16383 SHALL start with "e-".  Values greater than or
   equal to 16384 and keywords starting with "x-" are for Private Use
   and cannot be registered.

   Note: LDAP supports Simple Authentication and Security Layers
         [<a href="./rfc4422" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>] as an authentication choice.  SASL is an extensible
         authentication framework.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.8.%20%20LDAP%20Result%20Codes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.8" id="section-3.8">3.8</a>.  LDAP Result Codes</span>

   LDAP result messages carry a resultCode enumerated value to indicate
   the outcome of the operation [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].  Each result code consists of
   an ASN.1 identifier in the form of a keyword and a non-negative
   integer.

   New resultCodes integers in the range 0-1023 require Standards Action
   to be registered.  New resultCode integers in the range 1024-4095
   require Expert Review with Specification Required.  New resultCode
   integers in the range 4096-16383 will be registered on a First Come
   First Served basis.  Keywords associated with integers in the range
   0-4095 SHALL NOT start with "e-" or "x-".  Keywords associated with
   integers in the range 4096-16383 SHALL start with "e-".  Values
   greater than or equal to 16384 and keywords starting with "x-" are
   for Private Use and cannot be registered.

   LDAP SearchRequest messages carry a scope-enumerated value to
   indicate the extent of search within the DIT [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].  Each search
   value consists of an ASN.1 identifier in the form of a keyword and a
   non-negative integer.

   New scope integers in the range 0-1023 require Standards Action to be
   registered.  New scope integers in the range 1024-4095 require Expert
   Review with Specification Required.  New scope integers in the range
   4096-16383 will be registered on a First Come First Served basis.
   Keywords associated with integers in the range 0-4095 SHALL NOT start
   with "e-" or "x-".  Keywords associated with integers in the range
   4096-16383 SHALL start with "e-".  Values greater than or equal to

   LDAP filters are used in making assertions against an object
   represented in the directory [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].  The Filter CHOICE indicates
   a type of assertion.  Each Filter CHOICE consists of an ASN.1
   identifier in the form of a keyword and a non-negative choice number.

   The choice number is combined with the class (APPLICATION) and data
   type (CONSTRUCTED or PRIMITIVE) to construct the BER tag in the
   message's encoding.

   Note: LDAP provides the extensibleMatching choice, which reduces but
         does not eliminate the need to add new filter choices.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.11.%20%20LDAP%20ModifyRequest%20Operation%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.11" id="section-3.11">3.11</a>.  LDAP ModifyRequest Operation Type</span>

   The LDAP ModifyRequest carries a sequence of modification operations
   [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].  Each kind (e.g., add, delete, replace) of operation
   consists of an ASN.1 identifier in the form of a keyword and a non-
   negative integer.

   New operation type integers in the range 0-1023 require Standards
   Action to be registered.  New operation type integers in the range
   1024-4095 require Expert Review with Specification Required.  New
   operation type integers in the range 4096-16383 will be registered on
   a First Come First Served basis.  Keywords associated with integers
   in the range 0-4095 SHALL NOT start with "e-" or "x-".  Keywords
   associated with integers in the range 4096-16383 SHALL start with
   "e-".  Values greater than or equal to 16384 and keywords starting
   with "x-" are for Private Use and cannot be registered.

   Authorization Identities in LDAP are strings conforming to the
   &lt;authzId&gt; production [<a href="./rfc4513" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Authentication Methods and Security Mechanisms"'>RFC4513</a>].  This production is extensible.  Each
   new specific authorization form is identified by a prefix string
   conforming to the following ABNF:

         prefix = keystring COLON
         COLON = %x3A ; COLON (":" U+003A)

   Prefixes are case insensitive.

   While the protocol places no maximum length restriction upon prefix
   strings, they should be short.  Prefixes longer than 12 characters
   may be viewed as too long to register.

   Prefixes beginning with "x-" are for Private Use and cannot be
   registered.

   Prefixes beginning with "e-" are reserved for experiments and will be
   registered on a First Come First Served basis.

   All other prefixes require Standards Action or Expert Review with
   Specification Required to be registered.

   string representation of a distinguished name [<a href="./rfc1779" title='"A String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>RFC1779</a>].  LDAPv2 is
   now Historic [<a href="./rfc3494" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 2 (LDAPv2) to Historic Status"'>RFC3494</a>].

   Directory systems names are not known to be used in any other
   context.  LDAPv3 [<a href="./rfc4514" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>RFC4514</a>] uses Object Identifier Descriptors
   [<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>] (which have a different syntax than directory system
   names).

   New Directory System Names will no longer be accepted.  For
   historical purposes, the current list of registered names should
   remain publicly available.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Registration%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Registration Procedure</span>

   The procedure given here MUST be used by anyone who wishes to use a
   new value of a type described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of this document.

   The first step is for the requester to fill out the appropriate form.
   Templates are provided in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   If the policy is Standards Action, the completed form SHOULD be
   provided to the IESG with the request for Standards Action.  Upon
   approval of the Standards Action, the IESG SHALL forward the request
   (possibly revised) to IANA.  The IESG SHALL be regarded as the
   registration owner of all values requiring Standards Action.

   If the policy is Expert Review, the requester SHALL post the
   completed form to the &lt;directory@apps.ietf.org&gt; mailing list for
   public review.  The review period is two (2) weeks.  If a revised
   form is later submitted, the review period is restarted.  Anyone may
   subscribe to this list by sending a request to &lt;directory-
   request@apps.ietf.org&gt;.  During the review, objections may be raised
   by anyone (including the Expert) on the list.  After completion of
   the review, the Expert, based on public comments, SHALL either
   approve the request and forward it to the IANA OR deny the request.
   In either case, the Expert SHALL promptly notify the requester of the
   action.  Actions of the Expert may be appealed [<a href="./rfc2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>].  The Expert
   is appointed by Applications Area Directors.  The requester is viewed
   as the registration owner of values registered under Expert Review.

   If the policy is First Come First Served, the requester SHALL submit
   the completed form directly to the IANA: &lt;iana@iana.org&gt;.  The
   requester is viewed as the registration owner of values registered
   under First Come First Served.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4520">RFC 4520</a>              IANA Considerations for LDAP             June 2006</span>


   Neither the Expert nor IANA will take position on the claims of
   copyright or trademark issues regarding completed forms.

   Prior to submission of the Internet Draft (I-D) to the RFC Editor but
   after IESG review and tentative approval, the document editor SHOULD
   revise the I-D to use registered values.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Registration%20Maintenance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Registration Maintenance</span>

   This section discusses maintenance of registrations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Lists%20of%20Registered%20Values"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Lists of Registered Values</span>

   IANA makes lists of registered values readily available to the
   Internet community on its web site: &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/">http://www.iana.org/</a>&gt;.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Change%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Change Control</span>

   The registration owner MAY update the registration subject to the
   same constraints and review as with new registrations.  In cases
   where the registration owner is unable or is unwilling to make
   necessary updates, the IESG MAY assume ownership of the registration
   in order to update the registration.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.%20%20Comments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Comments</span>

   For cases where others (anyone other than the registration owner)
   have significant objections to the claims in a registration and the
   registration owner does not agree to change the registration,
   comments MAY be attached to a registration upon Expert Review.  For
   registrations owned by the IESG, the objections SHOULD be addressed
   by initiating a request for Expert Review.

   The form of these requests is ad hoc, but MUST include the specific
   objections to be reviewed and SHOULD contain (directly or by
   reference) materials supporting the objections.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations detailed in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp26">BCP 26</a> [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC2434</a>] are
   generally applicable to this document.  Additional security
   considerations specific to each name space are discussed in <a href="#section-3">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-3">3</a>, where appropriate.

   Security considerations for LDAP are discussed in documents
   comprising the technical specification [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>].

   This informative appendix provides a summary of changes made since
   <a href="./rfc3383">RFC 3383</a>.

      -  Object Identifier Descriptors practices were updated to require
         all descriptors defined in RFCs to be registered and
         recommending all other descriptors (excepting those in
         private-use name space) be registered.  Additionally, all
         requests for multiple registrations of the same descriptor are
         now subject to Expert Review.

      -  Protocol Mechanisms practices were updated to include values of
         the 'supportedFeatures' attribute type.

      -  LDAP Syntax, Search Scope, Filter Choice, ModifyRequest
         operation, and authzId prefixes registries were added.

      -  References to RFCs comprising the LDAP technical specifications
         have been updated to latest revisions.

      -  References to ISO 10646 have been replaced with [<a href="#ref-Unicode" title='"The Unicode Standard, Version 3.2.0"'>Unicode</a>].

      -  The "Assigned Values" appendix providing initial registry
         values was removed.

      -  Numerous editorial changes were made.
