Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing a client of the Common
   Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol.

   This memo includes a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   SMIv2 [<a href="#ref-V2SMI" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>V2SMI</a>].

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

      o  An overall architecture, described in an Architecture for
         Describing SNMP Management Frameworks [<a href="#ref-ARCH" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>ARCH</a>].

      o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
         purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
         STD 16, <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-V1SMI" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP- based Internets"'>V1SMI</a>], STD 16, <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-V1CONCISE" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>V1CONCISE</a>] and <a href="./rfc1215">RFC</a>
         <a href="./rfc1215">1215</a> [<a href="#ref-V1TRAPS" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>V1TRAPS</a>].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
         in STD 58, <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="#ref-V2SMI" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>V2SMI</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="#ref-V2TC" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>V2TC</a>] and STD
         58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="#ref-V2CONFORM" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>V2CONFORM</a>].

      o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
         described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-V1PROTO" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>V1PROTO</a>].  A second version of
         the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
         track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="./rfc1901">RFC 1901</a>
         [<a href="#ref-V2COMMUNITY" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>V2COMMUNITY</a>] and <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="#ref-V2TRANS" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>V2TRANS</a>].  The third version of the
         message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in <a href="./rfc1906">RFC1906</a>
         [<a href="#ref-V2TRANS" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>V2TRANS</a>], Message Processing and Dispatching [<a href="#ref-V3MPC" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>V3MPC</a>] and
         User-based Security Model [<a href="#ref-V3USM" title='"The User-Based Security Model (USM) for Version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>V3USM</a>].

      o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
         first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
         described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-V1PROTO" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>V1PROTO</a>].  A second set of
         protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
         <a href="./rfc1905">RFC 1905</a> [<a href="#ref-V2PROTO" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>V2PROTO</a>].

      o  A set of fundamental applications described in SNMPv3
         Applications [<a href="#ref-V3APPS" title='"SNMP Applications"'>V3APPS</a>] and the view-based access control
         mechanism described in View-based Access Control Model
         [<a href="#ref-V3VACM" title='"View-based Access Control Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>V3VACM</a>].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in <a href="./rfc2570">RFC 2570</a> [<a href="#ref-V3INTRO" title='"Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>V3INTRO</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no

   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

   The COPS protocol [<a href="#ref-COPS" title='"The COPS (Common Open Policy Service) Protocol"'>COPS</a>] is a client-server protocol intended for the
   communication of policy requests and decisions between a Policy
   Enforcement Point (PEP) and a Policy Decision Point (PDP).  The PEP
   acts as a COPS client in this scenario.  The model for policy out-
   sourcing, of which the COPS protocol provides one part, is described
   in [<a href="#ref-FRAMEWORK" title='"A Framework for Policy-based Admission Control"'>FRAMEWORK</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Scope</span>

   This MIB is intended to provide management of the important features
   of a COPS protocol client module. It does not provide management for
   a COPS server - this is outside the scope of the current memo.  It
   provides for monitoring of status and protocol statistics, as well as
   for configuration of the client, in particular for telling it where
   to locate its servers.  Other mechanisms for achieving this function
   without SNMP configuration might include use of the Service Location
   Protocol [<a href="#ref-SRVLOC" title='"Service Location Protocol, Version 2"'>SRVLOC</a>] although this is outside the scope of this memo and
   are not specified by the COPS protocol itself.

   This MIB also does not provide management of specific COPS client-
   types e.g., for use with the RSVP protocol [<a href="#ref-RSVP" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Version 1 - Functional Specification"'>RSVP</a>][COPSRSVP].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Structure%20of%20COPS%20Client%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Structure of COPS Client MIB</span>

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects. The overall structure is
   described below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20copsClientCapabilitiesGroup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  copsClientCapabilitiesGroup</span>

   This group contains objects that represent COPS protocol capabilities
   implemented by this COPS client.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20copsClientStatusGroup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  copsClientStatusGroup</span>

   This group contains objects that indicate the current status of
   connection(s) to COPS servers, including per-server protocol
   statistics.  It maintains last-known statistics for all of the
   servers with which the client has ever been connected since agent
   restart.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20copsConfigGroup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  copsConfigGroup</span>

   This group contains objects that allow for configuration of COPS
   server addresses and the order to which connections should be
   attempted.  It contains a table of per-server objects as well as
   scalars for configuration of the retry algorithm to be used by a
   client to obtain a connection to an appropriate server.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Textual%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Textual Conventions</span>

   The datatypes CopsClientState, CopsServerEntryType, CopsErrorCode,
   CopsTcpPort and CopsAuthType are used as textual conventions in this
   document.  These textual conventions have NO effect on either the
   syntax nor the semantics of any managed object.  Objects defined
   using these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the
   SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

   This MIB contains definitions for a single COPS protocol client
   represented by a single SNMP agent and instance of the MIB-2 system
   group [<a href="#ref-MIB2" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>MIB2</a>].  It does not address the case of multiple co-located
   COPS protocol clients.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Acknowledgments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Acknowledgments</span>

   This document describes instrumentation for the client side of the
   COPS protocol which was defined by the RSVP Admission Policy (rap)
   Working Group, now known as the Resource Allocation Protocol (rap)
   Working Group.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [USM] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [VACM] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
