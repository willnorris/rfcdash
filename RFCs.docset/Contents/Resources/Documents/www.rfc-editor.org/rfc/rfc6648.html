Abstract

   Historically, designers and implementers of application protocols
   have often distinguished between standardized and unstandardized
   parameters by prefixing the names of unstandardized parameters with
   the string "X-" or similar constructs.  In practice, that convention
   causes more problems than it solves.  Therefore, this document
   deprecates the convention for newly defined parameters with textual
   (as opposed to numerical) names in application protocols.

   Many application protocols use parameters with textual (as opposed to
   numerical) names to identify data (media types, header fields in
   Internet mail messages and HTTP requests, vCard parameters and
   properties, etc.).  Historically, designers and implementers of
   application protocols have often distinguished between standardized
   and unstandardized parameters by prefixing the names of
   unstandardized parameters with the string "X-" or similar constructs
   (e.g., "x."), where the "X" is commonly understood to stand for
   "eXperimental" or "eXtension".

   Under this convention, the name of a parameter not only identified
   the data, but also embedded the status of the parameter into the name
   itself: a parameter defined in a specification produced by a
   recognized standards development organization (or registered
   according to processes defined in such a specification) did not start

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6648">RFC 6648</a>                    Deprecating "X-"                   June 2012</span>


   with "X-" or similar constructs, whereas a parameter defined outside
   such a specification or process started with "X-" or similar
   constructs.

   As explained more fully under <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>, this convention was
   encouraged for many years in application protocols such as file
   transfer, email, and the World Wide Web.  In particular, it was
   codified for email by [<a href="./rfc822" title='"Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages"'>RFC822</a>] (via the distinction between
   "Extension-fields" and "user-defined-fields"), but then removed by
   [<a href="./rfc2822" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC2822</a>] based on implementation and deployment experience.  A
   similar progression occurred for SIP technologies with regard to the
   "P-" header, as explained in [<a href="./rfc5727" title='"Change Process for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Real- time Applications and Infrastructure Area"'>RFC5727</a>].  The reasoning behind those
   changes is explored under <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

   In short, although in theory the "X-" convention was a good way to
   avoid collisions (and attendant interoperability problems) between
   standardized parameters and unstandardized parameters, in practice
   the benefits have been outweighed by the costs associated with the
   leakage of unstandardized parameters into the standards space.

   This document generalizes from the experience of the email and SIP
   communities by doing the following:

   1.  Deprecates the "X-" convention for newly defined parameters in
       application protocols, including new parameters for established
       protocols.  This change applies even where the "X-" convention
       was only implicit, and not explicitly provided, such as was done
       for email in [<a href="./rfc822" title='"Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages"'>RFC822</a>].

   2.  Makes specific recommendations about how to proceed in a world
       without the distinction between standardized and unstandardized
       parameters (although only for parameters with textual names, not
       parameters that are expressed as numbers, which are out of the
       scope of this document).

   3.  Does not recommend against the practice of private, local,
       preliminary, experimental, or implementation-specific parameters,
       only against the use of "X-" and similar constructs in the names
       of such parameters.

   4.  Makes no recommendation as to whether existing "X-" parameters
       ought to remain in use or be migrated to a format without the
       "X-"; this is a matter for the creators or maintainers of those
       parameters.

   5.  Does not override existing specifications that legislate the use
       of "X-" for particular application protocols (e.g., the "x-name"
       token in [<a href="./rfc5545" title='"Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar)"'>RFC5545</a>]); this is a matter for the designers of those
       protocols.

   Implementations of application protocols MUST NOT make any
   assumptions about the status of a parameter, nor take automatic
   action regarding a parameter, based solely on the presence or absence
   of "X-" or a similar construct in the parameter's name.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Recommendations%20for%20Creators%20of%20New%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Recommendations for Creators of New Parameters</span>

   Creators of new parameters to be used in the context of application
   protocols:

   1.  SHOULD assume that all parameters they create might become
       standardized, public, commonly deployed, or usable across
       multiple implementations.

   2.  SHOULD employ meaningful parameter names that they have reason to
       believe are currently unused.

   3.  SHOULD NOT prefix their parameter names with "X-" or similar
       constructs.

   Note: If the relevant parameter name space has conventions about
   associating parameter names with those who create them, a parameter
   name could incorporate the organization's name or primary domain name
   (see <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for examples).

   Designers of new application protocols that allow extensions using
   parameters:

   1.  SHOULD establish registries with potentially unlimited value-
       spaces, defining both permanent and provisional registries if
       appropriate.

   2.  SHOULD define simple, clear registration procedures.

   3.  SHOULD mandate registration of all non-private parameters,
       independent of the form of the parameter names.

   4.  SHOULD NOT prohibit parameters with an "X-" prefix or similar
       constructs from being registered.

   5.  MUST NOT stipulate that a parameter with an "X-" prefix or
       similar constructs needs to be understood as unstandardized.

   6.  MUST NOT stipulate that a parameter without an "X-" prefix or
       similar constructs needs to be understood as standardized.

   Interoperability and migration issues with security-critical
   parameters can result in unnecessary vulnerabilities (see <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>
   for further discussion).

   As a corollary to the recommendation provided under <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>,
   implementations MUST NOT assume that standardized parameters are
   "secure" whereas unstandardized parameters are "insecure", based
   solely on the names of such parameters.

   This document does not modify registration procedures currently in
   force for various application protocols.  However, such procedures
   might be updated in the future to incorporate the best practices
   defined in this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Background</span>

   The beginnings of the "X-" convention can be found in a suggestion
   made by Brian Harvey in 1975 with regard to FTP parameters [<a href="./rfc691" title='"One more try on the FTP"'>RFC691</a>]:

      Thus, FTP servers which care about the distinction between Telnet
      print and non-print could implement SRVR N and SRVR T.  Ideally
      the SRVR parameters should be registered with Jon Postel to avoid
      conflicts, although it is not a disaster if two sites use the same
      parameter for different things.  I suggest that parameters be
      allowed to be more than one letter, and that an initial letter X
      be used for really local idiosyncracies [sic].

   This "X" prefix was subsequently used in [<a href="./rfc737" title='"FTP extension: XSEN"'>RFC737</a>], [<a href="./rfc743" title='"FTP extension: XRSQ/XRCP"'>RFC743</a>], and
   [<a href="./rfc775" title='"Directory oriented FTP commands"'>RFC775</a>].  This usage was noted in [<a href="./rfc1123" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support"'>RFC1123</a>]:

      FTP allows "experimental" commands, whose names begin with "X".
      If these commands are subsequently adopted as standards, there may
      still be existing implementations using the "X" form....  All FTP
      implementations SHOULD recognize both forms of these commands, by
      simply equating them with extra entries in the command lookup
      table.

   The "X-" convention has been used for email header fields since at
   least the publication of [<a href="./rfc822" title='"Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages"'>RFC822</a>] in 1982, which distinguished
   between "Extension-fields" and "user-defined-fields" as follows:

      The prefatory string "X-" will never be used in the names of
      Extension-fields.  This provides user-defined fields with a
      protected set of names.

   That rule was restated by [<a href="./rfc1154" title='"Encoding header field for internet messages"'>RFC1154</a>] as follows:

      Keywords beginning with "X-" are permanently reserved to
      implementation-specific use.  No standard registered encoding
      keyword will ever begin with "X-".

   This convention continued with various specifications for media types
   ([<a href="./rfc2045" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>RFC2045</a>], [<a href="./rfc2046" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>RFC2046</a>], [<a href="./rfc2047" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text"'>RFC2047</a>]), HTTP headers ([<a href="./rfc2068" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2068</a>],
   [<a href="./rfc2616" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>]), vCard parameters and properties ([<a href="./rfc2426" title='"vCard MIME Directory Profile"'>RFC2426</a>]), Uniform
   Resource Names ([<a href="./rfc3406" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms"'>RFC3406</a>]), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) field names ([<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>]), and other application technologies.

   However, use of the "X-" prefix in email headers was effectively
   deprecated between the publication of [<a href="./rfc822" title='"Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages"'>RFC822</a>] in 1982 and the
   publication of [<a href="./rfc2822" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC2822</a>] in 2001 by removing the distinction between
   the "extension-field" construct and the "user-defined-field"

   construct (a similar change happened with regard to Session
   Initiation Protocol "P-" headers when [<a href="./rfc3427" title='"Change Process for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3427</a>] was obsoleted by
   [<a href="./rfc5727" title='"Change Process for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Real- time Applications and Infrastructure Area"'>RFC5727</a>]).

   Despite the fact that parameters containing the "X-" string have been
   effectively deprecated in email headers, they continue to be used in
   a wide variety of application protocols.  The two primary situations
   motivating such use are:

   1.  Experiments that are intended to possibly be standardized in the
       future, if they are successful.

   2.  Extensions that are intended to never be standardized because
       they are intended only for implementation-specific use or for
       local use on private networks.

   Use of this naming convention is not mandated by the Internet
   Standards Process [<a href="#ref-BCP9" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>BCP9</a>] or IANA registration rules [<a href="#ref-BCP26" title="">BCP26</a>].  Rather,
   it is an individual choice by each specification that references the
   convention or each administrative process that chooses to use it.  In
   particular, some Standards Track RFCs have interpreted the convention
   in a normative way (e.g., [<a href="./rfc822" title='"Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages"'>RFC822</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5451" title='"Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status"'>RFC5451</a>]).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20B.%20%20Analysis"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B" id="appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Analysis</span>

   The primary problem with the "X-" convention is that unstandardized
   parameters have a tendency to leak into the protected space of
   standardized parameters, thus introducing the need for migration from
   the "X-" name to a standardized name.  Migration, in turn, introduces
   interoperability issues (and sometimes security issues) because older
   implementations will support only the "X-" name and newer
   implementations might support only the standardized name.  To
   preserve interoperability, newer implementations simply support the
   "X-" name forever, which means that the unstandardized name has
   become a de facto standard (thus obviating the need for segregation
   of the name space into standardized and unstandardized areas in the
   first place).

   We have already seen this phenomenon at work with regard to FTP in
   the quote from [<a href="./rfc1123" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support"'>RFC1123</a>] in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  The HTTP community had the
   same experience with the "x-gzip" and "x-compress" media types, as
   noted in [<a href="./rfc2068" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2068</a>]:

      For compatibility with previous implementations of HTTP,
      applications should consider "x-gzip" and "x-compress" to be
      equivalent to "gzip" and "compress" respectively.

   A similar example can be found in [<a href="./rfc5064" title='"The Archived-At Message Header Field"'>RFC5064</a>], which defined the
   "Archived-At" message header field but also found it necessary to
   define and register the "X-Archived-At" field:

      For backwards compatibility, this document also describes the
      X-Archived-At header field, a precursor of the Archived-At header
      field.  The X-Archived-At header field MAY also be parsed, but
      SHOULD NOT be generated.

   One of the original reasons for segregation of name spaces into
   standardized and unstandardized areas was the perceived difficulty of
   registering names.  However, the solution to that problem has been
   simpler registration rules, such as those provided by [<a href="./rfc3864" title='"Registration Procedures for Message Header Fields"'>RFC3864</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc4288" title='"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"'>RFC4288</a>].  As explained in [<a href="./rfc4288" title='"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"'>RFC4288</a>]:

      [W]ith the simplified registration procedures described above for
      vendor and personal trees, it should rarely, if ever, be necessary
      to use unregistered experimental types.  Therefore, use of both
      "x-" and "x." forms is discouraged.

   For some name spaces, another helpful practice has been the
   establishment of separate registries for permanent names and
   provisional names, as in [<a href="./rfc4395" title='"Guidelines and Registration Procedures for New URI Schemes"'>RFC4395</a>].

   Furthermore, often standardization of a unstandardized parameter
   leads to subtly different behavior (e.g., the standardized version
   might have different security properties as a result of security
   review provided during the standardization process).  If implementers
   treat the old, unstandardized parameter and the new, standardized
   parameter as equivalent, interoperability and security problems can
   ensue.  Analysis of unstandardized parameters to detect and correct
   flaws is, in general, a good thing and is not intended to be
   discouraged by the lack of distinction in element names.  If an
   originally unstandardized parameter or protocol element is
   standardized and the new form has differences that affect
   interoperability or security properties, it would be inappropriate
   for implementations to treat the old form as identical to the new
   form.

   For similar considerations with regard to the "P-" convention in the
   Session Initiation Protocol, see [<a href="./rfc5727" title='"Change Process for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Real- time Applications and Infrastructure Area"'>RFC5727</a>].

   In some situations, segregating the parameter name space used in a
   given application protocol can be justified:

   1.  When it is extremely unlikely that some parameters will ever be
       standardized.  In this case, implementation-specific and private-
       use parameters could at least incorporate the organization's name
       (e.g., "ExampleInc-foo" or, consistent with [<a href="./rfc4288" title='"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"'>RFC4288</a>],
       "VND.ExampleInc.foo") or primary domain name (e.g.,
       "com.example.foo" or a Uniform Resource Identifier [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>] such
       as "http://example.com/foo").  In rare cases, truly experimental
       parameters could be given meaningless names such as nonsense
       words, the output of a hash function, or Universally Unique
       Identifiers (UUIDs) [<a href="./rfc4122" title='"A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"'>RFC4122</a>].

   2.  When parameter names might have significant meaning.  This case
       too is rare, since implementers can almost always find a synonym
       for an existing term (e.g., "urgency" instead of "priority") or
       simply invent a more creative name (e.g., "get-it-there-fast").
       The existence of multiple similarly named parameters can be
       confusing, but this is true regardless if there is an attempt to
       segregate standardized and unstandardized parameters (e.g.,
       "X-Priority" can be confused with "Urgency").

   3.  When parameter names need to be very short (e.g., as in [<a href="./rfc5646" title='"Tags for Identifying Languages"'>RFC5646</a>]
       for language tags).  In this case, it can be more efficient to
       assign numbers instead of human-readable names (e.g., as in
       [<a href="./rfc2939" title='"Procedures and IANA Guidelines for Definition of New DHCP Options and Message Types"'>RFC2939</a>] for DHCP options) and to leave a certain numeric range
       for implementation-specific extensions or private use (e.g., as
       with the codec numbers used with the Session Description Protocol
       [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>]).

   There are three primary objections to deprecating the "X-" convention
   as a best practice for application protocols:

   1.  Implementers might mistake one parameter for another parameter
       that has a similar name; a rigid distinction such as an "X-"
       prefix can make this clear.  However, in practice, implementers
       are forced to blur the distinction (e.g., by treating "X-foo" as
       a de facto standard), so it inevitably becomes meaningless.

   2.  Collisions are undesirable, and it would be bad for both a
       standardized parameter "foo" and a unstandardized parameter "foo"
       to exist simultaneously.  However, names are almost always cheap,
       so an experimental, implementation-specific, or private-use name
       of "foo" does not prevent a standards development organization
       from issuing a similarly creative name such as "bar".

   3.  [<a href="#ref-BCP82" title='"Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful"'>BCP82</a>] is entitled "Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers
       Considered Useful" and therefore implies that the "X-" prefix is
       also useful for experimental parameters.  However, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp82">BCP 82</a>
       addresses the need for protocol numbers when the pool of such
       numbers is strictly limited (e.g., DHCP options) or when a number
       is absolutely required even for purely experimental purposes
       (e.g., the Protocol field of the IP header).  In almost all
       application protocols that make use of protocol parameters
       (including email headers, media types, HTTP headers, vCard
       parameters and properties, URNs, and LDAP field names), the name
       space is not limited or constrained in any way, so there is no
       need to assign a block of names for private use or experimental
       purposes (see also [<a href="#ref-BCP26" title="">BCP26</a>]).

   Therefore, it appears that segregating the parameter space into a
   standardized area and a unstandardized area has few, if any, benefits
   and has at least one significant cost in terms of interoperability.
