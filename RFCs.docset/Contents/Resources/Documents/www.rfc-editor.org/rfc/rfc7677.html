<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document registers the SASL mechanisms SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-
   SHA-256-PLUS.  SHA-256 has stronger security properties than SHA-1,
   and it is expected that SCRAM mechanisms based on it will have
   greater predicted longevity than the SCRAM mechanisms based on SHA-1.

   The registration form for the SCRAM family of algorithms is also
   updated from [<a href="./rfc5802" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms"'>RFC5802</a>].

   After publication of [<a href="./rfc5802" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms"'>RFC5802</a>], it was discovered that Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>] does not have the expected properties
   for the "tls-unique" channel binding to be secure [<a href="./rfc7627" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Hash and Extended Master Secret Extension"'>RFC7627</a>].
   Therefore, this document contains normative text that applies to both
   the original SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS and the newly introduced SCRAM-SHA-
   256-PLUS mechanism.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20SCRAM-SHA-256%20and%20SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS</span>

   The SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS SASL mechanisms are defined
   in the same way that SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS are defined in
   [<a href="./rfc5802" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms"'>RFC5802</a>], except that the hash function for HMAC() and H() uses
   SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 [<a href="./rfc6234" title='"US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)"'>RFC6234</a>].

   For the SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS SASL mechanisms, the
   hash iteration-count announced by a server SHOULD be at least 4096.

   The GSS-API mechanism OID for SCRAM-SHA-256 is 1.3.6.1.5.5.18 (see
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>).

   This is a simple example of a SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication exchange
   when the client doesn't support channel bindings.  The username
   'user' and password 'pencil' are being used.

   The security considerations from [<a href="./rfc5802" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms"'>RFC5802</a>] still apply.

   To be secure, either SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS MUST be
   used over a TLS channel that has had the session hash extension
   [<a href="./rfc7627" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Hash and Extended Master Secret Extension"'>RFC7627</a>] negotiated, or session resumption MUST NOT have been used.

   See [<a href="./rfc4270" title='"Attacks on Cryptographic Hashes in Internet Protocols"'>RFC4270</a>] and [<a href="./rfc6194" title='"Security Considerations for the SHA-0 and SHA-1 Message-Digest Algorithms"'>RFC6194</a>] for reasons to move from SHA-1 to a
   strong security mechanism like SHA-256.

   The strength of this mechanism is dependent in part on the hash
   iteration-count, as denoted by "i" in [<a href="./rfc5802" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms"'>RFC5802</a>].  As a rule of thumb,
   the hash iteration-count should be such that a modern machine will
   take 0.1 seconds to perform the complete algorithm; however, this is
   unlikely to be practical on mobile devices and other relatively low-
   performance systems.  At the time this was written, the rule of thumb
   gives around 15,000 iterations required; however, a hash iteration-
   count of 4096 takes around 0.5 seconds on current mobile handsets.
   This computational cost can be avoided by caching the ClientKey
   (assuming the Salt and hash iteration-count is stable).  Therefore,
   the recommendation of this specification is that the hash iteration-
   count SHOULD be at least 4096, but careful consideration ought to be
   given to using a significantly higher value, particularly where
   mobile use is less important.

   The IANA registry for SCRAM-* (the SCRAM family of SASL mechanisms)
   in the SASL mechanism registry ([<a href="./rfc4422" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>]) has been updated as

   A new IANA registry has been added for members of the SCRAM family of
   SASL mechanisms, named "SASL SCRAM Family Mechanisms".  It adds two
   new fields to the existing SCRAM mechanism registry: Minimum
   iteration-count and Associated OID.  Below is the template for
   registration of a new SASL family SCRAM.  (Note that the string
   "TBD-BY-IANA" should be left as is, so that it may be filled in at
   registration time by IANA.)

      be requested on the KITTEN mailing list kitten@ietf.org (or a
      successor designated by the responsible Security Area Director).

      Note: At publication of a new SASL SCRAM Family Mechanism, IANA
      SHOULD assign a GSS-API mechanism OID for this mechanism from the
      iso.org.dod.internet.security.mechanisms prefix (see the "SMI
      Security for Mechanism Codes" registry) and fill in the value for
      "TBD-BY-IANA" above.  Only one OID needs to be assigned for a
      SCRAM-&lt;NAME&gt; and SCRAM-&lt;NAME&gt;-PLUS pair.  The same OID should be
      assigned to both entries in the registry.

      Note to future SASL SCRAM mechanism designers: each new SASL SCRAM
      mechanism MUST be explicitly registered with IANA and MUST comply
      with the SCRAM-mechanism naming convention defined in <a href="./rfc5802#section-4">Section 4 of
      [RFC5802]</a>.

   The existing entries for SASL SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS have
   been moved from the existing SASL mechanism registry to the "SASL
   SCRAM Family Mechanisms" registry.  At that time, the following
   values were added:

      Minimum iteration-count: 4096
      OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.14 (from [<a href="./rfc5802" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms"'>RFC5802</a>])
