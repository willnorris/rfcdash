Request for Comments: 620                                              Mar 1974
NIC # 21993




               <span class="h1">Request for Monitor Host Table Updates</span>

The ARC/NIC group has successfully been running OFFICE-1 for several
weeks now. Our NIC users have been transferred to that site, and are
receiving all their computation from TYMSHARE. In conjunction with
this change, we would like all sites to change their monitor HOST
tables, effective Friday, March 8, 1974.

The net change we wish to accomplish is the following:
1) Site 53 (octal) is OFFICE-1
2) Site 2 is SRI-ARC
3) The nickname for site 2 is ARC (not NIC)
4) The nickname for site 53 is NIC
Please note that now that NIC services are available from
OFFICE-1, they rather than SRI-ARC should be accessed over the
network as "NIC".

To effect this change, each TENEX site's monitor host table should be
updated in the following manner. The actual host name section should
contain the following entries (they may already be present).

CC.(2,SR1-ARC,USER!SERVER!TENEX)
CC.(253,TYMSHARE-TIP,USER!TIP)
CC.(53,OFFICE-1,USER!SERVER!TENEX)
Further, the NICKNAME table should contain the following entries.
The entry for NIC should be changed to refer to site 53 (octal), and
a new entry for ARC should be added. Specifically, they are:

CC.(2,ARC,NICKNAME!SERVER!USER!TENEX)

CC.(53,NIC,NICKNAME!SERVER!USER!TENEX)

Other Network sites, not running TENEX, should make these changes in
a manner consistent with their operating system.

As mentioned above, these changes are effective on March 8. We will
inform all our users to use the nickname NiC in reference to OFFICE-1
as of this date. Thank you for your co-operation.
