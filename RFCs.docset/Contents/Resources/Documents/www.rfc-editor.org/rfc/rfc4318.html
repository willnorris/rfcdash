Abstract

   This memo defines an SMIv2 MIB module for managing the Rapid Spanning
   Tree capability defined by the IEEE P802.1t and P802.1w amendments to
   IEEE Std 802.1D-1998 for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN)
   segments.  The objects in this MIB are defined to apply both to
   transparent bridging and to bridges connected by subnetworks other
   than LAN segments.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed

   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,

   There are concerns that there may be changes made in the 802.1D-2004
   edition that would lead to non-backward-compatible SMI changes for
   802.1t and 802.1w managed objects in the MIB modules.  The Bridge MIB
   working group decided to 'freeze' the technical content of the MIB
   modules at a level that is compatible with the 802.1t and 802.1w

   The objects in the RSTP-MIB supplement those defined in the Bridge
   MIB [<a href="./rfc4188" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>RFC4188</a>].

   The Original BRIDGE-MIB [<a href="./rfc1493" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>RFC1493</a>] has been updated in an SMIv2-
   compliant version [<a href="./rfc4188" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>RFC4188</a>].  Conformance statements have been added
   and some description and reference clauses have been updated.  The
   interpretations of some objects were changed to accommodate IEEE
   802.1t and 802.1w amendments.

   The object dot1dStpPortPathCost32 was added to support IEEE 802.1t,
   and the permissible values of dot1dStpPriority and
   dot1dStpPortPriority have been clarified for bridges supporting IEEE
   802.1t or IEEE 802.1w.  The interpretation of
   dot1dStpTimeSinceTopologyChange has been clarified for bridges
   supporting the RSTP.

   See the updated BRIDGE-MIB [<a href="./rfc4188" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>RFC4188</a>] for details.

   This document was produced on behalf of the Bridge MIB Working Group
   in the Operations and Management area of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force.

   The authors wish to thank the members of the Bridge MIB Working
   Group, especially Alex Ruzin, for their comments and suggestions that
   improved this effort.

   Vivian Ngai and Les Bell were the initial authors of this document,
   and did the bulk of the development work for this document.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Writable objects that could be misused to cause network delays and
   spanning tree instabilities include dot1dStpVersion,
   dot1dStpTxHoldCount, dot1dStpPortProtocolMigration,
   dot1dStpPortAdminEdgePort, and dot1dStpPortAdminPathCost.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4318">RFC 4318</a>                        RSTP MIB                   December 2005</span>


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   dot1dStpVersion could be read by an attacker to identify environments
   containing applications or protocols that are potentially sensitive
   to RSTP mode.

   dot1dStpPortAdminPointToPoint could be used to mislead an access
   control protocol, such as 802.1x, to believe that only one other
   system is attached to a LAN segment and to enable network access
   based on that assumption.  This situation could permit potential
   man-in-the-middle attacks.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="./rfc3410#section-8">[RFC3410], sectionÂ 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
