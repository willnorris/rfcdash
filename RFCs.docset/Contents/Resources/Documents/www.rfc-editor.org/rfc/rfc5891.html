Abstract

   This document is the revised protocol definition for
   Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).  The rationale for changes,
   the relationship to the older specification, and important
   terminology are provided in other documents.  This document specifies
   the protocol mechanism, called Internationalized Domain Names in
   Applications (IDNA), for registering and looking up IDNs in a way
   that does not require changes to the DNS itself.  IDNA is only meant
   for processing domain names, not free text.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5891">RFC 5891</a>                    IDNA2008 Protocol                August 2010</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document supplies the protocol definition for Internationalized
   Domain Names in Applications (IDNA), with the version specified here
   known as IDNA2008.  Essential definitions and terminology for
   understanding this document and a road map of the collection of
   documents that make up IDNA2008 appear in a separate Definitions
   document [<a href="./rfc5890" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Definitions and Document Framework"'>RFC5890</a>].  <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> discusses the relationship between
   this specification and the earlier version of IDNA (referred to here
   as "IDNA2003").  The rationale for these changes, along with
   considerable explanatory material and advice to zone administrators
   who support IDNs, is provided in another document, known informally
   in this series as the "Rationale document" [<a href="./rfc5894" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Background, Explanation, and Rationale"'>RFC5894</a>].

   IDNA works by allowing applications to use certain ASCII [<a href="#ref-ASCII" title='"USA Code for Information Interchange"'>ASCII</a>]
   string labels (beginning with a special prefix) to represent
   non-ASCII name labels.  Lower-layer protocols need not be aware of
   this; therefore, IDNA does not change any infrastructure.  In
   particular, IDNA does not depend on any changes to DNS servers,
   resolvers, or DNS protocol elements, because the ASCII name service
   provided by the existing DNS can be used for IDNA.

   IDNA applies only to a specific subset of DNS labels.  The base DNS
   standards [<a href="./rfc1034" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>RFC1034</a>] [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>] and their various updates specify how
   to combine labels into fully-qualified domain names and parse labels
   out of those names.

   This document describes two separate protocols, one for IDN
   registration (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>) and one for IDN lookup (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>).  These
   two protocols share some terminology, reference data, and operations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   As mentioned above, terminology used as part of the definition of
   IDNA appears in the Definitions document [<a href="./rfc5890" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Definitions and Document Framework"'>RFC5890</a>].  It is worth
   noting that some of this terminology overlaps with, and is consistent
   with, that used in Unicode or other character set standards and the
   DNS.  Readers of this document are assumed to be familiar with the
   associated Definitions document and with the DNS-specific terminology
   in <a href="./rfc1034">RFC 1034</a> [<a href="./rfc1034" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>RFC1034</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5891">RFC 5891</a>                    IDNA2008 Protocol                August 2010</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Requirements%20and%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Requirements and Applicability</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Requirements</span>

   IDNA makes the following requirements:

   1.  Whenever a domain name is put into a domain name slot that is not
       IDNA-aware (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.6">Section 2.3.2.6</a> of the Definitions document
       [<a href="./rfc5890" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Definitions and Document Framework"'>RFC5890</a>]), it MUST contain only ASCII characters (i.e., its
       labels must be either A-labels or NR-LDH labels), unless the DNS
       application is not subject to historical recommendations for
       "hostname"-style names (see <a href="./rfc1034">RFC 1034</a> [<a href="./rfc1034" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>RFC1034</a>] and
       <a href="#section-3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a>).

   2.  Labels MUST be compared using equivalent forms: either both
       A-label forms or both U-label forms.  Because A-labels and
       U-labels can be transformed into each other without loss of
       information, these comparisons are equivalent (however, in
       practice, comparison of U-labels requires first verifying that
       they actually are U-labels and not just Unicode strings).  A pair
       of A-labels MUST be compared as case-insensitive ASCII (as with
       all comparisons of ASCII DNS labels).  U-labels MUST be compared
       as-is, without case folding or other intermediate steps.  While
       it is not necessary to validate labels in order to compare them,
       successful comparison does not imply validity.  In many cases,
       not limited to comparison, validation may be important for other
       reasons and SHOULD be performed.

   3.  Labels being registered MUST conform to the requirements of
       <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  Labels being looked up and the lookup process MUST
       conform to the requirements of <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Applicability</span>

   IDNA applies to all domain names in all domain name slots in
   protocols except where it is explicitly excluded.  It does not apply
   to domain name slots that do not use the LDH syntax rules as
   described in the Definitions document [<a href="./rfc5890" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Definitions and Document Framework"'>RFC5890</a>].

   Because it uses the DNS, IDNA applies to many protocols that were
   specified before it was designed.  IDNs occupying domain name slots
   in those older protocols MUST be in A-label form until and unless
   those protocols and their implementations are explicitly upgraded to
   be aware of IDNs and to accept the U-label form.  IDNs actually
   appearing in DNS queries or responses MUST be A-labels.






<span class="grey">Klensin                      Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5891">RFC 5891</a>                    IDNA2008 Protocol                August 2010</span>


   IDNA-aware protocols and implementations MAY accept U-labels,
   A-labels, or both as those particular protocols specify.  IDNA is not
   defined for extended label types (see <a href="./rfc2671">RFC 2671</a> <a href="./rfc2671#section-3">[RFC2671], Section 3</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.1.%20%20DNS%20Resource%20Records"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1" id="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  DNS Resource Records</span>

   IDNA applies only to domain names in the NAME and RDATA fields of DNS
   resource records whose CLASS is IN.  See the DNS specification
   [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>] for precise definitions of these terms.

   The application of IDNA to DNS resource records depends entirely on
   the CLASS of the record, and not on the TYPE except as noted below.
   This will remain true, even as new TYPEs are defined, unless a new
   TYPE defines TYPE-specific rules.  Special naming conventions for SRV
   records (and "underscore labels" more generally) are incompatible
   with IDNA coding as discussed in the Definitions document [<a href="./rfc5890" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Definitions and Document Framework"'>RFC5890</a>],
   especially <a href="#section-2.3.2.3">Section 2.3.2.3</a>.  Of course, underscore labels may be part
   of a domain that uses IDN labels at higher levels in the tree.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.2.%20%20Non-Domain-Name%20Data%20Types%20Stored%20in%20the%20DNS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.2" id="section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  Non-Domain-Name Data Types Stored in the DNS</span>

   Although IDNA enables the representation of non-ASCII characters in
   domain names, that does not imply that IDNA enables the
   representation of non-ASCII characters in other data types that are
   stored in domain names, specifically in the RDATA field for types
   that have structured RDATA format.  For example, an email address
   local part is stored in a domain name in the RNAME field as part of
   the RDATA of an SOA record (e.g., hostmaster@example.com would be
   represented as hostmaster.example.com).  IDNA does not update the
   existing email standards, which allow only ASCII characters in local
   parts.  Even though work is in progress to define
   internationalization for email addresses [<a href="./rfc4952" title='"Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email"'>RFC4952</a>], changes to the
   email address part of the SOA RDATA would require action in, or
   updates to, other standards, specifically those that specify the
   format of the SOA RR.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Registration%20Protocol"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Registration Protocol</span>

   This section defines the model for registering an IDN.  The model is
   implementation independent; any sequence of steps that produces
   exactly the same result for all labels is considered a valid
   implementation.

   Note that, while the registration (this section) and lookup protocols
   (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>) are very similar in most respects, they are not
   identical, and implementers should carefully follow the steps
   described in this specification.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5891">RFC 5891</a>                    IDNA2008 Protocol                August 2010</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Input%20to%20IDNA%20Registration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Input to IDNA Registration</span>

   Registration processes, especially processing by entities (often
   called "registrars") who deal with registrants before the request
   actually reaches the zone manager ("registry") are outside the scope
   of this definition and may differ significantly depending on local
   needs.  By the time a string enters the IDNA registration process as
   described in this specification, it MUST be in Unicode and in
   Normalization Form C (NFC [<a href="#ref-Unicode-UAX15">Unicode-UAX15</a>]).  Entities responsible for
   zone files ("registries") MUST accept only the exact string for which
   registration is requested, free of any mappings or local adjustments.
   They MAY accept that input in any of three forms:

   1.  As a pair of A-label and U-label.

   2.  As an A-label only.

   3.  As a U-label only.

   The first two of these forms are RECOMMENDED because the use of
   A-labels avoids any possibility of ambiguity.  The first is normally
   preferred over the second because it permits further verification of
   user intent (see <a href="#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Permitted%20Character%20and%20Label%20Validation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Permitted Character and Label Validation</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.1.%20%20Input%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1" id="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Input Format</span>

   If both the U-label and A-label forms are available, the registry
   MUST ensure that the A-label form is in lowercase, perform a
   conversion to a U-label, perform the steps and tests described below
   on that U-label, and then verify that the A-label produced by the
   step in <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a> matches the one provided as input.  In addition,
   the U-label that was provided as input and the one obtained by
   conversion of the A-label MUST match exactly.  If, for some reason,
   these tests fail, the registration MUST be rejected.

   If only an A-label was provided and the conversion to a U-label is
   not performed, the registry MUST still verify that the A-label is
   superficially valid, i.e., that it does not violate any of the rules
   of Punycode encoding [<a href="./rfc3492" title='"Punycode: A Bootstring encoding of Unicode for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)"'>RFC3492</a>] such as the prohibition on trailing
   hyphen-minus, the requirement that all characters be ASCII, and so
   on.  Strings that appear to be A-labels (e.g., they start with
   "xn--") and strings that are supplied to the registry in a context
   reserved for A-labels (such as a field in a form to be filled out),
   but that are not valid A-labels as described in this paragraph, MUST
   NOT be placed in DNS zones that support IDNA.

   If only an A-label is provided, the conversion to a U-label is not
   performed, but the superficial tests described in the previous
   paragraph are performed, registration procedures MAY, and usually

   The candidate Unicode string MUST NOT contain characters that appear

   The proposed label (in the form of a Unicode string, i.e., a string
   that at least superficially appears to be a U-label) is then examined
   using tests that require examination of more than one character.
   Character order is considered to be the on-the-wire order.  That
   order may not be the same as the display order.

   The Unicode string MUST NOT contain any characters whose validity is

   CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO in the Tables document [<a href="./rfc5892" title='"The Unicode Code Points and Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA)"'>RFC5892</a>] MUST have a
   non-null rule.  If such a code point is missing a rule, the label is
   invalid.  If the rule exists but the result of applying the rule is
   negative or inconclusive, the proposed label is invalid.

   Strings that contain at least one non-ASCII character, have been
   produced by the steps above, whose contents pass all of the tests in
   <a href="#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3</a>, and are 63 or fewer characters long in
   ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE) form (see <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>), are U-labels.

   To summarize, tests are made in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> for invalid characters,
   invalid combinations of characters, for labels that are invalid even
   if the characters they contain are valid individually, and for labels
   that do not conform to the restrictions for strings containing
   right-to-left characters.

   In addition to the rules and tests above, there are many reasons why
   a registry could reject a label.  Registries at all levels of the
   DNS, not just the top level, are expected to establish policies about
   label registrations.  Policies are likely to be informed by the local
   languages and the scripts that are used to write them and may depend
   on many factors including what characters are in the label (for
   example, a label may be rejected based on other labels already
   registered).  See the Rationale document <a href="./rfc5894#section-3.2">[RFC5894], Section 3.2</a>, for
   further discussion and recommendations about registry policies.

   The string produced by the steps in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> is checked and
   processed as appropriate to local registry restrictions.  Application
   of those registry restrictions may result in the rejection of some
   labels or the application of special restrictions to others.

   The resulting U-label is converted to an A-label (defined in <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">2.3.2.1</a> of the Definitions document [<a href="./rfc5890" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Definitions and Document Framework"'>RFC5890</a>]).  The A-label is the
   encoding of the U-label according to the Punycode algorithm [<a href="./rfc3492" title='"Punycode: A Bootstring encoding of Unicode for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)"'>RFC3492</a>]
   with the ACE prefix "xn--" added at the beginning of the string.  The
   resulting string must, of course, conform to the length limits
   imposed by the DNS.  This document does not update or alter the
   Punycode algorithm specified in <a href="./rfc3492">RFC 3492</a> in any way.  <a href="./rfc3492">RFC 3492</a> does
   make a non-normative reference to the information about the value and
   construction of the ACE prefix that appears in <a href="./rfc3490">RFC 3490</a> or Nameprep
   [<a href="./rfc3491" title='"Nameprep: A Stringprep Profile for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)"'>RFC3491</a>].  For consistency and reader convenience, IDNA2008
   effectively updates that reference to point to this document.  That
   change does not alter the prefix itself.  The prefix, "xn--", is the
   same in both sets of documents.

   With the exception of the maximum string length test on Punycode
   output, the failure conditions identified in the Punycode encoding
   procedure cannot occur if the input is a U-label as determined by the
   steps in Sections <a href="#section-4.1">4.1</a> through <a href="#section-4.3">4.3</a> above.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.5.%20%20Insertion%20in%20the%20Zone"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" id="section-4.5">4.5</a>.  Insertion in the Zone</span>

   The label is registered in the DNS by inserting the A-label into a
   zone.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Domain%20Name%20Lookup%20Protocol"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Domain Name Lookup Protocol</span>

   Lookup is different from registration and different tests are applied
   on the client.  Although some validity checks are necessary to avoid
   serious problems with the protocol, the lookup-side tests are more
   permissive and rely on the assumption that names that are present in
   the DNS are valid.  That assumption is, however, a weak one because
   the presence of wildcards in the DNS might cause a string that is not
   actually registered in the DNS to be successfully looked up.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Label%20String%20Input"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Label String Input</span>

   The user supplies a string in the local character set, for example,
   by typing it, clicking on it, or copying and pasting it from a
   resource identifier, e.g., a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>] or an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)
   [<a href="./rfc3987" title='"Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)"'>RFC3987</a>], from which the domain name is extracted.  Alternately,
   some process not directly involving the user may read the string from
   a file or obtain it in some other way.  Processing in this step and
   the one specified in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a> are local matters, to be
   accomplished prior to actual invocation of IDNA.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Conversion%20to%20Unicode"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Conversion to Unicode</span>

   The string is converted from the local character set into Unicode, if
   it is not already in Unicode.  Depending on local needs, this
   conversion may involve mapping some characters into other characters
   as well as coding conversions.  Those issues are discussed in the
   mapping-related sections (Sections <a href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>, <a href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>, <a href="#section-6">6</a>, and <a href="#section-7.3">7.3</a>) of the
   Rationale document [<a href="./rfc5894" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Background, Explanation, and Rationale"'>RFC5894</a>] and in the separate Mapping document
   [<a href="#ref-IDNA2008-Mapping">IDNA2008-Mapping</a>].  The result MUST be a Unicode string in NFC form.

   If the input to this procedure appears to be an A-label (i.e., it
   starts in "xn--", interpreted case-insensitively), the lookup
   application MAY attempt to convert it to a U-label, first ensuring
   that the A-label is entirely in lowercase (converting it to lowercase

   if necessary), and apply the tests of <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a> and the conversion
   of <a href="#section-5.5">Section 5.5</a> to that form.  If the label is converted to Unicode
   (i.e., to U-label form) using the Punycode decoding algorithm, then
   the processing specified in those two sections MUST be performed, and
   the label MUST be rejected if the resulting label is not identical to
   the original.  See <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a> of the Rationale document [<a href="./rfc5894" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Background, Explanation, and Rationale"'>RFC5894</a>]
   for additional discussion on this topic.

   Conversion from the A-label and testing that the result is a U-label
   SHOULD be performed if the domain name will later be presented to the
   user in native character form (this requires that the lookup
   application be IDNA-aware).  If those steps are not performed, the
   lookup process SHOULD at least test to determine that the string is
   actually an A-label, examining it for the invalid formats specified
   in the Punycode decoding specification.  Applications that are not
   IDNA-aware will obviously omit that testing; others MAY treat the
   string as opaque to avoid the additional processing at the expense of
   providing less protection and information to users.

   As with the registration procedure described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>, the
   Unicode string is checked to verify that all characters that appear
   in it are valid as input to IDNA lookup processing.  As discussed
   above and in the Rationale document [<a href="./rfc5894" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Background, Explanation, and Rationale"'>RFC5894</a>], the lookup check is
   more liberal than the registration one.  Labels that have not been
   fully evaluated for conformance to the applicable rules are referred
   to as "putative" labels as discussed in <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a> of the
   Definitions document [<a href="./rfc5890" title='"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Definitions and Document Framework"'>RFC5890</a>].  Putative U-labels with any of the
   following characteristics MUST be rejected prior to DNS lookup:

   o  Labels that are not in NFC [<a href="#ref-Unicode-UAX15">Unicode-UAX15</a>].

   o  Labels containing "--" (two consecutive hyphens) in the third and
      fourth character positions.

   o  Labels whose first character is a combining mark (see The Unicode
      Standard, <a href="#section-2.11">Section 2.11</a> [<a href="#ref-Unicode" title='"The Unicode Standard, Version 5.0"'>Unicode</a>]).

   o  Labels containing prohibited code points, i.e., those that are
      assigned to the "DISALLOWED" category of the Tables document
      [<a href="./rfc5892" title='"The Unicode Code Points and Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA)"'>RFC5892</a>].

   o  Labels containing code points that are identified in the Tables
      document as "CONTEXTJ", i.e., requiring exceptional contextual
      rule processing on lookup, but that do not conform to those rules.
      Note that this implies that a rule must be defined, not null: a

      character that requires a contextual rule but for which the rule
      is null is treated in this step as having failed to conform to the
      rule.

   o  Labels containing code points that are identified in the Tables
      document as "CONTEXTO", but for which no such rule appears in the
      table of rules.  Applications resolving DNS names or carrying out
      equivalent operations are not required to test contextual rules
      for "CONTEXTO" characters, only to verify that a rule is defined
      (although they MAY make such tests to provide better protection or
      give better information to the user).

   o  Labels containing code points that are unassigned in the version
      of Unicode being used by the application, i.e., in the UNASSIGNED
      category of the Tables document.

      This requirement means that the application must use a list of
      unassigned characters that is matched to the version of Unicode
      that is being used for the other requirements in this section.  It
      is not required that the application know which version of Unicode
      is being used; that information might be part of the operating
      environment in which the application is running.

   In addition, the application SHOULD apply the following test.

   o  Verification that the string is compliant with the requirements
      for right-to-left characters specified in the Bidi document
      [<a href="./rfc5893" title='"Right-to-Left Scripts for Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA)"'>RFC5893</a>].

   This test may be omitted in special circumstances, such as when the
   lookup application knows that the conditions are enforced elsewhere,
   because an attempt to look up and resolve such strings will almost
   certainly lead to a DNS lookup failure except when wildcards are
   present in the zone.  However, applying the test is likely to give
   much better information about the reason for a lookup failure --
   information that may be usefully passed to the user when that is
   feasible -- than DNS resolution failure information alone.

   For all other strings, the lookup application MUST rely on the
   presence or absence of labels in the DNS to determine the validity of
   those labels and the validity of the characters they contain.  If
   they are registered, they are presumed to be valid; if they are not,
   their possible validity is not relevant.  While a lookup application
   may reasonably issue warnings about strings it believes may be
   problematic, applications that decline to process a string that
   conforms to the rules above (i.e., does not look it up in the DNS)
   are not in conformance with this protocol.

   The A-label resulting from the conversion in <a href="#section-5.5">Section 5.5</a> or supplied
   directly (see <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>) is combined with other labels as needed to

   In order to avoid intentional or accidental attacks from labels that

   1.   Update base character set from Unicode 3.2 to Unicode version
        agnostic.

   2.   Separate the definitions for the "registration" and "lookup"
        activities.

   3.   Disallow symbol and punctuation characters except where special
        exceptions are necessary.

   4.   Remove the mapping and normalization steps from the protocol and
        have them, instead, done by the applications themselves,
        possibly in a local fashion, before invoking the protocol.

   5.   Change the way that the protocol specifies which characters are
        allowed in labels from "humans decide what the table of code
        points contains" to "decision about code points are based on
        Unicode properties plus a small exclusion list created by
        humans".

   6.   Introduce the new concept of characters that can be used only in
        specific contexts.

   7.   Allow typical words and names in languages such as Dhivehi and
        Yiddish to be expressed.

   8.   Make bidirectional domain names (delimited strings of labels,
        not just labels standing on their own) display in a less
        surprising fashion, whether they appear in obvious domain name
        contexts or as part of running text in paragraphs.

   9.   Remove the dot separator from the mandatory part of the
        protocol.

   10.  Make some currently valid labels that are not actually IDNA
        labels invalid.
