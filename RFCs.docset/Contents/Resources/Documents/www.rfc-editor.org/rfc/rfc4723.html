Abstract

   The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Association of
   Musical Electronics Industry (AMEI) have produced the Mobile XMF
   standard, which was developed particularly for mobile MIDI
   applications.  Mobile XMF is a very compact media type providing
   high-quality synthetic audio content for music downloading and
   messaging applications that require MIME registration.  This document
   registers the media type audio/mobile-xmf.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   MIDI content is used commonly in the Internet.  Typically, MIDI data
   is stored in the Standard MIDI File (SMF) format [<a href="#ref-8" title="In 'The Complete MIDI 1.0 Detailed Specification">8</a>].  This MIME type
   registration uses the Mobile XMF file format for the encapsulation of
   SP-MIDI [<a href="#ref-3" title="CA">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4" title="The MIDI Manufacturers Association">4</a>] and Mobile DLS (Downloadable Sounds) [<a href="#ref-2" title="CA">2</a>] data.

   The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Association of
   Musical Electronics Industry (AMEI) have produced the Mobile XMF
   standard [<a href="#ref-1" title="CA">1</a>], which was developed particularly for mobile MIDI [<a href="#ref-7" title="In 'The Complete MIDI 1.0 Detailed Specification">7</a>]
   applications.

   Type name: audio

   Subtype name: mobile-xmf

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:

      revision: Mobile XMF file type revision ID

         revision is the Mobile XMF file type revision ID number from
         the XmfFileTypeRevisionID field of the XMF Meta File format
         2.00. revision is encoded in hex in US-ASCII.

      prl: Playback resource list

         prl contains the playback resources included in all Content
         Description MetaDataItems of the Mobile XMF file.  prl contains
         two-digit hexadecimal numbers representing data bytes from the
         Content Description Meta Data.  Each resource is listed exactly
         once.  A playback resource contains two parts: a prefix and
         data.  prl is a sequence of two-digit hexadecimal numbers
         encoded in US-ASCII.  Thus, prl has an even number of
         hexadecimal digits.

         Example: If the file includes Playback Resource Lists such as
         [00h 01h 00h 02h] and [00h 01h 00h 03h], the corresponding prl
         is 000100020003 containing playback resources 01, 02, and 03
         each with the prefix 00.

      minimum-pr: Minimum playback requirements

         minimum-pr contains the Maximum Instantaneous Resource (MIR)
         values from the first row of all MIR Count Tables corresponding
         to the playback resources listed in prl.  Only the largest
         value from the values of the same resource is chosen.
         minimum-prl is a sequence of two-digit hexadecimal numbers
         encoded in US-ASCII.  Thus, minimum-prl has an even number of
         hexadecimal digits.

         minimum-pr requires the use of prl, and the values in
         minimum-pr must be in the same order as the resources in prl.
         minimum-pr is the more important of minimum-pr and total-pr,
         because it defines the minimum playback requirements.

         Example: If the file includes the first rows of MIR Count
         Tables such as [02h 00h] and [01h 01h] corresponding to the
         above Playback Resource Lists, the corresponding minimum-pr is
         020001.  (02 is the largest of 2 and 1, 00 is the largest of 0,
         and 01 is the largest of 1.)

      total-pr: Total playback requirements

         total-pr contains the MIR values from the last row of all MIR
         Count Tables corresponding to the playback resources listed in
         prl.  Only the largest value from the values of the same
         resource is chosen.  total-pr is a sequence of two-digit
         hexadecimal numbers encoded in US-ASCII.  Thus, total-pr has an
         even number of hexadecimal digits.

         total-pr requires the use of prl, and the values in total-pr
         must be in the same order as the resources in prl.

         Example: If the file includes the last rows of MIR Count Tables
         such as [05h 02h] and [06h 01h] corresponding to the above
         Playback Resource Lists, the corresponding total-pr is 060201.
         (06 is the largest of 5 and 6, 02 is the largest of 2, and 01
         is the largest of 1.)

   Encoding considerations:

      mobile-xmf data is binary data and must be encoded for non-binary
      transport; Base64 [<a href="#ref-9" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>9</a>] is suitable for Email.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4723">RFC 4723</a>                    Mobile XMF MIME                December 2006</span>


   Security considerations:

      Many synthetic audio compositions have associated intellectual
      property rights.  It is conceivable that the rights owners of
      mobile-xmf content will want to protect their rights by applying
      security mechanisms that prohibit the rendering of the content
      without a legally acquired license to do so.  These mechanisms
      would be applied externally to the Content-Type defined here;
      mobile-xmf content itself is not encrypted internally.  mobile-xmf
      streams do not contain executable content.  Mobile XMF players are
      robust against corrupted mobile-xmf content, because Mobile XMF
      players ignore unidentified content.  prl, minimum-pr, and
      total-pr parameters can be used to represent Mobile DLS playback
      memory requirements for protecting against the excessive usage of
      playback memory.

   Interoperability considerations:

      Mobile XMF is a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
      specification developed by MMA and AMEI.  Mobile XMF is based on
      the XMF Meta File Format Specification v2.00 [<a href="#ref-5" title="USA">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6" title="RP-043">6</a>], which
      standardizes a meta file format for the electronic distribution of
      music.  mobile-xmf data is stored in XMF file format [<a href="#ref-5" title="USA">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6" title="RP-043">6</a>].

   Published specification:

      Mobile XMF Content Format Specification, MMA specification v1.0.,
        RP-42, Los Angeles, CA, USA.  2004.

      Specification is available from:
        <a href="http://www.midi.org/about-midi/specshome.shtml">http://www.midi.org/about-midi/specshome.shtml</a>

   Applications which use this media type:

      mobile-xmf is a synthetic audio format for the flexible
      presentation of SP-MIDI and Mobile DLS instrument data on a wide
      range of playback devices, particularly portable appliances such
      as mobile phones, PDAs, and palmtop computers.
