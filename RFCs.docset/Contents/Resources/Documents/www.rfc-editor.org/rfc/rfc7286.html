     <span class="h1">Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Server Discovery</span>

Abstract

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
   resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an
   ALTO client can ask for guidance, it needs to discover one or more
   ALTO servers.

   This document specifies a procedure for resource-consumer-initiated
   ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is
   embedded in the resource consumer.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
   resource [<a href="./rfc5693" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement"'>RFC5693</a>].  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol;
   see requirement AR-1 in [<a href="./rfc6708" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Requirements"'>RFC6708</a>].  Before an ALTO client can ask for
   guidance it needs to discover one or more ALTO servers that can
   provide guidance to this specific client.

   This document specifies a procedure for resource-consumer-initiated
   ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is
   embedded in the resource consumer.  In other words, this document
   meets requirement AR-32 in [<a href="./rfc6708" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Requirements"'>RFC6708</a>] while AR-33 is out of scope.  A
   different approach, which tries to meet requirement AR-33, i.e.,
   third-party ALTO server discovery, is addressed in [<a href="#ref-3PDISC" title='"Third-Party ALTO Server Discovery (3pdisc)"'>3PDISC</a>].

   A more detailed discussion of various options on where to place the
   functional entities comprising the overall ALTO architecture can be
   found in [<a href="#ref-ALTO-DEPLOY">ALTO-DEPLOY</a>].

   The ALTO protocol specification [<a href="./rfc7285" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol"'>RFC7285</a>] is based on HTTP and
   expects the discovery procedure to yield the HTTP(S) URI of an ALTO
   server's Information Resource Directory (IRD).  Therefore, this
   procedure is based on a combination of the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) or local configuration and URI-enabled Naming
   Authority Pointer (U-NAPTR) resource records in the Domain Name
   System (DNS), in order to deliver such URIs.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Terminology%20and%20Requirements%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology and Requirements Language</span>

   This document makes use of the ALTO terminology defined in [<a href="./rfc5693" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement"'>RFC5693</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20ALTO%20Server%20Discovery%20Procedure%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  ALTO Server Discovery Procedure Overview</span>

   The ALTO protocol specification [<a href="./rfc7285" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol"'>RFC7285</a>] expects that the ALTO
   discovery procedure yields the HTTP(S) URI [<a href="./rfc7230" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>] of the ALTO
   server's Information Resource Directory (IRD), which gives further
   information about the capabilities and services provided by that ALTO
   server.

   On hosts with more than one interface or address family (IPv4/v6),
   the ALTO server discovery procedure has to be run for every interface
   and address family.  For more details see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.



<span class="grey">Kiesel, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7286">RFC 7286</a>                  ALTO Server Discovery            November 2014</span>


   The ALTO server discovery procedure is performed in two steps:

   1.  One DNS domain name is retrieved for each combination of
       interface and address family, either by local configuration
       (e.g., manual input into a menu or configuration file) or by
       means of DHCP.

   2.  These DNS domain names are used for U-NAPTR lookups yielding one
       or more URIs.  Further DNS lookups may be necessary to determine
       the ALTO server's IP address(es).

   The primary means for retrieving the DNS domain name is DHCP.
   However, there may be situations where DHCP is not available or does
   not return a suitable value.  Furthermore, there might be situations
   in which the user wishes to override the value that could be
   retrieved from DHCP.  In these situations, local configuration may be
   used.  Consequently, the algorithm first checks for a locally
   configured override, before it tries to retrieve a value from DHCP.

   Typically, but not necessarily, the DNS domain name is the domain
   name in which the client is located, i.e., a PTR lookup on the
   client's IP address (according to <a href="./rfc1035#section-3.5">[RFC1035], Section 3.5</a> for IPv4 or
   <a href="./rfc3596#section-2.5">[RFC3596], Section 2.5</a> for IPv6) would yield a similar name.
   However, due to the widespread use of Network Address Translation
   (NAT), trying to determine the DNS domain name through a PTR lookup
   on an interface's IP address is not recommended for resource consumer
   initiated ALTO server discovery (see also [<a href="./rfc3424" title='"IAB Considerations for UNilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF) Across Network Address Translation"'>RFC3424</a>]).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20ALTO%20Server%20Discovery%20Procedure%20Specification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  ALTO Server Discovery Procedure Specification</span>

   As already outlined in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, the ALTO server discovery procedure
   is performed for every address family on every interface the
   application considers for communicating with resource providers.

   First, the algorithm checks for a locally configured domain name, as
   specified in <a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a>.  If no such name was configured, it tries
   to retrieve one from DHCP, as specified in <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a>.  If still
   no domain name could be found, the procedure has failed and
   terminates with an appropriate error code.

   If one or more domain names were found, they will be used as U-NAPTR/
   DDDS (URI-Enabled NAPTR/Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service)
   [<a href="./rfc4848" title='"Domain-Based Application Service Location Using URIs and the Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS)"'>RFC4848</a>] application-unique strings for a DNS lookup, as specified
   in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Step%201%3A%20Retrieving%20the%20Domain%20Name"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Step 1: Retrieving the Domain Name</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.1.%20%20Step%201%2C%20Option%201%3A%20Local%20Configuration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" id="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Step 1, Option 1: Local Configuration</span>

   The preferred way to acquire a domain name related to an interface's
   point of network attachment is the use of DHCP (see <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a>).
   However, in some network deployment scenarios, there is no DHCP
   server available.  Furthermore, a user may want to use an ALTO
   service instance provided by an entity that is not the operator of
   the underlying IP network.  Therefore, we allow the user to specify a
   DNS domain name, for example, in a configuration file option.  An
   example domain name is:

      my-alternative-alto-provider.example.org

   Implementations MAY give the user the opportunity (e.g., by means of
   configuration file options or menu items) to specify an individual
   domain name for every address family on every interface.
   Implementations SHOULD allow the user to specify a default name that
   is used if no more specific name has been configured.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.2.%20%20Step%201%2C%20Option%202%3A%20DHCP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2" id="section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Step 1, Option 2: DHCP</span>

   Network operators may provide the domain name to be used for service
   discovery within an access network using DHCP.

   <a href="./rfc5986">RFC 5986</a> [<a href="./rfc5986" title='"Discovering the Local Location Information Server (LIS)"'>RFC5986</a>] defines DHCP IPv4 and IPv6 access network domain
   name options to identify a domain name that is suitable for service
   discovery within the access network.  <a href="./rfc2132">RFC 2132</a> [<a href="./rfc2132" title='"DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions"'>RFC2132</a>] defines the
   DHCP IPv4 domain name option.  While this option is less suitable, it
   still may be useful if the <a href="./rfc5986">RFC 5986</a> option is not available.

   For IPv6, the ALTO server discovery procedure MUST try to retrieve
   DHCP option 57 (OPTION_V6_ACCESS_DOMAIN).  If no such option can be
   retrieved the procedure fails for this interface.  For IPv4, the ALTO
   server discovery procedure MUST try to retrieve DHCP option 213
   (OPTION_V4_ACCESS_DOMAIN).  If no such option can be retrieved, the
   procedure SHOULD try to retrieve option 15 (Domain Name).  If neither
   option can be retrieved, the procedure fails for this interface.  If
   a result can be retrieved, it will be used as an input for the next
   step (U-NAPTR resolution).  One example result could be:

      example.net

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Step%202%3A%20U-NAPTR%20Resolution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Step 2: U-NAPTR Resolution</span>

   The first step of the ALTO server discovery procedure (see
   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) retrieved one or -- in case of multiple interfaces and/
   or IPv4/v6 dual-stack operation -- several domain names, which will
   be used as U-NAPTR/DDDS (URI-Enabled NAPTR/Dynamic Delegation
   Discovery Service) [<a href="./rfc4848" title='"Domain-Based Application Service Location Using URIs and the Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS)"'>RFC4848</a>] application unique strings.  An example
   is:

      example.net

   In the second step, the ALTO server discovery procedure uses a
   U-NAPTR [<a href="./rfc4848" title='"Domain-Based Application Service Location Using URIs and the Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS)"'>RFC4848</a>] lookup with the "ALTO" Application Service Tag and
   either the "http" or the "https" Application Protocol Tag to obtain
   one or more URIs (indicating protocol, host, and possibly path
   elements) for the ALTO server's Information Resource Directory.  In
   this document, only the HTTP and HTTPS URI schemes are defined, as
   the ALTO protocol specification defines the access over both
   protocols, but no other [<a href="./rfc7285" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol"'>RFC7285</a>].  Note that the result can be any
   valid HTTP(S) URI.

   The following two U-NAPTR resource records can be used for mapping
   "example.net" to the HTTPS URIs "https://alto1.example.net/ird" and
   "https://alto2.example.net/ird", with the former being preferred.

       example.net.

       IN NAPTR 100  10   "u"    "ALTO:https"
            "!.*!https://alto1.example.net/ird!"  ""

       IN NAPTR 100  20   "u"    "ALTO:https"
            "!.*!https://alto2.example.net/ird!"  ""


   If no ALTO-specific U-NAPTR records can be retrieved, the discovery
   procedure fails for this domain name (and the corresponding interface
   and IP protocol version).  If further domain names retrieved by Step
   1 are known, the discovery procedure may perform the corresponding
   U-NAPTR lookups immediately.  However, before retrying a lookup that
   has failed, a client MUST wait a time period that is appropriate for
   the encountered error (NXDOMAIN, timeout, etc.).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Deployment%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Deployment Considerations</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Issues%20with%20Home%20Gateways"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Issues with Home Gateways</span>

   <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a> describes the usage of a DHCP option that provides a
   means for the network operator of the network in which the ALTO
   client is located to provide a DNS domain name.  However, this
   assumes that this particular DHCP option is correctly passed from the
   DHCP server to the actual host with the ALTO client, and that the
   particular host understands this DHCP option.  This memo assumes the
   client to be able to understand the proposed DHCP option; otherwise,
   there is no further use of the DHCP option, but the client has to use
   the other proposed mechanisms.

   There are well-known issues with the handling of DHCP options in home
   gateways.  One issue is that unknown DHCP options are not passed
   through some home gateways, effectively eliminating the DHCP option.

   Another well-known issue is the use of home-gateway-specific DNS
   domain names that "override" the DNS domain name provided by the
   network operator.  For instance, a host behind a home gateway may
   receive a DNS domain name ".local" instead of "example.net".  In
   general, this domain name is not usable for the server discovery
   procedure, unless a DNS server in the home gateway resolves the
   corresponding NAPTR lookup correctly, e.g., by means of a DNS split
   horizon approach.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Issues%20with%20Multihoming%2C%20Mobility%2C%20and%20Changing%20IP%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Issues with Multihoming, Mobility, and Changing IP Addresses</span>

   If the user decides to enter only one (default) DNS domain name in
   the local configuration facility (see <a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a>), only one set of
   ALTO servers will be discovered, irrespective of multihoming and
   mobility.  Particularly in mobile scenarios, this can lead to
   undesirable results.

   The DHCP-based discovery method can discover different sets of ALTO
   servers for each interface and address family (i.e., IPv4/v6).  In
   general, if a client wishes to communicate using one of its
   interfaces and using a specific IP address family, it SHOULD query
   the ALTO server or servers that have been discovered for this
   specific interface and address family.  How to select an interface
   and IP address family as well as how to compare results returned from

   A change of the IP address at an interface invalidates the result of
   the ALTO server discovery procedure.  For instance, if the IP address
   assigned to a mobile host changes due to host mobility, it is
   required to re-run the ALTO server discovery procedure without
   relying on earlier gained information.

   There are several challenges with DNS on hosts with multiple
   interfaces [<a href="./rfc6418" title='"Multiple Interfaces and Provisioning Domains Problem Statement"'>RFC6418</a>], which can affect the ALTO server discovery.  If
   the DNS resolution is performed on the wrong interface, it can return
   an ALTO server that could provide suboptimal or wrong guidance.
   Finding the best ALTO server for multi-interfaced hosts is outside
   the scope of this document.

   When using Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections, there is
   usually no DHCP.  The user has to enter the DNS domain name in the
   local configuration facility.  For good optimization results, a DNS
   domain name corresponding to the VPN concentrator, not corresponding
   to the user's current location, has to be entered.  Similar
   considerations apply for Mobile IP.

   A high-level discussion of security issues related to ALTO is part of
   the ALTO problem statement [<a href="./rfc5693" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement"'>RFC5693</a>].  A classification of unwanted
   information disclosure risks, as well as specific security-related
   requirements can be found in the ALTO requirements document
   [<a href="./rfc6708" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Requirements"'>RFC6708</a>].

   The remainder of this section focuses on security threats and
   protection mechanisms for the ALTO server discovery procedure as
   such.  Once the ALTO server's URI has been discovered and the
   communication between the ALTO client and the ALTO server starts, the
   security threats and protection mechanisms discussed in the ALTO
   protocol specification [<a href="./rfc7285" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol"'>RFC7285</a>] apply.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20Integrity%20of%20the%20ALTO%20Server%27s%20URI"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Integrity of the ALTO Server's URI</span>

   Scenario Description
      An attacker could compromise the ALTO server discovery procedure
      or infrastructure in a way that ALTO clients would discover a
      "wrong" ALTO server URI.

   Threat Discussion
      This is probably the most serious security concern related to ALTO
      server discovery.  The discovered "wrong" ALTO server might not be
      able to give guidance to a given ALTO client at all, or it might
      give suboptimal or forged information.  In the latter case, an
      attacker could try to use ALTO to affect the traffic distribution
      in the network or the performance of applications (see also
      <a href="./rfc7285#section-15.1">Section 15.1. of [RFC7285]</a>).  Furthermore, a hostile ALTO server
      could threaten user privacy (see also <a href="#section-5.2.1">Section 5.2.1</a>, case (5a) in
      [<a href="./rfc6708" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Requirements"'>RFC6708</a>]).

      However, it should also be noted that, if an attacker was able to
      compromise DHCP and/or DNS servers used for ALTO server discovery
      (see below), (s)he could also launch significantly more serious
      other attacks (e.g., redirecting various application protocols).



<span class="grey">Kiesel, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 9]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7286">RFC 7286</a>                  ALTO Server Discovery            November 2014</span>


   Protection Strategies and Mechanisms
      The ALTO server discovery procedure consists of three building
      blocks (local configuration, DHCP, and DNS) and each of them is a
      possible attack vector.

      The problem of users possibly following "bad advice" that tricks
      them into manually configuring unsuitable ALTO servers cannot be
      solved by technical means and is out of the scope of this
      document.

      Due to the nature of the protocol, DHCP is rather prone to
      attacks.  As already mentioned, an attacker that is able to inject
      forged DHCP replies into the network may do significantly more
      harm than only configuring a wrong ALTO server.  Best current
      practices for safely operating DHCP should be followed.

      A further threat is the possible alteration of the DNS records
      used in U-NAPTR resolution.  If an attacker was able to modify or
      spoof any of the DNS records used in the DDDS resolution, this URI
      could be replaced by a forged URI.  The application of DNS
      security (DNSSEC) [<a href="./rfc4033" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>] provides a means to limit attacks that
      rely on modification of the DNS records used in U-NAPTR
      resolution.  Security considerations specific to U-NAPTR are
      described in more detail in [<a href="./rfc4848" title='"Domain-Based Application Service Location Using URIs and the Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS)"'>RFC4848</a>].

      A related risk is the impersonation of the ALTO server (i.e.,
      attacks after the correct URI has been discovered).  This threat
      and protection strategies are discussed in <a href="./rfc7285#section-15.1">Section 15.1 of
      [RFC7285]</a>.  Note that if Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to
      protect ALTO, the server certificate will contain the host name
      (CN).  Consequently, only the host part of the HTTPS URI will be
      authenticated, i.e., the result of the ALTO server discovery
      procedure.  The U-NAPTR based mapping within the ALTO server
      discovery procedure needs to be secured as described above, e.g.,
      by using DNSSEC.

      In addition to active protection mechanisms, users and network
      operators can monitor application performance and network traffic
      patterns for poor performance or abnormalities.  If it turns out
      that relying on the guidance of a specific ALTO server does not
      result in better-than-random outcomes, the use of the ALTO server
      may be discontinued (see also <a href="./rfc7285#section-15.2">Section 15.2 of [RFC7285]</a>).

   Scenario Description
      An attacker could compromise the ALTO server discovery procedure
      or infrastructure in a way that ALTO clients would not be able to
      discover any ALTO server.

   Threat Discussion
      If no ALTO server can be discovered (although a suitable one
      exists), applications have to make their decisions without ALTO
      guidance.  As ALTO could be temporarily unavailable for many
      reasons, applications must be prepared to do so.  However, the
      resulting application performance and traffic distribution will
      correspond to a deployment scenario without ALTO.

   Protection Strategies and Mechanisms
      Operators should follow best current practices to secure their
      DHCP, DNS, and ALTO (see <a href="./rfc7285#section-15.5">Section 15.5 of [RFC7285]</a>) servers
      against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.3.%20%20Confidentiality%20of%20the%20ALTO%20Server%27s%20URI"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" id="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Confidentiality of the ALTO Server's URI</span>

   Scenario Description
      An unauthorized party could invoke the ALTO server discovery
      procedure, or intercept discovery messages between an authorized
      ALTO client and the DHCP and DNS servers, in order to acquire
      knowledge of the ALTO server's URI.

   Threat Discussion

      In the ALTO use cases that have been described in the ALTO problem
      statement [<a href="./rfc5693" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement"'>RFC5693</a>] and/or discussed in the ALTO working group,
      the ALTO server's URI as such has always been considered as public
      information that does not need protection of confidentiality.

   Protection Strategies and Mechanisms
      No protection mechanisms for this scenario have been provided, as
      it has not been identified as a relevant threat.  However, if a
      new use case is identified that requires this kind of protection,
      the suitability of this ALTO server discovery procedure as well as
      possible security extensions have to be re-evaluated thoroughly.

   Scenario Description
      An unauthorized party could intercept discovery messages between
      an ALTO client and the DHCP and DNS servers, and thereby find out
      the fact that said ALTO client uses (or at least tries to use) the
      ALTO service.

   Threat Discussion
      In the ALTO use cases that have been described in the ALTO problem
      statement [<a href="./rfc5693" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement"'>RFC5693</a>] and/or discussed in the ALTO working group,
      this scenario has not been identified as a relevant threat.

   Protection Strategies and Mechanisms
      No protection mechanisms for this scenario have been provided, as
      it has not been identified as a relevant threat.  However, if a
      new use case is identified that requires this kind of protection,
      the suitability of this ALTO server discovery procedure as well as
      possible security extensions have to be re-evaluated thoroughly.
