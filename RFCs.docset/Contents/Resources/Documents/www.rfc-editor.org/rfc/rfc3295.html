   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for the General Switch
   Management Protocol (GSMP).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20The%20SNMP%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. The SNMP Management Framework</span>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   *  An overall architecture, described in <a href="./rfc2571">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="./rfc2571" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].

   *  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and is described in
      STD 16, <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="./rfc1155" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>RFC1155</a>], STD 16, <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="./rfc1212" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>RFC1212</a>], and <a href="./rfc1215">RFC</a>
      <a href="./rfc1215">1215</a> [<a href="./rfc1215" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>RFC1215</a>].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in
      STD 58, <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>], and <a href="./rfc2580">RFC</a>
      <a href="./rfc2580">2580</a>[<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

   *  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and is
      described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="./rfc1157" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>].  A second version of the
      SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and is described in <a href="./rfc1901">RFC 1901</a> [<a href="./rfc1901" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>RFC1901</a>]
      and <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="./rfc1906" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>].  The third version of the message protocol
      is called SNMPv3 and is described in <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="./rfc1906" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>], <a href="./rfc2572">RFC 2572</a>
      [<a href="./rfc2572" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2572</a>], and <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="./rfc2574" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2574</a>].

   *  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats are
      described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="./rfc1157" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>].  A second set of
      operations and associated PDU formats are described in 1905
      [<a href="./rfc1905" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1905</a>].

   can be found in <a href="./rfc2570">RFC 2570</a> [<a href="./rfc2570" title='"Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC2570</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for the use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for the
   General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP), as defined in [<a href="./rfc3292" title='"General Switch Management Protocol V3"'>RFC3292</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a> Overview</span>

   The General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP) is a general purpose
   protocol to control a label switch.  GSMP allows a controller to
   establish and release connections across the switch, to manage switch
   ports and to request configuration information or statistics.  It
   also allows the switch to inform the controller of asynchronous
   events such as a link going down.

   The GSMP protocol is asymmetric, the controller being the master and
   the switch being the slave.  Multiple switches may be controlled by a
   single controller using multiple instantiations of the protocol over
   separate control connections.  Also a switch may be controlled by
   more than one controller by using the technique of partitioning.

   Each instance of a (switch controller, switch partition) adjacency is
   a session between one switch controller entity and one switch entity.
   The MIB provides objects to configure/setup these entities to form
   the GSMP sessions.  It also provide objects to monitor these GSMP
   sessions.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3295">RFC 3295</a>                        GSMP MIB                       June 2002</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a> Scope</span>

   The GSMP mib is a protocol mib.  It contains objects to configure,
   monitor, and maintain the GSMP protocol entity.  It does not provide
   any information learned via the protocol, such as "all ports config"
   information.

   The relationships between virtual entities, such as Virtual Switch
   Entities, and "physical" entities, such as Switch Entities, falls
   outside of the management of GSMP.  This also applies for the
   management of switch partitions.  So this is excluded from the GSMP
   mib.

   It is possible to configure which, and how many Switch Controllers
   are controlling one Switch since every potential session with the
   switch has to be represented with an Switch entity.  It is, however,
   not possible to define that one Switch Controller shouldn't allow
   other Switch controllers to control the same switch or partition on
   the switch.  It is assumed that there are mechanisms that synchronise
   controllers and the configuration of them.  This is outside the scope
   of this mib.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3%20MIB%20guideline"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a> MIB guideline</span>

   Two tables are used to configure potential GSMP sessions depending if
   you are acting as a GSMP switch controller or a GSMP switch.  Each
   row in these tables initiates a GSMP session.

   The entity ID is a 48-bit name that is unique within the operational
   context of the device.  A 48-bit IEEE 802 MAC address, if available,
   MAY be used for the entity ID.  If the Ethernet encapsulation is
   used, the entity ID MUST be the IEEE 802 MAC address of the interface
   on which the GSMP session is to be setup.

   First, the encapsulation of the potential GSMP session shall be
   defined.  If ATM is used, a row in the gsmpAtmEncapTable has to be
   created with the index set to the entity ID.  The specified resources
   should be allocated to GSMP.  If TCP/IP is used, a row in the
   gsmpTcpIpEncapTable has to be created with the index set to the
   entity ID.  The specified port shall be allocated to GSMP.  No
   special action is needed if ethernet encapsulation is used.

   Then the entity information shall be defined.  To create a Switch
   Entity, an entry in the gsmpSwitchTable is created with the index set
   to the entity ID.  To create a Switch Controller Entity, an entry in
   the gsmpControllerTable is created with the index set to the entity
   ID.




<span class="grey">Sjostrand, et. al.          Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3295">RFC 3295</a>                        GSMP MIB                       June 2002</span>


   When the row status of the GsmpControllerEntry or GsmpSwitchEntry is
   set to active (e.g., in the case with ATM or TCP/IP there are active
   rows with a corresponding entity ID), the adjacency protocol of GSMP
   is started.

   Another table, the gsmpSessionTable, shows the actual sessions that
   are established or are in the process of being established.  Each row
   represents a specific session between an Entity and a peer.  This
   table carries information about the peer, the session, and parameters
   that were negotiated by the adjacency procedures.  The
   gsmpSessionTable also contains statistical information regarding the
   session.

   This creation order SHOULD be used by all GSMP managers.  This is to
   avoid clash situations in multiple SNMP manager scenarios where
   different managers may create competing entries in the different
   tables.

   Entities may very well be configured by other means than SNMP, e.g.,
   the cli command.  Such configured entities SHOULD be represented as
   entries in the tables of this mib and SHOULD be possible to query,
   and MAY be possible to alter with SNMP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4%20MIB%20groups"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a> MIB groups</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.1%20GSMP%20Switch%20Controller%20group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4.1" id="section-3.4.1">3.4.1</a> GSMP Switch Controller group</span>

   The controller group is used to configure a potential GSMP session on
   a Switch Controller.  A row in the gsmpControllerTable is created for
   each such session.  If ATM or TCP/IP encapsulation is used, a
   corresponding row has to be created in these tables before the
   session adjacency protocol is initiated.

   If ATM or TCP/IP is used, encapsulation data is defined in the
   corresponding encapsulation tables.  If ethernet is used, the MAC
   address of the interface defined for the session is set by the
   Controller ID object.

   The adjacency parameters are defined; such as

   -  Max supported GSMP version.
   -  Time between the periodic adjacency messages.
   -  Controller local port number and instance number.
   -  Whether partitions are being used and the partition ID for the
      specific partitions this controller is concerned with if
      partitions are used.
   -  The resynchronisation strategy for the session is specified.

   The notification mapping is set to specify for with events the
   corresponding SNMP notifications are sent.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.2%20GSMP%20Switch%20group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4.2" id="section-3.4.2">3.4.2</a> GSMP Switch group</span>

   The switch group is used to configure a potential GSMP session on a
   Switch.  A row in the gsmpSwitchTable is created for each such
   session.  If ATM or TCP/IP encapsulation is used, a corresponding row
   has to be created in these tables before the session adjacency
   protocol is initiated.

   If ATM or TCP/IP is used, encapsulation data is defined in the
   corresponding encapsulation tables.  If ethernet is used the MAC
   address of the interface defined for the session is set by the Switch
   ID object.

   The adjacency parameters are defined; such as
   -  Max supported GSMP version
   -  Time between the periodic adjacency messages
   -  Switch Name, local port number, and instance number.
   -  Whether partitions are being used and the partition ID for this
      specific partition if partitions are used.
   -  The switch type could be set.
   -  The suggested maximum window size for unacknowledged request
      messages.

   Also, a notification mapping is set to specify for with events the
   corresponding SNMP notifications are sent.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.3%20GSMP%20Encapsulation%20groups"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4.3" id="section-3.4.3">3.4.3</a> GSMP Encapsulation groups</span>

   The ATM Encapsulation Table and the TCP/IP Encapsulation Table
   provides a way to configure information that are encapsulation
   specific.  The encapsulation data is further specified in [<a href="./rfc3293" title='"General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP) Packet Encapsulations for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Ethernet and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)"'>RFC3293</a>].

   If ATM encapsulation is used, the interface and the virtual channel
   are specified.

   If TCP/IP is used, the IP address and the port number are specified.

   No special config data needed if Ethernet encapsulation is used.

   This mib MAY be extended with new, standard or proprietary, GSMP
   encapsulation types.  If a new encapsulation type needs to be added,
   it SHOULD be done in the form of a new table with the entity ID as an
   index.  A row in that encapsulation table SHOULD be created before
   any row in a GSMP entity table is created that is using this new GSMP
   encapsulation.

   The GSMP session table provides a way to monitor and maintain GSMP
   sessions.

   The session is defined by a Switch Controller Entity and Switch
   Entity pair.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.5%20The%20GSMP%20Notifications%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4.5" id="section-3.4.5">3.4.5</a> The GSMP Notifications Group</span>

   The GSMP Notification Group defines notifications for GSMP entities.
   These notifications provide a mechanism for a GSMP device to inform
   the management station of status changes.  Also a notification is
   defined for each type of GSMP events.

   The group of notifications consists of the following notifications:

   - gsmpSessionDown

   This notification is generated when a session is terminating and also
   reports the final accounting statistics of the session.

   - gsmpSessionUp

   This notification is generated when a new session is established.

   - gsmpSendFailureInd

   This notification is generated when a message with a failure
   indication was sent.  This means that this notification identifies a
   change to the gsmpSessionStatFailureInds object in a row of the
   gsmpSessionTable.

   - gsmpReceivedFailureInd

   This notification is generated when a message with a failure
   indication received.  This means that this notification identifies a
   change to the gsmpSessionStatReceivedFailures object in a row of the
   gsmpSessionTable.

   - gsmpPortUpEvent

   This notification is generated when a Port Up Event is either
   received or sent.

   - gsmpPortDownEvent

   This notification is generated when a Port Down Event is either
   received or sent.

   - gsmpInvalidLabelEvent

   This notification is generated when an Invalid Label Event is either
   received or sent.

   - gsmpNewPortEvent

   This notification is generated when New Port Event either is received
   or sent.

   - gsmpDeadPortEvent

   This notification is generated when a Dead Port Event is either
   received or sent.

   - gsmpAdjacencyUpdateEvent

   This notification is generated when an Adjacency Update Event is
   either received or sent.

   To disable or enable the sending of each notification, the bits in
   the bitmap are set to 0 or 1 in the Notification mapping objects in
   the Controller Entitiy or Switch Entity tables.

   The GSMP notification map capability should not be seen as a
   duplication of the filter mechanism in the snmp notification
   originator application [<a href="./rfc2573" title='"SNMP Applications"'>RFC2573</a>], but as a compliment, to configure
   the relation between GSMP events and the SNMP notifications already
   in the GSMP agent.  SNMP notifications and GSMP events operate
   sometimes on a different timescale, and it may in some applications
   be devastating for a SNMP application to receive events for each GSMP
   events.  E.g. the invalid label event in a ATM switch scenario may

   The datatypes GsmpNameType, GsmpLabelType, GsmpVersion,
   GsmpPartitionType, and GsmpPartitionIdType are used as textual
   conventions in this document.  These textual conventions are used for
   the convenience of humans reading the MIB.  Objects defined using
   these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define their primitive type.  However, the textual conventions have

   special semantics associated with them.  Hence, no changes to the SMI
   or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions
   which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

              Its purpose is to allow a management application
              (primarily an accounting application) that is
              monitoring the session statistics to receive the final
              values of these counters, so that the application can
              properly account for the amounts the counters were
              incremented since the last time the application polled
              them. The gsmpSessionStartUptime object provides the
              total amount of time that the session was active.

              This notification is not a substitute for polling the
              session statistic counts. In particular, the count
              values reported in this notification cannot be assumed
             to be the complete totals for the life of the session,
             since they may have wrapped while the
             session was up.

             The session to which this notification
             applies is identified by the gsmpSessionThisSideId and
             gsmpSessionFarSideId which could be inferred from the
             Object Identifiers of the objects contained in the
             notification.

             one instance of each of its objects, and these objects

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   Assuming that secure network management (such as SNMP v3) is
   implemented, the objects represented in this MIB do not pose a threat
   to the security of the network.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  They are contained in the gsmpControllerTable
   and gsmpSwitchTable.  It is thus important to control even GET access
   to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   object when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions
   of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="./rfc2574" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2574</a>] and the View-
   based Access Control Model <a href="./rfc2575">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="./rfc2575" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects, only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
