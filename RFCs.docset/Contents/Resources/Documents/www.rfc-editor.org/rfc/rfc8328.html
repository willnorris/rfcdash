Abstract

   The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based
   management framework defines base YANG data models to encode policy.
   These models point to device-, technology-, and service-specific YANG
   data models developed elsewhere.  Policy rules within an operator's
   environment can be used to express high-level, possibly network-wide,
   policies to a network management function (within a controller, an
   orchestrator, or a network element).  The network management function
   can then control the configuration and/or monitoring of network
   elements and services.  This document describes the SUPA basic
   framework, its elements, and interfaces.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Traffic flows over increasingly complex enterprise and service
   provider networks are becoming more and more important.  Meanwhile,
   the rapid growth of this variety makes the task of network operations
   and management applications deploying new services much more
   difficult.  Moreover, network operators want to deploy new services
   quickly and efficiently.  Two possible mechanisms for dealing with
   this growing difficulty are 1) the use of software abstractions to
   simplify the design and configuration of monitoring and control
   operations and 2) the use of programmatic control over the
   configuration and operation of such networks.  Policy-based
   management can be used to combine these two mechanisms into an
   extensible framework.

   There is a set of policy rules within an operator's environment that
   defines how services are designed, delivered, and operated.

   The SUPA (Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions) data model
   represents a high-level, possibly network-wide policy, which can be
   input to a network management function (within a controller, an
   orchestrator, or a network element).  The network management function
   can then control the configuration and/or monitoring of network
   elements and services according to such policies.

   SUPA defines a Generic Policy Information Model (GPIM) [<a href="#ref-SUPA-INFO">SUPA-INFO</a>]
   for use in network operations and management applications.  The GPIM
   defines concepts and terminology needed by policy management
   independent of the form and content of the policy rule.  The Event-
   Condition-Action (ECA) Policy Rule Information Model (EPRIM)
   [<a href="#ref-SUPA-INFO">SUPA-INFO</a>] extends the GPIM by defining how to build policy rules
   according to the ECA paradigm.

   Both the GPIM and the EPRIM are targeted at controlling the
   configuration and monitoring of network elements throughout the
   service development and deployment life cycle.  The GPIM and the
   EPRIM can both be translated into corresponding YANG [<a href="./rfc6020" title='"YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6020</a>]
   [<a href="./rfc7950" title='"The YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language"'>RFC7950</a>] modules that define policy concepts, terminology, and rules
   in a generic and interoperable manner; additional YANG modules may
   also be derived from the GPIM and/or EPRIM to manage specific
   functions.

   The key benefit of policy management is that it enables different
   network elements and services to be instructed to behave the same
   way, even if they are programmed differently.  Management
   applications will benefit from using policy rules that enable
   scalable and consistent programmatic control over the configuration
   and monitoring of network elements and services.

   Some typical and useful instances for authors to understand the
   applicability of SUPA, such as SNMP blocking upon load of link
   reaching a threshold and virtual matching migration upon the changing
   of user location, are described in [<a href="#ref-SUPA-APP" title='"Applicability of SUPA"'>SUPA-APP</a>].

   SUPA: The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions is a policy-based
   management framework that defines a data model to be used to
   represent high-level, possibly network-wide policies.  This data
   model can be input to a network management function (within a
   controller, an orchestrator, or a network element).

   YANG: An acronym for "Yet Another Next Generation".  YANG is a data
   modeling language used to model configuration and state data
   manipulated by the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), NETCONF
   remote procedure calls, and NETCONF notifications [<a href="./rfc6020" title='"YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6020</a>]

   ECA: Event-Condition-Action is a shortcut for referring to the
   structure of active rules in event-driven architecture and active
   database systems.

   EMS: An Element Management System is software used to monitor and
   control network elements (devices) in telecommunications.

   NMS: A Network Management System is a set of hardware and/or software
   tools that allow an IT professional to supervise the individual
   components of a network within a larger network management framework.

   OSS: An Operations/Operational Support System is a computer system
   used by telecommunications service providers to manage their networks
   (e.g., telephone networks).

   BSS: A Business Support System is used to support various end-to-end
   telecommunication services.

   GPIM: A Generic Policy Information Model defines concepts and
   terminology needed by policy management independent of the form and
   content of the policy rule.

   EPRIM: An ECA Policy Rule Information Model extends the GPIM by
   defining how to build policy rules according to the ECA paradigm.

   GPDM: Generic Policy Data Models [<a href="#ref-SUPA-DATA">SUPA-DATA</a>] are created from the
   GPIM.  These YANG data model policies are used to control the
   configuration of network elements that model the service(s) to be
   managed.  The relationship between the information model (IM) and
   data model (DM) can be founded in [<a href="./rfc3444" title='"On the Difference between Information Models and Data Models"'>RFC3444</a>].

   Declarative Policy: Policies that specify the goals to be achieved
   but not how to achieve those goals (also called "intent-based"
   policies).  Please note that declarative policies are out of scope
   for the initial phase of SUPA.

   This section briefly describes the design and operation of the SUPA
   policy-based management framework.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Overview</span>

   Figure 1 shows a simplified functional architecture of how SUPA is
   used to define policies for creating snippets of network element
   configurations.  SUPA uses the GPIM to define a consensual vocabulary
   that different actors can use to interact with network elements and
   services.  The EPRIM defines a generic structure for imperative
   policies.  The GPIM, and/or the combination of the GPIM and the
   EPRIM, is converted to generic YANG modules.

   In one possible approach (shown with asterisks in Figure 1), SUPA
   Generic Policy and SUPA ECA Policy YANG modules together with the
   Resource and Service YANG data models specified in the IETF (which
   define the specific elements that will be controlled by policies) are
   used by the Service Interface Logic.  This Service Interface Logic
   creates appropriate input mechanisms for the operator to define
   policies (e.g., a web form or a script) for creating and managing the
   network configuration.  The operator interacts with the interface,
   and the policies input by operators are then translated into
   configuration snippets.

   Note that the Resource and Service YANG data models may not exist.
   In this case, the SUPA generic policy YANG modules serve as an
   extensible basis to develop new YANG data models for the Service
   Interface Logic.  This transfers the work specified by the Resource

                         Figure 1: SUPA Framework

   Figure 1 shows the SUPA Framework at a high level of abstraction.
   The operator actor can interact with SUPA in other ways not shown in
   Figure 1.  In addition, other actors (e.g., an application developer)
   that can interact with SUPA are not shown for simplicity.

   The EPRIM defines an ECA policy as an example of imperative policies.
   An ECA policy rule is activated when its event clause is true; the
   condition clause is then evaluated and, if true, signals the
   execution of one or more actions in the action clause.  This type of
   policy explicitly defines the current and desired states of the
   system being managed.  Imperative policy rules require additional
   management functions, which are explained in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.

   Figure 2 shows how the SUPA Policy Model is used to create policy
   data models step-by-step and how the policy rules are used to
   communicate among various network management functions located on
   different layers.

   The GPIM is used to construct policies.  The GPIM defines generic
   policy concepts as well as two types of policies: ECA policy rules
   and declarative policy statements.

   A set of Generic Policy Data Models (GPDM) are then created from the
   GPIM.  These YANG data model policies are then used to control the
   configuration of network elements that model the service(s) to be
   managed.

   Resource and Service YANG Data Models: Models of the service as well
   as physical and virtual network topology including the resource
   attributes (e.g., data rate or latency of links) and operational
   parameters needed to support service deployment over the network
   topology.

   SUPA Policy Model:  This model represents one or more policy modules
      that contain the following entities:

      Generic Policy Information Model:  A model for defining policy
         rules that are independent of data repository, data definition,
         query, implementation language, and protocol.  This model is
         abstract and is used for design; it MUST be turned into a data
         model for implementation.

      Generic Policy Data Model:  A model of policy rules that are
         dependent on data repository, data definition, query,
         implementation language, and protocol.

      ECA Policy Rule Information Model (EPRIM):  This model represents
         a policy rule as a statement that consists of an event clause,
         a condition clause, and an action clause.  This type of policy
         rule explicitly defines the current and desired states of the
         system being managed.  This model is abstract and is used for
         design; it MUST be turned into a data model for implementation.

      ECA Policy Rule Data Model:  A model of policy rules, derived from
         EPRIM, where each policy rule consists of an event clause, a
         condition clause, and an action clause.

      EMS/NMS/Controller:  This represents one or more entities that are
         able to control the operation and management of a network
         infrastructure (e.g., a network topology that consists of
         network elements).

      Network Element (NE):  An element that can interact with the local
         or remote EMS/NMS/Controller in order to exchange information,
         such as configuration information, policy-enforcement
         capabilities, and network status.

   Relationships among Policy, Service, and Resource models are
   illustrated in Figure 3.

     Figure 3: Relationship among Policy, Service, and Resource Models

   In Figure 3:

   (1)  The policy manages and can adjust service behavior as necessary
        (1:1..n).  In addition, data from resources and services are
        used to select and/or modify policies during runtime.

   (2)  The policy manages and can adjust resource behavior as necessary
        (1:1..n).

   (3)  Resource hosts service; changing resources may change service
        behavior as necessary.

   Policies are used to control the management of resources and
   services, while data from resources and services are used to select
   and/or modify policies during runtime.  More importantly, policies
   can be used to manage how resources are allocated and assigned to
   services.  This enables a single policy to manage one or multiple
   services and resources as well as their dependencies.  The use of
   (1:1..n) in point (1) and (2) above show that one policy rule is able
   to manage and can adjust one or multiple services/resources.  Lines
   (1) and (2) (connecting policy to resource and policy to service) are
   the same, and line (3) (connecting resource to service) is different
   as it's navigable only from resource to service.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8328">RFC 8328</a>         SUPA Policy-Based Management Framework       March 2018</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Operation</span>

   SUPA can be used to define various types of policies, including
   policies that affect services and/or the configuration of individual
   network elements or groups of network elements.  SUPA can be used by
   a centralized and/or distributed set of entities for creating,
   managing, interacting with, and retiring policy rules.

   The SUPA scope is limited to policy information and data models.
   SUPA does not define network resource data models or network service
   data models; both are out of scope.  Instead, SUPA makes use of
   network resource data models defined by other working groups or
   Standards Development Organizations (SDOs).

   Declarative policies are out of scope for the initial phase of SUPA.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20The%20GPIM%20and%20the%20EPRIM"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  The GPIM and the EPRIM</span>

   The GPIM provides a shared vocabulary for representing concepts that
   are common to different types of policies, but which are independent
   of language, protocol, repository, and level of abstraction.  Hence,
   the GPIM defines concepts and vocabulary needed by policy management
   systems independent of the form and content of the policy.  The EPRIM
   is a more specific model that refines the GPIM to specify policy
   rules in an ECA form.

   This enables different policies at different levels of abstraction to
   form a continuum, where more abstract policies can be translated into
   more concrete policies and vice versa.  For example, the information
   model can be extended by generalizing concepts from an existing data
   model into the GPIM; the GPIM extensions can then be used by other
   data models.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Creation%20of%20Generic%20YANG%20Modules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Creation of Generic YANG Modules</span>

   An information model is abstract.  As such, it cannot be directly
   instantiated (i.e., objects cannot be created directly from it).
   Therefore, both the GPIM and the combination of the GPIM and the
   EPRIM are translated into generic YANG modules.

   SUPA will provide guidelines for translating the GPIM (or the
   combination of the GPIM and the EPRIM) into concrete YANG data models
   that define how to manage and communicate policies between systems.
   Multiple imperative policy YANG data models may be instantiated from
   the GPIM (or the combination of the GPIM and the EPRIM).  In
   particular, SUPA will specify a set of YANG data models that will
   consist of a base policy model for representing policy management
   concepts independent of the type or structure of a policy; it will



<span class="grey">Liu, et al.                   Informational                    [Page 10]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-11"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8328">RFC 8328</a>         SUPA Policy-Based Management Framework       March 2018</span>


   also specify an extension for defining policy rules according to the
   ECA paradigm.  (Note: This means that policies can be defined using
   the GPIM directly, or using the combination of the GPIM and the
   EPRIM.  If you use only the GPIM, you get a technology- and vendor-
   independent information model that you are free to map to the data
   model of your choice; note that the structure of a policy is NOT
   defined.  If you use the GPIM and the EPRIM, you get a technology-
   and vendor-independent information model that defines policies as an
   ECA policy rule (i.e., imperative).)

   The process of developing the GPIM, the EPRIM, and the derived/
   translated YANG data models is realized following the sequence shown
   below.  After completing this process and, if the implementation of
   the YANG data models requires it, the GPIM and EPRIM and the derived/
   translated YANG data models are updated and synchronized.

      (1)=&gt;(2)=&gt;(3)=&gt;(4)=&gt;(3')=&gt;(2')=&gt;(1')

      Where:
      (1)=GPIM
      (2)=EPRIM
      (3)=YANG data models
      (4)=Implementation
      (3')=update of YANG data models
      (2')=update of EPRIM
      (1')=update of GPIM

   The YANG module derived from the GPIM contains concepts and
   terminology for the common operation and administration of policy-
   based systems as well as an extensible structure for policy rules of
   different paradigms.  The YANG module derived from the EPRIM extends
   the generic nature of the GPIM by representing policies using an ECA
   structure.

   The above sequence allows for the addition of new model elements, as
   well as the editing of existing ones, in the GPIM and EPRIM.  In
   practice, the implementation sequence may be much simpler.
   Specifically, it is unlikely that the GPIM will need to be changed.
   In addition, changes to the EPRIM will likely be focused on fine-
   tuning the behavior offered by a specific set of model elements.
