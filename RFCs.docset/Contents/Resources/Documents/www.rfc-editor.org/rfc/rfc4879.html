Abstract

   This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in <a href="./rfc3979">RFC 3979</a>.
   Specifically, when third party Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
   disclosures are made, the intention is that the IETF Executive
   Director notify the IPR holder that a third party disclosure has been
   filed, and to ask the IPR holder whether they have any disclosure
   that needs to be made, per applicable <a href="./rfc3979">RFC 3979</a> rules.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in <a href="./rfc3979">RFC 3979</a>
   [<a href="./rfc3979" title='"Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology"'>RFC3979</a>].  Specifically, when third party IPR disclosures are made,
   the intention is that the IETF Executive Director notify the IPR
   holder that a third party disclosure has been filed, and to ask the
   IPR holder whether they have any disclosure that needs to be made,
   per applicable <a href="./rfc3979">RFC 3979</a> rules.

   This document updates <a href="./rfc3979">RFC 3979</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20Fix"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The Fix</span>

   <a href="./rfc3979#section-4">RFC 3979, SectionÂ 4</a> (C), states:

    (C) Where Intellectual Property Rights have been disclosed for IETF
        Documents as provided in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> of this document, the IETF
        Executive Director shall request from the discloser of such IPR,
        a written assurance that upon approval by the IESG for
        publication as RFCs of the relevant IETF specification(s), all
        persons will be able to obtain the right to implement, use,
        distribute and exercise other rights with respect to
        Implementing Technology under one of the licensing options
        specified in <a href="#section-6.5">Section 6.5</a> below unless such a statement has
        already been submitted.

   In the case of third party disclosures, it makes no sense to ask the
   discloser about potential licensing terms, since they do not own the
   IPR.  Instead, it only makes sense to ask the IPR holder.

   This document updates <a href="./rfc3979">RFC 3979</a> by changing the word "discloser" to
   "holder" in the above text.
