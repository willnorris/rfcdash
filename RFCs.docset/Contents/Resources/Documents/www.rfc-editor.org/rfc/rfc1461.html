      <span class="h1">SNMP MIB extension for Multiprotocol Interconnect over X.25</span>

Status of this Memo

   This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing Multiprotocol
   Interconnect (including IP) traffic carried over X.25.  The objects
   defined here, along with the objects in the "SNMP MIB extension for
   the Packet Layer of X.25"[<a href="#ref-8" title='"SNMP MIB extension for the X.25 Packet Layer"'>8</a>], "SNMP MIB extension for LAPB"[<a href="#ref-7" title='"SNMP MIB extension for X.25 LAPB"'>7</a>], and
   the "Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232-like Hardware Devices"
   [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232- like Hardware Devices"'>6</a>], combine to allow management of the traffic over an X.25 protocol
   stack.

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  These components give the rules for defining objects,
   the definitions of objects, and the protocol for manipulating
   objects.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1461">RFC 1461</a>        Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 MIB          May 1993</span>


   The network management framework structures objects in an abstract
   information tree. The branches of the tree name objects and the
   leaves of the tree contain the values manipulated to effect
   management. This tree is called the Management Information Base or
   MIB. The concepts of this tree are given in STD 16, <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a>, "The
   Structure of Management Information" or SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>]. The SMI defines the
   trunk of the tree and the types of objects used when defining the
   leaves. STD 16, <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a>, "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Towards Concise MIB Definitions"'>3</a>],
   defines a more concise description mechanism that preserves all the
   principals of the SMI.

   The core MIB definitions for the Internet suite of protocols can be
   found in STD 17, <a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>4</a>], "Management Information Base for
   Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets".

   STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>2</a>] defines the SNMP protocol itself. The protocol
   defines how to manipulate the objects in a remote MIB.

   The tree structure of the MIB allows new objects to be defined for
   the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Objects</span>

   The definition of an object in the MIB requires an object name and
   type.  Object names and types are defined using the subset of
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Information processing systems - Open Systems Interconnection - Specification of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)"'>5</a>] defined in the SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>].
   Objects are named using ASN.1 object identifiers, administratively
   assigned names, to specify object types.  The object name, together
   with an optional object instance, uniquely identifies a specific
   instance of an object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
   string, termed the descriptor, to refer to objects.

   Objects also have a syntax that defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Information processing systems - Open Systems Interconnection - Specification of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)"'>5</a>] provides
   the primitives used for this purpose.  The SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>] purposely
   restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used for simplicity and
   ease of implementation.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in
   "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Towards Concise MIB Definitions"'>3</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1461">RFC 1461</a>        Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 MIB          May 1993</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Scope</span>

   Instances of the objects defined below provide management information
   for Multiprotocol Interconnect traffic on X.25 as defined in <a href="./rfc1356">RFC 1356</a>
   [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN in the Packet Mode"'>9</a>].  That RFC describes how X.25 can be used to exchange IP or
   network level protocols. The multiprotocol packets (IP, CLNP, ES-IS,
   or SNAP) are encapsulated in X.25 frames for transmission between
   nodes.  All nodes that implement <a href="./rfc1356">RFC 1356</a> must implement this MIB.

   The objects in this MIB apply to the software in the node that
   manages X.25 connections and performs the protocol encapsulation.  A
   node in this usage maybe the end node source or destination host for
   the packet, or it may be a router or bridge responsible for
   forwarding the packet.  Since <a href="./rfc1356">RFC 1356</a> requires X.25, nodes that
   implement <a href="./rfc1356">RFC 1356</a> must also implement the X.25 MIB, <a href="./rfc1382">RFC 1382</a>.

   This MIB only applies to Multiprotocol Interconnect over X.25
   service. It does not apply to other software that may also use X.25
   (for example PAD).  Thus the presence, absence, or operation of such
   software will not directly affect any of these objects.  (However
   connections in use by that software will appear in the X.25 MIB).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Structure%20of%20MIB%20objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Structure of MIB objects</span>

   The objects of this MIB are organized into three tables:  the
   mioxPleTable, the mioxPeerTable, and the mioxPeerEncTable.  All
   objects in all tables are mandatory for conformance with this MIB.

   The mioxPleTable defines information relative to an interface used to
   carry Multiprotocol Interconnect traffic over X.25.  Such interfaces
   are identified by an ifType object in the Internet-standard MIB [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>4</a>]
   of ddn-x25 or <a href="./rfc877">rfc877</a>-x25.  Interfaces of type ddn-x25 have a self
   contained algorithm for translating between IP addresses and X.121
   addresses.  Interfaces of type <a href="./rfc877">rfc877</a>-x25 do not have such an
   algorithm.  Note that not all X.25 Interfaces will be used to carry
   Multiprotocol Interconnect traffic. Those interfaces not carrying
   such traffic will not have entries in the mioxPleTable.  The entries
   in the mioxPleTable are only for interfaces that do carry
   Multiprotocol Interconnect traffic over X.25.  Entries in the
   mioxPleTable are indexed by ifIndex to make it easy to find the
   mioxPleTable entry for an interface.

   The mioxPeerTable contains information needed to contact an X.25 Peer
   to exchange packets.  This includes information such as the X.121
   address of the peer and a pointer to the X.25 call parameters needed
   to place the call.  The instance identifiers used for the objects in

   this table are independent of any interface or other tables defined
   outside this MIB.  This table contains the ifIndex value of the X.25
   interface to use to call a peer.

   The mioxPeerEncTable contains information about the encapsulation
   type used to communicate with a peer.  This table is an extension of
   the mioxPeerTable in its instance identification. Each entry in the
   mioxPeerTable may have zero or more entries in this table.  This
   table will not have any entries that do not have correspondent
   entries in mioxPeerTable.

                          only be created by setting a value of
                          createRequest.  Entries that exist in other
                          than the invalid state can not be set to
                          createRequest.

                          Entries with a value of underCreation are
                          not used by the system and the management
                          station can change the values of other
                          objects in the table entry.  Management
                          stations should also remember to configure
                          values in the mioxPeerEncTable with the same
                          peer index value as this peer entry.

                          An entry in the underCreation state can be
                          set to valid or invalid.  Entries in the
                          underCreation state will stay in that state
                          until 1) the agent times them out, 2) they
                          are set to valid, 3) they are set to
                          invalid.  If an agent notices an entry has
                          been in the underCreation state for an
                          abnormally long time, it may decide the
                          management station has failed and invalidate
                          the entry.  A prudent agent will understand
                          that the management station may need to wait
                          for human input and will allow for that
                          possibility in its determination of this
                          abnormally long period.

                          Once a management station has completed all
                          fields of an entry, it will set a value of
                          valid.  This causes the entry to be
                          activated.

                          Entries in the valid state may also be set
                          to makeCall or clearCall to make or clear
                          X.25 calls to the peer.  After such a set
                          request the entry will still be in the valid
                          state.  Setting a value of makeCall causes
                          the agent to initiate an X.25 call request
                          to the peer specified by the entry.  Setting
                          a value of clearCall causes the agent to
                          initiate clearing one X.25 call present to
                          the peer.  Each set request will initiate
                          another call or clear request (up to the
                          maximum allowed); this means that management
                          stations that fail to get a response to a
                          set request should query to see if a call
                          was in fact placed or cleared before

                          valid state can not be set to makeCall or
                          clearCall.

                          The values of makeCall and clearCall provide

                          "The value of the encapsulation type.  For
                          IP encapsulation this will have a value of
                          204 (hex CC).  For SNAP encapsulated
                          packets, this will have a value of 128 (hex
                          80).  For CLNP, ISO 8473, this will have a
                          value of 129 (hex 81).  For ES-ES, ISO 9542,
                          this will have a value of 130 (hex 82).  A
                          value of 197 (hex C5) identifies the Blacker
                          X.25 encapsulation.  A value of 0,
                          identifies the Null encapsulation.

                          This value can only be written when the
                          mioxPeerStatus object with the same
                          mioxPeerIndex has a value of underCreation.
                          Setting this object to a value of 256
                          deletes the entry.  When deleting an entry,
                          all other entries in the mioxPeerEncTable
                          with the same mioxPeerIndex and with an
                          mioxPeerEncIndex higher then the deleted
                          entry, will all have their mioxPeerEncIndex
                          values decremented by one."
