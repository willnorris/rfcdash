          <span class="h1">Location Hiding: Problem Statement and Requirements</span>

Abstract

   The emergency services architecture developed in the IETF Emergency
   Context Resolution with Internet Technology (ECRIT) working group
   describes an architecture where location information is provided by
   access networks to endpoints or Voice over IP (VoIP) service
   providers in order to determine the correct dial string and
   information to route the call to a Public Safety Answering Point
   (PSAP).  To determine the PSAP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), the
   usage of the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol is
   envisioned.

   This document provides a problem statement and lists requirements for
   situations where the Internet Access Provider (IAP) and/or the
   Internet Service Provider (ISP) are only willing to disclose limited
   or no location information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Emergency%20Services%20Architecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Emergency Services Architecture</span>

   The emergency services architecture developed in the IETF Emergency
   Context Resolution with Internet Technology (ECRIT) working group,
   see [<a href="./rfc6443" title='"Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia"'>RFC6443</a>], describes an architecture where location information
   is provided by access networks to endpoints or VoIP service providers
   in order to determine the correct dial string and information to
   route the call to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).  The
   Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>] allows
   callers and other call-routing entities to determine the PSAP Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) for a specific geographical location
   together with a service URN [<a href="./rfc5031" title='"A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Emergency and Other Well-Known Services"'>RFC5031</a>].  The basic architecture is
   shown in Figure 1 of [<a href="./rfc6443" title='"Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia"'>RFC6443</a>] and further detailed in the message
   flow in Figure 2 of [<a href="./rfc6443" title='"Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia"'>RFC6443</a>].

   For emergency services, location information is needed for three
   purposes:

   1.  Emergency call routing to the PSAP that is responsible for a
       specific geographical region.

   2.  Dispatch of the emergency personnel to the scene of an accident,
       crime, or other type of incident.

   3.  Additionally, a Voice Service Provider (VSP) may need to verify
       that a call is indeed an emergency call and may therefore require
       location information to ensure that calls routed to a specific
       URI point to a PSAP.

   This document focuses on items (1) and (3).  Providing location
   information by the ISP to emergency authorities, including PSAPs,
   regional emergency management association, and emergency personnel is
   typically a legal obligation covered by regulatory frameworks.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20Location%20Hiding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Location Hiding</span>

   Internet Access Providers (IAPs) and Internet Service Providers
   (ISPs) typically have little incentive to provide location
   information to end hosts or independent VSPs (without monetary
   compensation) for any purpose, including for emergency call routing.
   The decision to deny disclosure of location information can be driven
   by a number of technical and business concerns.  Some providers may
   perceive a risk that allowing users to access location information
   for non-emergency purposes or prior to an emergency call will incur
   additional server load and thus costs.  Other providers may not want

   to make location information available without the ability to charge
   for it.  Yet, others fear problems with regard to privacy when
   disclosing location information to potentially unknown third parties.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.3.%20%20Location%20by%20Reference"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" id="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Location by Reference</span>

   The work on the Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) indicated the
   need to provide the capability to obtain Location-by-References
   (LbyRs) in addition to Location-by-Value (LbyV) from a Location
   Information Server (LIS).

   The LCP problem statement and requirements document is [<a href="./rfc5687" title='"GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol: Problem Statement and Requirements"'>RFC5687</a>].
   The requirements for obtaining an LbyR via the LCP and the
   corresponding dereferencing step can be found in [<a href="./rfc5808" title='"Requirements for a Location-by-Reference Mechanism"'>RFC5808</a>].

   HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD), see [<a href="./rfc5985" title='"HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)"'>RFC5985</a>], is an
   instantiation of the LCP concept and allows LbyVs and LbyRs to be
   requested.

   A location reference may already satisfy the requirement for location
   hiding if the PSAP has the appropriate credentials to resolve the
   reference.  These credentials allow the ISP/IAP to authenticate and
   to authorize the party that would like to request location
   information.  The policy to obtain these credentials allows ISPs/IAPs
   to put constraints under which these credentials are handed out.
   ISPs/IAPs ideally might want to engage in a business relationship
   with the VSP to receive a financial compensation for the service they
   provide.  On the Internet, the number of VSPs is potentially large
   and the VSPs would not want to enter a business contract with
   potentially every ISP/IAP worldwide.  The number of potential
   contracts between ISPs/IAPs and PSAPs is, however, relatively small
   as they typically need to have a local relationship as PSAPs provide
   their emergency services support in a certain geographical region for
   which certain ISPs/IAPs have networks deployed.

   Note that the requirement being met here is for delivery of location
   information to the PSAP, not for LoST routing or for validation at
   the VSP.  Since LoST [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>] requires location by value, location
   by reference cannot be used for location-based routing.  Also, LoST
   servers may be operated by independent parties, including VSPs, which
   again may not be able to resolve the reference to location by value.
   (Note that LoST is a protocol used for determining the location-
   appropriate PSAP based on location information and a Service URN
   [<a href="./rfc5031" title='"A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Emergency and Other Well-Known Services"'>RFC5031</a>].)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>], with the
   important qualification that, unless otherwise stated, these terms
   apply to the design of an solution supporting location hiding, not
   its implementation or application.

   This document reuses terminology from [<a href="./rfc5687" title='"GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol: Problem Statement and Requirements"'>RFC5687</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Requirements</span>

   Req-1:   There MUST be a way for the ISP/IAP to withhold precise
            location information from the endpoint and from the VSP.

   Req-2:   The ISP/IAP MUST support the ability of the endpoint or the
            VSP to route emergency calls.

   Req-3:   The VSP MUST be able to validate that a call purported to be
            an emergency call is being routed to a bona fide URI, which
            is denoted by being a URI in LoST for the designated
            emergency service.  This requirement is provided to deal
            with potential security problems described in <a href="./rfc5069#section-5.1">SectionÂ 5.1 of
            [RFC5069]</a>.

   Req-4:   The PSAP MUST receive precise location information (by
            value) about emergency callers.  As such, any solution MUST
            be able to provide location information to the PSAP even
            while withholding it from the emergency caller.

   Req-5:   The proposed solution MUST NOT assume a business or trust
            relationship between the caller's VSP and the caller's ISP.

   Req-6:   A solution MUST consider deployment scenarios where a VSP
            does not operate in the same jurisdiction as the PSAP.

   Req-7:   The solution MUST consider that service boundaries for the
            various emergency services responsible for a particular
            location may differ.

   Req-8:   The steps needed by the endpoint for emergency calling
            SHOULD be no different when location is withheld versus when
            location is not withheld.  In particular, user agents cannot
            require additional configuration to discover in which
            particular environment (hiding or no hiding) they find
            themselves.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6444">RFC 6444</a>              Location Hiding Requirements          January 2012</span>


   Req-9:   The solution SHOULD work without the ISP/IAP having to
            support SIP and without the need to utilize SIP between the
            endpoint and the VSP.

   Req-10:  The solution MUST work if PSAP boundaries have holes.  (For
            a discussion about holes in PSAP boundaries and their
            encoding, the reader is referred to [<a href="./rfc5964" title='"Specifying Holes in Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Service Boundaries"'>RFC5964</a>].)

   Req-11:  The solution MUST NOT assume the existence of Emergency
            Service Routing Proxies (ESRPs) per country, state, and
            city.

   Req-12:  The solution MUST consider that service boundaries for
            different emergency services may differ, but they overlap at
            the location of the caller.

   Req-13:  Though the solution MAY add steps to the emergency call
            routing process described in [<a href="./rfc6443" title='"Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia"'>RFC6443</a>], these steps MUST NOT
            significantly increase call setup latency.  For example, the
            revised process MUST NOT include "trial-and-error"
            operations on its critical path, such as attempts at LbyR
            resolutions that may take time to time out.

   Req-14:  The solution MUST allow the end host to determine PSAP/ESRP
            URLs prior to the call, for all emergency services.

   Req-15:  The solution MUST allow user agents (UAs) to discover at
            least their dial string ahead of the emergency call.

   Req-16:  The solution MUST have minimal impact on UAs, i.e., a
            solution is preferred if it does not require a substantially
            different emergency service procedure compared to the
            procedure of dealing with emergency services where no
            location hiding is applied.

   Req-17:  The solution MUST NOT interfere with the use of LoST for
            non-emergency services.

   Req-18:  The solution MUST allow emergency calls to reach an IP-to-
            PSTN gateway rather than the IP-based PSAP directly.

   Req-19:  The solution MUST NOT shift effort (externality), i.e., the
            convenience of the location-hiding ISP MUST NOT impose a
            burden on user agents or non-hiding ISPs/IAPs and SHOULD NOT
            impose a burden on VSPs.

   Req-20:  The solution SHOULD minimize the impact on LoST, SIP
            conveyance [<a href="./rfc6442" title='"Location Conveyance for the Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC6442</a>], and DHCP.

   Req-21:  The solution SHOULD NOT break in the presence of NATs and
            SHOULD consider the presence of legacy devices, as described
            in [<a href="./rfc5687" title='"GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol: Problem Statement and Requirements"'>RFC5687</a>].
