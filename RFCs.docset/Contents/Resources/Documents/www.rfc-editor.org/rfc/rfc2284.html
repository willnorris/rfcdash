Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>1</a>] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.

   PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, which allows
   negotiation of an Authentication Protocol for authenticating its peer
   before allowing Network Layer protocols to transmit over the link.

   This document defines the PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol.

   In order to establish communications over a point-to-point link, each
   end of the PPP link must first send LCP packets to configure the data
   link during Link Establishment phase.  After the link has been
   established, PPP provides for an optional Authentication phase before
   proceeding to the Network-Layer Protocol phase.

   By default, authentication is not mandatory.  If authentication of
   the link is desired, an implementation MUST specify the
   Authentication-Protocol Configuration Option during Link
   Establishment phase.

   These authentication protocols are intended for use primarily by
   hosts and routers that connect to a PPP network server via switched
   circuits or dial-up lines, but might be applied to dedicated links as
   well.  The server can use the identification of the connecting host
   or router in the selection of options for network layer negotiations.

   This document defines the PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol
   (EAP).  The Link Establishment and Authentication phases, and the
   Authentication-Protocol Configuration Option, are defined in The
   Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>1</a>].

   authenticator
             The end of the link requiring the authentication.  The
             authenticator specifies the authentication protocol to be
             used in the Configure-Request during Link Establishment
             phase.

   peer
             The other end of the point-to-point link; the end which is
             being authenticated by the authenticator.

   silently discard
             This means the implementation discards the packet without
             further processing.  The implementation SHOULD provide the
             capability of logging the error, including the contents of
             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event
             in a statistics counter.

   displayable message
             This is interpreted to be a human readable string of
             characters, and MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.
             The message encoding MUST follow the UTF-8 transformation
             format [<a href="#ref-5" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of Unicode and ISO 10646"'>5</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20PPP%20Extensible%20Authentication%20Protocol%20%28EAP%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)</span>

   The PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)  is a general
   protocol for PPP authentication which supports multiple
   authentication mechanisms.  EAP does not select a specific
   authentication mechanism at Link Control Phase, but rather postpones
   this until the Authentication Phase.  This allows the authenticator
   to request more information before determining the specific
   authentication mechanism.  This also permits the use of a "back-end"
   server which actually implements the various mechanisms while the PPP
   authenticator merely passes through the authentication exchange.

   1. After the Link Establishment phase is complete, the authenticator
      sends one or more Requests to authenticate the peer.  The Request
      has a type field to indicate what is being requested.  Examples of
      Request types include Identity,  MD5-challenge, One-Time
      Passwords, Generic Token Card, etc.  The MD5-challenge type
      corresponds closely to the CHAP authentication protocol.
      Typically, the authenticator will send an initial Identity Request
      followed by one or more Requests for authentication information.
      However, an initial Identity Request is not required, and MAY be
      bypassed in cases where the identity is presumed (leased lines,
      dedicated dial-ups, etc.).

   2. The peer sends a Response packet in reply to each Request.  As
      with the Request packet, the Response packet contains a type field
      which corresponds to the type field of the Request.

   3. The authenticator ends the authentication phase with a Success or
      Failure packet.

Advantages

   The EAP protocol can support multiple authentication mechanisms
   without having to pre-negotiate a particular one during LCP Phase.

   Certain devices (e.g. a NAS) do not necessarily have to understand
   each request type and may be able to simply act as a passthrough
   agent for a "back-end" server on a host.  The device only need look
   for the success/failure code to terminate the authentication phase.

Disadvantages

   EAP does require the addition of a new authentication type to LCP and
   thus PPP implementations will need to be modified to use it.  It also
   strays from the previous PPP authentication model of negotiating a
   specific authentication mechanism during LCP.

   Code

      The Code field is one octet and identifies the type of EAP packet.
      EAP Codes are assigned as follows:

         1       Request
         2       Response
         3       Success
         4       Failure

   Identifier

          The Identifier field is one octet and aids in matching
          responses with requests.

   Length

          The Length field is two octets and indicates the length of the
          EAP packet including the Code, Identifier, Length and Data
          fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length field should
          be treated as Data Link Layer padding and should be ignored on
          reception.

   Data

          The Data field is zero or more octets.  The format of the Data
          field is determined by the Code field.

   Description

      The Request packet is sent by the authenticator to the peer.  Each
      Request has a type field which serves to indicate what is being
      requested.  The authenticator MUST transmit an EAP packet with the
      Code field set to 1 (Request).  Additional Request packets MUST be
      sent until a valid Response packet is received, or an optional
      retry counter expires.  Retransmitted Requests MUST be sent with
      the same Identifier value in order to distinguish them from new
      Requests.  The contents of the data field is dependent on the
      Request type.  The peer MUST send a Response packet in reply to a
      Request packet.  Responses MUST only be sent in reply to a
      received Request and never retransmitted on a timer.  The
      Identifier field of the Response MUST match that of the Request.

         Implementation Note: Because the authentication process will
         often involve user input, some care must be taken when deciding
         upon retransmission strategies and authentication timeouts.  It
         is suggested a retransmission timer of 6 seconds with a maximum
         of 10 retransmissions be used as default.  One may wish to make
         these timeouts longer in certain cases (e.g. where Token Cards
         are involved).  Additionally, the peer must be prepared to
         silently discard received retransmissions while waiting for
         user input.

   A summary of the Request and Response packet format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Identifier

      The Identifier field is one octet.  The Identifier field MUST be
      the same if a Request packet is retransmitted due to a timeout
      while waiting for a Response.  Any new (non-retransmission)
      Requests MUST modify the Identifier field.  If a peer recieves a
      duplicate Request for which it has already sent a Response, it
      MUST resend it's Response.  If a peer receives a duplicate Request
      before it has sent a Response to the initial Request (i.e. it's
      waiting for user input), it MUST silently discard the duplicate
      Request.

   Length

      The Length field is two octets and indicates the length of the EAP
      packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Type, and Type-Data
      fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length field should be
      treated as Data Link Layer padding and should be ignored on
      reception.

   Type

      The Type field is one octet.  This field indicates the Type of
      Request or Response.  Only one Type MUST be specified per EAP
      Request or Response.  Normally, the Type field of the Response
      will be the same as the Type of the Request.  However, there is
      also a Nak Response Type for indicating that a Request type is
      unacceptable to the peer.  When sending a Nak in response to a
      Request, the peer MAY indicate an alternative desired
      authentication Type which it supports. An initial specification of
      Types follows in a later section of this document.

   Type-Data

      The Type-Data field varies with the Type of Request and the
      associated Response.

   Description

      The Success packet is sent by the authenticator to the peer to
      acknowledge successful authentication.  The authenticator MUST
      transmit an EAP packet with the Code field set to 3 (Success).

      If the authenticator cannot authenticate the peer (unacceptable
      Responses to one or more Requests) then the implementation MUST
      transmit an EAP packet with the Code field set to 4 (Failure).  An

      authenticator MAY wish to issue multiple Requests before sending a
      Failure response in order to allow for human typing mistakes.

         Implementation Note: Because the Success and Failure packets
         are not acknowledged, they may be potentially lost.  A peer
         MUST allow for this circumstance.  The peer can use a Network
         Protocol packet as an alternative indication of Success.
         Likewise, the receipt of a LCP Terminate-Request can be taken
         as a Failure.

   A summary of the Success and Failure packet format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      prompt the peer in the case where there expectation of interaction
      with a user.  A Response MUST be sent to this Request with a Type
      of 1 (Identity).

         Implementation Note:  The peer MAY obtain the Identity via user
         input.  It is suggested that the authenticator retry the
         Indentity Request in the case of an invalid Identity or
         authentication failure to allow for potential typos on the part
         of the user.  It is suggested that the Identity Request be
         retried a minimum of 3 times before terminating the
         authentication phase with a Failure reply.  The Notification
         Request MAY be used to indicate an invalid authentication
         attempt prior to transmitting a new Identity Request
         (optionally, the failure MAY be indicated within the message of
         the new Identity Request itself).

   Type

      1

   Type-Data

      This field MAY contain a displayable message in the Request.  The
      Response uses this field to return the Identity.  If the Identity
      is unknown, this field should be zero bytes in length.  The field
      MUST NOT be null terminated.  The length of this field is derived
      from the Length field of the Request/Response packet and hence a
      null is not required.

   Description

      The Notification Type is optionally used to convey a displayable
      message from the authenticator to the peer.   The peer SHOULD
      display this message to the user or log it if it cannot be
      displayed.  It is intended to provide an acknowledged notification
      of some imperative nature.  Examples include a password with an
      expiration time that is about to expire, an OTP sequence integer
      which is nearing 0, an authentication failure warning, etc.   In
      most circumstances, notification should not be required.

   Type

      2

   Type-Data

      The Type-Data field in the Request contains a displayable message
      greater than zero octets in length.  The length of the message is
      determined by Length field of the Request packet.  The message
      MUST not be null terminated.  A Response MUST be sent in reply to
      the Request with a Type field of 2 (Notification).  The Type-Data
      field of the Response is zero octets in length.   The Response
      should be sent immediately (independent of how the message is
      displayed or logged).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Nak"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Nak</span>

   Description

      The Nak Type is valid only in Response messages.  It is sent in
      reply to a Request where the desired authentication Type is
      unacceptable.   Authentication Types are numbered 4 and above.
      The Response contains the authentication Type desired by the peer.

   Type

      3

   Type-Data

      This field MUST contain a single octet indicating the desired
      authentication type.

   Description

      The MD5-Challenge Type is analagous to the PPP CHAP protocol [<a href="#ref-3" title='"PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)"'>3</a>]
      (with MD5 as the specified algorithm).  The PPP Challenge
      Handshake Authentication Protocol RFC [<a href="#ref-3" title='"PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)"'>3</a>] should be referred to
      for further implementation specifics.  The Request contains a
      "challenge" message to the peer.  A Repsonse MUST be sent in reply
      to the Request.  The Response MAY be either of Type 4 (MD5-
      Challenge) or Type 3 (Nak).   The Nak reply indicates the peer's
      desired authentication mechanism Type.  All EAP implementations
      MUST support the MD5-Challenge mechanism.

   Description

      The One-Time Password system is defined in "A One-Time Password
      System" [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A One-Time Password System"'>4</a>].  The Request contains a displayable message
      containing an OTP challenge.  A Repsonse MUST be sent in reply to
      the Request.  The Response MUST be of Type 5 (OTP) or Type 3
      (Nak).  The Nak reply indicates the peer's desired authentication
      mechanism Type.

   Type-Data

      The Type-Data field contains the OTP "challenge" as a displayable
      message in the Request.  In the Response, this field is used for
      the 6 words from the OTP dictionary [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A One-Time Password System"'>4</a>].  The messages MUST not be
      null terminated.  The length of the field is derived from the
      Length field of the Request/Reply packet.

   Description

      The Generic Token Card Type is defined for use with various Token
      Card implementations which require user input.   The Request
      contains an ASCII text message and the Reply contains the Token
      Card information necessary for authentication.  Typically, this
      would be information read by a user from the Token card device and
      entered as ASCII text.

   Type

      6

   Type-Data

      The Type-Data field in the Request contains a displayable message
      greater than zero octets in length.  The length of the message is
      determined by Length field of the Request packet.  The message
      MUST not be null terminated.  A Response MUST be sent in reply to
      the Request with a Type field of 6 (Generic Token Card).  The
      Response contains data from the Token Card required for
      authentication.  The length is of the data is determined by the
      Length field of the Response packet.

Security Considerations

   Security issues are the primary topic of this RFC.

   The interaction of the authentication protocols within PPP are highly
   implementation dependent.

   For example, upon failure of authentication, some implementations do
   not terminate the link.  Instead, the implementation limits the kind
   of traffic in the Network-Layer Protocols to a filtered subset, which
   in turn allows the user opportunity to update secrets or send mail to
   the network administrator indicating a problem.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2284">RFC 2284</a>                          EAP                         March 1998</span>


   There is no provision for retries of failed authentication.  However,
   the LCP state machine can renegotiate the authentication protocol at
   any time, thus allowing a new attempt.  It is recommended that any
   counters used for authentication failure not be reset until after
   successful authentication, or subsequent termination of the failed
   link.

   There is no requirement that authentication be full duplex or that
   the same protocol be used in both directions.  It is perfectly
   acceptable for different protocols to be used in each direction.
   This will, of course, depend on the specific protocols negotiated.

   In practice, within or associated with each PPP server, it is not
   anticipated that a particular named user would be authenticated by
   multiple methods.  This would make the user vulnerable to attacks
   which negotiate the least secure method from among a set (such as PAP
   rather than EAP).  Instead, for each named user there should be an
   indication of exactly one method used to authenticate that user name.
   If a user needs to make use of different authentication methods under
   different circumstances, then distinct identities SHOULD be employed,
   each of which identifies exactly one authentication method.
