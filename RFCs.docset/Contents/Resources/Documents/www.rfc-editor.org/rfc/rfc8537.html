Abstract

   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) association signaling can be
   used to bind two unidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs) into an
   associated bidirectional LSP.  When an associated bidirectional LSP
   is co-routed, the reverse LSP follows the same path as its forward
   LSP.  This document updates the fast reroute procedures defined in
   <a href="./rfc4090">RFC 4090</a> to support both single-sided and double-sided provisioned
   associated bidirectional LSPs.  This document also updates the
   procedure for associating two reverse LSPs defined in <a href="./rfc7551">RFC 7551</a> to
   support co-routed bidirectional LSPs.  The fast reroute procedures
   can ensure that, for the co-routed LSPs, traffic flows on co-routed
   paths in the forward and reverse directions after a failure event.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) (Extended) ASSOCIATION
   Object is specified in [<a href="./rfc6780" title='"RSVP ASSOCIATION Object Extensions"'>RFC6780</a>] and can be used generically to
   associate Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).
   [<a href="./rfc7551" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC7551</a>] defines mechanisms for binding two point-to-point (P2P)
   unidirectional LSPs [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>] into an associated bidirectional LSP.
   There are two models described in [<a href="./rfc7551" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC7551</a>] for provisioning an
   associated bidirectional LSP: single-sided and double-sided.  In both
   models, the reverse LSP of the bidirectional LSP may or may not be
   co-routed and follow the same path as its forward LSP.

   In some packet transport networks, there are requirements where the
   reverse LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same path as
   its forward LSP [<a href="./rfc6373" title='"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS- TP) Control Plane Framework"'>RFC6373</a>].  The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
   [<a href="./rfc6370" title='"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Identifiers"'>RFC6370</a>] architecture facilitates the co-routed bidirectional LSP by
   using GMPLS extensions [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] to achieve congruent paths.
   However, RSVP association signaling allows enabling co-routed
   bidirectional LSPs without having to deploy GMPLS extensions in the
   existing networks.  The association signaling also allows taking
   advantage of the existing TE and fast reroute mechanisms in the
   network.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4090">RFC4090</a>] defines fast reroute extensions for RSVP-TE LSPs, which are
   also applicable to the associated bidirectional LSPs.  [<a href="./rfc8271" title='"Updates to the Resource Reservation Protocol for Fast Reroute of Traffic Engineering GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC8271</a>]
   defines fast reroute procedures for GMPLS signaled bidirectional LSPs
   such as coordinating bypass tunnel assignments in the forward and
   reverse directions of the LSP.  The mechanisms defined in [<a href="./rfc8271" title='"Updates to the Resource Reservation Protocol for Fast Reroute of Traffic Engineering GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC8271</a>]
   are also useful for the fast reroute of associated bidirectional
   LSPs.

   This document updates the fast reroute procedures defined in
   [<a href="./rfc4090" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC4090</a>] to support both single-sided and double-sided provisioned
   associated bidirectional LSPs.  This document also updates the
   procedure for associating two reverse LSPs defined in [<a href="./rfc7551" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC7551</a>] to
   support co-routed bidirectional LSPs.  The fast reroute procedures
   can ensure that for the co-routed LSPs, traffic flows on co-routed
   paths in the forward and reverse directions after fast reroute.

   The following assumptions and considerations apply to this document:

   o  The fast reroute procedure for the unidirectional LSPs is defined
      in [<a href="./rfc4090" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC4090</a>] and is not modified by this document.

   o  The fast reroute procedure when using unidirectional bypass
      tunnels is defined in [<a href="./rfc4090" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC4090</a>] and is not modified by this
      document.

   o  This document assumes that the fast reroute bypass tunnels used
      for protected associated bidirectional LSPs are also associated
      bidirectional.

   o  This document assumes that the fast reroute bypass tunnels used
      for protected co-routed associated bidirectional LSPs are also co-
      routed associated bidirectional.

   o  The fast reroute procedure to coordinate the bypass tunnel
      assignment defined in this document may be used for protected
      associated bidirectional LSPs that are not co-routed but requires
      that the downstream Point of Local Repair (PLR) and Merge Point
      (MP) pair of the forward LSP matches the upstream MP and PLR pair
      of the reverse LSP.

   o  Unless otherwise specified in this document, the fast reroute
      procedures defined in [<a href="./rfc4090" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC4090</a>] are used for associated
      bidirectional LSPs.

   Two reverse unidirectional P2P LSPs are set up in opposite directions
   between a pair of source and destination nodes to form an associated
   bidirectional LSP.  In the case of single-sided provisioned LSP, the
   originating LSP with a REVERSE_LSP Object [<a href="./rfc7551" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC7551</a>] is identified as
   a forward unidirectional LSP.  In the case of double-sided
   provisioned LSP, the LSP originating from the higher node address (as
   source) and terminating on the lower node address (as destination) is
   identified as a forward unidirectional LSP.

   Two reverse unidirectional P2P LSPs are set up in opposite directions
   between a pair of source and destination nodes to form an associated
   bidirectional LSP.  A reverse unidirectional LSP originates on the
   same node where the forward unidirectional LSP terminates, and it
   terminates on the same node where the forward unidirectional LSP
   originates.  A reverse co-routed unidirectional LSP traverses along
   the same path as the forward-direction unidirectional LSP in the
   opposite direction.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Problem%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Problem Statement</span>

   As specified in [<a href="./rfc7551" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC7551</a>], in the single-sided provisioning case, the
   RSVP-TE tunnel is configured only on one endpoint node of the
   bidirectional LSP.  An LSP for this tunnel is initiated by the
   originating endpoint with the (Extended) ASSOCIATION Object
   containing Association Type set to "Single-Sided Associated
   Bidirectional LSP" and the REVERSE_LSP Object inserted in the RSVP
   Path message.  The remote endpoint then creates the corresponding
   reverse TE tunnel and signals the reverse LSP in response using the
   information from the REVERSE_LSP Object and other objects present in
   the received RSVP Path message.  As specified in [<a href="./rfc7551" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC7551</a>], in the
   double-sided provisioning case, the RSVP-TE tunnel is configured on
   both endpoint nodes of the bidirectional LSP.  Both forward and
   reverse LSPs are initiated independently by the two endpoints with
   the (Extended) ASSOCIATION Object containing Association Type set to
   "Double-Sided Associated Bidirectional LSP".  With both single-sided
   and double-sided provisioned bidirectional LSPs, the reverse LSP may
   or may not be congruent (i.e., co-routed) and follow the same path as
   its forward LSP.

   Both single-sided and double-sided associated bidirectional LSPs
   require solutions to the following issues for fast reroute to ensure
   co-routing after a failure event.

   In order to ensure that the traffic flows on a co-routed path after a
   link or node failure on the protected co-routed LSP path, the
   midpoint PLR nodes need to assign matching bidirectional bypass
   tunnels for fast reroute.  Such bypass assignment requires
   coordination between the PLR nodes in both the forward and reverse
   directions when more than one bypass tunnel is present on a PLR node.

              Figure 1: Multiple Bidirectional Bypass Tunnels

   As shown in Figure 1, there are two bypass tunnels available: bypass
   tunnel N (on path B-H-I-C) and bypass tunnel S (on path B-F-G-C).
   The midpoint PLR nodes B and C need to coordinate bypass tunnel
   assignment to ensure that traffic in both directions flows through
   either bypass tunnel N or bypass tunnel S after the link B-C failure.

   When using a node protection bypass tunnel with a protected
   associated bidirectional LSP, after a link failure, the forward and
   reverse LSP traffic can flow on different node protection bypass
   tunnels in the upstream and downstream directions.

                 Figure 2: Node Protection Bypass Tunnels

   As shown in Figure 2, after the link B-C failure, the downstream PLR
   node B reroutes the protected forward LSP1 traffic over bypass tunnel
   S (on path B-F-G-D) to reach downstream MP node D, whereas the
   upstream PLR node C reroutes the protected reverse LSP2 traffic over
   bypass tunnel N (on path C-I-H-A) to reach the upstream MP node A.
   As a result, the traffic in the forward and reverse directions flows
   on different bypass tunnels, which can cause the co-routed associated
   bidirectional LSP to be no longer co-routed.  However, unlike GMPLS
   LSPs, the asymmetry of paths in the forward and reverse directions
   does not result in RSVP soft-state timeout with the associated
   bidirectional LSPs.

   In packet transport networks, a restoration LSP is signaled after a
   link failure on the protected LSP path, and the protected LSP may or
   may not be torn down [<a href="./rfc8131" title='"RSVP-TE Signaling Procedure for End-to-End GMPLS Restoration and Resource Sharing"'>RFC8131</a>].  In this case, multiple forward and
   reverse LSPs of a co-routed associated bidirectional LSP may be
   present at midpoint nodes with identical (Extended) ASSOCIATION
   Objects.  This creates an ambiguity at midpoint nodes to identify the
   correct associated LSP pair for fast reroute bypass assignment (e.g.,
   during the recovery phase of the RSVP graceful restart procedure).

            Figure 3: Restoration LSP Setup after Link Failure

   As shown in Figure 3, the protected LSPs (LSP1 and LSP2) are an
   associated LSP pair; similarly, the restoration LSPs (LSP3 and LSP4)
   are an associated LSP pair.  Both pairs belong to the same associated
   bidirectional LSP and carry identical (Extended) ASSOCIATION Objects.
   In this example, the midpoint node D may mistakenly associate LSP1
   with the reverse LSP4 instead of the reverse LSP2 due to the matching
   (Extended) ASSOCIATION Objects.  This may cause the co-routed
   associated bidirectional LSP to be no longer co-routed after fast
   reroute.  Since the bypass assignment needs to be coordinated between
   the forward and reverse LSPs, this can also lead to undesired bypass
   tunnel assignments.

   For both single-sided and double-sided associated bidirectional LSPs,
   the fast reroute procedure specified in [<a href="./rfc4090" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC4090</a>] is used.  In
   addition, the mechanisms defined in [<a href="./rfc8271" title='"Updates to the Resource Reservation Protocol for Fast Reroute of Traffic Engineering GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC8271</a>] are used as follows:

   o  The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT IPv4 subobject (value 38) and IPv6 subobject
      (value 39) defined in [<a href="./rfc8271" title='"Updates to the Resource Reservation Protocol for Fast Reroute of Traffic Engineering GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC8271</a>] are used to coordinate bypass
      tunnel assignment between the PLR nodes in both the forward and
      reverse directions (see Figure 1).  The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT and
      Node-ID address [<a href="./rfc4561" title='"Definition of a Record Route Object (RRO) Node-Id Sub-Object"'>RFC4561</a>] subobjects MUST be added by the
      downstream PLR node in the RECORD_ROUTE Object (RRO) of the RSVP
      Path message of the forward LSP to indicate the local bypass
      tunnel assignment using the procedure defined in [<a href="./rfc8271" title='"Updates to the Resource Reservation Protocol for Fast Reroute of Traffic Engineering GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC8271</a>].  The
      upstream node uses the bypass assignment information (namely,
      bypass tunnel source address, destination address, and Tunnel ID)
      in the received RSVP Path message of the protected forward LSP to

      find the associated bypass tunnel in the reverse direction.  The
      upstream PLR node MUST NOT add the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in
      the RRO of the RSVP Path message of the reverse LSP.

   o  The downstream PLR node initiates the bypass tunnel assignment for
      the forward LSP.  The upstream PLR (forward-direction LSP MP) node
      reflects the associated bypass tunnel assignment for the reverse-
      direction LSP.  The upstream PLR node MUST NOT initiate the bypass
      tunnel assignment.

   o  If the indicated forward bypass tunnel or the associated reverse
      bypass tunnel is not found, the upstream PLR SHOULD send a Notify
      message [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] with Error Code "FRR Bypass Assignment Error"
      (value 44) and Sub-code "Bypass Tunnel Not Found" (value 1)
      [<a href="./rfc8271" title='"Updates to the Resource Reservation Protocol for Fast Reroute of Traffic Engineering GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC8271</a>] to the downstream PLR.

   o  If the bypass tunnel cannot be used as described in <a href="./rfc8271#section-4.5.3">Section 4.5.3
      of [RFC8271]</a>, the upstream PLR SHOULD send a Notify message
      [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] with Error Code "FRR Bypass Assignment Error" (value 44)

   o  After a link or node failure, the PLR nodes in both forward and
      reverse directions trigger fast reroute independently using the
      procedures defined in [<a href="./rfc4090" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC4090</a>] and send the forward and protected
      reverse LSP modified RSVP Path messages and traffic over the
      bypass tunnel.  The RSVP Resv signaling of the protected forward
      and reverse LSPs follows the same procedure as defined in
      [<a href="./rfc4090" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC4090</a>] and is not modified by this document.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.1.%20%20Restoring%20Co-routing%20with%20Node%20Protection%20Bypass%20Tunnels"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1" id="section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Restoring Co-routing with Node Protection Bypass Tunnels</span>

   After fast reroute, the downstream MP node assumes the role of
   upstream PLR and reroutes the reverse LSP RSVP Path messages and
   traffic over the bypass tunnel on which the forward LSP RSVP Path
   messages and traffic are received.  This procedure is defined as
   "restoring co-routing" in [<a href="./rfc8271" title='"Updates to the Resource Reservation Protocol for Fast Reroute of Traffic Engineering GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC8271</a>].  This procedure is used to
   ensure that both forward and reverse LSP signaling and traffic flow
   on the same bidirectional bypass tunnel after fast reroute.

   As shown in Figure 2, when using a node protection bypass tunnel with
   protected co-routed LSPs, asymmetry of paths can occur in the forward
   and reverse directions after a link failure [<a href="./rfc8271" title='"Updates to the Resource Reservation Protocol for Fast Reroute of Traffic Engineering GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC8271</a>].  In order to
   restore co-routing, the downstream MP node D (acting as an upstream
   PLR) MUST trigger the procedure to restore co-routing and reroute the
   protected reverse LSP2 RSVP Path messages and traffic over the bypass
   tunnel S (on path D-G-F-B) to the upstream MP node B upon receiving
   the protected forward LSP modified RSVP Path messages and traffic

   over the bypass tunnel S (on path D-G-F-B) from node B.  The upstream
   PLR node C stops receiving the RSVP Path messages and traffic for the
   reverse LSP2 from node D (resulting in RSVP soft-state timeout), and
   it stops sending the RSVP Path messages for the reverse LSP2 over the
   bypass tunnel N (on path C-I-H-A) to node A.

   The unidirectional link failures can cause co-routed associated
   bidirectional LSPs to be no longer co-routed after fast reroute with
   both link protection and node protection bypass tunnels.  However,
   the unidirectional link failures in the upstream and/or downstream
   directions do not result in RSVP soft-state timeout with the
   associated bidirectional LSPs as upstream and downstream PLRs trigger
   fast reroute independently.  The asymmetry of forward and reverse LSP
   paths due to the unidirectional link failure in the downstream
   direction can be corrected by using the procedure to restore co-
   routing specified in <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>.

   When the revertive behavior is desired for a protected LSP after the
   link is restored, the procedure defined in <a href="./rfc4090#section-6.5.2">Section 6.5.2 of [RFC4090]</a>
   is followed.

   o  The downstream PLR node starts sending the RSVP Path messages and
      traffic flow of the protected forward LSP over the restored link
      and stops sending them over the bypass tunnel [<a href="./rfc4090" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC4090</a>].

   o  The upstream PLR node (when the protected LSP is present) also
      starts sending the RSVP Path messages and traffic flow of the
      protected reverse LSPs over the restored link and stops sending
      them over the bypass tunnel [<a href="./rfc4090" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC4090</a>].

   o  For node protection bypass tunnels (see Figure 2), after restoring
      co-routing, the upstream PLR node D SHOULD start sending RSVP Path
      messages and traffic for the reverse LSP over the original link
      (C-D) when it receives the unmodified RSVP Path messages and
      traffic for the protected forward LSP over it and stops sending
      them over the bypass tunnel S (on path D-G-F-B).

   Fast reroute bidirectional bypass tunnels can be single-sided or

   need to be configured on the downstream PLR nodes of the protected

   LSPs that initiate the bypass tunnel assignments.  For single-sided
   associated bypass tunnels, these nodes are the originating endpoints
   of their signaling.

   The fast reroute signaling procedure defined in this document can be

   and one-to-one backup described in <a href="./rfc4090#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC4090]</a>.  As
   described in <a href="./rfc8271#section-4.5.2">Section 4.5.2 of [RFC8271]</a>, in the one-to-one backup
   method, if the associated bidirectional bypass tunnel is already in
   use at the upstream PLR, it SHOULD send a Notify message [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>]
   with Error Code "FRR Bypass Assignment Error" (value 44) and Sub-code

   In order to associate the LSPs unambiguously at a midpoint node (see
   Figure 3), the endpoint node MUST signal the Extended ASSOCIATION
   Object and add a unique Extended Association ID for each associated
   forward and reverse LSP pair forming the bidirectional LSP.  An
   endpoint node MAY set the Extended Association ID to the value
   formatted according to the structure shown in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   o  For single-sided provisioned bidirectional LSPs [<a href="./rfc7551" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC7551</a>], the
      originating endpoint signals the Extended ASSOCIATION Object with
      a unique Extended Association ID.  The remote endpoint copies the
      contents of the received Extended ASSOCIATION Object including the
      Extended Association ID in the RSVP Path message of the reverse
      LSP's Extended ASSOCIATION Object.

   o  For double-sided provisioned bidirectional LSPs [<a href="./rfc7551" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC7551</a>], both
      endpoints need to ensure that the bidirectional LSP has a unique
      Extended ASSOCIATION Object for each forward and reverse LSP pair
      by selecting appropriate unique Extended Association IDs signaled
      by them.  A controller can be used to provision a unique Extended
      Association ID on both endpoints.  The procedure for selecting
      unique Extended Association IDs is outside the scope of this
      document.

   The Extended Association ID in the Extended ASSOCIATION Object
   [<a href="./rfc6780" title='"RSVP ASSOCIATION Object Extensions"'>RFC6780</a>] can be set to the value formatted according to the
   structure shown in the following example to uniquely identify
   associated forward and reverse LSP pairs of an associated
   bidirectional LSP.

   An example of the IPv4 Extended Association ID format is shown below:
