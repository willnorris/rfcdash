Abstract

   This document defines the procedures for IANA to administer and
   maintain the Object Identifier (OID) tree under the Remote Monitoring
   (rmon) root.  This memo also documents the currently assigned values.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The RMONMIB Working Group so far has maintained its own registry for
   OID assignments for new MIB modules under the root OID for rmon
   [<a href="./rfc2819" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base"'>RFC2819</a>].  This has worked reasonably well, although errors had to
   be corrected at a late stage one or two times, and a few now defunct
   assignments have been made as well.

   It is also a somewhat non-standard way of doing things, because
   normally a new standards track MIB module will get a MIB root
   assigned at the time that the module is being published as part of an
   RFC.

   This document lists the currently assigned rmon OIDs.  It also
   describes the procedures and rules for new assignments and asks IANA
   to take over the responsibility for existing and future assignments.

   The current assignments are not all too logical.  Initially normal
   MIB OIDs were assigned under rmon, but at a later time the WG used
   the rmon root OID to create new MIB modules underneath it.  Some

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3737">RFC 3737</a>         IANA Guidelines for the RMON Registry        April 2004</span>


   people will claim 'an OID is just an OID', and while this is true, it
   does not make things easier if the organisation of OIDs is not
   logical.  However, we cannot change what has been assigned in the
   past.  From now on, only MODULE-IDENTITY macro (MIB root) assignments
   will be made (by IANA) under the 'rmon' node.  Within a MIB module,
   the working group authors/editors can then assign their own OIDs
   according to normal procedures.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Currently%20assigned%20OIDs%20under%20the%20rmon%20root"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Currently assigned OIDs under the rmon root</span>

   At the time of this writing, the following OIDs have been assigned
   and IANA has picked up this information in their public registry of
   assigned values.  They are listed as part of the already existing
   smi-numbers registry at:

       <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers">http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers</a>

       ...mib-2.rmon (1.3.6.1.2.1.16)

   The assignments under ...mib-2.rmon were maintained by the RMONMIB
   Working Group until publication of <a href="./rfc3737">RFC 3737</a>.  Some (early)
   assignments may not look all too logical.  That is true, but that is
   history and cannot be changed.  From now on, only MODULE-IDENTITY
   macro (MIB root) assignments will be made (by IANA) under the 'rmon'
   node.

   When anyone is writing a internet-draft for which a new assignment is
   needed/wanted under the rmon OID, then the proper way to do so is as
   follows:

      EXAMPLE-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

      IMPORTS
        rmon          FROM RMON-MIB

        .. other imports ..

      exampleMIB  MODULE-IDENTITY

        ... other normal MODULE-IDENTITY stuff ...

      ::= { rmon nnn }  -- IANA: please assign nnn
                        -- RFC-Editor: replace nnn with IANA-assigned
                        --             number and remove this note

   IANA will assign the number as part of the RFC publication process.

   IANA has picked up the initial set of assignments and integrated them
   into the existing registry for smi-numbers at:

      <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers">http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers</a>

   The list is presented in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.

   IANA is requested to maintain this registry for future assignments.
   New assignments can only be made via Standards Action as described in
   [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC2434</a>].

   IANA will assign the number as part of the RFC publication process.
