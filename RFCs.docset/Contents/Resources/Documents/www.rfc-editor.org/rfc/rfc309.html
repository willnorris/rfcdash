              DATA AND FILE TRANSFER WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT
              --------------------------------------------

        MIT will host a workshop on Data and File Transfer, Friday,
   April 14 and Saturday, April 15, 1972.  People have expressed an
   interest in revising the existing ARPANET Data and File Transfer
   Protocols (RFC # 264 and RFC # 265), to make them more suitable
   to fulfill the now better understood ARPANET requirements.

        The objective of this workshop is to arrive at a unified
   convention for ARPANET data and file transfer.  It is important
   that we adequately consider the needs of TIP users, DATACOMPUTER
   users, remote job entry users, and the major ARPANET service
   systems.

        In addition to the current members of the data and file
   transfer protocol committee, I have invited a number of
   interested parties to talk and participate in this workshop.  On
   the first day's agenda is a list of speakers who have agreed to
   discuss their respective interests in data and file transfer.  If
   your interests have not been represented and you would like to
   give a presentation or discuss a specific area, please contact me
   (617-864-6900 Ext. 1428).

        Participants are encouraged to have written position papers
   ready at the time of this meeting.  If possible, these papers
   should be distributed as NWG/RFCs or informal notes to workshop
   invitees, prior to the workshop.

        As this meeting is intended to be an intensive workshop,
   with the second half devoted to a detailed specification of
   protocol, it will be necessary to limit attendance.  The
   attendance to this meeting is by invitation only.  A list of
   invitees is attached.  If you have not been invited, and would
   like to attend the workshop, please contact me.

        Hotel reservations may be made at Random House, operated by
   MIT's Real Estate office ($5.00 to $7.00/night), by contacting
   either me or Sue Pitkin (617-864-6900 Ext. 1450)  before March
   31st.  If you would prefer other hotel accomodations instead, a
   convenient hotel is the Fenway motor Hotel (Tel. 617-492-4777).

        Please contact either me or Sue Pitkin if you intend to come.

                 Tentative List of Items for Discussion
                 --------------------------------------

   Data Transfer Protocol (DTP)
   ----------------------------

        - DTP vs TELNET.  Concept of extended TELNET, or
             allowing use of ASCII in DTP.

        - Error Control and recovery in DTP (use of
             error checks, restart, etc.)

        - Modes available -- handshake, only one mode, or use
             of default.

        - Information separator, Aborts, and the Use
             of Close (NCP-CLS) to Separate Information.

        - Use of DTP with TIPs

        - Use of DTP with DATACOMPUTER


   File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
   ----------------------------

        - Use of ICP, inter-mixing data and control,
             transferring files to third connections
             (possibly to different sites)

        - The command language ASCII or codes

        - Handling of data types and physical storage.

        - Handling of descriptors and logical structure

        - Error control and error recovery

        - Use of FTP with TIPs

        - Use of FTP with DATACOMPUTER

        - Uniform Pathnames and the ARPANET virtual file system.
