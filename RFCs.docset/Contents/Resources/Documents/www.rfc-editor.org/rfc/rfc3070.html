   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) describes a mechanism to tunnel
   Point-to-Point (PPP) sessions.  The protocol has been designed to be
   independent of the media it runs over.  The base specification
   describes how it should be implemented to run over the User Datagram
   Protocol (UDP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).  This document
   describes how L2TP is implemented over Frame Relay Permanent Virtual
   Circuits (PVCs) and Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs).

Applicability

   This specification is intended for those implementations which desire
   to use facilities which are defined for L2TP and  applies only to the
   use of Frame Relay pont-to-point circuits.

   L2TP [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 'L2TP'&quot;">1</a>] defines a general purpose mechanism for tunneling PPP over
   various media.  By design, it insulates L2TP operation from the
   details of the media over which it operates.  The base protocol
   specification illustrates how L2TP may be used in IP environments.
   This document specifies the encapsulation of L2TP over native Frame
   Relay and addresses relevant issues.

   In this section we describe in high level terms the scope of the
   problem being addressed.  Topology:

         +------+           +---------------+          |
         | PSTN |           |  Frame Relay  |          |
   User--|      |----LAC ===|               |=== LNS --+ LANs
         | ISDN |           |     Cloud     |          |
         +------+           +---------------+          |

   An L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) is a device attached to the
   switched network fabric (e.g., PSTN or ISDN) or co-located with a PPP
   end system capable of handling the L2TP protocol.  The LAC need only
   implement the media over which L2TP is to operate to pass traffic to
   one or more LNS's.  It may tunnel any protocol carried within PPP.

   L2TP Network Server (LNS) operates on any platform capable of PPP
   termination.  The LNS handles the server side of the L2TP protocol.
   L2TP is connection-oriented.  The LNS and LAC maintain state for each
   user that is attached to an LAC.  A session is created when an end-
   to-end PPP connection is attempted between a user and the LNS.  The
   datagrams related to a session are sent over the tunnel between the
   LAC and LNS.  A tunnel is defined by an LNS-LAC pair.  The tunnel
   carries PPP datagrams between the LAC and the LNS.

   L2TP protocol operates at a level above the particular media over
   which it is carried.  However, some details of its connection to
   media are required to permit interoperable implementations.  L2TP
   over IP/UDP is described in the base L2TP specification [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 'L2TP'&quot;">1</a>].  Issues
   related to L2TP over Frame Relay are addressed in later sections of
   this document.

   L2TP MUST be able to share a Frame Relay virtual circuit (VC) with
   other protocols carried over the same VC.  The Frame Relay header
   format for data packet needs to be defined to identify the protocol
   being carried in the packets.  The Frame Relay network may not
   understand these formats.

   All protocols over this circuit MUST encapsulate their packets within
   a Q.922 frame.  Additionally, frames must contain information
   necessary to identify the protocol carried within the frame relay
   Protocol Data Unit (PDU), thus allowing the receiver to properly
   process the incoming packet.

   The frame format for L2TP MUST be SNAP encapsulation as defined in
   <a href="./rfc1490">RFC 1490</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Multiprotocol Interconnect over Frame Relay"'>6</a>] and FRF3.1 [<a href="#ref-3" title=" Frame Relay Forum Technical Committee">3</a>].  SNAP format uses NLPID followed by
   Organizationally Unique Identifier and a PID.

   NLPID

   The single octet identifier provides a mechanism to allow easy
   protocol identification.  For L2TP NLPID value 0x80 is used which
   indicates the presence of SNAP header.

   OUI &amp; PID

   The three-octet Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) 0x00-00-5E
   identifies IANA who administers the meaning of the Protocol
   Identifier (PID) 0x0007.  Together they identify a distinct protocol.

   Format of L2TP frames encapsulated in Frame Relay is given in Figure
   1.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.0%20MTU%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.0" id="section-5.0">5.0</a> MTU Considerations</span>

   FRF.12 [<a href="#ref-5" title=" Frame Relay Forum Technical Committee">5</a>] is the Frame Relay Fragmentation Implementation Agreement.
   If fragmentation is not supported, the two Frame Relay endpoints MUST
   support an MTU size of at least 1526 which is based on adding the PPP
   Max-Receive-Unit size with the PPP header size with the Max L2TP
   Header Size with the Frame Relay header size (PPP header size is the
   protocol field size plus HDLC framing bytes, which is required by
   L2TP).  To avoid packet discards on the Frame Relay interface, the
   RECOMMENDED default Frame Relay MTU is 1564 based on a PPP default
   MRU of 1500.  The means to ensure these MTU settings are left to
   implementation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.0%20QOS%20Issues"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.0" id="section-6.0">6.0</a> QOS Issues</span>

   In general, QoS mechanisms can be roughly provided for with
   proprietary mechanisms localized within the LAC or LNS.  QoS
   considerations are beyond the scope of this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.0%20Frame%20Relay%20and%20L2TP%20Interaction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.0" id="section-7.0">7.0</a> Frame Relay and L2TP Interaction</span>

   In case of Frame Relay SVCs, connection setup will be triggered when
   L2TP tries to create a tunnel.  Details of triggering mechanism are
   left to implementation.  There SHALL NOT be any change in Frame Relay
   SVC signaling due to L2TP.  The endpoints of the L2TP tunnel MUST be
   identified by X.121/E.164 addresses in case of Frame Relay SVC.
   These addresses MAY be obtained as tunnel endpoints for a user as
   defined in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"RADIUS Attributes for Tunnel Protocol Support"'>4</a>].  In case of PVCs, the Virtual Circuit to carry L2TP
   traffic MAY be configured administratively.  The endpoints of the
   tunnel MUST be identified by DLCI, assigned to the PVC at
   configuration time.  This DLCI MAY be obtained as tunnel endpoints
   for a user as defined in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"RADIUS Attributes for Tunnel Protocol Support"'>4</a>].

   There SHALL be no framing issues between PPP and Frame Relay.  PPP
   frames received by LAC from remote user are stripped of CRC, link
   framing, and transparency bytes, encapsulated in L2TP, and forwarded
   over Frame Relay tunnel.

   Currently there is no standard specification for Frame Relay security
   although the Frame Relay Forum is working on a Frame Relay Privacy
   Agreement.  In light of this work, the issue of security will be re-
   examined at a later date to see if L2TP over Frame Relay specific
   protection mechanisms are still required.  In the interim, basic
   security issues are discussed in the base L2TP specification [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 'L2TP'&quot;">1</a>].
