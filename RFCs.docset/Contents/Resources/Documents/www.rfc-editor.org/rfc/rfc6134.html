                <span class="h1">Sieve Extension: Externally Stored Lists</span>

Abstract

   The Sieve email filtering language can be used to implement email
   whitelisting, blacklisting, personal distribution lists, and other
   sorts of list matching.  Currently, this requires that all members of
   such lists be hard-coded in the script itself.  Whenever a member of
   a list is added or deleted, the script needs to be updated and
   possibly uploaded to a mail server.

   This document defines a Sieve extension for accessing externally
   stored lists -- lists whose members are stored externally to the
   script, such as using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP), the Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP), vCard
   Extensions to WebDAV (CardDAV), or relational databases.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document specifies an extension to the Sieve language [<a href="./rfc5228" title='"Sieve: An Email Filtering Language"'>RFC5228</a>]
   for checking membership in an external list or for redirecting
   messages to an external list of recipients.  An "external list" is a
   list whose members are stored externally to the Sieve script, such as
   using LDAP [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>], ACAP [<a href="./rfc2244" title='"ACAP -- Application Configuration Access Protocol"'>RFC2244</a>], CardDAV [<a href="#ref-CardDAV" title='"vCard Extensions to WebDAV (CardDAV)"'>CardDAV</a>], or
   relational databases.

   This extension adds a new match type to apply to supported tests and
   a new tagged argument to the "redirect" action.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Conventions%20Used%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   Conventions for notations are as in <a href="./rfc5228#section-1.1">[RFC5228], Section 1.1</a>, including
   the use of ABNF [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Extlists%20Extension"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Extlists Extension</span>

   The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
   document is "extlists".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20%3Alist%20Match%20Type%20for%20Supported%20Tests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  :list Match Type for Supported Tests</span>

   ABNF:

         MATCH-TYPE  =/ ":list"
              ; only valid for supported tests

   The new ":list" match type changes the interpretation of the "key-
   list" parameter (the second parameter) in supported tests.  When the
   match type is ":list", the key-list becomes a list of names of
   externally stored lists.  The external lists are queried, perhaps
   through a list-specific mechanism, and the test evaluates to "true"
   if any of the specified values matches any member of one or more of
   the lists.

   Comparators are not allowed together with the ":list" match type, so
   if both are specified in a test, that MUST result in an error.
   Queries done through list-specific mechanisms might have the effect

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6134">RFC 6134</a>        Sieve Extension: Externally Stored Lists       July 2011</span>


   of built-in comparators; for example, queries to certain lists might
   be case-sensitive, while queries to other lists might be done without
   regard to case.

   Implementations MUST support the use of ":list" in "address",
   "envelope", and "header" tests.  Implementations that include the
   Variables extension [<a href="./rfc5229" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Variables Extension"'>RFC5229</a>] MUST also support its use in "string"
   tests.

   Implementations MAY support other tests than the ones in this
   document.  Implementations MUST report an error when a script uses
   ":list" with a test that does not support ":list".  This error SHOULD
   be reported at compile-time but MAY be reported at run-time.  To
   maintain interoperability, other tests that can be used with ":list"
   SHOULD be documented in a specification that defines a capability
   string that can be tested (in a "require" statement or using "ihave"
   [<a href="./rfc5463" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Ihave Extension"'>RFC5463</a>]).

   For example, testing 'header ["to", "cc"]' against a list would cause
   each "to" and "cc" value, ignoring leading and trailing whitespace,
   to be queried.  If any value is found to belong to the list, the test
   returns "true".  If no value belongs to the list, the test returns
   "false".  Once a value is found in the list, there is no need for the
   query mechanism to look further.

   For some lists, the Sieve engine might directly retrieve the list and
   make its own comparison.  Other lists might not work that way -- they
   might provide a way to ask if a value is in the list, but not permit
   retrieval of the list itself.  It is up to the Sieve implementation
   to understand how to interact with any supported list.  If the Sieve
   engine is permanently unable to query the list (perhaps because the
   list doesn't support the required operation), the test MUST result in
   a runtime error in the Sieve script.

   See <a href="#section-2.5">Section 2.5</a> for the detailed description of syntax used for
   naming externally stored lists.

   The ":list" match type uses the concept of "match variables" as
   defined in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> of the Variables extension [<a href="./rfc5229" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Variables Extension"'>RFC5229</a>].
   Implementations that also support that extension MUST set the ${0}
   match variable to the value in the list that matched the query.
   Other numbered match variables (${1}, ${2}, and so on) MAY be set
   with list-specific information that might be of use to the script.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6134">RFC 6134</a>        Sieve Extension: Externally Stored Lists       July 2011</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20%3Alist%20Tagged%20Argument%20to%20the%20%22redirect%22%20Action"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  :list Tagged Argument to the "redirect" Action</span>

   Usage:  redirect :list &lt;ext-list-name: string&gt;

   The "redirect" action with the ":list" argument is used to send the
   message to the set of email addresses in the externally stored list
   named by the ext-list-name string.  This variant of the redirect
   command can be used to implement a personal distribution list.

   For this feature to work, one of the following conditions has to be
   true:

   1.  The list resolves to a list of email addresses, and the Sieve
       engine is able to enumerate those addresses.

   2.  The list handler is able to take care of the redirection on
       behalf of the Sieve engine.

   In cases where, for example, a list contains hashed email address
   values or an email address pattern ("sz*@example.com",
   "*+ietf@example.net"), the Sieve engine will not be able to redirect
   to that list, and responsibility must pass to the list handler.

   If neither the Sieve engine nor the list handler can enumerate (or
   iterate) the list, or the list does not resolve to email addresses,
   the situation MUST result in a runtime error in the Sieve script.

   See <a href="#section-2.5">Section 2.5</a> for the detailed description of syntax used for
   naming externally stored lists.

   The uses for external lists specified here represent known cases and
   situations at the time of this writing.  Other uses for external
   lists, employing other Sieve features, might be devised in the
   future, and such uses can be described in extensions to this
   document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.%20%20Syntax%20of%20an%20Externally%20Stored%20List%20Name"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5" id="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Syntax of an Externally Stored List Name</span>

   A name of an externally stored list is always an absolute URI
   [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].  Implementations might find URIs such as LDAP [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>],
   CardDAV [<a href="#ref-CardDAV" title='"vCard Extensions to WebDAV (CardDAV)"'>CardDAV</a>], or "tag" [<a href="./rfc4151" title="&quot;The 'tag' URI Scheme&quot;">RFC4151</a>] to be useful for naming
   external lists.

   The "tag" URI scheme [<a href="./rfc4151" title="&quot;The 'tag' URI Scheme&quot;">RFC4151</a>] can be used to represent opaque, but
   more user-friendly identifiers.  Resolution of such identifiers is
   going to be implementation specific and it can help in hiding the

   complexity of an implementation from end users.  For example, an
   implementation can provide a web interface for managing lists of
   users stored in LDAP.  Requiring users to know generic LDAP URI
   syntax might not be very practical, due to its complexity.  An
   implementation can instead use a fixed tag URI prefix such as "tag:
   example.com,&lt;date&gt;:" (where &lt;date&gt; can be, for example, a date
   generated once on installation of the web interface and left
   untouched upon upgrades), and the prefix doesn't even need to be
   shown to end users.

   The "addrbook" URNs defined in <a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a> (in particular, the
   reserved URI "urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:default") MUST be
   supported.  To make it easier to use registered Sieve URN parameters,
   we define a shorthand way to specify them in a Sieve script: a list
   name that begins with ":" is taken as referencing a Sieve URN
   parameter, with the initial ":" expanding to
   "urn:ietf:params:sieve:".  So we have the following equivalences:

      :addrbook:default == urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:default

      :addrbook:personal == urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:personal

   and so on.

   The mandatory-to-implement URI

      urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:default

   gives access to the user's default address book (usually the user's
   personal address book).  Note that these are URIs, subject to normal
   URI encoding rules, including percent-encoding.  The reserved name
   "default" MUST be considered case-insensitive after decoding.  That
   means that the following URIs are all equivalent:

      :addrbook:default

      :ADDRBOOK:DEFAULT

      :aDdRbOOk:DeFauLt

      :AddrBook:%44%65%66ault

   Address book names other than "default" MAY be case-sensitive,
   depending upon the implementation, so their case (after URI decoding)
   MUST be maintained.

   It's possible that a server will have no access to anything
   resembling an address book (perhaps in an implementation where
   address books are only client-side things), but the server can still
   provide access to other sorts of lists -- consider the list of dates
   in Example 2 (<a href="#section-2.9.2">Section 2.9.2</a>), or lists of important keywords and the
   like.  It might sometimes make sense to map ":addrbook:default" into
   some available list, but that might not always be reasonable.  If
   there really is no concept of an address book in a particular server
   implementation, the server MAY support ":addrbook:default" by having
   all matches to it fail.  Such an implementation SHOULD NOT be done
   except as a last resort.

   Queries against address books SHOULD be done without regard to case.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.6.%20%20Definition%20of%20%22addrbook%22%20URN%20Parameter"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6" id="section-2.6">2.6</a>.  Definition of "addrbook" URN Parameter</span>

   This section gives the details of the "addrbook" Sieve URN parameter
   that's registered in <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>.  URIs that use this parameter begin
   with "urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:".

   URN parameter name:  addrbook

   URN parameter syntax:  The "addrbook" parameter is defined by the
       &lt;addrbook-urn&gt; rule, defined using ABNF [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>]:

          addrbook-urn = "addrbook:" addrbook [ "?" extensions ]
          addrbook = segment
               ; &lt;segment&gt; defined in [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>]
          extensions = query
               ; &lt;query&gt; defined in [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>]

   Intended usage:  "addrbook" URNs are used for designating references
   to address books.  An address book is a concept used by different
   applications (such as Sieve interpreters) for describing a list of
   named entries, and may be translated into other types of address
   books, such as LDAP groups.  Address books may be private or shared;
   they may be personal, organizational, or perhaps even "crowdsourced".

   The address book name (the "addrbook" element in the ABNF above)
   refers to a specifically named address book, as defined by the
   implementation.  A user might, for example, have access to a number
   of different address books, such as a personal one, a family one, a
   company one, and one for the town where the user lives.

   The extension information (the "extensions" element in the ABNF
   above) is available for use in future extensions.  It might allow for
   things such as dynamic subsets of an address book -- for example,
   something such as this might be defined in the future:

       urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:personal?name.contains=fred

       There are no extensions defined at this time.

       An "addrbook" URN is designed to be used by applications for
       referencing address books.  Each URN is intended to represent a
       grouping of addresses that can be logically thought of as one
       "book".  Any given address can belong to more than one book --
       that is, can be referred to by more than one URN.

       The URI "urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook" has no meaning in
       itself.  It MUST be used with sub-parameters representing the
       address book name and extension information, as shown in the ABNF
       above.

       The sub-parameter "default" (creating the URN
       "urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:default") is a reserved (case-
       insensitive) name that MUST be implemented, representing a
       default grouping (book) of addresses.  Other names, representing
       the same or other groupings MAY be implemented.  For example, an
       implementation might use the following sub-parameters:

       *   personal -- a book representing the user's personal address
           book.

       *   friends -- a subset of
           urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:personal, defined by the user.

       *   family -- a subset of
           urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:personal, defined by the user.

       *   company -- a book representing the user's company's address
           book.

       *   department -- a subset of
           urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:company, defined by the
           company.

       *   co-workers -- a subset of
           urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:company, defined by the user.

       *   default -- the default address book, a reference to
           urn:ietf:params:sieve:addrbook:personal.

   Interoperability considerations:  Applications are only REQUIRED to
       support "addrbook:default", where all cases and encodings of
       "default" are considered equivalent.  Address book names other
       than "default" MAY be case-sensitive, depending upon the

   This example uses a personal address book, along with the Spamtest
   [<a href="./rfc5235" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Spamtest and Virustest Extensions"'>RFC5235</a>] and Relational [<a href="./rfc5231" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Relational Extension"'>RFC5231</a>] extensions to give a different

   This example uses variable matching [<a href="./rfc5229" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Variables Extension"'>RFC5229</a>] to extract the IP
   address from the last "Received" header field.  It then checks that
   against a "block list" of undesirable IP addresses, and rejects the

   This example uses several features of the MIME parts extension
   [<a href="./rfc5703" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: MIME Part Tests, Iteration, Extraction, Replacement, and Enclosure"'>RFC5703</a>] to scan for unsafe attachment types.  To make it easily
   extensible, the unsafe types are kept in an external list, which
   would be shared among all users and all scripts, avoiding the need to
   change scripts when the list changes.

   Security considerations related to the "address"/"envelope"/"header"
   tests and "redirect" action discussed in Sieve [<a href="./rfc5228" title='"Sieve: An Email Filtering Language"'>RFC5228</a>] also apply
   to this document.

   External list memberships ought to be treated as if they are an
   integral part of the script, so a temporary failure to access an
   external list SHOULD be handled in the same way as a temporary
   failure to retrieve the Sieve script itself.

   For example, if the Sieve script is stored in the Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>] and the script can't be retrieved
   when a message is processed (perhaps the LDAP server is unavailable),
   then the Sieve engine might delay message delivery until the script
   can be retrieved successfully.  Similarly, if an external list is
   stored in LDAP and that LDAP server is unavailable, the Sieve engine
   would take the same action -- delay message delivery and try again
   later.

<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-13"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6134">RFC 6134</a>        Sieve Extension: Externally Stored Lists       July 2011</span>


   Protocols/APIs used to retrieve/verify external list membership MUST
   provide an appropriate level of confidentiality and authentication.
   Usually, that will be at least the same level of confidentiality as
   protocols/APIs used to retrieve Sieve scripts, but only the
   implementation (or deployment) will know what is appropriate.
   There's a difference, for example, between making an LDAP request on
   a closed LAN that's only used for trusted servers (it may be that
   neither encryption nor authentication is needed), on a firewalled LAN
   internal to a company (it might be OK to skip encryption, depending
   upon policy), and on the open Internet (encryption and authentication
   are probably both required).  It also matters whether the list being
   accessed is private or public (no encryption or authentication may be
   needed for public data, even on the Internet).

   Having the processing and outcome of a Sieve script depend on the
   contents of external data can allow someone with control of the
   external data to have unusual, and perhaps unauthorized, control of
   the script -- and, consequently, of the disposition of the user's
   email.  A user using such a list for spam control, for example, might
   find important mail being discarded because of tampering with the
   list.  Someone using redirect to an external list could have her
   email redirected to the wrong eyes because of such tampering.
   Security and integrity protection of external lists is as important
   as protection of the Sieve script itself.

   Implementations of this extension should keep in mind that matching
   values against an externally stored list can be I/O and/or CPU
   intensive.  This can be used to deny service to the mail server
   and/or to servers providing access to externally stored mailing
   lists.  A naive implementation, such as the one that tries to
   retrieve content of the whole list to perform matching, can make this
   worse.

   But note that many protocols that can be used for accessing
   externally stored lists support flexible searching features that can
   be used to minimize network traffic and load on the directory
   service.  For example, LDAP allows for search filters.
   Implementations SHOULD use such features whenever they can.

   Many organizations support external lists with thousands of
   recipients.  In order to avoid mailbombs when redirecting a message
   to an externally stored list, implementations SHOULD enforce limits
   on the number of recipients and/or on domains to which such
   recipients belong.

   Note, in particular, that it can be too easy for a script to use
        redirect :list ":addrbook:default";
   to send messages to "everyone in your address book", and one can

   easily imagine both intentional and accidental abuse.  The situation
   can be even worse for, say, ":addrbook:corporate".  Warnings, as well
   as enforced limits, are appropriate here.

   Applications SHOULD ensure appropriate restrictions are in place to
   protect sensitive information that might be revealed by "addrbook"
   URNs from access or modification by untrusted sources.

   IANA has created a new registry under "Sieve Extensions" for Sieve
   URN Parameters.  Registration into this registry is according to the
   "Specification Required" policy [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].

   The registry contains the following two items:

   URN parameter name:  The name of the URN parameter.  If the name is
       "paramname", the resulting top-level URN will be
       "urn:ietf:params:sieve:paramname".

   Reference:  The document and section where the definition of the
       parameter can be found.  Be sure to include the section number as
       well as the document reference, so the documentation is easy to
       find.

   The documentation -- which will be in the referenced document and
   section, and will not be included in the registry -- MUST include the
   following information (see <a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a> for an example):

      URN parameter name:  The name of the URN parameter.

      URN parameter syntax:  The syntax of the parameter and any sub-
          parameters, which SHOULD be specified using ABNF [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].

      Intended usage:  A detailed description of how the parameter and
          any sub-parameters are expected to be used.  This is the place
          to define static sub-parameters, registries for sub-
          parameters, options, registries for options, and so on.

      Interoperability considerations:  Any notes specific to
          interoperability issues.  This is where to put mandatory-to-
          implement sub-parameters and the like.

      Security considerations:  Any notes specific to security and
          privacy issues.

      Contact:  Contact information, in case there are questions.
