Abstract

   The snoop file format provides a way to store and exchange datalink
   layer packet traces.  This document describes extensions to this file
   format to support new media.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC1761">RFC1761</a>] defines the snoop file format used to store captured
   network packets for tools that capture, display, and interpret
   network traffic.  The file format specifies a header containing the
   Datalink Type field that identifies the network's datalink type.
   This document defines new values for this field, as well as an IANA
   registry for future datalink types.

   In addition to the Datalink Type codes listed in [<a href="./rfc1761" title='"Snoop Version 2 Packet Capture File Format"'>RFC1761</a>], this
   document defines the following type codes for the corresponding
   media:

             Datalink Type           Code
             -------------           ----

             Fibre Channel           16
             ATM                     17
             ATM Classical IP        18
             IP over Infiniband      26

   The IP over Infiniband packet format is described in [<a href="#ref-IPoIB" title='"IP encapsulation and address resolution over InfiniBand networks"'>IPoIB</a>].

   This document created a new IANA registry named "Snoop Datalink
   Types" to hold the various possible 32-bit (4 octet) snoop datalink
   types.  This new registry holds the values previously defined in
   [<a href="./rfc1761" title='"Snoop Version 2 Packet Capture File Format"'>RFC1761</a>] and tabulated below:

             Datalink Type           Code
             -------------           ----

             IEEE 802.3              0
             IEEE 802.4 Token Bus    1
             IEEE 802.5 Token Ring   2
             IEEE 802.6 Metro Net    3
             Ethernet                4
             HDLC                    5
             Character Synchronous   6
             IBM Channel-to-Channel  7
             FDDI                    8
             Other                   9

   Additionally, the new registry also holds the values defined above in
   <a href="#section-2">section 2</a> of this document.

   All new allocations and assignments to this registry starting from
   code 27 will follow the First Come First Served policy outlined in
   [<a href="#ref-BCP0026" title="">BCP0026</a>].  Type codes up to 26 not defined by this section of the
   document (10-15 and 19-25) are considered reserved.

   The addition of new datalink type codes to the existing file format
   poses no known security risks.
