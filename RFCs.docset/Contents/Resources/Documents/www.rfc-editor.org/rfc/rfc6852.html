            <span class="h1">Affirmation of the Modern Paradigm for Standards</span>

Abstract

   On 29 August 2012, the leaders of the IEEE Standards Association, the
   IAB, the IETF, the Internet Society, and the W3C signed a statement
   affirming the importance of a jointly developed set of principles
   establishing a modern paradigm for global, open standards.  These
   principles have become known as the "OpenStand" principles.  This
   document contains the text of the affirmation that was signed.

   On 29 August 2012, the leaders of the IEEE Standards Association, the
   IAB, the IETF, the Internet Society, and the W3C signed a statement
   affirming the importance of a jointly developed set of principles
   establishing a modern paradigm for global, open standards.  These
   principles have become known as the "OpenStand" principles.

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document describes the five OpenStand principles.
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of this document contains the text of the signed
   affirmation of the five OpenStand principles.  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> contains a
   call for others to support the five OpenStand principles.

   Over the past several decades, the global economy has realized a huge
   bounty due to the Internet and the World Wide Web.  These could not
   have been possible without the innovations and standardization of
   many underlying technologies.  This standardization occurred with
   great speed and effectiveness only because of key characteristics of
   a modern global standards paradigm.  The affirmation below
   characterizes the principles that have led to this success as a means
   to ensure acceptance of standards activities that adhere to the
   principles.

   We embrace a modern paradigm for standards where the economics of
   global markets, fueled by technological advancements, drive global
   deployment of standards regardless of their formal status.

   In this paradigm standards support interoperability, foster global
   competition, are developed through an open participatory process, and
   are voluntarily adopted globally.  These voluntary standards serve as
   building blocks for products and services targeted at meeting the
   needs of the market and consumer, thereby driving innovation.
   Innovation in turn contributes to the creation of new markets and the
   growth and expansion of existing markets.

   Participation in the modern paradigm demands:

   1. Cooperation.  Respectful cooperation between standards
      organizations, whereby each respects the autonomy, integrity,
      processes, and intellectual property rules of the others.

   2. Adherence to principles.  Adherence to the five fundamental
      principles of standards development:

      * Due process.  Decisions are made with equity and fairness among
        participants.  No one party dominates or guides standards
        development.  Standards processes are transparent and
        opportunities exist to appeal decisions.  Processes for periodic
        standards review and updating are well defined.

      * Broad consensus.  Processes allow for all views to be considered
        and addressed, such that agreement can be found across a range
        of interests.

      * Transparency.  Standards organizations provide advance public
        notice of proposed standards development activities, the scope
        of work to be undertaken, and conditions for participation.
        Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in
        reaching those decisions are provided.  Public comment periods
        are provided before final standards approval and adoption.

      * Balance.  Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by
        any particular person, company or interest group.

      * Openness.  Standards processes are open to all interested and
        informed parties.

   3. Collective empowerment.  Commitment by affirming standards
      organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by
      striving for standards that:

      * are chosen and defined based on technical merit, as judged by
        the contributed expertise of each participant;

      * provide global interoperability, scalability, stability, and
        resiliency;

      * enable global competition;

      * serve as building blocks for further innovation; and

      * contribute to the creation of global communities, benefiting
        humanity.

   4. Availability.  Standards specifications are made accessible to all
      for implementation and deployment.  Affirming standards
      organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications
      that can be implemented under fair terms.  Given market diversity,
      fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair, reasonable, and
      non-discriminatory terms (FRAND).

   5. Voluntary adoption.  Standards are voluntarily adopted and success
      is determined by the market.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Affirmation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Affirmation</span>

   We embrace a modern paradigm for standards where the economics of
   global markets, fueled by technological advancements, drive global
   deployment of standards regardless of their formal status.

   In this paradigm standards support interoperability, foster global
   competition, are developed through an open participatory process, and
   are voluntarily adopted globally.  These voluntary standards serve as

   needs of the market and consumer, thereby driving innovation.
   Innovation in turn contributes to the creation of new markets and the
   growth and expansion of existing markets.

   By signing this statement, we affirm our support for and adherence to
   these principles.
