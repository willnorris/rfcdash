Abstract

   This document describes how the OpenPGP Message Format can be used to
   provide privacy and authentication using the Multipurpose Internet
   Mail Extensions (MIME) security content types described in <a href="./rfc1847">RFC 1847</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Work on integrating PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) with MIME [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>3</a>]
   (including the since withdrawn "application/pgp" content type) prior
   to <a href="./rfc2015">RFC 2015</a> suffered from a number of problems, the most significant
   of which is the inability to recover signed message bodies without
   parsing data structures specific to PGP.  <a href="./rfc2015">RFC 2015</a> makes use of the
   elegant solution proposed in <a href="./rfc1847">RFC 1847</a>, which defines security
   multipart formats for MIME.  The security multiparts clearly separate
   the signed message body from the signature, and have a number of
   other desirable properties.  This document revises <a href="./rfc2015">RFC 2015</a> to adopt
   the integration of PGP and MIME to the needs which emerged during the
   work on the OpenPGP specification.

   This document defines three content types for implementing security
   and privacy with OpenPGP: "application/pgp-encrypted",
   "application/pgp-signature" and "application/pgp-keys".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20OpenPGP%20data%20formats"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  OpenPGP data formats</span>

   OpenPGP implementations can generate either ASCII armor (described in
   [<a href="#ref-1" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>1</a>]) or 8-bit binary output when encrypting data, generating a
   digital signature, or extracting public key data.  The ASCII armor
   output is the REQUIRED method for data transfer.  This allows those
   users who do not have the means to interpret the formats described in
   this document to be able to extract and use the OpenPGP information
   in the message.

   When the amount of data to be transmitted requires that it be sent in
   many parts, the MIME message/partial mechanism SHOULD be used rather
   than the multi-part ASCII armor OpenPGP format.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Content-Transfer-Encoding%20restrictions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Content-Transfer-Encoding restrictions</span>

   Multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted are to be treated by agents
   as opaque, meaning that the data is not to be altered in any way [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted"'>2</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Gateways and MIME Security Multiparts"'>7</a>].  However, many existing mail gateways will detect if the next
   hop does not support MIME or 8-bit data and perform conversion to
   either Quoted-Printable or Base64.  This presents serious problems
   for multipart/signed, in particular, where the signature is
   invalidated when such an operation occurs.  For this reason all data
   signed according to this protocol MUST be constrained to 7 bits (8-
   bit data MUST be encoded using either Quoted-Printable or Base64).
   Note that this also includes the case where a signed object is also
   encrypted (see <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>).  This restriction will increase the
   likelihood that the signature will be valid upon receipt.

   Additionally, implementations MUST make sure that no trailing
   whitespace is present after the MIME encoding has been applied.

      Note: In most cases, trailing whitespace can either be removed, or
      protected by applying an appropriate content-transfer-encoding.
      However, special care must be taken when any header lines - either
      in MIME entity headers, or in embedded <a href="./rfc822">RFC 822</a> headers - are
      present which only consist of whitespace: Such lines must be
      removed entirely, since replacing them by empty lines would turn
      them into header delimiters, and change the semantics of the
      message.  The restrictions on whitespace are necessary in order to
      make the hash calculated invariant under the text and binary mode
      signature mechanisms provided by OpenPGP [<a href="#ref-1" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>1</a>].  Also, they help to
      avoid compatibility problems with PGP implementations which
      predate the OpenPGP specification.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3156">RFC 3156</a>               MIME Security with OpenPGP            August 2001</span>


      Note: If any line begins with the string "From ", it is strongly
      suggested that either the Quoted-Printable or Base64 MIME encoding
      be applied.  If Quoted-Printable is used, at least one of the
      characters in the string should be encoded using the hexadecimal
      coding rule.  This is because many mail transfer and delivery
      agents treat "From " (the word "from" followed immediately by a
      space character) as the start of a new message and thus insert a
      right angle-bracket (&gt;) in front of any line beginning with
      "From " to distinguish this case, invalidating the signature.

   Data that is ONLY to be encrypted is allowed to contain 8-bit
   characters and trailing whitespace and therefore need not undergo the
   conversion to a 7bit format, and the stripping of whitespace.

      Implementor's note: It cannot be stressed enough that applications
      using this standard follow MIME's suggestion that you "be
      conservative in what you generate, and liberal in what you
      accept."  In this particular case it means it would be wise for an
      implementation to accept messages with any content-transfer-
      encoding, but restrict generation to the 7-bit format required by
      this memo.  This will allow future compatibility in the event the
      Internet SMTP framework becomes 8-bit friendly.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20OpenPGP%20encrypted%20data"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  OpenPGP encrypted data</span>

   Before OpenPGP encryption, the data is written in MIME canonical
   format (body and headers).

   OpenPGP encrypted data is denoted by the "multipart/encrypted"
   content type, described in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted"'>2</a>], and MUST have a "protocol" parameter
   value of "application/pgp-encrypted".  Note that the value of the
   parameter MUST be enclosed in quotes.

   The multipart/encrypted MIME body MUST consist of exactly two body
   parts, the first with content type "application/pgp-encrypted".  This
   body contains the control information.  A message complying with this
   standard MUST contain a "Version: 1" field in this body.  Since the
   OpenPGP packet format contains all other information necessary for
   decrypting, no other information is required here.

   The second MIME body part MUST contain the actual encrypted data.  It
   MUST be labeled with a content type of "application/octet-stream".

   Example message:

   OpenPGP signed messages are denoted by the "multipart/signed" content
   type, described in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted"'>2</a>], with a "protocol" parameter which MUST have a
   value of "application/pgp-signature" (MUST be quoted).

   The "micalg" parameter for the "application/pgp-signature" protocol
   MUST contain exactly one hash-symbol of the format "pgp-&lt;hash-
   identifier&gt;", where &lt;hash-identifier&gt; identifies the Message
   Integrity Check (MIC) algorithm used to generate the signature.
   Hash-symbols are constructed from the text names registered in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>1</a>] or
   according to the mechanism defined in that document by converting the
   text name to lower case and prefixing it with the four characters
   "pgp-".

   Currently defined values are "pgp-md5", "pgp-sha1", "pgp-ripemd160",
   "pgp-md2", "pgp-tiger192", and "pgp-haval-5-160".

   The multipart/signed body MUST consist of exactly two parts.  The
   first part contains the signed data in MIME canonical format,
   including a set of appropriate content headers describing the data.

   The second body MUST contain the OpenPGP digital signature.  It MUST
   be labeled with a content type of "application/pgp-signature".



<span class="grey">Elkins, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3156">RFC 3156</a>               MIME Security with OpenPGP            August 2001</span>


      Note: Implementations can either generate "signatures of a
      canonical text document" or "signatures of a binary document", as
      defined in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>1</a>].  The restrictions on the signed material put forth
      in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> and in this section will make sure that the various
      MIC algorithm variants specified in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>1</a>] and [<a href="#ref-5" title='"PGP Message Exchange Formats"'>5</a>] will all produce
      the same result.

   When the OpenPGP digital signature is generated:

   (1)   The data to be signed MUST first be converted to its content-
         type specific canonical form.  For text/plain, this means
         conversion to an appropriate character set and conversion of
         line endings to the canonical &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; sequence.

   (2)   An appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding is then applied; see
         <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>.  In particular, line endings in the encoded data
         MUST use the canonical &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; sequence where appropriate
         (note that the canonical line ending may or may not be present
         on the last line of encoded data and MUST NOT be included in
         the signature if absent).

   (3)   MIME content headers are then added to the body, each ending
         with the canonical &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; sequence.

   (4)   As described in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> of this document, any trailing
         whitespace MUST then be removed from the signed material.

   (5)   As described in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted"'>2</a>], the digital signature MUST be calculated
         over both the data to be signed and its set of content headers.

   (6)   The signature MUST be generated detached from the signed data
         so that the process does not alter the signed data in any way.

      Note: The accepted OpenPGP convention is for signed data to end
      with a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; sequence.  Note that the &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; sequence
      immediately preceding a MIME boundary delimiter line is considered
      to be part of the delimiter in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>3</a>], 5.1.  Thus, it is not part of
      the signed data preceding the delimiter line.  An implementation
      which elects to adhere to the OpenPGP convention has to make sure
      it inserts a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; pair on the last line of the data to be
      signed and transmitted (signed message and transmitted message
      MUST be identical).

      &amp; It's generally a good idea to encode lines that begin with

   The "&amp;"s in the previous example indicate the portion of the data
   over which the signature was calculated.

   Upon receipt of a signed message, an application MUST:

   (1)   Convert line endings to the canonical &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; sequence before
         the signature can be verified.  This is necessary since the
         local MTA may have converted to a local end of line convention.

   (2)   Pass both the signed data and its associated content headers
         along with the OpenPGP signature to the signature verification
         service.

   Sometimes it is desirable to both digitally sign and then encrypt a
   message to be sent.  This protocol allows for two methods of
   accomplishing this task.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20RFC%201847%20Encapsulation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  <a href="./rfc1847">RFC 1847</a> Encapsulation</span>

   In [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted"'>2</a>], it is stated that the data is first signed as a
   multipart/signature body, and then encrypted to form the final
   multipart/encrypted body.  This is most useful for standard MIME-
   compliant message forwarding.

   Example:

         Content-Type: multipart/encrypted;
            protocol="application/pgp-encrypted"; boundary=foo

         --foo
         Content-Type: application/pgp-encrypted

   The OpenPGP packet format [<a href="#ref-1" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>1</a>] describes a method for signing and
   encrypting data in a single OpenPGP message.  This method is allowed
   in order to reduce processing overhead and increase compatibility
   with non-MIME implementations of OpenPGP.  The resulting data is
   formatted as a "multipart/encrypted" object as described in <a href="#section-4">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-4">4</a>.

   Messages which are encrypted and signed in this combined fashion are
   REQUIRED to follow the same canonicalization rules as
   multipart/signed objects.

   It is explicitly allowed for an agent to decrypt a combined message
   and rewrite it as a multipart/signed object using the signature data
   embedded in the encrypted version.

   Signatures of a canonical text document as defined in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>1</a>] ignore
   trailing white space in signed material.  Implementations which
   choose to use signatures of canonical text documents will not be able
   to detect the addition of whitespace in transit.

   This document relies on the work of the IETF's OpenPGP Working
   Group's definitions of the OpenPGP Message Format.  The OpenPGP
   message format is currently described in <a href="./rfc2440">RFC 2440</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>1</a>].

   Special thanks are due: to Philip Zimmermann for his original and
   ongoing work on PGP; to Charles Breed, Jon Callas and Dave Del Torto
   for originally proposing the formation of the OpenPGP Working Group;
   and to Steve Schoenfeld for helpful feedback during the draft
   process.  The authors would also like to thank the engineers at
   Pretty Good Privacy, Inc (now Network Associates, Inc), including
   Colin Plumb, Hal Finney, Jon Callas, Mark Elrod, Mark Weaver and
   Lloyd Chambers, for their technical commentary.

   Additional thanks are due to Jeff Schiller and Derek Atkins for their
   continuing support of strong cryptography and PGP freeware at MIT; to
   Rodney Thayer of Sable Technology; to John Noerenberg, Steve Dorner
   and Laurence Lundblade of the Eudora team at QUALCOMM, Inc; to Bodo
   Moeller for proposing the approach followed with respect to trailing
   whitespace; to John Gilmore, Hugh Daniel and Fred Ringel (at
   Rivertown) and Ian Bell (at Turnpike) for their timely critical
   commentary; and to the international members of the IETF's OpenPGP
   mailing list, including William Geiger, Lutz Donnerhacke and Kazu
   Yamamoto.  The idea to use multipart/mixed with multipart/signed has
   been attributed to James Galvin.  Finally, our gratitude is due to
   the many members of the "Cypherpunks," "Coderpunks" and "pgp-users"
   &lt;<a href="http://cryptorights.org/pgp-users">http://cryptorights.org/pgp-users</a>&gt; mailing lists and the many users
   of PGP worldwide for helping keep the path to privacy open.
