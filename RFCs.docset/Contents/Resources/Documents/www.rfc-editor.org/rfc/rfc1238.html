   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
      and naming objects for the purpose of management.  <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a>
      defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
      consistent with the SMI.

      <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
      the Internet suite of protocols.  <a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a>, defines MIB-II, an
      evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
      operational requirements.

      <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
      access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Objects</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Specification of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)"'>7</a>]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>3</a>] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Specification of Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract Notation One (ASN.1)"'>8</a>],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1238">RFC 1238</a>                        CLNS MIB                       June 1991</span>


   Intermediate System [<a href="#ref-11">11</a>] protocols are present.  No assumptions are
   made as to what underlying protocol is being used to carry the SNMP.

   This memo uses the string encoding of [<a href="#ref-12" title='"A String Encoding of Presentation Address"'>12</a>] to textually describe OSI
   addresses.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Textual%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Textual Conventions</span>

   A new data type is introduced as a textual convention in this MIB
   document.  This textual conventions enhance the readability of the
   specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if
   appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of this
   textual convention has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of this is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   this methods are always encoded by means of the rules that define the
   primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are
   necessary to accommodate this textual convention which are adopted
   merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the
   elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

   The ASN.1 type ClnpAddress is used to denote an OSI address.  This
   consists of a string of octets.  The first octet of the string
   contains a binary value in the range of 0..20, and indicates the the
   length in octets of the NSAP.  Following the first octet, is the
   NSAP, expressed in concrete binary notation, starting with the most
   significant octet.  A zero- length NSAP is used as a "special"
   address meaning "the default NSAP" (analogous to the IP address of
   0.0.0.0).  Such an NSAP is encoded as a single octet, containing the
   value 0.  All other NSAPs are encoded in at least 4 octets.

   Features of this MIB include:

      (1)  The managed objects in this document have been defined
           using the conventions defined in the Internet-standard
           SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>].  It
           must be emphasized that definitions made using these
           extensions are semantically identically to those in <a href="./rfc1162">RFC</a>
           <a href="./rfc1162">1162</a>.

      (2)  The PhysAddress textual convention from MIB-II has been
           introduced to represent media addresses.

      (3)  The clnpRoutingDiscards, clnpRouteMetric5, and
           clnpRouteInfo objects have been defined.
