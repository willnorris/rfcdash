<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2560">RFC 2560</a>                       PKIX OCSP                       June 1999</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Protocol%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Protocol Overview</span>

   In lieu of or as a supplement to checking against a periodic CRL, it
   may be necessary to obtain timely information regarding the
   revocation status of a certificate (cf. <a href="./rfc2459#section-3.3">[RFC2459], Section 3.3</a>).
   Examples include high-value funds transfer or large stock trades.

   The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enables applications to
   determine the (revocation) state of an identified certificate. OCSP
   may be used to satisfy some of the operational requirements of
   providing more timely revocation information than is possible with
   CRLs and may also be used to obtain additional status information. An
   OCSP client issues a status request to an OCSP responder and suspends
   acceptance of the certificate in question until the responder
   provides a response.

   This protocol specifies the data that needs to be exchanged between
   an application checking the status of a certificate and the server
   providing that status.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1%20%20Request"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>  Request</span>

   An OCSP request contains the following data:

   -- protocol version
   -- service request
   -- target certificate identifier
   -- optional extensions which MAY be processed by the OCSP Responder

   Upon receipt of a request, an OCSP Responder determines if:

   1. the message is well formed

   2. the responder is configured to provide the requested service and

   3. the request contains the information needed by the responder If
   any one of the prior conditions are not met, the OCSP responder
   produces an error message; otherwise, it returns a definitive
   response.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2%20%20Response"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>  Response</span>

   OCSP responses can be of various types.  An OCSP response consists of
   a response type and the bytes of the actual response. There is one
   basic type of OCSP response that MUST be supported by all OCSP
   servers and clients. The rest of this section pertains only to this
   basic response type.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2560">RFC 2560</a>                       PKIX OCSP                       June 1999</span>


   All definitive response messages SHALL be digitally signed. The key
   used to sign the response MUST belong to one of the following:

   -- the CA who issued the certificate in question
   -- a Trusted Responder whose public key is trusted by the requester
   -- a CA Designated Responder (Authorized Responder) who holds a
      specially marked certificate issued directly by the CA, indicating
      that the responder may issue OCSP responses for that CA

   A definitive response message is composed of:

   -- version of the response syntax
   -- name of the responder
   -- responses for each of the certificates in a request
   -- optional extensions
   -- signature algorithm OID
   -- signature computed across hash of the response

   The response for each of the certificates in a request consists of

   -- target certificate identifier
   -- certificate status value
   -- response validity interval
   -- optional extensions

   This specification defines the following definitive response
   indicators for use in the certificate status value:

   -- good
   -- revoked
   -- unknown

   The "good" state indicates a positive response to the status inquiry.
   At a minimum, this positive response indicates that the certificate
   is not revoked, but does not necessarily mean that the certificate
   was ever issued or that the time at which the response was produced
   is within the certificate's validity interval. Response extensions
   may be used to convey additional information on assertions made by
   the responder regarding the status of the certificate such as
   positive statement about issuance, validity, etc.

   The "revoked" state indicates that the certificate has been revoked
   (either permanantly or temporarily (on hold)).

   The "unknown" state indicates that the responder doesn't know about
   the certificate being requested.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3%20%20Exception%20Cases"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>  Exception Cases</span>

   In case of errors, the OCSP Responder may return an error message.
   These messages are not signed. Errors can be of the following types:

   -- malformedRequest
   -- internalError
   -- tryLater
   -- sigRequired
   -- unauthorized

   A server produces the "malformedRequest" response if the request
   received does not conform to the OCSP syntax.

   The response "internalError" indicates that the OCSP responder
   reached an inconsistent internal state. The query should be retried,
   potentially with another responder.

   In the event that the OCSP responder is operational, but unable to
   return a status for the requested certificate, the "tryLater"
   response can be used to indicate that the service exists, but is
   temporarily unable to respond.

   The response "sigRequired" is returned in cases where the server
   requires the client sign the request in order to construct a
   response.

   The response "unauthorized" is returned in cases where the client is
   not authorized to make this query to this server.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4%20%20Semantics%20of%20thisUpdate%2C%20nextUpdate%20and%20producedAt"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>  Semantics of thisUpdate, nextUpdate and producedAt</span>

   Responses can contain three times in them - thisUpdate, nextUpdate
   and producedAt. The semantics of these fields are:

   - thisUpdate: The time at which the status being indicated is known
                 to be correct
   - nextUpdate: The time at or before which newer information will be
                 available about the status of the certificate
   - producedAt: The time at which the OCSP responder signed this
                 response.

   If nextUpdate is not set, the responder is indicating that newer
   revocation information is available all the time.

   OCSP responders MAY pre-produce signed responses specifying the
   status of certificates at a specified time. The time at which the
   status was known to be correct SHALL be reflected in the thisUpdate
   field of the response. The time at or before which newer information
   will be available is reflected in the nextUpdate field, while the
   time at which the response was produced will appear in the producedAt
   field of the response.

   The key that signs a certificate's status information need not be the
   same key that signed the certificate. A certificate's issuer
   explicitly delegates OCSP signing authority by issuing a certificate
   containing a unique value for extendedKeyUsage in the OCSP signer's
   certificate. This certificate MUST be issued directly to the
   responder by the cognizant CA.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.7%20%20CA%20Key%20Compromise"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7" id="section-2.7">2.7</a>  CA Key Compromise</span>

   If an OCSP responder knows that a particular CA's private key has
   been compromised, it MAY return the revoked state for all
   certificates issued by that CA.

   In order to convey to OCSP clients a well-known point of information
   access, CAs SHALL provide the capability to include the
   AuthorityInfoAccess extension (defined in <a href="./rfc2459#section-4.2.2.1">[RFC2459], section 4.2.2.1</a>)
   in certificates that can be checked using OCSP.  Alternatively, the
   accessLocation for the OCSP provider may be configured locally at the
   OCSP client.

   CAs that support an OCSP service, either hosted locally or provided
   by an Authorized Responder, MUST provide for the inclusion of a value
   for a uniformResourceIndicator (URI) accessLocation and the OID value
   id-ad-ocsp for the accessMethod in the AccessDescription SEQUENCE.

   The value of the accessLocation field in the subject certificate
   defines the transport (e.g. HTTP) used to access the OCSP responder
   and may contain other transport dependent information (e.g. a URL).

   Prior to accepting a signed response as valid, OCSP clients SHALL
   confirm that:

   1. The certificate identified in a received response corresponds to
   that which was identified in the corresponding request;

   2. The signature on the response is valid;

   3. The identity of the signer matches the intended recipient of the
   request.

   4. The signer is currently authorized to sign the response.

   5. The time at which the status being indicated is known to be
   correct (thisUpdate) is sufficiently recent.

   6. When available, the time at or before which newer information will
   be available about the status of the certificate (nextUpdate) is
   greater than the current time.

   The ASN.1 syntax imports terms defined in [<a href="./rfc2459" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile"'>RFC2459</a>]. For signature
   calculation, the data to be signed is encoded using the ASN.1
   distinguished encoding rules (DER) [<a href="#ref-X.690" title=" Information Technology - ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Basic Encoding Rules (BER)">X.690</a>].

   ASN.1 EXPLICIT tagging is used as a default unless specified
   otherwise.

   The terms imported from elsewhere are: Extensions,
   CertificateSerialNumber, SubjectPublicKeyInfo, Name,
   AlgorithmIdentifier, CRLReason

       issuerKeyHash       OCTET STRING, -- Hash of Issuers public key
       serialNumber        CertificateSerialNumber }

   issuerNameHash is the hash of the Issuer's distinguished name. The
   hash shall be calculated over the DER encoding of the issuer's name
   field in the certificate being checked. issuerKeyHash is the hash of
   the Issuer's public key. The hash shall be calculated over the value
   (excluding tag and length) of the subject public key field in the
   issuer's certificate. The hash algorithm used for both these hashes,
   is identified in hashAlgorithm. serialNumber is the serial number of
   the certificate for which status is being requested.

   The primary reason to use the hash of the CA's public key in addition
   to the hash of the CA's name, to identify the issuer, is that it is
   possible that two CAs may choose to use the same Name (uniqueness in
   the Name is a recommendation that cannot be enforced). Two CAs will
   never, however, have the same public key unless the CAs either
   explicitly decided to share their private key, or the key of one of
   the CAs was compromised.

   Support for any specific extension is OPTIONAL. The critical flag
   SHOULD NOT be set for any of them.  <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a> suggests several
   useful extensions.  Additional extensions MAY be defined in
   additional RFCs. Unrecognized extensions MUST be ignored (unless they
   have the critical flag set and are not understood).

   The requestor MAY choose to sign the OCSP request. In that case, the
   signature is computed over the tbsRequest structure. If the request
   is signed, the requestor SHALL specify its name in the requestorName

   An OCSP response at a minimum consists of a responseStatus field
   indicating the processing status of the prior request. If the value
   of responseStatus is one of the error conditions, responseBytes are
   not set.

   ResponseBytes ::=       SEQUENCE {

       response       OCTET STRING }

   For a basic OCSP responder, responseType will be id-pkix-ocsp-basic.

   The thisUpdate and nextUpdate fields define a recommended validity
   interval. This interval corresponds to the {thisUpdate, nextUpdate}
   interval in CRLs. Responses whose nextUpdate value is earlier than
   the local system time value SHOULD be considered unreliable.
   Responses whose thisUpdate time is later than the local system time
   SHOULD be considered unreliable. Responses where the nextUpdate value
   is not set are equivalent to a CRL with no time for nextUpdate (see
   <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>).

   The producedAt time is the time at which this response was signed.

   The key that signs a certificate's status information need not be the
   same key that signed the certificate. It is necessary however to
   ensure that the entity signing this information is authorized to do
   so.  Therefore, a certificate's issuer MUST either sign the OCSP
   responses itself or it MUST explicitly designate this authority to
   another entity.  OCSP signing delegation SHALL be designated by the
   inclusion of id-kp-OCSPSigning in an extendedKeyUsage certificate
   extension included in the OCSP response signer's certificate.  This
   certificate MUST be issued directly by the CA that issued the
   certificate in question.

   id-kp-OCSPSigning OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-kp 9}

   Systems or applications that rely on OCSP responses MUST be capable
   of detecting and enforcing use of the id-ad-ocspSigning value as
   described above. They MAY provide a means of locally configuring one
   or more OCSP signing authorities, and specifying the set of CAs for
   which each signing authority is trusted. They MUST reject the
   response if the certificate required to validate the signature on the
   response fails to meet at least one of the following criteria:

   1. Matches a local configuration of OCSP signing authority for the
   certificate in question; or

   2. Is the certificate of the CA that issued the certificate in
   question; or

   3. Includes a value of id-ad-ocspSigning in an ExtendedKeyUsage
   extension and is issued by the CA that issued the certificate in
   question."

   Since an Authorized OCSP responder provides status information for
   one or more CAs, OCSP clients need to know how to check that an
   authorized responder's certificate has not been revoked. CAs may
   choose to deal with this problem in one of three ways:

   - A CA may specify that an OCSP client can trust a responder for the
   lifetime of the responder's certificate. The CA does so by including
   the extension id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck. This SHOULD be a non-critical
   extension. The value of the extension should be NULL. CAs issuing
   such a certificate should realized that a compromise of the
   responder's key, is as serious as the compromise of a CA key used to
   sign CRLs, at least for the validity period of this certificate. CA's
   may choose to issue this type of certificate with a very short
   lifetime and renew it frequently.

   id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix-ocsp 5 }

   - A CA may specify how the responder's certificate be checked for
   revocation. This can be done using CRL Distribution Points if the
   check should be done using CRLs or CRL Distribution Points, or
   Authority Information Access if the check should be done in some
   other way. Details for specifying either of these two mechanisms are
   available in [<a href="./rfc2459" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile"'>RFC2459</a>].

   - A CA may choose not to specify any method of revocation checking
   for the responder's certificate, in which case, it would be up to the
   OCSP client's local security policy to decide whether that
   certificate should be checked for revocation or not.

   The nonce cryptographically binds a request and a response to prevent
   replay attacks. The nonce is included as one of the requestExtensions
   in requests, while in responses it would be included as one of the
   responseExtensions. In both the request and the response, the nonce
   will be identified by the object identifier id-pkix-ocsp-nonce, while
   the extnValue is the value of the nonce.

   It may be desirable for the OCSP responder to indicate the CRL on
   which a revoked or onHold certificate is found. This can be useful
   where OCSP is used between repositories, and also as an auditing
   mechanism. The CRL may be specified by a URL (the URL at which the
   CRL is available), a number (CRL number) or a time (the time at which
   the relevant CRL was created). These extensions will be specified as
   singleExtensions. The identifier for this extension will be id-pkix-
   ocsp-crl, while the value will be CrlID.

   id-pkix-ocsp-crl       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix-ocsp 3 }

   For the choice crlUrl, the IA5String will specify the URL at which
   the CRL is available. For crlNum, the INTEGER will specify the value
   of the CRL number extension of the relevant CRL. For crlTime, the
   GeneralizedTime will indicate the time at which the relevant CRL was
   issued.

   An OCSP client MAY wish to specify the kinds of response types it
   understands. To do so, it SHOULD use an extension with the OID id-
   pkix-ocsp-response, and the value AcceptableResponses.  This
   extension is included as one of the requestExtensions in requests.
   The OIDs included in AcceptableResponses are the OIDs of the various
   response types this client can accept (e.g., id-pkix-ocsp-basic).

   As noted in <a href="#section-4.2.1">section 4.2.1</a>, OCSP responders SHALL be capable of
   responding with responses of the id-pkix-ocsp-basic response type.
   Correspondingly, OCSP clients SHALL be capable of receiving and
   processing responses of the id-pkix-ocsp-basic response type.

   An OCSP responder MAY choose to retain revocation information beyond
   a certificate's expiration. The date obtained by subtracting this
   retention interval value from the producedAt time in a response is
   defined as the certificate's "archive cutoff" date.

   OCSP-enabled applications would use an OCSP archive cutoff date to
   contribute to a proof that a digital signature was (or was not)
   reliable on the date it was produced even if the certificate needed
   to validate the signature has long since expired.

   OCSP servers that provide support for such historical reference
   SHOULD include an archive cutoff date extension in responses.  If
   included, this value SHALL be provided as an OCSP singleExtensions
   extension identified by id-pkix-ocsp-archive-cutoff and of syntax
   GeneralizedTime.

   id-pkix-ocsp-archive-cutoff  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix-ocsp 6 }

   ArchiveCutoff ::= GeneralizedTime

   To illustrate, if a server is operated with a 7-year retention
   interval policy and status was produced at time t1 then the value for
   ArchiveCutoff in the response would be (t1 - 7 years).

   All the extensions specified as CRL Entry Extensions - in <a href="./rfc2459#section-5.3">Section 5.3
   of [RFC2459]</a> - are also supported as singleExtensions.

   An OCSP server may be operated in a mode whereby the server receives
   a request and routes it to the OCSP server which is known to be
   authoritative for the identified certificate.  The serviceLocator
   request extension is defined for this purpose.  This extension is
   included as one of the singleRequestExtensions in requests.

   For this service to be effective, certificate using systems must
   connect to the certificate status service provider. In the event such
   a connection cannot be obtained, certificate-using systems could
   implement CRL processing logic as a fall-back position.

   A denial of service vulnerability is evident with respect to a flood
   of queries. The production of a cryptographic signature significantly
   affects response generation cycle time, thereby exacerbating the
   situation. Unsigned error responses open up the protocol to another
   denial of service attack, where the attacker sends false error
   responses.

   The use of precomputed responses allows replay attacks in which an
   old (good) response is replayed prior to its expiration date but
   after the certificate has been revoked. Deployments of OCSP should
   carefully evaluate the benefit of precomputed responses against the
   probability of a replay attack and the costs associated with its
   successful execution.

   Requests do not contain the responder they are directed to. This
   allows an attacker to replay a request to any number of OCSP
   responders.

   The reliance of HTTP caching in some deployment scenarios may result
   in unexpected results if intermediate servers are incorrectly
   configured or are known to possess cache management faults.
   Implementors are advised to take the reliability of HTTP cache
   mechanisms into account when deploying OCSP over HTTP.

   HTTP based OCSP requests can use either the GET or the POST method to
   submit their requests. To enable HTTP caching, small requests (that
   after encoding are less than 255 bytes), MAY be submitted using GET.
   If HTTP caching is not important, or the request is greater than 255
   bytes, the request SHOULD be submitted using POST.  Where privacy is
   a requirement, OCSP transactions exchanged using HTTP MAY be
   protected using either TLS/SSL or some other lower layer protocol.

   An OCSP request using the GET method is constructed as follows:

   GET {url}/{url-encoding of base-64 encoding of the DER encoding of
   the OCSPRequest}

   where {url} may be derived from the value of AuthorityInfoAccess or
   other local configuration of the OCSP client.

   An OCSP request using the POST method is constructed as follows: The
   Content-Type header has the value "application/ocsp-request" while
   the body of the message is the binary value of the DER encoding of
   the OCSPRequest.

   An HTTP-based OCSP response is composed of the appropriate HTTP
   headers, followed by the binary value of the DER encoding of the
   OCSPResponse. The Content-Type header has the value
   "application/ocsp-response". The Content-Length header SHOULD specify
   the length of the response. Other HTTP headers MAY be present and MAY
   be ignored if not understood by the requestor.
