Abstract

   This document serves to register and document the standard MIME types
   associated with the 3GPP multimedia file format, which is part of the
   family based on the ISO Media File Format.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The third-generation partnership project (3GPP) for third-generation
   cellular telephony has defined a standard file format to contain
   audio/visual sequences which may be downloaded to cellular phones
   [<a href="#ref-3GPP">3GPP</a>].  At the time of writing, the 3GPP file format (3GP) can
   contain H.263 or MPEG-4 video, and AMR Narrow-band speech, AMR wide-
   band speech, or AAC audio, and 3GPP timed text.

   Within the file, as with all files in the 'ISO' family, there is an
   intrinsic file-type box, which identifies those specifications to
   which the file complies, and which players (possibly compliant with
   only one specification) are permitted by the content author to play
   the file.  This identification is through four-letter 'brands'.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3839">RFC 3839</a>            MIME Type Registrations for 3GPP           July 2004</span>


   Files identified by the MIME [<a href="#ref-MIME1" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME1</a>] type defined here MUST contain a
   brand defined in a standard issued by 3GPP that can apply to 3GPP
   files, in their compatible brands list.

   The MIME types defined here are needed to correctly identify such
   files when they are served over HTTP, included in multi-part
   documents, or used in other places where MIME types are used.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The 3GPP file format may contain audio, video, and displayable text
   data.  There is currently no provision for 'active' elements (such as
   scripts) of any kind.

   Clearly it is possible to author malicious files which attempt to
   call for an excessively large picture size, high sampling-rate audio
   etc.  However, clients can and usually do protect themselves against
   this kind of attack.

   It should be noted that selected metadata fields may encompass
   information partly intended to protect the media against unauthorized
   use or distribution.  In this case, the intention is that alteration
   or removal of the data in the field would be treated as an offense
   under national agreements based on World Intellectual Property
   Organization (WIPO) treaties.

   3GPP files have an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically
   possible that metadata fields or media formats could be defined in
   the future which could be used to induce particular actions on the
   part of the recipient, thus presenting additional security risks.
   However, this type of capability is currently not supported in the
   referenced specification.

   There is no current provision in the standards for encryption,
   signing, or authentication of these file formats.

   This registration applies to all files defined as using the '3GP'
   file format and identified with a suitable brand in a 3GPP
   specification.  The usual file suffix for all these files is ".3gp".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Files%20with%20audio%20but%20no%20video"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Files with audio but no video</span>

   The type "audio/3gpp" may be used for files containing audio but no
   visual presentation (neither video nor timed text, for example).

   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type audio/3gpp

MIME media type name:              audio
MIME subtype name:                 3gpp
Required parameters:               none
Optional parameters:               none
                                    Ongoing work related to this
                                    registration may introduce new
                                    optional parameters.  One example
                                    area of effort may introduce a
                                    parameter that would allow for
                                    codecs in use within the MIME type
                                    to be asserted and determined
                                    without examination of the file.
                                    Those with interests in the area
                                    should monitor registrations for
                                    updates.
Encoding considerations:           files are binary and should be
                                    transmitted in a suitable encoding
                                    without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                    stripping etc.; base64 is a suitable
                                    encoding.  Note that this MIME type
                                    is used only for files; separate
                                    types are used for real-time
                                    transfer, such as for the RTP
                                    payload format for AMR audio
                                    [<a href="./rfc3267" title='"Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload Format and File Storage Format for the Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate WideBand (AMR-WB) Audio Codecs"'>RFC3267</a>].
Security considerations:           see the security considerations
                                    section in <a href="./rfc3839">RFC 3839</a>
Interoperability considerations:   The 3GPP organization has defined the
                                    specification, interoperability, and
                                    conformance, and conducts regular
                                    interoperability testing.
Published specification:           3GPP 26.234, Release 5; 3GPP 26.244,
                                    Release 6 or later.  3GPP
                                    specifications are publicly
                                    accessible at the 3GPP web site,
                                    www.3gpp.org.
Applications which use this media type: Multi-media
Additional information:            The type "audio/3gpp" MAY be used for
                                    files containing audio but no visual
                                    presentation.  Files served under
                                    this type MUST NOT contain any
                                    visual material. (Note that 3GPP
                                    timed text is visually presented
                                    and is considered to be visual
                                    material).
