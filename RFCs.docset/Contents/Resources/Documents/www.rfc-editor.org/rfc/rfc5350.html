<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IP Router Alert Option is defined for IPv4 in [<a href="./rfc2113" title='"IP Router Alert Option"'>RFC2113</a>].  A
   similar IPv6 option is defined in [<a href="./rfc2711" title='"IPv6 Router Alert Option"'>RFC2711</a>].  When one of these
   options is present in an IP datagram, it indicates that the contents
   of the datagram may be interesting to routers.  The Router Alert
   Option (RAO) is used by protocols such as the Resource Reservation
   Protocol (RSVP) [<a href="./rfc2205" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1 Functional Specification"'>RFC2205</a>] and IGMP [<a href="./rfc3376" title='"Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3"'>RFC3376</a>].

   Both the IPv4 and IPv6 options contain a two-octet Value field to
   carry extra information.  This information can be used, for example,
   by routers to determine whether or not the packet should be more
   closely examined by them.

   There can be up to 65536 values for the RAO.  Yet, currently there is
   only a registry for IPv6 values.  No registry or allocation policies
   are defined for IPv4.

   This document updates the IANA registry for managing IPv4 and IPv6
   Router Alert Option Values, and removes one existing IPv6 Router
   Alert Option Value.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Use%20of%20the%20Router%20Alert%20Option%20Value%20Field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Use of the Router Alert Option Value Field</span>

   One difference between the specifications for the IPv4 and IPv6
   Router Alert Options is the way values for the Value field are
   managed.  In [<a href="./rfc2113" title='"IP Router Alert Option"'>RFC2113</a>], the IPv4 Router Alert Option Value field has
   the value 0 assigned to "Router shall examine packet".  All other
   values (1-65535) are reserved.  Neither a management mechanism (e.g.,
   an IANA registry) nor an allocation policy are provided for the IPv4
   RAO values.

   The IPv6 Router Alert Option has an IANA-managed registry
   [<a href="#ref-IANA-IPv6RAO" title='"IANA Registry for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) Router Alert Option Values"'>IANA-IPv6RAO</a>] containing allocations for the Value field.

   In [<a href="./rfc3175" title='"Aggregation of RSVP for IPv4 and IPv6 Reservations"'>RFC3175</a>], the IPv4 Router Alert Option Value is described as a
   parameter that provides "additional information" to the router in
   making its interception decision, rather than as a registry managed
   by IANA.  As such, this aggregation mechanism makes use of the Value
   field to carry the reservation aggregation level.  For the IPv6
   option, IANA has assigned a set of 32 values to indicate reservation
   levels.  However, since other registrations have already been made in
   that registry, these values are from 3-35 (which is actually a set of
   33 values).

   Although it might have been desirable to have the same values used in
   both the IPv4 and IPv6 registries, the initial allocations in
   [<a href="./rfc2711" title='"IPv6 Router Alert Option"'>RFC2711</a>] and the aggregation-level allocations in [<a href="./rfc3175" title='"Aggregation of RSVP for IPv4 and IPv6 Reservations"'>RFC3175</a>] have

   made this impossible.  The following table shows the allocations in
   the IPv6 registry and the values used in the IPv4 registry, where the
   latter have been deduced from [<a href="./rfc2113" title='"IP Router Alert Option"'>RFC2113</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3175" title='"Aggregation of RSVP for IPv4 and IPv6 Reservations"'>RFC3175</a>] with the
   assumption that the number of aggregation levels can be limited to 32
   as in the IPv6 case.  Entries for values 6 to 31 have been elided for
   brevity.

   Note (*): The entry in the above table for the IPv6 RAO Value of 35
   (Aggregated Reservation Nesting Level 32) has been marked due to an
   inconsistency in the text of [<a href="./rfc3175" title='"Aggregation of RSVP for IPv4 and IPv6 Reservations"'>RFC3175</a>], and is consequently reflected

   in the IANA registry.  In that document, the values 3-35 (i.e., 33
   values) are defined for nesting levels 0-31 (i.e., 32 levels).
   Similarly, value 3 is a duplicate, because aggregation level 0 means
   end-to-end signaling, and this already has an IPv6 RAO value "1"
   assigned.

   Also note that nesting levels begin at 1 for IPv4 (described in
   <a href="./rfc3175#section-1.4.9">Section 1.4.9 of [RFC3175]</a>) and 0 for IPv6 (allocated in <a href="./rfc3175#section-6">Section 6 of
   [RFC3175]</a>).

   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> of this document redefines these so that for IPv6, value
   3 is no longer used and values 4-35 represent levels 1-32.  This
   removes the above inconsistencies.

   This section contains the new procedures for managing IPv4 Router
   Alert Option Values.  IANA has created a registry for IPv4 Router
   Alert Option Values (described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) and has updated the
   IPv6 Router Alert Option Values (described in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).

   IP Router Alert Option Values are currently managed separately for
   IPv4 and IPv6.  This document does not change this, as there is
   little value in forcing the two registries to be aligned.

   The Value field, as specified in [<a href="./rfc2113" title='"IP Router Alert Option"'>RFC2113</a>], is two octets in length.
   The Value field is registered and maintained by IANA.  The initial
   contents of this registry are:

   The registry for IPv6 Router Alert Option Values continues to be
   maintained as specified in [<a href="./rfc2711" title='"IPv6 Router Alert Option"'>RFC2711</a>].  In addition, the following
   value has been removed from the IANA registry and reserved for
   possible future use (not to be allocated currently).  The reason is
   that it is a duplicate value; aggregation level 0 means end-to-end
   signaling, and this already has an IPv6 RAO value "1" assigned.

   Since this document is only concerned with the IANA management of the
   IPv4 and IPv6 Router Alert Option Values registry, it raises no new
   security issues beyond those identified in [<a href="./rfc2113" title='"IP Router Alert Option"'>RFC2113</a>] and [<a href="./rfc2711" title='"IPv6 Router Alert Option"'>RFC2711</a>].

   Yet, as discussed in <a href="./rfc4727">RFC 4727</a> [<a href="./rfc4727" title='"Experimental Values In IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, UDP, and TCP Headers"'>RFC4727</a>], production networks do not
   necessarily support the use of experimental code points in IP option
   headers.  The network scope of support for experimental values should
   be evaluated carefully before deploying any experimental RAO value
   across extended network domains, such as the public Internet.  The
   potential to disrupt the stable operation of the network hosting the
   experiment through the use of unsupported experimental code points is
   a serious consideration when planning an experiment using such code
   points.

   When experimental RAO values are deployed within an administratively
   self-contained network domain, the network administrators should
   ensure that each value is used consistently to avoid interference
   between experiments.  When experimental values are used in traffic
   that crosses multiple administrative domains, the experimenters
   should assume that there is a risk that the same values will be used
   simultaneously by other experiments, and thus that there is a

   possibility that the experiments will interfere.  Particular
   attention should be given to security threats that such interference
   might create.
