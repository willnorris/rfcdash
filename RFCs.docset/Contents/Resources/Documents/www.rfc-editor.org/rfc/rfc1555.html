Abstract

   This document describes the encoding used in electronic mail [<a href="./rfc822" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>RFC822</a>]
   for transferring Hebrew.  The standard devised makes use of MIME
   [<a href="./rfc1521" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>RFC1521</a>] and ISO-8859-8.

Description

   All Hebrew text when transferred via e-mail must first be translated
   into ISO-8859-8, and then encoded using either Quoted-Printable
   (preferable) or Base64, as defined in MIME.

   The following table provides the four most common Hebrew encodings:

                       PC    IBM     PC     ISO
           Hebrew                           8859-8

   Note: All values are in decimal ASCII except for the EBCDIC column
   which is in hexadecimal.

   ISO 8859-8 8-bit ASCII is also known as IBM Codepage 862.

   The default directionality of the text is visual.  This means that
   the Hebrew text is encoded from left to right (even though Hebrew
   text is entered right to left) and is transmitted from left to right
   via the standard MIME mechanisms.  Other methods to control
   directionality are supported and are covered in the complementary <a href="./rfc1556">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc1556">1556</a>, "Handling of Bi-directional Texts in MIME".

   All discussion regarding Hebrew in email, as well as discussions of
   Hebrew in other TCP/IP protocols, is discussed in the ilan-
   h@vm.tau.ac.il list.  To subscribe send mail to listserv@vm.tau.ac.il
   with one line of text as follows:

                    subscribe ilan-h firstname lastname

MIME Considerations

   Mail that is sent that contains Hebrew must contain the following
   minimum amount of MIME headers:

         MIME-Version: 1.0
         Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-8
         Content-transfer-encoding: BASE64 | Quoted-Printable

   Users should keep their text to within 72 columns so as to allow
   email quoting via the prefixing of each line with a "&gt;".  Users
   should also realize that not all MIME implementations handle email
   quoting properly, so quoting email that contains Hebrew text may lead
   to problems.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1555">RFC 1555</a>               Hebrew Character Encoding           December 1993</span>


   In the future, when all email systems implement fully transparent 8-
   bit email as defined in <a href="./rfc1425">RFC 1425</a> and <a href="./rfc1426">RFC 1426</a> this standard will
   become partially obsolete.  The "Content-type:" field will still be
   necessary, as well as directionality (which might be implicit for
   8BIT, but is something for future discussion),  but the "Content-
   transfer-encoding" will be altered to use 8BIT rather than Base64 or
   Quoted-Printable.

Optional

   It is recommended, although not required, to support Hebrew encoding
   in mail headers as specified in <a href="./rfc1522">RFC 1522</a>.  Specifically, the Q-
   encoding format is to be the default method used for encoding Hebrew
   in Internet mail headers and not the B-encoding method.

Caveats

   Within Israel there are in excess of 40 Listserv lists which will now
   start using Hebrew for part of their conversations.  Normally,
   Listserv will deliver mail from a distribution list with a
   "shortened" header, one that does not include the extra MIME headers.
   This will cause the MIME encoding to be left intact and the user
   agent decoding software will not be able to interpret the mail.  Each
   user is able to customize how Listserv delivers mail.  For lists that
   contain Hebrew, users should send mail to Listserv with the following
   command:

                             set listname full

   where listname is the name of the list which the user wants full,
   unabridged headers to appear.  This will update their private entry
   and all subsequent mail from that list will be with full <a href="./rfc822">RFC822</a>
   headers, including MIME headers.

   In addition, Listserv usually maintains automatic archives of all
   postings to a list.  These archives, contained in the file "listname
   LOGyymm", do not contain the MIME headers, so all encoding
   information will be lost.  This is a limitation of the Listserv
   software.

Example

   Below is a short example of Quoted-Printable encoded Hebrew email:

   Date:         Sun, 06 Jun 93 15:25:35 IDT
   From:         Hank Nussbacher &lt;HANK@VM.BIU.AC.IL&gt;
   Subject:      Sample Hebrew mail
   To:           Hank Nussbacher &lt;Hank@BARILVM&gt;,
                 Yehavi Bourvine &lt;yehavi@hujivms&gt;
   MIME-Version: 1.0
   Content-Type: Text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-8
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE

   The end of this line contains Hebrew            .=EC=E0=F8=F9=E9 =F5=
   =F8=E0=EE =ED=E5=EC=F9


   Hank Nussbacher                                  =F8=EB=E1=F1=E5=
   =F0 =F7=F0=E4
