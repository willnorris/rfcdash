    <span class="h1">IANA Registration of Enumservices for Voice and Video Messaging</span>

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document registers the Enumservice named "vmsg", which is used
   to facilitate the real-time routing of voice, video, and unified
   communications to a messaging system.  This vmsg Enumservice
   registers three Enumservice types: "voicemsg", "videomsg", and
   "unifmsg".  Each type also registers the subtypes "sip", "sips",
   "http", and "https", as well as the subtype "tel" for the "voicemsg"
   type.

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)"'>1</a>]) is a technology that
   transforms E.164 numbers (the International Public Telecommunication
   Numbering Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The International Public Telecommunication Numbering Plan"'>2</a>]) into domain names and
   then uses DNS (Domain Name System, <a href="./rfc1034">RFC 1034</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>3</a>]) delegation through
   NS records and Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) records (Dynamic
   Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System
   (DNS) Database, <a href="./rfc3403">RFC 3403</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database"'>4</a>]) to look up what services are available
   for a specific domain name.

   This document registers Enumservices according to the guidelines
   given in <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)"'>1</a>] to be used for provisioning in the services
   field of a NAPTR [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database"'>4</a>] resource record to indicate the types of
   functionality associated with an end point and/or telephone number.
   The registration is defined within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation
   Discovery System [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database"'>4</a>][5][<a href="#ref-6" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Two: The Algorithm"'>6</a>][7][<a href="#ref-8" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Five: URI.ARPA Assignment Procedures"'>8</a>]) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U"
   DDDS Application defined in <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a>.

   Voice messaging systems are used widely with telephony and voice
   communication services.  The need for a voice messaging service type
   has become clear in order to provide certain applications with direct
   access to various voice messaging services (for example, voicemail),
   most typically via the use of SIP.

   The authors considered the use of Voice Profile for Internet Mail
   (VPIM) [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Voice Message Routing Service"'>14</a>] but found that VPIM was best suited to the non-real-time
   and non-session-based routing of a voice message once it had been
   deposited into a voice messaging system.  Thus, VPIM was a good
   solution for the non-real-time and non-session-based routing of voice
   messages between and within domains, but it did not enable real-time
   interaction with a voice messaging system.

   Thus, a need has been identified for this voice messaging service
   type that would enable, for example, some of the use cases listed in
   this section.

   Video messaging systems, sometimes called visual voice messaging
   systems, are beginning to be used with real-time communication
   services.  The need for a video messaging service type has become
   clear in order to provide certain applications with direct access to
   various video messaging services, most typically via the use of SIP.
   Thus, a need has been identified for this video messaging service
   type that would enable, for example, some of the use cases listed in
   this section.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5278">RFC 5278</a>                    VMSG Enumservice                   July 2008</span>


   Finally, several service providers and software developers have
   indicated that their system for voice messaging and video messaging
   either have been or soon will be unified into a single system.  As
   such, they desired to have the option of using an Enumservice type
   that represents a subscriber's mailbox as being a so-called unified
   messaging repository.  Thus, a need has been identified for this
   unified voice and video messaging service type that would enable, for
   example, some of the use cases listed in this section.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Selected%20Use%20Cases%20for%20Illustrative%20Purposes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Selected Use Cases for Illustrative Purposes</span>

   The following is a partial, non-exclusive list of use cases that the
   vmsg Enumservice could address:

   * A called party is busy or does not answer a call.  A client or
     server then determines that a messaging service should be used and
     sends the calling party's session to such a service.  The client or
     server needs to be able to determine which server to direct this
     real-time session to, whether that is within or outside of the
     called party's domain.

   * Similar to the above use case, a real-time session is attempted to
     a messaging system, but that system is currently unavailable.
     Since multiple service type records may be returned by the original
     ENUM query, the client or server could then attempt to initiate a
     session with one or more backup messaging servers in a manner that
     is transparent to the calling party and that supports better
     overall availability of a messaging service.

   * Similar to the above use case, this service type could be used to
     balance load across multiple messaging servers, whether those are
     in the same or in different physical locations.

   * A user with an account on a messaging service needs to connect to
     the messaging service in order to retrieve messages.  They initiate
     a real-time session, and an ENUM query is performed to discover the
     messaging server that holds its mailbox.

   * In the process of invoking and supporting a real-time, automated
     and interactive session with a user, whether for message deposit or
     retrieval, VoiceXML files are referenced and utilized, via either
     HTTP or HTTPS.  Multiple VoiceXML servers could be associated with
     a user and returned via ENUM query, for the purposes of load
     balancing, for example.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20Consideration%20of%20Other%20Existing%20Enumservices"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Consideration of Other Existing Enumservices</span>

   The authors considered whether this service type could simply use the
   SIP Enumservice type [<a href="#ref-19" title='"enumservice registration for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Addresses-of-Record"'>19</a>], but found that it does not satisfy their
   voice messaging requirements, particularly given the non-SIP URI sub-
   types specified herein.  Even with sub-types for SIP URIs, however,
   there are challenges to using the SIP Enumservice type.  For example,
   a request for access to such a service could be extended to the
   requesting SIP client, or User Agent Client (UAC), rather than
   relying upon the local policy of a SIP server, or User Agent Server
   (UAS), which means that special routing logic within a UAS cannot be
   relied upon to solve this problem.  More importantly, however, the
   authors have found that without this service type, a UAC or UAS will
   be presented with multiple SIP URIs, with no ability other than in
   non-standards-based routing rules or application logic to recognize
   which one is related to a voice messaging, video messaging, or
   unified voice and video messaging service.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Distribution%20of%20Data"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Distribution of Data</span>

   The authors believe that it is more likely that these records will be
   distributed on a purely private basis, but they may also be
   distributed in public ENUM trees.  Distribution of this NAPTR data
   could be either (a) on a private basis within a service provider's
   internal network, (b) on a private basis between one or more parties
   using a variety of security mechanisms to prohibit general public
   access, or (c) openly available.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Should
   implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any other
   publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining voicemsg
   Enumservice data, this information would be visible to anyone
   anonymously.  While this is not qualitatively different from
   publication in a Telephone Directory, it does open or ease access to
   such data without any indication that such data has been accessed or
   by whom it has been accessed.

   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists
   of targets for unsolicited information.  Thus, a third party could
   use this to generate a list that it can use to make unsolicited
   telemarketing phone calls, or so-called SPAM over Internet Telephony
   (SPIT).  Many countries have do-not-call registries or other legal or
   regulatory mechanisms in place to deal with such abuses.

   As noted earlier, carriers, service providers, and other users may
   simply choose not to publish such information in the public e164.arpa
   tree, but may instead simply publish this in their internal ENUM
   routing database that is only able to be queried by trusted elements
   of their network and/or partner networks, such as softswitches and
   SIP proxy servers.  They may also choose to publish such information
   in a carrier-only branch of the e164.arpa tree, should one be
   created.

   Although an E.164 telephone number does not appear to reveal as much
   identity information about a user as a name in the format
   sip:username@hostname or email:username@hostname, the information is
   still publicly available; thus, there is still the risk of unwanted
   communication.

   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS
   and the applicability of DNSSEC [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>16</a>] to this is provided in <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a>
   [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)"'>1</a>].  A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in

   Enumservice Subtype: "https"

   URI Schemes: 'https:'

   Functional Specification:

   This Enumservice indicates that the remote resource identified by the
   associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of information,
   which can be contacted using TLS or the Secure Socket Layer protocol.

   Note that the kind of information retrieved can be manifold. Usually,
   contacting a resource by an 'https:' [<a href="#ref-12" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>12</a>] URI provides a document.
   This document can contain references that will trigger the download
   of many different kinds of information, such as text, audio, video,
   executable code, or even voice message files.  Thus, one cannot be
   more specific about the kind of information expected when contacting
   the resource.

   Security Considerations: See <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   The following sub-sections document several examples that
   implementers may find informative.  These examples shall in no way
   limit the various forms that this Enumservice may take.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.1.%20%20Example%20Using%20a%20%27sip%27%20URI"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" id="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Example Using a 'sip' URI</span>

      $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
         NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+voicemsg:sip"
         "!^.*$!sip:12155550123@gw.example.com!".

   In this example, a calling party has attempted a session that has
   gone unanswered after a certain period of time.  The calling party's
   session is sent to the appropriate voice messaging server, a
   personalized greeting is played to the calling party, after which it
   records a voice message to the called party.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.2.%20%20Example%20Using%20a%20%27tel%27%20URI"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" id="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Example Using a 'tel' URI</span>

      $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
         NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+voicemsg:tel"
         "!^.*$!tel:1-215-555-0123!".

   In this example, a calling party has attempted a session that has
   gone unanswered after a certain period of time.  The calling party's
   session is sent to the appropriate voice messaging server, a
   personalized greeting is played to the calling party, after which it
   records a voice message to the called party.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.3.%20%20Example%20Using%20a%20Backreference"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3" id="section-7.3">7.3</a>.  Example Using a Backreference</span>

      $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
         NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+voicemsg:sip"
         "!(^.*)$!sip:\1@example.net!".

   In this example, a backreference is used to reduce the size of the
   NAPTR record.  The sip URI uses "\1", which would dynamically replace
   the expression with the TN, in this case +12155550123.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.4.%20%20Example%20Using%20a%20%27sip%27%20URI%20without%20a%20Telephone%20Number"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.4" id="section-7.4">7.4</a>.  Example Using a 'sip' URI without a Telephone Number</span>

      $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
         NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+voicemsg:sip"
         "!^.*$!sip:johndoe@gw.example.com!".

   In this example, a calling party has attempted a session that has
   gone unanswered after a certain period of time.  The calling party's
   session is sent to the appropriate voice messaging server, a
   personalized greeting is played to the calling party, after which it
   records a voice message to the called party.  The URI that this
   session is directed to does not include a telephone number, as this
   user has multiple service that are not particularly tied to telephone
   numbers whereby text, audio, video and other multimedia messages can
   be received and accessed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.5.%20%20Example%20of%20Failover%20Using%20E2U%2Bvideomsg%3Asip"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.5" id="section-7.5">7.5</a>.  Example of Failover Using E2U+videomsg:sip</span>

      $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
         NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+videomsg:sip"
         "!^.*$!sip:12155550123@gw1.example.com!".

      $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
         NAPTR 10 200 "u" "E2U+videomsg:sip"
         "!^.*$!sip:12155550123@gw2.example.com!".

   In this example, the preference indicates that gw1.example.com is
   used first (100), and if this is unreachable, then the next higher
   preference (200) is used and gw2.example.com is contacted.  While out
   of scope for this document, a service provider could thus mirror or
   cluster a message store and fail from the primary to secondary using
   the DNS in an active-standby mode.

   It is likely that both E2U+sip and E2U+voicemsg, E2U+videomsg, and/or
   E2U+unifmsg Enumservice type records will be returned for a given
   query.  In this case, this could result in what is essentially
   E2U+sip records for real-time communications with an end user, while,
   for example, the E2U+voicemsg records will be used for real-time
   communications with a voice messaging service, when the called party
   is not available or does not wish to be disturbed.  Therefore, the
   network element that receives the results of this ENUM query will
   need to know enough information in order to select the voicemsg
   service type, rather than the sip service type.

   In addition, it is likely that multiple E2U+voicemsg, E2U+videomsg,
   and/or E2U+unifmsg Enumservice type records will be returned for a
   given query.  In this case, multiple records may include order and
   preference to allow recursion or load balancing.  Order could be used
   to designate a primary and a backup voice, video, or unified voice
   and video messaging service.  Preference could be used to load
   balance across multiple voice, video, and/or unified voice and video
   messaging servers by weight, for example.

   Finally, as with multiple records resulting from a typical ENUM query
   of the e164.arpa tree, it is up to the application using an ENUM
   resolver to determine which record(s) to use and which record(s) to
   ignore.  Implementers should take this into consideration and build
   logic into their applications that can select appropriately from
   multiple records based on business, network, or other rules.

   Implementers may wish to consider using regular expressions in order
   to reduce the size of individual NAPTRs.  This will have a
   significant effect on the overall size of the database involved.
