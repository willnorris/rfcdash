Abstract

   Most IMAP extensions are used by the client when it wants to and the
   server supports it.  However, a few extensions require the server to
   know whether a client supports that extension.  The ENABLE extension
   allows an IMAP client to say which extensions it supports.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Overview</span>

   Several IMAP extensions allow the server to return unsolicited
   responses specific to these extensions in certain circumstances.
   However, servers cannot send those unsolicited responses until they
   know that the clients support such extensions and thus won't choke on
   the extension response data.

   Up until now, extensions have typically stated that a server cannot
   send the unsolicited responses until after the client has used a
   command with the extension data (i.e., at that point the server knows
   the client is aware of the extension).  CONDSTORE ([<a href="./rfc4551" title='"IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE Operation or Quick Flag Changes Resynchronization"'>RFC4551</a>]),
   ANNOTATE ([<a href="#ref-ANNOTATE" title='"IMAP ANNOTATE Extension"'>ANNOTATE</a>]), and some extensions under consideration at the
   moment use various commands to enable server extensions.  For
   example, CONDSTORE uses a SELECT or FETCH parameter, and ANNOTATE
   uses a side effect of FETCH.

   The ENABLE extension provides an explicit indication from the client
   that it supports particular extensions.  This is done using a new
   ENABLE command.

   An IMAP server that supports ENABLE advertises this by including the
   word ENABLE in its capability list.

   Most IMAP extensions do not require the client to enable the
   extension in any way.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   Formal syntax is defined by [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>].

   Example lines prefaced by "C:" are sent by the client and ones
   prefaced by "S:" by the server.  The five characters [...] means that
   something has been elided.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20The%20ENABLE%20Command"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  The ENABLE Command</span>

   Arguments: capability names

   Result:    OK: Relevant capabilities enabled
              BAD: No arguments, or syntax error in an argument

   The ENABLE command takes a list of capability names, and requests the
   server to enable the named extensions.  Once enabled using ENABLE,
   each extension remains active until the IMAP connection is closed.
   For each argument, the server does the following:

   - If the argument is not an extension known to the server, the server
     MUST ignore the argument.

   - If the argument is an extension known to the server, and it is not
     specifically permitted to be enabled using ENABLE, the server MUST
     ignore the argument.  (Note that knowing about an extension doesn't
     necessarily imply supporting that extension.)

   - If the argument is an extension that is supported by the server and
     that needs to be enabled, the server MUST enable the extension for
     the duration of the connection.  At present, this applies only to
     CONDSTORE ([<a href="./rfc4551" title='"IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE Operation or Quick Flag Changes Resynchronization"'>RFC4551</a>]).  Note that once an extension is enabled,
     there is no way to disable it.

   If the ENABLE command is successful, the server MUST send an untagged
   ENABLED response (see <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5161">RFC 5161</a>               The IMAP ENABLE Extension              March 2008</span>


   Clients SHOULD only include extensions that need to be enabled by the
   server.  At the time of publication, CONDSTORE is the only such
   extension (i.e., ENABLE CONDSTORE is an additional "CONDSTORE
   enabling command" as defined in [<a href="./rfc4551" title='"IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE Operation or Quick Flag Changes Resynchronization"'>RFC4551</a>]).  Future RFCs may add to
   this list.

   The ENABLE command is only valid in the authenticated state (see
   [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>]), before any mailbox is selected.  Clients MUST NOT issue
   ENABLE once they SELECT/EXAMINE a mailbox; however, server
   implementations don't have to check that no mailbox is selected or
   was previously selected during the duration of a connection.

   The ENABLE command can be issued multiple times in a session.  It is
   additive; i.e., "ENABLE a b", followed by "ENABLE c" is the same as a
   single command "ENABLE a b c".  When multiple ENABLE commands are
   issued, each corresponding ENABLED response SHOULD only contain
   extensions enabled by the corresponding ENABLE command.

   There are no limitations on pipelining ENABLE.  For example, it is
   possible to send ENABLE and then immediately SELECT, or a LOGIN
   immediately followed by ENABLE.

   The server MUST NOT change the CAPABILITY list as a result of
   executing ENABLE; i.e., a CAPABILITY command issued right after an
   ENABLE command MUST list the same capabilities as a CAPABILITY
   command issued before the ENABLE command.  This is demonstrated in
   the following example:

      C: t1 CAPABILITY
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 ID LITERAL+ ENABLE X-GOOD-IDEA
      S: t1 OK foo
      C: t2 ENABLE CONDSTORE X-GOOD-IDEA
      S: * ENABLED X-GOOD-IDEA
      S: t2 OK foo
      C: t3 CAPABILITY
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 ID LITERAL+ ENABLE X-GOOD-IDEA
      S: t3 OK foo again

   In the following example, the client enables CONDSTORE:

      C: a1 ENABLE CONDSTORE
      S: * ENABLED CONDSTORE
      S: a1 OK Conditional Store enabled

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5161">RFC 5161</a>               The IMAP ENABLE Extension              March 2008</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20The%20ENABLED%20Response"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  The ENABLED Response</span>

   Contents:   capability listing

   The ENABLED response occurs as a result of an ENABLE command.  The
   capability listing contains a space-separated listing of capability
   names that the server supports and that were successfully enabled.
   The ENABLED response may contain no capabilities, which means that no
   extensions listed by the client were successfully enabled.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Note%20to%20Designers%20of%20Extensions%20That%20May%20Use%20the%20ENABLE%20Command"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Note to Designers of Extensions That May Use the ENABLE Command</span>

   Designers of IMAP extensions are discouraged from creating extensions
   that require ENABLE unless there is no good alternative design.
   Specifically, extensions that cause potentially incompatible behavior
   changes to deployed server responses (and thus benefit from ENABLE)
   have a higher complexity cost than extensions that do not.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Formal%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Formal Syntax</span>

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] including the core
   rules in <a href="./rfc3501#appendix-B.1">Appendix B.1.  [RFC3501]</a> defines the non-terminals
   "capability" and "command-any".

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are
   case-insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to
   define token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations
   MUST accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

      capability    =/ "ENABLE"

      command-any   =/ "ENABLE" 1*(SP capability)

      response-data =/ "*" SP enable-data CRLF

      enable-data   = "ENABLED" *(SP capability)

   It is believed that this extension doesn't add any security
   considerations that are not already present in the base IMAP protocol
   [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>].

   The IANA has added ENABLE to the IMAP4 Capabilities Registry.
