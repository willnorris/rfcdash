   The requirements for Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) in the
   Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) are
   specified in [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>], and the framework of LI and LB is specified
   in [<a href="./rfc6371" title='"Operations, Administration, and Maintenance Framework for MPLS-Based Transport Networks"'>RFC6371</a>].  A Label Switched Path (LSP) that is locked, using LI,
   is prevented from carrying user data traffic.  The LB function can
   only be applied to an LSP that has been previously locked.

   In general, the LI and LB are useful Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance (OAM) functions for technologies that use Generalized
   MPLS (GMPLS) for the control plane, e.g., time-division multiplexing,
   wavelength-division multiplexing, and packet switching.  It is
   natural to use and extend the GMPLS control-plane protocol to provide
   a unified approach for LI and LB provisioning in all these
   technologies.

   [<a id="ref-RFC7487">RFC7487</a>] specifies the RSVP-TE extensions for the configuration of
   proactive MPLS-TP OAM functions, such as Continuity Check (CC),
   Connectivity Verification (CV), Delay Measurement (DM), and Loss
   Measurement (LM).  The provisioning of on-demand OAM functions such
   as LI and LB are not covered in that document.

   This document specifies extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol-
   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to support lock instruct and loopback
   mechanisms for LSPs.  The mechanisms are applicable to technologies

   that use GMPLS for the control plane.  For a network supporting MPLS-
   TP, the mechanisms defined in this document are complementary to
   [<a href="./rfc6435" title='"MPLS Transport Profile Lock Instruct and Loopback Functions"'>RFC6435</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   In order to indicate the lock/unlock status of the LSP, the A
   (Administratively down) bit in the Administrative Status
   (ADMIN_STATUS) Object [<a href="./rfc3471" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Functional Description"'>RFC3471</a>] [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] is used.

   In order to indicate the loopback mode of LSP, a new bit flag is
   defined in the Attribute Flags TLV [<a href="./rfc5420" title='"Encoding of Attributes for MPLS LSP Establishment Using Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)"'>RFC5420</a>].

   Loopback flag:

      This flag indicates a particular node on the LSP is required to
      enter loopback mode.  This can also be used for specifying the
      loopback state of the node.

      - Bit number: 13

      - Attribute flag carried in Path message: Yes

      - Attribute flag carried in Resv message: No

      - Attribute flag carried in the Record Route Object (RRO)
      Attributes subobject: Yes

   When an ingress node intends to put an LSP into lock mode, it MUST
   send a Path message with the Administratively down (A) bit used as
   specified above and the Reflect (R) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object
   set.

   On receipt of this Path message, the egress node SHOULD try to take
   the LSP out of service.  If the egress node locks the LSP
   successfully, it MUST send a Resv message with the A bit in the
   ADMIN_STATUS Object set.  Otherwise, it MUST send a PathErr message
   with the Error Code "OAM Problem" [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>] and the new Error Value
   "Lock Failure", and the following Resv messages MUST be sent with the
   A bit cleared.

   When an LSP is put in lock mode, the subsequent Path and Resv
   messages MUST keep the A bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object set.

   When the ingress node intends to take the LSP out of the lock mode,
   it MUST send a Path message with the A bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object
   cleared.

   On receipt of this Path message, the egress node SHOULD try to bring
   the LSP back to service.  If the egress node unlocks the LSP
   successfully, it MUST send a Resv message with the A bit in the
   ADMIN_STATUS Object cleared.  Otherwise, it MUST send a PathErr
   message with the Error Code "OAM Problem" [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>] and the new Error
   Value "Unlock Failure", and the following Resv messages MUST be sent
   with the A bit set.

   When an LSP is taken out of lock mode, the subsequent Path and Resv
   messages MUST keep the A bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object cleared.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Loopback"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Loopback</span>

   The loopback request can be sent either to the egress node or to a
   particular intermediate node.  The mechanism defined in [<a href="./rfc7570" title='"Label Switched Path (LSP) Attribute in the Explicit Route Object (ERO)"'>RFC7570</a>] is
   used for addressing the loopback request to a particular node on the
   LSP.  The ingress node MUST ensure that the LSP is in lock mode
   before it requests setting a particular node on the LSP into loopback
   mode.

   When an ingress node intends to put a particular node on the LSP into
   loopback mode, it MUST send a Path message with the Loopback
   Attribute Flag defined above in the Attribute Flags TLV set.  The
   mechanism defined in [<a href="./rfc7570" title='"Label Switched Path (LSP) Attribute in the Explicit Route Object (ERO)"'>RFC7570</a>] is used to address the loopback
   request to the particular node.  The ingress node MUST ensure that
   the entity at which loopback is intended to occur is explicitly
   identified by the immediately preceding subobject of the Explicit
   Route Object (ERO) Hop Attributes subobject.  The Administratively
   down (A) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object MUST be kept set to indicate
   that the LSP is still in lock mode.

   On receipt of this Path message, the target node of the loopback
   request MUST check if the LSP is in lock mode by verifying that the
   Administratively down (A) bit is set in the ADMIN_STATUS Object.  If
   the bit is not set, the loopback request MUST be ignored.  If the bit
   is set, the node MUST check that the desired loopback entity is
   explicitly identified by the ERO subobject prior to the ERO Hop
   Attributes subobject.  Currently, the type value MUST be verified to
   be less than 32 (i.e., able to identify a specific entity where a
   loopback can occur; see <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>), and for type values 1 (IPv4
   prefix) and 2 (IPv6 prefix), the prefix length MUST be 32 and 128,
   respectively.  If the desired loopback entity is not explicitly
   identified, the request MUST be ignored and a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE
   object" error SHOULD be generated.  Otherwise, the node SHOULD try to
   put the LSP into loopback mode.  The loopback SHOULD be enabled on
   the entity identified by the ERO subobject immediately prior to the
   ERO Hop Attributes subobject.  If the immediately preceding subobject
   is a label subobject [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>], the loopback SHOULD be enabled for
   the direction indicated by the U bit of the label subobject.

   If the node puts the LSP into loopback mode successfully, it MUST set
   the Loopback Attribute Flag if it adds, per [<a href="./rfc7570" title='"Label Switched Path (LSP) Attribute in the Explicit Route Object (ERO)"'>RFC7570</a>], an RRO Hop
   Attributes subobject to the RRO of a Path or Resv message.  The
   Administratively down (A) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object MUST be kept
   set in the message.  If the node cannot put the LSP into loopback
   mode, it MUST send a PathErr message with the Error Code "OAM
   Problem" [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>] and the new Error Value "Loopback Failure".

   When the ingress node intends to take the particular node out of
   loopback mode, it MUST send a Path message with the Loopback
   Attribute Flag in the Attribute Flags TLV cleared.  The mechanism
   defined in [<a href="./rfc7570" title='"Label Switched Path (LSP) Attribute in the Explicit Route Object (ERO)"'>RFC7570</a>] is used to indicate that the particular node
   SHOULD exit loopback mode for this LSP.  The Administratively down
   (A) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object MUST be kept set to indicate the
   LSP is still in lock mode.

   On receipt of this Path message, the target node SHOULD try to take
   the LSP out of loopback mode.  If the node takes the LSP out of
   loopback mode successfully, it MUST clear the Loopback Attribute Flag
   in the RRO Hop Attributes subobject and push this subobject onto the
   RRO object in the corresponding Path or Resv message.  The
   Administratively down (A) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object MUST be kept
   set in the message.  Otherwise, the node MUST send a PathErr message
   with the Error Code "OAM Problem" [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>] and the new Error Value
   "Exit Loopback Failure".

   After the loopback mode is cleared successfully, the ingress node MAY
   remove the Lock Instruct using the mechanism defined in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.
   The ingress node MUST NOT request to exit lock mode if the LSP is

   when the LSP is still in loopback mode.
