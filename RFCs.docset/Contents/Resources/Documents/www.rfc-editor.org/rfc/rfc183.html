              The EBCDIC Codes and Their Mapping to ASCII

Abstract

   The uniquely map the ASCII codes into corresponding EBCDIC codes in a
   consistent manner throughout the ARPA Network, this RFC describes and
   defines the IBM Standard Extended BCD Interchanged Code.

Introduction

   The IBM Corporate Systems Standard, Extended BCD Interchanged Code
   (EBCDIC) defines 8-bit graphic and control codes (See Figure 1).  The
   basic EBCDIC code consists of 54 controls (including space) and 88
   graphics.  This set is extended to include 10 special graphics and 1
   special control (EO).  These special graphics originate from the 7-
   bit hollerith code and include 6 ASCII graphics.  The EBCDIC code is
   further extended to include the publishing and printing graphics
   option which specifics 52 graphics.  Of these graphics, 32 appear on
   the IBM TN print chain.  Four of these graphics are duals with
   graphics not on the TN print chain, and one graphic (degree) is dual
   with a graphic in the special graphics set of the basic code (tilde).

   It is desirable to uniquely map the ASCII codes into corresponding
   EBCDIC codes in a consistent manner throughout the ARPA network.

   For each of the 34 ASCII controls (including space and delete) there
   is a corresponding BDCDIC control (assigning ASCII control DC3 to the
   EBCDIC code X'13').  For 85 of the 94 ASCII graphics, there is a
   corresponding graphic in the basic EBCDIC set.  Three different
   correspondences can be made for the other 9 ASCII graphics.

   a) IBM recommends the following ASCII duals with the basic EBCDIC
      graphics.

           ASCII                   EBCDIC                  Code
           [                       [cent sign]             X'4A'
           ]                       !                       X'5A'
           !                       l                       X'4F'
           [carrot sign]           [upper right corner]    X'5F'

   Note that the EBCDIC graphic for exclamation point (!) is not chosen
   to correspond to the ASCII for exclamation point (!), though this
   would be a sensible choice, and thus another code must be used to
   represent this graphic.

   b) Special EBCDIC graphics would be used to represent the other ASCII
      graphics.

           Graphic                         Code
           l                               X'6A'
           l                               X'79'
           [diagonal slash]                X'A1'
           ~                               X'E0'
           [diagonal slash]                XC0'
           {                               XD0'
           }

II.  Publishing Correspondence

   a) Associate the following special EBCDIC graphics with the
      corresponding ASCII graphics.

           Graphic                         Code
           [<a href="#ref-carrot">carrot</a>]                        X'71'
           [                               X'AD'
           ]                               X'BD'
           {                               X'8B'
           }                               X'9B'

   The codes for open bracket and close bracket are chosen since these
   graphics appear on the TN print chain.  The codes for left brace and
   right brace are chosen rather than the codes in the special graphics
   set for opening brace and closing brace, respectively, since these
   graphics are similar and also appear on the TN print chain.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc183">RFC 183</a>         EBCDIC Codes and Their Mapping to ASCII    July 21, 1971</span>


III.  Graphical Correspondence

   a) Associate the following basic EBCDIC graphics with the indicated
      ASCII graphics because of their graphic similarity.

           |                       X'4F'           with |
                                                        |

           [upper right corner]    X'5F'           with ~

   b) Associate the basic EBCDIC graphic for cent with the ASCII graphic
      for reverse slash.

           [<a id="ref-cent">cent</a>]          X'4A'           with [diagonal slash]

   This choice is made since the cent graphic is not an ASCII graphic
   and is the only graphic in the basic EBCDIC set which would not
   otherwise be associated with any ACII graphic.

   c) Associate the special EBCDIC graphic grave accent.

         `  X'79'

      with the corresponding ASCII graphic.

   d) Associate the following publishing EBCDIC graphics with the
   corresponding ASCII graphics.

           [<a id="ref-carrot">carrot</a>]        X'71'
           [               X'AD'
           ]               X'BD'
           {               X'8B'
           }               X'9B'

   The codes for open bracket and close bracket are chosen since these
   graphic appear on the TN print chain.  The codes for left brace and
   right brace are chosen rather than the codes in the special graphics
   set for opening brace and closing brace, respectively, since these
   graphics are similar and also appear on the TN print chain.

   Standards:

   In order that the mapping from ASCII into EBCDIC and vice versa could
   become standardized, I would appreciate comments on the above from
   each site whose operating system uses EBCDIC as the internal code.






<span class="grey">Winett                                                          [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc183">RFC 183</a>         EBCDIC Codes and Their Mapping to ASCII    July 21, 1971</span>


   Telnet Codes:

   For those sites who may wish to provide our use TELNET services that
   communicate using an EBCDIC code, a standard code must be specified.
   The codes given in Figure 1 can form the basis for a standard.
   Specific codes must also be specified for the TELNET control codes.
   The following are suggested:

                                   Hex Code
           sync                    38
           break                   39
           NOP                     3A
           Return to ASCII         FF
           No echo                 14
           Echo                    23
           Hide input              24

   To eliminate using one code for two graphics, I propose that the TN
   graphics be associated with their corresponding code.  The graphic
   tilde (~) might be assigned to the code X'E1' rather than keeping the
   dual with the graphic for degree.  This would have no effect if the
   Graphical Correspondence were chosen for the EBCDIC to ASCII mapping
   with the code X'5F' for logical not associated with tilde.  The other
   graphics of the publishing and printing option (Double Acute,
   Inferior Hook, Macron, and Inferior Comma) which are not on the TN
   print chain but have the same codes as graphics on the TN print chain
   would not be considered to be part of the standard EBCDIC code.

   CC    ([illegible] Control). A functional character  [illegible] to
         control or facilitate transmission of introducing [illegible]
         communication networks.

   FB    (Format Bisector). A functional character which controls the
         layout of positioning or information in printing or display
         devices.

   IS    (Information Separator). A character which is used to separate
         and qualify information in a logical sense. There is a group of
         four such characters, which are to be used in a hierarchical
         order.

   DC    (Device Control). A functional character used for the control
         of ancillary devices associated with data processing of
         telecommunication systems, more especially switching devices
         "on" and "off".

   ED    (Edit and Mark). A control character used by the
         System/[illegible]...and Mark ([illegible]) instruction for the
         formatting of alphanumeric fields.

   GH    (Graphic Control). A control character indicating that the core
         combinations which follow are to be [illegible] in a particular
         code table, depending upon the particular control character.
