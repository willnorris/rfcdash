Abstract

   This memo describes a syntax for embedding S-HTTP negotiation
   parameters in HTML documents.  S-HTTP, as described by <a href="./rfc2660">RFC 2660</a>,
   contains the concept of negotiation headers which reflect the
   potential receiver of a message's preferences as to which crypto-
   graphic enhancements should be applied to the message. This document
   describes a syntax for binding these negotiation parameters to HTML
   anchors.

   1.  Introduction

   2.  Anchor Attributes

   We define the following new anchor (and form submission) attributes:

        DN -- The distinguished name of the principal for whom the
        request should be encrypted when dereferencing the anchor's url.
        This need not be specified, but failure to do so runs the risk
        that the client will be unable to determine the DN and therefore
        will be unable to encrypt.  This should be specified in the form
        of <a href="./rfc1485">RFC1485</a>, using SGML quoting conventions as needed.

        NONCE -- A free-format string (appropriately SGML quoted) which
        is to be included in a SHTTP-Nonce: header (after SGML quoting
        is removed) when the anchor is dereferenced.

        CRYPTOPTS -- Cryptographic option information as described in

        [<a href="#ref-SHTTP" title='"The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol"'>SHTTP</a>]. Specifically, the &lt;cryptopt-list&gt; production.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20CERTS%20Element"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  CERTS Element</span>

   A new CERTS HTML element is defined, which carries a (not necessarily
   related) group of certificates provided as advisory data. The element
   contents are not intended to be displayed to the user. Certificate
   groups may be provided appropriate for either PEM or PKCS-7
   implementations. Such certificates are supplied in the HTML document
   for the convenience of the recipient, who might otherwise be unable
   to retrieve the certificate (chain) corresponding to a DN specified
   in an anchor.

   The format should be the same as that of the 'Certificate-Info'
   header line, of [<a href="#ref-SHTTP" title='"The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol"'>SHTTP</a>] except that the &lt;Cert-Fmt&gt; specifier should
   be provided as the FMT attribute in the tag.

   Multiple CERTS elements are permitted; it is suggested that CERTS
   elements themselves be included in the HTML document's HEAD element
   (in the hope that the data will not be displayed by S-HTTP oblivious
   but HTML compliant browsers.)

   Cryptopts may also be broken out into an element and referred to in
   anchors by name. The NAME attribute specifies the name by which this
   element may be referred to in a CRYPTOPTS attribute in an anchor.
   Names must have a # as the leading character.

   An example of cryptographic data embedded in an anchor, proceeded by
   a certificate group is provided below. Note the SGML quoting syntax
   used to supply embedded quotation marks.
