   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing ethernet-like objects.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20Network%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The Network Management Framework</span>

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
      and naming objects for the purpose of management.  <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1284">RFC 1284</a>                 ETHERNET-LIKE OBJECTS             December 1991</span>


      defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
      consistent with the SMI.

      <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
      the Internet suite of protocols.  <a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a>, defines MIB-II, an
      evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
      operational requirements.

      <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
      access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Objects</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-7" title=" International Organization for Standardization">7</a>]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>3</a>] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-8" title=" International Standard 8825">8</a>],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>13</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1284">RFC 1284</a>                 ETHERNET-LIKE OBJECTS             December 1991</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Overview</span>

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface
   to an ethernet-like communications medium.  At present, ethernet-like
   media are identified by three values of the ifType object in the
   Internet-standard MIB:

               ethernet-csmacd(6)
               iso88023-csmacd(7)
               starLan(11)

   For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the
   MIB-II [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>6</a>] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

               dot3    OBJECT IDENTIFER ::= { transmission 7 }

   The definitions presented here are based on the IEEE 802.3 Layer
   Management Specification [<a href="#ref-9" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management"'>9</a>], as originally interpreted by Frank
   Kastenholz of Interlan in [<a href="#ref-10" title="F.">10</a>].  Implementors of these MIB objects
   should note that the IEEE document explicitly describes (in the form
   of Pascal pseudocode) when, where, and how various MAC attributes are
   measured.  The IEEE document also describes the effects of MAC
   actions that may be invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB
   objects defined here.

   To the extent that some of the attributes defined in [<a href="#ref-9" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management"'>9</a>] are
   represented by previously defined objects in the Internet-standard
   MIB or in the generic interface extensions MIB [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB"'>11</a>], such attributes
   are not redundantly represented by objects defined in this memo.
   Among the attributes represented by objects defined in other memos
   are the number of octets transmitted or received on a particular
   interface, the number of frames transmitted or received on a
   particular interface, the promiscuous status of an interface, the MAC
   address of an interface, and multicast information associated with an
   interface.

   The relationship between an ethernet-like interface and an interface
   in the context of the Internet-standard MIB is one-to-one.  As such,
   the value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to
   identify corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.

    -- the Ethernet-like Statistics group

    -- Implementation of this group is mandatory

    -- Due to implementation restrictions (e.g. in the
    -- instrumentation provided by a chipset, or a device
    -- driver), some of the counters in this group may be
    -- difficult or impossible to implement.
    -- In such cases, an implementator should apply reasonable
    -- best effort to detect as many occurrences as possible.
    -- In any case, the value of a counter will be the number
    -- actually detected, which will always be less or equal
    -- to the number of actual occurrences.  In the extreme
    -- case of a total inability to detect occurrences, the
    -- counter will always be zero.

    -- Vendors are strongly encouraged to document in user guides and
    -- other appropriate documentation the conditions under which the
    -- values of the counters in this group may represent an
    -- underestimate of the true count.

    --  802.3 Tests

    -- The ifExtnsTestTable defined in [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB"'>11</a>] provides a common means
    -- for a manager to test any interface corresponding to a value
    -- of ifIndex.

    -- At this time, one well known test (testFullDuplexLoopBack) is
    -- defined in [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB"'>11</a>].  For ethernet-like interfaces, this test
    -- configures the MAC chip and executes an internal loopback
    -- test of memory and the MAC chip logic.  This loopback test can

    -- only be executed if the interface is offline.  Once the test
    -- has completed, the MAC chip should be reinitialized for network
    -- operation, but it should remain offline.

    -- If an error occurs during a test, the object ifExtnsTestResult
    -- (defined in [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB"'>11</a>]) will be set to failed(7).  The following two
    -- OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be used to provided more information as
    -- values for the object ifExtnsTestCode in [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB"'>11</a>]:

    dot3Errors             OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { dot3 7 }

    --  TDR Test

    -- Another test, specific to ethernet-like interfaces,
    -- is Time-domain Reflectometry (TDR) which is defined
    -- as follows:

    dot3Tests   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { dot3 6 }
    dot3TestTdr OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { dot3Tests 1 }

    -- A TDR test returns as its result the time interval between the
    -- most recent TDR test transmission and the subsequent detection
    -- of a collision.  This interval is based on a 10 MHz clock and
    -- should be normalized if the time base is other than 10 MHz.
    -- On successful completion of a TDR test, the result is stored
    -- as the value of the appropriate instance of the MIB object
    -- dot3TestTdrValue, and the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of that instance
    -- is stored in the corresponding instance of ifExtnsTestResult
    -- (thereby indicating where the result has been stored).


   --  802.3 Hardware Chipsets

   -- The object ifExtnsChipSet is provided in [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB"'>11</a>] to identify the
   -- MAC hardware used to communcate on an interface.  The following
   -- hardware chipsets are provided for 802.3:

   This document was produced by the Transmission MIB Working Group.

   This document is based on a document written by Frank Kastenholz of
   Interlan entitled IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft M compatible MIB
   for TCP/IP Networks [<a href="#ref-10" title="F.">10</a>].  This document has been modestly reworked,
   initially by the SNMP Working Group, and then by the Transmission
   Working Group, to reflect the current conventions for defining
   objects for MIB interfaces.  James Davin, of the MIT Laboratory for
   Computer Science, and Keith McCloghrie of Hughes LAN Systems,
   contributed to later drafts of this memo. Marshall Rose of
   Performance Systems International, Inc. converted the document into
   its current concise format.  Thanks to Frank Kastenholz of Interlan
   and Louis Steinberg of IBM for their experimentation.
