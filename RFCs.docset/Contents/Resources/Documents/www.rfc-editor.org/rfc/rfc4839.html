Abstract

   This document serves to register a media type for the Open eBook
   Publication Structure (OEBPS) Package Files.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The present document registers a media type for the Open eBook
   Publication Structure (OEBPS) Package File (OPF).  The OPF file is an
   XML file that describes an OEBPS Publication [<a href="#ref-OEBPS" title='"Open eBook Publication Structure 1.2"'>OEBPS</a>].  It identifies
   all other files in the publication and provides descriptive
   information about them.  OPF and its related standards are maintained
   and defined by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).

   The media type defined here is needed to correctly identify OPF files
   when they are edited on disk, referenced in OEBPS Container files, or
   used in other places where media types are used.

   The OPF files contain well-formed XML conforming to the XML 1.0
   specification.

   Clearly, it is possible to author malicious files which, for example,
   contain malformed data.  Most XML parsers protect themselves from
   such attacks by rigorously enforcing conformance.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4839">RFC 4839</a>            Media Type Registrations for OPF          April 2007</span>


   All processors that read OPF files should rigorously check the size
   and validity of data retrieved.

   There is no current provision in the OEBPS Package File standard for
   encryption, signing, or authentication within the file format.
