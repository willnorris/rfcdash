Discussion

   The transition of the Network Information Center from SRI
   International in Menlo Park, CA, to Government Systems Inc. in
   Chantilly, VA, is officially scheduled for 1 October 1991.  This
   includes the transition of services currently offered to DDN and
   Internet users by SRI.  These services include network/user
   registration (i.e., network number and top level domain name
   assignment), on-line information services, and Help Desk operations.
   GSI will also continue RFC and Internet-Draft archive and
   distribution services.

   SRI will continue to provide all NIC services and respond to all user
   calls and requests until 30 September 1991.

   Defense Information System Agency (DISA) and GSI will make every
   effort to ensure a smooth and timely transition of NIC services from
   SRI.  Network users should be minimally impacted.  With a few minor
   exceptions, all on-line services currently offered by SRI will appear
   the same to the user when a connection is established to the new
   (GSI) NIC host.  These exceptions are due to the change from the
   TOPS20 operating system to the SunOS operating system.  The new NIC
   host is a Sun 470 SPARCserver running SunOS 4.1.  All users on the
   DDN and the Internet should carefully note the following changes:

   Help Desk Telephone Numbers:

                             1-800-365-3642 (1-800-365-DNIC)
                             1-703-802-4535


   Help Desk Hours of Operation:

                             7:00 am to 7:00 pm Eastern Time


   Fax Number:               1-703-802-8376

   Network Address:          192.112.36.5 (NIC.DDN.MIL)

   Root Domain Server:       192.112.36.4 (NS.NIC.DDN.MIL)

   During the period of 26 to 30 September 1991 the ID (WHOIS) database
   will not be changed.  All registration actions for this five day
   period will be suspended.  This action is necessary in order to
   transfer the master database to GSI.  Starting 26 September 1991, all
   U.S. mail and fax requests should be directed to the GSI address and
   fax number shown above.  All electronic mail requests should continue
   to be directed to the "HOSTMASTER" and "REGISTRAR" mailboxes at
   NIC.DDN.MIL.  As appropriate, SRI will redirect electronic mail to
   GSI.  On 1 October 1991 all registration activities will resume.

   We hope that the transition and its accompanying changes will not
   greatly inconvenience network users, and we thank you in advance for
   your patience and understanding.  For general questions regarding the
   transition, users may call the new NIC Help Desk after September 1,
   1991 at 1-800-365-3642/703-802-4535 or send an e-mail message to
   nic@diis.ddn.mil.
