Abstract

   This document proposes a framework for the management of the Locator/
   ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Endpoint Identifier (EID) address
   block.  The framework described relies on hierarchical distribution
   of the address space, granting temporary usage of prefixes of such
   space to requesting organizations.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7955">RFC 7955</a>                LISP EID Block Management         September 2016</span>


   This document proposes a management framework for the registration of
   EID prefixes from that block, allowing the requesting organization
   exclusive use of those EID prefixes limited to the duration of the
   LISP experiment.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Definition%20of%20Terms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Definition of Terms</span>

   This document does not introduce any new terms related to the set of
   LISP Specifications ([<a href="./rfc6830" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)"'>RFC6830</a>], [<a href="./rfc6831" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) for Multicast Environments"'>RFC6831</a>], [<a href="./rfc6832" title='"Interworking between Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) and Non-LISP Sites"'>RFC6832</a>], [<a href="./rfc6833" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Map-Server Interface"'>RFC6833</a>],

   reader is familiar with the LISP terminology.  [<a href="#ref-INTRO" title='"An Architectural Introduction to the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)"'>INTRO</a>] provides an
   introduction to the LISP technology, including its terminology.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20EID%20Prefix%20Registration%20Policy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  EID Prefix Registration Policy</span>

   The request for registration of EID prefixes MUST be done under the
   following policies:

   1.  EID prefixes are made available in the reserved space on a
       temporary basis and for experimental uses.  The requester of an
       experimental prefix MUST provide a short description of the
       intended use or experiment that will be carried out (see
       <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>).  If the prefix will be used for activities not
       documented in the original description, renewal of the
       registration may be denied.

   2.  EID prefix registrations MUST be renewed on a regular basis to
       ensure their use by active participants in the experiment.  The
       registration period is 12 months.  A renewal SHOULD NOT cause a
       change in the EID prefix registered in the previous request.  The
       conditions of registration renewal are to be the same as the
       conditions of the first EID prefix registration request.

   3.  It is preferable that EID prefixes whose registrations have
       expired not be reused.  When an EID prefix registration is
       removed from the registry, then the reuse of the EID prefix in a
       subsequent registration on behalf of a different end user should
       be avoided where possible.  If the considerations of overall
       usage of the EID block prefix requires reuse of a previously
       registered EID prefix, then a minimum delay of at least one week
       between removal and subsequent registration SHOULD be applied by
       the registry operator.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7955">RFC 7955</a>                LISP EID Block Management         September 2016</span>


   4.  When the reserved experimental LISP EID block expires, all EID
       prefix registrations expire as well.  The further disposition of
       these prefixes and the associated registry entries are to be
       specified in the announcement of the cessation of this
       experiment.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20EID%20Prefixes%20Registration%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  EID Prefixes Registration Requirements</span>

   All EID prefix registrations MUST satisfy the following requirements:

   1.  All EID prefix registrations MUST use a globally unique EID
       prefix.

   2.  The EID prefix registration information, as specified in
       <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>, MUST be collected upon initial registration and
       renewal, and made publicly available through interfaces allowing
       both the retrieval of specific registration details (search) and
       the enumeration of the entire registry contents (e.g., RDAP
       ([<a href="./rfc7481" title='"Security Services for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)"'>RFC7481</a>]), WHOIS, HTTP, or similar access methods).

   3.  The registry operator MUST permit the delegation of EID prefixes
       in the reverse DNS space to holders of registered EID prefixes.

   4.  Anyone can obtain an entry in the EID prefix registry, on the
       understanding that the prefix so registered is for the exclusive
       use in the LISP experimental network, and that their registration
       details (as specified in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>) are openly published in the
       EID prefix registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20EID%20Prefix%20Request%20Template"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  EID Prefix Request Template</span>

   The following is a basic request template for prefix registration to
   ensure a uniform process.  This template is inspired by IANA's online
   "Private Enterprise Number (PEN) Request" form
   &lt;<a href="http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page">http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page</a>&gt;.

   Note that all details in this registration become part of the
   registry and will be published in the LISP EID Prefix Registry
   managed by RIPE NCC.

   The EID Prefix Request template MUST at a minimum contain:

   1.  Organization (In the case of individuals requesting an EID
       prefix, this section can be left empty)

       (a)  Organization Name

       (b)  Organization Address

       (b)  Prefix Size Rationale

       (c)  Lease Period

         +  Note well: All EID Prefix registrations will be valid until
            the earlier date of 12 months from the date of registration
            or August 2019.

         +  All registrations may be renewed by the applicant for
            further 12-month periods, ending on August 2019.

         +  According to the 3+3 year experimentation plan, defined in
            [<a href="./rfc7954" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Endpoint Identifier (EID) Block"'>RFC7954</a>], all registrations MUST end by August 2019, unless
            the IETF community decides to grant a permanent LISP EID
            address block.  In the latter case, registrations following
            the present document policy MUST end by August 2022 and a
            new policy (to be decided -- see <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>) will apply
            thereafter.

   The policy outlined in the present document is tied to the existence
   of the experimental LISP EID block requested in [<a href="./rfc7954" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Endpoint Identifier (EID) Block"'>RFC7954</a>] and is
   valid until August 2019.

   If the IETF decides to transform the block into a permanent
   allocation, the usage period reserved for the LISP EID block will be
   extended for three years (until August 2022) to allow time for the
   IETF to define, following the policies outlined in [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>], the
   final size of the EID block and create a transition plan, while the
   policy in the present document will still apply.

   Note that, as stated in [<a href="./rfc7954" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Endpoint Identifier (EID) Block"'>RFC7954</a>], the transition of the EID block
   into a permanent allocation has the potential to pose policy issues
   (as recognized in <a href="./rfc2860#section-4.3">[RFC2860], Section 4.3</a>); hence, discussion with the
   IANA, the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) communities, and the IETF
   community will be necessary to determine the appropriate policy for
   permanent EID prefix management, which will be effective after August
   2022.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document does not introduce new security threats in the LISP
   architecture nor in the Legacy Internet architecture.

   For accountability reasons and in line with the security
   considerations in [<a href="./rfc7020" title='"The Internet Numbers Registry System"'>RFC7020</a>], each registration request MUST contain
   accurate information about the requesting entity (company,
   institution, individual, etc.) and valid and accurate contact
   information of a referral person (see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA allocated the following IPv6 address block for experimental use
   as the LISP EID prefix [<a href="./rfc7954" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Endpoint Identifier (EID) Block"'>RFC7954</a>]:

   o  Address Block: 2001:5::/32

   o  Name: EID Space for LISP

   o  RFC: [<a href="./rfc7954" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Endpoint Identifier (EID) Block"'>RFC7954</a>]

   o  Further details are at: www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-
      special-registry

   To grant requesting organizations and individuals exclusive use of
   EID prefixes out of this reserved block (limited to the duration of
   the LISP experiment as outlined in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>), there is an
   operational requirement for an EID registration service.

   Provided that the policies and requirements outlined in Sections <a href="#section-4">4</a>,
   5, and 6 are satisfied, EID prefix registration is accorded based on
   a "First Come First Served" basis.

   There is no hard limit to the number of registrations an organization
   or individual can submit, as long as the information described in
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> is provided, in particular point 4: "Experiment
   Description".

   For the duration defined in [<a href="./rfc7954" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Endpoint Identifier (EID) Block"'>RFC7954</a>], RIPE NCC will manage the LISP
   EID prefix as described herein.  Therefore, this document has no IANA
   actions.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.%20%20Procedures%20to%20be%20Followed%20by%20RIPE%20NCC"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" id="section-10">10</a>.  Procedures to be Followed by RIPE NCC</span>

   RIPE NCC will provide the registration service following the EID
   Prefix Registration Policy (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>) and the EID Prefix
   Registration Requirements (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>) provided in this document.  The
   request form provided by RIPE NCC will include at least the
   information from the template in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.  RIPE NCC will make all
   received requests publicly available.  While this document does not
   suggest any minimum allocation size; RIPE NCC is allowed to introduce
   such a minimum size for management purposes.
