   PASSporT [<a href="./rfc8225" title='"PASSporT: Personal Assertion Token"'>RFC8225</a>] is a token format based on JSON Web Token (JWT)
   [<a href="./rfc7519" title='"JSON Web Token (JWT)"'>RFC7519</a>] for conveying cryptographically signed information about
   the identities involved in personal communications.  PASSporT with
   Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) [<a href="./rfc8224" title='"Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC8224</a>] provides a
   mechanism by which an authority on the originating side of a call,
   using a protocol like SIP [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>], can provide a cryptographic
   assurance of the validity of the calling party telephone number in
   order to prevent impersonation attacks.




<span class="grey">Singh, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-3"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8443">RFC 8443</a>                      PASSporT-ext                   August 2018</span>


   [<a id="ref-RFC4412">RFC4412</a>] defines a mechanism to prioritize access to SIP-signaled
   resources during periods of communications resource scarcity using
   the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header.  As specified in [<a href="./rfc4412" title='"Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4412</a>], the
   SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field may be used by SIP user agents
   (UAs) [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] (including Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
   gateways and SIP proxy servers) to influence prioritization afforded
   to communication sessions, including PSTN calls (e.g., to manage
   scarce network resources during network congestion scenarios).
   However, the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field could be spoofed
   and abused by unauthorized entities, the threat models and use cases
   of which are described in [<a href="./rfc7375" title='"Secure Telephone Identity Threat Model"'>RFC7375</a>] and [<a href="./rfc7340" title='"Secure Telephone Identity Problem Statement and Requirements"'>RFC7340</a>], respectively.

   Compromise of the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field [<a href="./rfc4412" title='"Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4412</a>]
   could lead to misuse of network resources (i.e., during congestion
   scenarios), impacting the application services supported using the
   SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field.

   [<a id="ref-RFC8225">RFC8225</a>] allows extensions by which an authority on the originating
   side verifying the authorization of a particular communication for
   the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field can use a PASSPorT claim to
   cryptographically sign the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field and
   convey assertion of the authorization for the SIP 'Resource-Priority'
   header field.  A signed SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field will
   allow a receiving entity (including entities located in different
   network domains/boundaries) to verify the validity of assertions
   authorizing the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field and to act on
   the information with confidence that the information has not been
   spoofed or compromised.

   This specification documents an extension to PASSporT and the
   associated STIR mechanisms to provide a function to cryptographically
   sign the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field.  This PASSporT object
   is used to provide attestation of a calling-user authorization for
   priority communications.  This is necessary in addition to the
   PASSporT object that is used for calling-user telephone-number
   attestation.  How this extension to PASSporT is used for real-time
   communications supported using the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header
   field is outside the scope of this document.  In addition, the
   PASSPorT extension defined in this document is intended for use in
   environments where there are means to verify that the signer of the
   SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field is authoritative.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20PASSporT%20%22rph%22%20Claim"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  PASSporT "rph" Claim</span>

   This specification defines a new JSON Web Token claim for "rph" that
   provides an assertion for information in the SIP 'Resource-Priority'
   header field.

   The creator of a PASSporT object adds a "ppt" value of "rph" to the
   header of a PASSporT object.  The PASSporT claims MUST contain an
   "rph" claim, and any entities verifying the PASSporT object will be
   required to understand the "ppt" extension in order to process the
   PASSporT in question.  A PASSPorT header with the "ppt" included will
   look as follows:

   {
   "typ":"passport",
     "ppt":"rph",
     "alg":"ES256",
     "x5u":"https://www.example.org/cert.cer"
   }

   The "rph" claim will provide an assertion of authorization, "auth",
   for information in the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field based on
   [<a href="./rfc4412" title='"Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4412</a>].  The syntax is:

   {
   Resource-Priority = "Resource-Priority" : r-value,
   r-value = namespace  "."  r-priority
   }

   Specifically, the "rph" claim includes an assertion of the priority
   level of the user to be used for a given communication session.  The
   value of the "rph" claim is an object with one or more keys.  Each
   key is associated with a JSON array.  These arrays contain strings
   that correspond to the r-values indicated in the SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' header field.








<span class="grey">Singh, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>

   The following is an example "rph" claim for a SIP 'Resource-Priority'
   header field with one r-value of "ets.0" and with another r-value of
   "wps.0":

    {
     "orig":{"tn":"12155550112"},
     "dest":{["tn":"12125550113"]},
     "iat":1443208345,
     "rph":{"auth":["ets.0", "wps.0"]}
    }

   After the header and claims PASSporT objects have been constructed,
   their signature is generated normally per the guidance in [<a href="./rfc8225" title='"PASSporT: Personal Assertion Token"'>RFC8225</a>]
   using the full form of PASSPorT.  The credentials (i.e., Certificate)
   used to create the signature must have authority over the namespace
   of the "rph" claim, and there is only one authority per claim.  The
   authority MUST use its credentials associated with the specific
   service supported by the resource priority namespace in the claim.
   If r-values are added or dropped by the intermediaries along the
   path, the intermediaries must generate a new "rph" header and sign
   the claim with their own authority.

   The use of the compact form of PASSporT is not specified in this
   document.

   This section specifies SIP-specific usage for the "rph" claim in
   PASSporT.

   The Authentication Service will create the "rph" claim using the
   values discussed in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of this document that are based on
   [<a href="./rfc4412" title='"Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4412</a>].  The construction of the "rph" claim follows the steps
   described in <a href="./rfc8224#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of [RFC8224]</a>.

   The resulting Identity header for "rph" might look as follows
   (backslashes shown for line folding only):

   A SIP authentication service will derive the value of "rph" from the
   SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field based on policy associated with
   service-specific use of r-values, defined as follows in [<a href="./rfc4412" title='"Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4412</a>]:

      r-value = namespace "." r-priority

   The authentication service derives the value of the PASSPorT claim by
   verifying the authorization for the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header
   field (i.e., verifying a calling-user privilege for the SIP
   'Resource-Priority' header field based on its identity).  The
   authorization might be derived from customer-profile data or access
   to external services.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4412">RFC4412</a>] allows multiple "namespace "." priority value" pairs,
   either in a single SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field or across
   multiple SIP 'Resource-Priority' header fields.  An authority is
   responsible for signing all the content of a SIP 'Resource-Priority'
   header field for which it has the authority.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Verification%20Service%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Verification Service Behavior</span>

   <a href="./rfc8224#section-6.2">[RFC8224], SectionÂ 6.2</a>, Step 5 requires that specifications defining
   "ppt" values describe any additional verifier behavior.  The behavior
   specified for the "ppt" values of "rph" is as follows:

   The verification service MUST extract the value associated with the
   "auth" key in a full-form PASSPorT with a "ppt" value of "rph".  If
   the signature validates, then the verification service can use the
   value of the "rph" claim as validation that the calling party is
   authorized for SIP 'Resource-Priority' header fields as indicated in
   the claim.  This value would, in turn, be used for priority treatment
   in accordance with local policy for the associated communication
   service.  If the signature validation fails, the verification service
   should infer that the calling party is not authorized for SIP
   'Resource-Priority' header fields as indicated in the claim.  In such
   cases, the priority treatment for the associated communication
   service is handled as per the local policy of the verifier.  In such
   scenarios, the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field SHOULD be
   stripped from the SIP request, and the network entities should treat
   the call as an ordinary call.

   In addition, <a href="./rfc8224#section-6.2">[RFC8224], SectionÂ 6.2</a>, Step 4 requires the "iat" value
   in "rph" claim to be verified.

   The behavior of a SIP UA upon receiving an INVITE containing a
   PASSporT object with an "rph" claim will largely remain a matter of
   implementation policy for the specific communication service.  In
   most cases, implementations would act based on confidence in the
   veracity of this information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Header%20Field"></a>    Header Field</span>

   There may be additional information about the calling party or the
   call that could be relevant to authorization for the SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' header field.  This may include information related to the
   device subscription of the caller, to any institutions that the
   caller or device is associated with, or even to categories of
   institutions.  All of these data elements would benefit from the
   secure attestations provided by the STIR and PASSporT frameworks.
   The specification of the "rph" claim could entail the optional
   presence of one or more such additional information fields applicable
   to the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field.

   A new IANA registry has been defined to hold potential values of the
   "rph" array; see <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>.  The definition of the "rph" claim may
   have one or more such additional information field(s).  Details of
   how an "rph" claim encompasses other data elements are left for
   future specifications.

   The PASSporT extension with a "ppt" value of "rph" MUST only be sent
   with SIP INVITE when the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field is used
   to convey the priority of the communication, as defined in [<a href="./rfc4412" title='"Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4412</a>].
   To avoid replay and cut-and-paste attacks, the recommendations
   provided in <a href="./rfc8224#section-12.1">SectionÂ 12.1 of [RFC8224]</a> MUST be followed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.2.%20%20Solution%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" id="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Solution Considerations</span>

   Using extensions to PASSporT tokens with a "ppt" value of "rph"
   requires knowledge of the authentication, authorization, and
   reputation of the signer to attest to the identity being asserted,
   including validating the digital signature and the associated
   certificate chain to a trust anchor.  The following considerations
   should be recognized when using PASSporT extensions with a "ppt"
   value of "rph":

   o  A signer is only allowed to sign the content of a SIP 'Resource-
      Priority' header field for which it has the proper authorization.
      Before signing tokens, the signer MUST have a secure method for
      authentication of the end user or the device being granted a
      token.

   o  The verification of the signature MUST include means of verifying
      that the signer is authoritative for the signed content of the
      resource priority namespace in the PASSporT.
