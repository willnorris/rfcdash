Introduction

   This RFC defines the format of two new Resource Records (RRs) for the
   Domain Name System (DNS), and reserves corresponding DNS type
   mnemonic and numerical codes.  This format may be used with the any
   proposal that has variable length addresses, but is targeted for CLNP
   use.

   This memo assumes that the reader is familiar with the DNS [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities"'>3</a>,<a href="#ref-4" title='"Domain Names - Implementation and Specification"'>4</a>].

Background

   This section describes an experimental representation of NSAP
   addresses in the DNS. There are several reasons to take this approch.
   First, it provides simple documentation of the correct addresses to
   use in static configurations of CLNP compliant hosts and routers.

   NSAP support requires that a new DNS resource record entry type
   ("NSAP") be defined, to store longer Internet (i.e., NSAP) addresses.
   This resource record allows mapping from DNS names to NSAP addresses,
   and will contain entries for systems which are able to run Internet
   applications, over TCP or UDP, over CLNP.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1348">RFC 1348</a>                      DNS NSAP RRs                     July 1992</span>


   The backward translation (from NSAP address to DNS name) is
   facilitated by definition of an associated resource record. This
   resource record is known as "NSAP-PTR", and is used in a manner
   analogous to the existing "in-addr.arpa".

   These RRs are intended for use in a proposal [<a href="#ref-6" title='"TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses (TUBA), A Simple Proposal for Internet Addressing and Routing"'>6</a>] by one of the
   members of the NOOP WG to address the next-generation internet.

The NSAP RR

   The NSAP RR is defined with mnemonic NSAP and type code 22 (decimal).

   An NSAP (Network Service Access Protocol) number is a unique string
   to OSI transport service.

   The numbering plan follows <a href="./rfc1237">RFC 1237</a> and associated OSI definitions
   for NSAP format.

   NSAP has the following format:

   &lt;owner&gt; &lt;ttl&gt; &lt;class&gt; NSAP &lt;length&gt; &lt;NSAP-address&gt;

   All fields are required.

   &lt;length&gt; identifies the number of octets in the &lt;NSAP-address&gt; as
   defined by the various national and international authorities.

   &lt;NSAP-address&gt; enumerates the actual octet values assigned by the
   assigning authority.  Its format in master files is a &lt;character-
   string&gt; syntactically identical to that used in TXT and HINFO.

   The format of NSAP is class insensitive.  NSAP RR causes no
   additional section processing.

   For example:

foo.bar.com.    IN  NSAP   21 47000580ffff000000321099991111222233334444
host.school.de  IN  NSAP   17 39276f3100111100002222333344449876

   The RR data is the ASCII representation of the digits.  It is encoded
   as two &lt;character-strings&gt;, i.e., count followed by characters.

The NSAP-PTR RR

   The NSAP-PTR RR is defined with mnemonic NSAP-PTR and a type code 23
   (decimal).

   Its function is analogous to the PTR record used for IP addresses

   [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Domain Names - Implementation and Specification"'>4</a>,<a href="#ref-7" title='"DNS Encoding of Network Names and Other Types"'>7</a>].

   NSAP-PTR has the following format:

   &lt;NSAP-suffix&gt; &lt;ttl&gt; &lt;class&gt; NSAP-PTR &lt;owner&gt;

   All fields are required.

   &lt;NSAP-suffix&gt; enumerates the actual octet values assigned by the
   assigning authority for the LOCAL network.  Its format in master
   files is a &lt;character-string&gt; syntactically identical to that used in
   TXT and HINFO.

   The format of NSAP-PTR is class insensitive.  NSAP-PTR RR causes no
   additional section processing.

   For example:

   In net ff08000574.nsap-in-addr.arpa:

   444433332222111199990123000000ff    NSAP-PTR   foo.bar.com.

   Or in net 11110031f67293.nsap-in-addr.arpa:

   67894444333322220000  NSAP-PTR        host.school.de.

   The RR data is the ASCII representation of the digits.  It is encoded
   as a &lt;character-string&gt;.
