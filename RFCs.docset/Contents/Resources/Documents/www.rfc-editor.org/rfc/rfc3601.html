Abstract

   This memo describes the full set of notations needed to represent a
   text string in a Dial Sequence.  A Dial Sequence is normally composed
   of Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) elements, plus separators and
   additional "actions" (such as "wait for dialtone", "pause for N
   secs", etc.) which could be needed to successfully establish the
   connection with the target service:  this includes the cases where
   subaddresses or DTMF menu navigation apply.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Since the very first devices interacting with GSTN services appeared,
   a need for a unique text string representation of commonly called
   telephone numbers, and more generally DTMF sequences and actions, was
   foreseen.

   This memo describes the full text string representation method.  This
   specification was explicitly created to provide an easy, unique and
   complete reference which MUST be used by all other specifications
   needing a text string representation for a Dial Sequence.

   The specification was collected directly from Dial Sequence
   definitions which are already described in existing Standard Track
   specifications (such as [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Minimal GSTN address format in Internet Mail"'>6</a>] [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Minimal FAX address format in Internet Mail"'>7</a>] [<a href="#ref-8" title='"GSTN Address Element Extensions in E-mail Services"'>8</a>] [<a href="#ref-9" title='"URLs for Telephone Calls"'>9</a>]), and is fully synchronized
   with them.  Full compatibility is thus assured, and as a consequence,
   this specification results in a compendium of existing definitions.

   This notation is a fully compatible compendium of existing notations,
   and should be used in all specifications needing a text string
   representation of a Dial Sequence.

   Although the commonly called "telephone numbers" are normally used to
   generate a Dial Sequence when establishing a connection, the full
   abstract E.164 addresses [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>], i.e., the universal addressing on the
   Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN), have further elements which
   cannot be dialled.  Thus abstract E.164 addresses cannot be fully
   converted into a Dial Sequence or fully represented using this
   notation.

   The possible elements composing a Dial Sequence can vary from a
   minimum number, up to a really large and complex collection: in fact,
   the sequences already needed to dial a gstn-phone, which is a subset
   of the generic Dial Sequence, well represents this variety and
   complexity of cases.

   In particular, a Dial Sequence is composed by:

   -  "DTMF elements": normally available as "keys" on numeric keypads
      of dialling devices;

   -  "actions": normally performed by the agent (human or device)
      composing the Dial Sequence;

   -  "separators": used only to improve human readability of a Dial
      Sequence.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20The%20%22phone-string%22%20definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  The "phone-string" definition</span>

   The text representation of the Dial Sequence elements is defined in
   the phone-string specification:

      phone-string = 1*( DTMF / pause / tonewait / written-sep )

      DTMF = ( DIGIT / "#" / "*" / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" )
                     ; special DTMF codes like "*", "#", "A", "B",
                     ; "C", "D" are defined in [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].
                     ; Important Note: these elements only apply for
                     ; alphabetic strings used in DTMF operations.
                     ; They are NOT applicable for the alphabetic
                     ; characters that are mapped to digits on phone
                     ; keypads in some countries.

      pause = "p"

      tonewait = "w"

      written-sep = ( "-" / "." )

   Note:
      DTMF are the "DTMF elements", pause and tonewait are the "actions"
      and written-sep are the "separators".

   The "pause" and "tonewait" elements interpretation of the phone-
   string depends on the specific devices and implementation using the
   specification.  Thus their exact meaning is not mandated in this

   document.  The next section provides some examples drawn from common
   practice.  Both "pause" and "tonewait" are case insensitive.

   Implementation of "pause" and "tonewait":

      -  one instance of a "pause" SHOULD be interpreted as a pause of
         one second between the preceding and succeeding dial string
         elements;

      -  a "tonewait" SHOULD be interpreted as a pause that will last
         until the calling party hears a dial tone or another indication
         that more dial string characters may be processed.  An off-hook
         indication MAY also be interpreted as this kind of indication
         (meaning that the audio channel has been opened to the
         receiving party);

      -  because these characters are not a part of the GSTN subscriber
         address (telephone number) per se, any dial string characters
         that succeed either a "pause" or "tonewait" SHOULD be sent
         using DTMF signalling.

   The use of written-sep elements is allowed in order to improve human
   readability of the phone-string.  The written-sep are elements which
   can be placed between dial elements, such as digits etc.  Any
   occurrences of written-sep elements in a phone-string MUST NOT result
   in any action.  Conformant implementations MAY drop or insert
   written-sep into the phone-string they handle.

   The phone-string definition is used in the following sections to
   explicitly describe the encoding of some specific subcases where it
   applies.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20The%20%22gstn-phone%22%20definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  The "gstn-phone" definition</span>

   In order to access a GSTN address, a human or a device must perform a
   Dial Sequence.  Thus, a GSTN address can be represented using the
   phone-string elements.  In particular, diallable E.164 numeric
   addresses [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>] represent a limited subset of all possible GSTN
   addresses, while the complete complex case needs a full encoding
   schema, as it also includes a local or private addressing schema.

   In order to describe this distinction and provide anyhow a complete
   encoding schema, the following definition of "gstn-phone" is
   provided:

      gstn-phone = ( global-phone / local-phone )

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3601">RFC 3601</a>       Dial Sequences and GSTN / E.164 Addresses  September 2003</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20The%20%22global-phone%22%20definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  The "global-phone" definition</span>

   The purpose of the global-phone element is to represent diallable
   E.164 numeric addresses.  As such, it uses a subset of a phone-string
   definition only.

   The syntax for a global-phone element is as follows:

      global-phone = "+" 1*( DIGIT / written-sep )

   Any other dialling schemes MUST NOT use the leading "+" defined here.
   The "+" sign is strictly reserved for the standard "global-phone"
   syntax, and, even if not specifically part of the phone-string
   definition, it is needed to uniquely label a global-phone.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20The%20%22local-phone%22%20definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  The "local-phone" definition</span>

   The local-phone element is intended to represent the set of possible
   cases where the global-phone numbering schema does not apply.  Given
   the different and complex conventions currently being used in the
   GSTN system, the local-phone definition supports a large number of
   elements.

   The detailed syntax for local-phone elements is as follows:

      local-phone =  [ exit-code ] dial-number

      local-phone =/ exit-code [ dial-number ]

      exit-code = phone-string
                  ; this will include elements such as the digit to
                  ; access outside line, the long distance carrier
                  ; access code, the access password to the service,
                  ; etc...

      dial-number = phone-string
                  ; this is in many cases composed of different elements
                  ; such as the local phone number, the area code
                  ; (if needed), the international country code
                  ; (if needed), etc...

   Notes:
      The "+" character is reserved for use in a global-phone and MUST
      NOT be used in a local-phone string;

      Please note that a local-phone string MUST NOT be a null string,
      i.e., at least an exit-code, or a dial-number or both MUST be
      present.

   In GSTN service, there are cases where a subaddress is required to
   specify the final destination.  To specify these subaddresses, a Dial
   Sequence is also used, and thus the "subaddr-string" can be encoded
   as:

      subaddr-string = phone-string

   Note:
      Within actual uses of subaddresses, some specific services can
      limit the possible set of phone-string elements allowed.  In
      particular, there are ISDN subaddresses [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>] [<a href="#ref-8" title='"GSTN Address Element Extensions in E-mail Services"'>8</a>], which restrict
      the phone-string elements to 1*( DIGIT / written-sep ) and service
      specific subaddresses, like the fax service T.33 subaddress [<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]
      [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Minimal FAX address format in Internet Mail"'>7</a>], which restrict phone-string elements to 1*( DIGIT ).

   In some cases, after the connection with the destination GSTN device
   has been established, a further dialling sequence is required to
   access further services.  A typical example is an automated menu-
   driven service using DTMF sequences. These cases may be represented
   using the "post-dial" definition below:

      post-dial = phone-string

   set of examples.  Please note that all the examples are for

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Conclusions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Conclusions</span>

   This proposal creates a full standard text encoding for Dial
   Sequences, including GSTN and diallable E.164 addresses, and thus
   provides a unique common representation method both for standard
   protocols and applications.

   Some definitions, like these corresponding to an alias of the generic
   phone-string element, are somewhat a theoretical distinction; however
   they are useful to provide a more subtle distinction, allowing other
   specifications to be more exact in a consistent way.

   The proposal is consistent with existing standard specifications.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document specifies a means to represent Dial Sequences, which
   could include GSTN addresses and private codes sequences, like
   Personal Identification Numbers, to access special services.  As
   these text strings could be transmitted without encoding inside
   protocols or applications services, this could allow unauthorized
   people to gain access to these codes.  Users SHOULD be provided
   methods to prevent this disclosure, like code encryption, or
   masquerading techniques: out-of-band communication of authorization
   information or use of encrypted data in special fields are the
   available non-standard techniques.
