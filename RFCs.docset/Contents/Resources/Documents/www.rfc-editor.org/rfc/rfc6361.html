Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) defines a Link Control Protocol
   (LCP) and a method for negotiating the use of multiprotocol traffic
   over point-to-point links.  This document describes PPP support for
   the Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Protocol,
   allowing direct communication between Routing Bridges (RBridges) via
   PPP links.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The TRILL Protocol [<a href="./rfc6325" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>] defines a set of mechanisms used to
   communicate between RBridges.  These devices can bridge together
   large 802 networks using link-state protocols in place of the
   traditional spanning tree mechanisms [<a href="./rfc5556" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Problem and Applicability Statement"'>RFC5556</a>].

   Over Ethernet, TRILL uses two separate Ethertypes to distinguish
   between encapsulation headers, which carry user data, and link-state
   messages, which compute network topology using a protocol based on
   [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Intermediate system to Intermediate system intra-domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>] [<a href="./rfc6326" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Use of IS-IS"'>RFC6326</a>].  These two protocols must be distinguished from
   one another, and segregated from all other traffic.

   In a network where PPP [<a href="./rfc1661" title='"The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>RFC1661</a>] is used to interconnect routers
   (often over telecommunications links), it may be advantageous to be
   able to bridge between Ethernet segments over those PPP links, and
   thus integrate remote networks with an existing TRILL cloud.  The
   existing Bridging Control Protocol (BCP) [<a href="./rfc3518" title='"Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Bridging Control Protocol (BCP)"'>RFC3518</a>] allows direct
   bridging of Ethernet frames over PPP.  However, this mechanism is
   inefficient and inadequate for TRILL, which can be optimized for use
   over PPP links.

   To interconnect these devices over PPP links, three protocol numbers
   are needed, and are reserved as follows:

      Value (in hex)  Protocol Name
      --------------  -------------------------------------
       005d           TRILL Network Protocol (TNP)
       405d           TRILL Link State Protocol (TLSP)
       805d           TRILL Network Control Protocol (TNCP)

   The usage of these three protocols is described in detail in the
   following section.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6361">RFC 6361</a>                     TRILL over PPP                  August 2011</span>


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20PPP%20TRILL%20Negotiation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  PPP TRILL Negotiation</span>

   The TRILL Network Control Protocol (TNCP) is responsible for
   negotiating the use of the TRILL Network Protocol (TNP) and TRILL
   Link State Protocol (TLSP) on a PPP link.  TNCP uses the same option
   negotiation mechanism and state machine as described for LCP
   (<a href="./rfc1661#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC1661]</a>).

   TNCP packets MUST NOT be exchanged until PPP has reached the Network-
   Layer Protocol phase.  Any TNCP packets received when not in that
   phase MUST be silently ignored.

   The encapsulated network layer data, carried in TNP packets, and
   topology information, carried in TLSP packets, MUST NOT be sent
   unless TNCP is in the Opened state.  If a TNP or TLSP packet is
   received when TNCP is not in the Opened state and LCP is in the
   Opened state, an implementation MUST silently discard the unexpected
   TNP or TLSP packet.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20TNCP%20Packet%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  TNCP Packet Format</span>

   Exactly one TNCP packet is carried in the PPP Information field, with
   the PPP Protocol field set to hex 805d (TNCP).  A summary of the TNCP
   packet format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left
   to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3

   Code

      Only LCP Code values 1 through 7 (Configure-Request,
      Configure-Ack, Configure-Nak, Configure-Reject, Terminate-Request,
      Terminate-Ack, and Code-Reject) are used.  All other codes SHOULD
      result in a TNCP Code-Reject reply.

   Identifier and Length

      These are as documented for LCP.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6361">RFC 6361</a>                     TRILL over PPP                  August 2011</span>


   Data

      This field contains data formatted as described in <a href="./rfc1661#section-5">Section 5 of
      [RFC1661]</a>.  Codes 1-4 use Type-Length-Data sequences, Codes 5
      and 6 use uninterpreted data, and Code 7 uses a Rejected-Packet,
      all as described in [<a href="./rfc1661" title='"The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>RFC1661</a>].

   Because no Configuration Options have been defined for TNCP,
   negotiating the use of the TRILL Protocol with IS-IS for the link
   state protocol is the default when no options are specified.  A
   future document may specify the use of Configuration Options to
   enable different TRILL operating modes, such as the use of a
   different link state protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20TNP%20Packet%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  TNP Packet Format</span>

   When TNCP is in the Opened state, TNP packets are sent by setting the
   PPP Protocol field to hex 005d (TNP) and placing TRILL-encapsulated
   data representing exactly one encapsulated packet in the PPP
   Information field.

   A summary of this format is provided below:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | V | R |M|Op-Length| Hop Count | Egress (RB2) Nickname         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Ingress (RB1) Nickname        | Inner Destination MAC ...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   This is identical to the TRILL Ethernet format (<a href="./rfc6325#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of
   [RFC6325]</a>, "Ethernet Data Encapsulation"), except that the Outer MAC
   (Media Access Control) header and Ethertype are replaced by the PPP
   headers and Protocol Field, and the Ethernet Frame Check Sequence
   (FCS) is not present.  Both user data and End-Station Address
   Distribution Information (ESADI) packets are encoded in this format.

   The PPP FCS follows the encapsulated data on links where the PPP FCS
   is in use.

   Unlike the TRILL Ethernet encapsulation, PPP nodes do not have MAC
   addresses, so no outer MAC is present.  (High-Level Data Link Control
   (HDLC) addresses MAY be present in some situations; such usage is
   outside the scope of this document.)

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6361">RFC 6361</a>                     TRILL over PPP                  August 2011</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20TLSP%20Packet%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  TLSP Packet Format</span>

   When TNCP is in the Opened state, TLSP packets are sent by setting
   the PPP Protocol field to hex 405d (TLSP) and placing exactly one
   IS-IS Payload (<a href="./rfc6325#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3 of [RFC6325]</a>, "TRILL IS-IS Frames") in
   the PPP Information field.

   Note that point-to-point IS-IS links have only an arbitrary circuit
   ID, and do not use MAC addresses for identification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20TRILL%20PPP%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  TRILL PPP Behavior</span>

   1. On a PPP link, TRILL always uses point-to-point (P2P) Hellos.
      There is no need for TRILL-Hello frames, nor is per-port
      configuration necessary.  P2P Hello messages, per "Point-to-Point
      IS to IS hello PDU" (Section 9.7 of [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Intermediate system to Intermediate system intra-domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>]), do not use Neighbor
      IDs in the same manner as on Ethernet.  However, per
      <a href="./rfc6325#section-4.2.4.1">Section 4.2.4.1 of [RFC6325]</a>, the three-way IS-IS handshake using
      extended circuit IDs is required on point-to-point links, such
      as PPP.

   2. RBridges are never appointed forwarders on PPP links.  If an
      implementation includes BCP [<a href="./rfc3518" title='"Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Bridging Control Protocol (BCP)"'>RFC3518</a>], then it MUST ensure that
      only one of BCP or TNCP is negotiated on a link, and not both.  If
      the peer is an RBridge, then there is no need to pass
      unencapsulated frames, as the link can have no TRILL-ignorant peer
      to be concerned about.  If the peer is not an RBridge, then TNCP
      negotiation fails and TRILL is not used on the link.

   3. An implementation that has only PPP links might have no
      Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) that can form an IS-IS
      System ID.  Resolving that issue is outside the scope of this
      document; however, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that all TRILL
      implementations have at least one zero-configuration mechanism to
      obtain a valid System ID.  Refer to ISO/IEC 10589 [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Intermediate system to Intermediate system intra-domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>]
      regarding System ID uniqueness requirements.

   4. TRILL MTU-probe and TRILL MTU-ack messages (<a href="./rfc6325#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2 of
      [RFC6325]</a>) are not needed on a PPP link.  Implementations MUST NOT
      send MTU-probe messages and SHOULD NOT reply to these messages.
      The MTU computed by LCP SHOULD be used instead.  Negotiating an
      LCP MTU of at least 1524, to allow for an inner Ethernet payload
      of 1500 octets, is RECOMMENDED.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6361">RFC 6361</a>                     TRILL over PPP                  August 2011</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Existing PPP and IS-IS security mechanisms may play important roles
   in a network of RBridges interconnected by PPP links.  At the TRILL
   IS-IS layer, the IS-IS authentication mechanism [<a href="./rfc5304" title='"IS-IS Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC5304</a>] [<a href="./rfc5310" title='"IS-IS Generic Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC5310</a>]
   prevents fabrication of link-state control messages.

   Not all implementations need to include specific security mechanisms
   at the PPP layer, for example if they are designed to be deployed
   only in cases where the networking environment is trusted or where
   other layers provide adequate security.  A complete enumeration of
   possible deployment scenarios and associated threats and options is
   not possible and is outside the scope of this document.  For
   applications involving sensitive data, end-to-end security should
   always be considered in addition to link security to provide security
   in depth.

   However, in case a PPP layer authentication mechanism is needed to
   protect the establishment of a link and identify a link with a known
   peer, implementation of the PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication
   Protocol (CHAP) [<a href="./rfc1994" title='"PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)"'>RFC1994</a>] is RECOMMENDED.  Should greater flexibility
   than that provided by CHAP be required, the Extensible Authentication
   Protocol (EAP) [<a href="./rfc3748" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)"'>RFC3748</a>] is a good alternative.

   If TRILL-over-PPP packets also require confidentiality, the PPP
   Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) link encryption mechanisms
   [<a href="./rfc1968" title='"The PPP Encryption Control Protocol (ECP)"'>RFC1968</a>] can protect the confidentiality and integrity of all
   packets on the PPP link.

   And when PPP is run over tunneling mechanisms, such as the Layer Two
   Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>], tunnel security protocols may be
   available.

   For general TRILL protocol security considerations, see [<a href="./rfc6325" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has assigned three PPP Protocol field values, 005d, 405d, and
   805d, as described in <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> of this document.

   IANA has created a new "PPP TNCP Configuration Option Types" registry
   in the PPP-Numbers registry, using the same format as the existing
   "PPP LCP Configuration Option Types" registry.

   All TNCP Configuration Option Types except 0 are "Unassigned" and
   available for future use, based on "IETF Review", as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp26">BCP 26</a> [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  Option 0 is allocated for use with Vendor-Specific
   Options, as described in [<a href="./rfc2153" title='"PPP Vendor Extensions"'>RFC2153</a>].
