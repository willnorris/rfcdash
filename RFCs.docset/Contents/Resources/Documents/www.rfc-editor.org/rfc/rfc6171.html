The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Don't Use Copy Control

Abstract

   This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) Don't Use Copy control extension, which allows a client to
   specify that copied information should not be used in providing
   service.  This control is based upon the X.511 dontUseCopy service
   control option.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Background%20and%20Intended%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Background and Intended Usage</span>

   This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>] Don't Use Copy control extension.  The control may
   be attached to request messages to indicate that copied (replicated
   or cached) information [<a href="#ref-X.500" title='"The Directory -- Overview of concepts, models and services,"'>X.500</a>] is not be used in providing service.
   This control is based upon the X.511 [<a href="#ref-X.511" title='"The Directory: Abstract Service Definition"'>X.511</a>] dontUseCopy service
   control option.

   The Don't Use Copy control is intended to be used where the client
   requires the service be provided using original (master) information
   [<a href="#ref-X.500" title='"The Directory -- Overview of concepts, models and services,"'>X.500</a>].  In absence of this control, the server is free to make use
   of copied (i.e., non-authoritative) information in providing the
   requested service.

   For instance, a client might desire to have an authoritative answer
   to a question of whether or not a particular user is a member of a
   group.  To ask this question of a server, the client might issue a
   compare request [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>], with the Don't Use Copy control, where the
   entry parameter is the Distinguished Name (DN) of the group, the
   ava.attributeDesc is 'member', and the ava.assertionValue is the DN
   of the user in question.  If the server has access to the original
   (master) information directly or through chaining, it performs the
   operation against the original (master) information and returns
   compareTrue or compareFalse (or an error).  If the server does not
   have access to the original information, the server is obligated to
   either return a referral or an error.

   It is not intended that this control be used generally (e.g., for all
   LDAP interrogation operations) but only as required to ensure proper
   directory application behavior.  In general, directory applications
   ought to designed to use copied information well.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   DSA stands for Directory System Agent (or server).
   DSE stands for DSA-Specific Entry.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20The%20Don%27t%20Use%20Copy%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  The Don't Use Copy Control</span>

   The Don't Use Copy control is an LDAP Control [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] whose
   controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.22 and controlValue is absent.  The
   criticality MUST be TRUE.  There is no corresponding response
   control.

   The control is appropriate for LDAP interrogation operations,
   including Compare and Search operations [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].  It is
   inappropriate for all other operations, including Abandon, Bind,
   Delete, Modify, ModifyDN, StartTLS, and Unbind operations [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>].

   When the control is attached to an LDAP request, the requested
   operation MUST NOT be performed on copied information.  That is, the
   requested operation MUST be performed on original information.

   If original (master) information for the target or base object of the
   operation is not available (either locally or through chaining), the
   server MUST either return a referral directing the client to a server
   believed to be better able to service the request or return an
   appropriate result code (e.g., unwillingToPerform).

   It is noted that a referral, if returned, is not necessarily to the
   server holding the original (master) information.  It is also noted
   that an authoritative answer to the question might not be available
   to the client for any number of reasons.

   Where the client chases a referral to a server (as referenced by an
   LDAP URL) in the server response in order to obtain an authoritative
   response, the client MUST provide the dontUseCopy control with the
   interrogation request it makes to the referred to server.  While LDAP
   allows return of other kinds of URIs, the syntax and semantics of
   other kinds of URIs are left to future specifications.  The
    particulars of how to act upon other kinds of URIs are also left to
   future specifications.

   Servers implementing this technical specification SHOULD publish the
   object identifier 1.3.6.1.1.22 as a value of the 'supportedControl'
   attribute [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>] in their root DSE.  A server MAY choose to
   advertise this extension only when the client is authorized to use
   it.

   This control is intended to be provided where providing service using
   copied information might lead to unexpected application behavior.

   Use of the Don't Use Copy control may permit an attacker to perform
   or amplify a denial-of-service attack by causing additional server
   resources to be employed, such as when the server chooses to chain
   the request instead of returning a referral.  Servers capable of such
   chaining can mitigate this threat by limiting chaining to a
   particular group of authenticated entities.

   LDAP is frequently used for storage and distribution of security-
   sensitive information, including access control and security policy
   information.  Failure to use the Don't Use Copy control may thus
   permit an attacker to gain unauthorized access by allowing reliance
   on stale data.
