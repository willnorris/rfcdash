A URN Namespace for Device Identity and Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)

Abstract

   This document defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for the
   Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) and a Namespace
   Specific String (NSS) for the Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID).  The
   structure of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long and is defined in
   the 3GPP2 to uniquely identify each individual mobile equipment
   (e.g., a handset or mobile phone).  The 3GPP2 has a requirement to be
   able to use an MEID as a URN.  This document fulfills that
   requirement.

   Mobile equipment that is either a) single-mode 3GPP using only 3GPP
   technology to transmit and receive voice or data or b) dual-mode
   3GPP/3GPP2 using either 3GPP or 3GPP2 technology to transmit and
   receive voice or data has an International Mobile station Equipment
   Identity (IMEI) to identify it.  A URN namespace and an NSS for the
   IMEI are defined in [<a href="./rfc7254" title='"A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) and the International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI)"'>RFC7254</a>].  For cases where the mobile equipment
   uses IMEI as an identity for dual-mode 3GPP/3GPP2 access, the IMEI
   URN as defined in [<a href="./rfc7254" title='"A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) and the International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI)"'>RFC7254</a>] can be used to identify the mobile
   equipment.




<span class="grey">Atarius                       Informational                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8464">RFC 8464</a>                     MEID-Based URN               September 2018</span>


   However, single-mode 3GPP2 mobile equipment that supports only 3GPP2
   access technology to transmit and receive voice or data has a
   hexadecimal MEID.  Since there are fundamental differences between
   MEID and IMEI (i.e., in encoding, format, and the ownership),
   [<a href="./rfc7254" title='"A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) and the International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI)"'>RFC7254</a>] cannot be employed to represent the hexadecimal MEID.

   This document specifies a URN namespace for 3GPP2 and an NSS for the
   MEID as per the namespace registration requirement in [<a href="./rfc8141" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URNs)"'>RFC8141</a>].  The
   structure of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long and is defined by
   3GPP2 (see [<a href="#ref-S.R0048-A">S.R0048-A</a>]) to uniquely identify each individual piece of
   mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or mobile phone).  The 3GPP2 has a
   requirement to be able to use an MEID as a URN.  This document
   fulfills that requirement.  The Namespace Identifier (NID) '3gpp2' is
   for identities used in 3GPP2 networks.  The MEID is managed by the
   3GPP2, so this NID is managed by the 3GPP2.  This specification
   defines only NSSs constructed from MEIDs under the '3gpp2' NID.
   These NSSs start with "meid:" in order to identify them as such.  In
   the future, the 3GPP2 may specify other types of NSSs under the
   '3gpp2' NID.

   The MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long, includes a manufacturer code
   of 8 hexadecimal digits, and includes the serial number of 6
   hexadecimal digits plus a hexadecimal digit as a check digit.

   The manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer.
   A manufacturer can be assigned more than one manufacturer code.  The
   serial number uniquely identifies each piece of mobile equipment
   within the manufacturer code.  The check digit is used as assurance
   of integrity in error-prone operations, e.g., when used with certain
   types of readers during inventory-management operations.  The check
   digit is not transmitted.  Therefore, the first 14 of the 15
   hexadecimal digits are used for defining the MEID as a URN.

   The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing
   to use the hexadecimal MEID as a URN.  Nothing in this document
   should be construed to override [<a href="#ref-S.R0048-A">S.R0048-A</a>], which defines the MEID.

   A completed namespace registration follows.

   Namespace Identifier:  '3gpp2'

   Version:  1

   Date:  2018-06-10

   Registrant:
      Standards Organization: Third Generation Partnership Project 2
      (3GPP2)

      Arlington, Virginia 22201, United States of America

   Purpose:  The '3gpp2' namespace is used to identify mobile equipment
      that uses technologies defined by the Third Generation Partnership
      Project 2 ((3GPP2); initially, such equipment is identified by a
      URN that embeds a Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) that is 15
      hexadecimal digits long and unique to each individual piece of
      mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or mobile phone).

   Syntax:  The identifier is expressed in American Standard Code for
      Information Interchange (ASCII) characters and has a hierarchical
      expression using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) defined in
      [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>], as follows:

      pp2-urn              = "urn:" pp2-NID ":" pp2-NSS
      pp2-NID              = "3gpp2"
      pp2-NSS              = meid-specifier / future-pp2-specifier
      meid-specifier       = "meid:" meidval
      future-pp2-specifier = future-specifier *[ ":" 1*( pchar / "/" )]
      future-specifier     = 1*pp2-char
      pp2-char             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" /
                             pct-encoded

      where 'pchar' and 'pct-encoded' are defined in [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].  An NSS
      for the MEID is defined under the '3gpp2' NID.  The representation
      of the MEID is a specific number of hexadecimal digits, as

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8464">RFC 8464</a>                     MEID-Based URN               September 2018</span>


      described in [<a href="#ref-S.R0048-A">S.R0048-A</a>].  The formal definition of a URN with
      'meid' NSS contains one meidval with the formal definition
      according to the following ABNF [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>]:

      meidval           = Manufacturer-Code "-" Serial-Number
      Manufacturer-Code = 8HEX
      Serial-Number     = 6HEX
      HEX               = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

   Assignment:  The manufacturer code and serial number portions of the
      MEID are permanently stored in the mobile equipment, so they
      remain persistent as long as the mobile equipment exists.  The
      process for manufacturer code and serial number assignment is
      documented in [<a href="#ref-SC.R4002-0">SC.R4002-0</a>] and the manufacturer code and serial
      number values once assigned are not reassigned to other pieces of
      mobile equipment.

      Identifiers in the '3gpp2' namespace are defined and assigned by
      the 3GPP2 or an agency appointed by 3GPP2 after ensuring that the
      URNs to be assigned are unique.  Procedures are in place to ensure
      that each MEID is uniquely assigned by the mobile equipment
      manufacturer so that it is guaranteed to uniquely identify that
      particular piece of mobile equipment.

   Security and Privacy:  See <a href="./rfc8464#section-6">Section 6 of RFC 8464</a>.

   Interoperability:  Although both the 3GPP2 Mobile Equipment Identity
      (MEID) and the 3GPP International Mobile station Equipment
      Identity (IMEI) are used to identify mobile equipment, they are
      separate identifiers and are not to be confused.
      Internet implementations will not generally possess MEID
      identifiers.  The identifiers generated by such implementations
      will typically be URNs within namespaces other than '3gpp2', and
      may, depending on context, even be non-URN URIs.  Implementations
      are advised to be ready to process URIs other than '3gpp2'
      namespace URNs, so as to aid in interoperability.

   Resolution:  No resolution is envisioned.

   Documentation:  Documentation can be found in the following
      specifications:

         Identity (MEID)" [<a href="./rfc8464">RFC8464</a>].

   Additional Information:  Because the syntax of a 3GPP2 Mobile
      Equipment Identity (MEID) differs from that of a 3GPP
      International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI), reuse of
      the URN specified in <a href="./rfc7254">RFC 7254</a> is not possible.

   Any future change to the format of the 'meid' NSS requires the use of
   the procedure for URN NSS changes (currently through the publication
   of a future Informational RFC approved by IETF consensus).

   [<a id="ref-RFC8465">RFC8465</a>] specifies how the MEID URN can be used as an Instance ID as
   specified in [<a href="./rfc5626" title='"Managing Client-Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5626</a>].  Any change to the Instance ID will require
   an update to [<a href="./rfc8465" title='"Using the Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) URN as an Instance ID"'>RFC8465</a>].  An example of 3GPP2 MEID URN is:

   urn:3gpp2:meid:A04B0D56-02A7E3

   The MEID format is 15 hexadecimal digits encoded in 8 octets as
   defined in [<a href="#ref-S.R0048-A">S.R0048-A</a>].  The first 8 hexadecimal digits constitute
   the manufacturer code; the next 6 hexadecimal digits the serial
   number within the manufacturer code.  The last hexadecimal digit is a
   check digit.  For more details on the hexadecimal encoding, see
   <a href="#section-4.2.5">Section 4.2.5</a>.

   The manufacturer code is a value of 8 hexadecimal digits.  The
   manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer.  The
   manufacturer code is chosen from a range of values allocated to the
   mobile equipment manufacturer in order to uniquely identify the
   mobile equipment.

   This is a single hexadecimal digit (bits 1-4 of octet 8), and it is
   used as assurance of integrity in error-prone operations, e.g., when
   used with certain types of readers during inventory management
   operations.  The check digit is not transmitted by the mobile
   equipment and is not used in the MEID URN.

   The MEID format is 15 hexadecimal digits encoded in 8 octets as
   defined in [<a href="#ref-S.R0048-A">S.R0048-A</a>].  The following figure is an abstract
   representation of a hexadecimal-encoded MEID stored in memory (the
   actual storage format in memory is implementation specific).  In this
   figure, the most significant digit of the manufacturer code is
   encoded in bits 1-4 of octet 1.  Bits 5-8 of octet 8 are zero-padded,
   since bits 1-4 are only needed to encode the check digit.  The most
   significant digit of the serial number is encoded in the bits 1-4 of
   octet 5.  When MEID is included in a cellular signaling message, the
   check digit is omitted and the first 7 Octets in the following figure
   are only transmitted, [<a href="#ref-X.S0008-A">X.S0008-A</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8464">RFC 8464</a>                     MEID-Based URN               September 2018</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20and%20Privacy%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security and Privacy Considerations</span>

   An MEID is usually printed outside of the box in which a mobile
   device ships.  The MEID may also be printed under the battery on a
   mobile device; however, very few devices have removable batteries
   today.  One can retrieve the MEID via either settings or by dialing
   *#06#.  Anyone with brief physical access to the mobile device or its
   box can easily obtain the MEID.  Therefore, MEIDs MUST NOT be used as
   security capabilities (identifiers whose mere possession grants
   access).  Unfortunately, there are currently examples of some
   applications that are using the MEID for authorization.  Also, some
   service providers' customer service departments have been known to
   use knowledge of the MEID as "proof" that the caller is the
   legitimate owner of the mobile device.  Both of these are
   inappropriate uses of the MEID.

   Since the MEID is permanently assigned to the mobile equipment and is
   not modified when the ownership of the mobile equipment changes (even
   upon a complete software reload of the mobile equipment), the MEID
   URN MUST NOT be used as a user identifier or user address by an
   application.  Using the MEID to identify a user or as a user address
   could result in communications destined for a previous owner of a
   device being received by the new device owner or could allow the new
   device owner to access information or services owned by the previous
   device owner.

   Additionally, since the MEID identifies the mobile equipment, it
   potentially could be used to identify and track users for the
   purposes of surveillance and call data mining if sent in the clear.

   Since the MEID is personally identifiable information, uses of the
   MEID URN with IETF protocols require a specification and IETF expert
   review [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] in order to ensure that the privacy concerns are
   appropriately addressed.  Protocols carrying the MEID URN SHOULD, at
   a minimum, use strongly hop-by-hop encrypted channels, and it is
   RECOMMENDED that end-to-end encryption be used.
