Abstract

   This memo recommends that <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> be reclassified as an Historic
   document and provides the supporting motivation for that
   recommendation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Details"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Details</span>

   STD 50, <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> [<a href="./rfc1643" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC1643</a>], "Definitions of Managed Objects for the
   Ethernet-like Interface Types", and its SMIv2 equivalent, <a href="./rfc1650">RFC 1650</a>
   [<a href="./rfc1650" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types using SMIv2"'>RFC1650</a>], are applicable to half-duplex 10 Mb/s Ethernet interfaces
   only.  Subsequent to the 1994 publication of these documents, 100
   Mb/s, 1000 Mb/s, and 10 Gb/s Ethernet interface types have been
   developed, and full-duplex operation at 10 Mb/s has been
   standardized.  Updates to <a href="./rfc1650">RFC 1650</a> have been produced to accommodate
   these new technologies [<a href="./rfc2358" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC2358</a>] [<a href="./rfc2665" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC2665</a>] [<a href="./rfc2666" title='"Definitions of Object Identifiers for Identifying Ethernet Chip Sets"'>RFC2666</a>] [<a href="./rfc3635" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC3635</a>].
   These updates define new MIB objects to supplement those defined in
   <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> and <a href="./rfc1650">RFC 1650</a> and in addition deprecate some of the objects
   in <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> and <a href="./rfc1650">RFC 1650</a> that are no longer considered useful.  They
   also levy a requirement for implementations of the EtherLike-MIB to
   support the MAU-MIB [<a href="./rfc2239" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) using SMIv2"'>RFC2239</a>] [<a href="./rfc2668" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs)"'>RFC2668</a>] [<a href="./rfc3636" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs)"'>RFC3636</a>] as well.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3638">RFC 3638</a>              <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> to Historic Status         September 2003</span>


   <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> is an obsolete specification, overtaken by events.  Its
   SMIv2 equivalent, <a href="./rfc1650">RFC 1650</a>, was officially retired in 1998.  New
   implementations -- even those that support only half-duplex 10 Mb/s
   interfaces -- should comply with in the latest version of the
   specification, currently <a href="./rfc3635">RFC 3635</a> [<a href="./rfc3635" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC3635</a>] and <a href="./rfc2666">RFC 2666</a> [<a href="./rfc2666" title='"Definitions of Object Identifiers for Identifying Ethernet Chip Sets"'>RFC2666</a>],
   instead of <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a>.  It is therefore recommended that <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> be
   reclassified as an Historic document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Effect%20on%20Other%20Standards%20Track%20Documents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Effect on Other Standards Track Documents</span>

   Reclassification of <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> will have no impact on the status of any
   standards track RFC because no standards track RFC cites it as a
   normative reference.  An RFC content search made with the tools
   available at <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org">http://www.rfc-editor.org</a> reveals the following
   standards track documents that cite <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a>:

      Document               Title
      --------               -----

      <a href="./rfc2020">RFC 2020</a>         IEEE 802.12 Interface MIB

      <a href="./rfc2358">RFC 2358</a>         Definitions of Managed Objects for the
                       Ethernet-like Interface Types

      <a href="./rfc2665">RFC 2665</a>         Definitions of Managed Objects for the
                       Ethernet-like Interface Types

      <a href="./rfc2720">RFC 2720</a>         Traffic Flow Measurement: Meter MIB

      <a href="./rfc3635">RFC 3635</a>         Definitions of Managed Objects for the
                       Ethernet-like Interface Types

   <a href="./rfc2020">RFC 2020</a> [<a href="./rfc2020" title='"IEEE 802.12 Interface MIB"'>RFC2020</a>] contains DOT12-IF-MIB, which is the MIB module for
   managing IEEE 802.12 100VG-AnyLAN interfaces.  It refers to <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a>
   in the context of an admonition not to implement the EtherLike-MIB
   for any interface where the DOT12-IF-MIB is implemented.

   <a href="./rfc2358">RFC 2358</a> [<a href="./rfc2358" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC2358</a>], <a href="./rfc2665">RFC 2665</a> [<a href="./rfc2665" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC2665</a>], and <a href="./rfc3635">RFC 3635</a> [<a href="./rfc3635" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC3635</a>] all
   contain updated versions of the EtherLike-MIB.  They refer to <a href="./rfc1643">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc1643">1643</a> in the context of explaining the history of the EtherLike-MIB,
   and the citation in <a href="./rfc3635">RFC 3635</a> is explicitly listed as a non-normative
   reference.

   <a href="./rfc2720">RFC 2720</a> [<a href="./rfc2720" title='"Traffic Flow Measurement: Meter MIB"'>RFC2720</a>] contains the FLOW-METER-MIB.  It refers to <a href="./rfc1643">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc1643">1643</a> only in an ASN.1 comment in the MIB module.  Omission of that
   comment would not preclude correct implementation of the MIB module.

   Clearly, none of these citations are normative.
