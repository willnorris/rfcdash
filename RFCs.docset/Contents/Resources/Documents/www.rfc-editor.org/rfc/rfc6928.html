                    <span class="h1">Increasing TCP's Initial Window</span>

Abstract

   This document proposes an experiment to increase the permitted TCP
   initial window (IW) from between 2 and 4 segments, as specified in
   <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a>, to 10 segments with a fallback to the existing
   recommendation when performance issues are detected.  It discusses
   the motivation behind the increase, the advantages and disadvantages
   of the higher initial window, and presents results from several
   large-scale experiments showing that the higher initial window
   improves the overall performance of many web services without
   resulting in a congestion collapse.  The document closes with a
   discussion of usage and deployment for further experimental purposes
   recommended by the IETF TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (TCPM)
   working group.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document proposes to raise the upper bound on TCP's initial
   window (IW) to 10 segments (maximum 14600 B).  It is patterned after
   and borrows heavily from <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> [<a href="./rfc3390" title="&quot;Increasing TCP's Initial Window&quot;">RFC3390</a>] and earlier work in this
   area.  Due to lingering concerns about possible side effects to other
   flows sharing the same network bottleneck, some of the
   recommendations are conditional on additional monitoring and
   evaluation.

   The primary argument in favor of raising IW follows from the evolving
   scale of the Internet.  Ten segments are likely to fit into queue
   space available at any broadband access link, even when there are a
   reasonable number of concurrent connections.

   Lower speed links can be treated with environment-specific
   configurations, such that they can be protected from being
   overwhelmed by large initial window bursts without imposing a
   suboptimal initial window on the rest of the Internet.

   This document reviews the advantages and disadvantages of using a
   larger initial window and includes summaries of several large-scale
   experiments showing that an initial window of 10 segments (IW10)
   provides benefits across the board for a variety of bandwidth (BW),
   round-trip time (RTT), and bandwidth-delay product (BDP) classes.
   These results show significant benefits for increasing IW for users
   at much smaller data rates than had been previously anticipated.
   However, at initial windows larger than 10, the results are mixed.
   We believe that these mixed results are not intrinsic but are the
   consequence of various implementation artifacts, including overly
   aggressive applications employing many simultaneous connections.

   We recommend that all TCP implementations have a settable TCP IW
   parameter, as long as there is a reasonable effort to monitor for
   possible interactions with other Internet applications and services
   as described in <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>.  Furthermore, <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> details why 10
   segments may be an appropriate value, and while that value may
   continue to rise in the future, this document does not include any
   supporting evidence for values of IW larger than 10.

   In addition, we introduce a minor revision to <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> and <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a>
   [<a href="./rfc5681" title='"TCP Congestion Control"'>RFC5681</a>] to eliminate resetting the initial window when the SYN or
   SYN/ACK is lost.

   The document closes with a discussion of the consensus from the TCPM
   working group on the near-term usage and deployment of IW10 in the
   Internet.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20TCP%20Modification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  TCP Modification</span>

   This document proposes an increase in the permitted upper bound for
   TCP's initial window (IW) to 10 segments, depending on the maximum
   segment size (MSS).  This increase is optional: a TCP MAY start with
   an initial window that is smaller than 10 segments.

   More precisely, the upper bound for the initial window will be

         min (10*MSS, max (2*MSS, 14600))                            (1)

   This upper bound for the initial window size represents a change from
   <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> [<a href="./rfc3390" title="&quot;Increasing TCP's Initial Window&quot;">RFC3390</a>], which specified that the congestion window be
   initialized between 2 and 4 segments, depending on the MSS.

   This change applies to the initial window of the connection in the
   first round-trip time (RTT) of data transmission during or following
   the TCP three-way handshake.  Neither the SYN/ACK nor its ACK in the
   three-way handshake should increase the initial window size.

   Note that all the test results described in this document were based
   on the regular Ethernet MTU of 1500 bytes.  Future study of the
   effect of a different MTU may be needed to fully validate (1) above.

   Furthermore, <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> states (and <a href="./rfc5681">RFC 5681</a> [<a href="./rfc5681" title='"TCP Congestion Control"'>RFC5681</a>] has similar
   text):

      If the SYN or SYN/ACK is lost, the initial window used by a sender
      after a correctly transmitted SYN MUST be one segment consisting
      of MSS bytes.

   The proposed change to reduce the default retransmission timeout
   (RTO) to 1 second [<a href="./rfc6298" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>] increases the chance for spurious SYN or
   SYN/ACK retransmission, thus unnecessarily penalizing connections
   with RTT &gt; 1 second if their initial window is reduced to 1 segment.
   For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations refrain from
   resetting the initial window to 1 segment, unless there have been
   more than one SYN or SYN/ACK retransmissions or true loss detection
   has been made.

   TCP implementations use slow start in as many as three different
   ways: (1) to start a new connection (the initial window); (2) to
   restart transmission after a long idle period (the restart window);
   and (3) to restart transmission after a retransmit timeout (the loss
   window).  The change specified in this document affects the value of
   the initial window.  Optionally, a TCP MAY set the restart window to
   the minimum of the value used for the initial window and the current
   value of cwnd (in other words, using a larger value for the restart
   window should never increase the size of cwnd).  These changes do NOT
   change the loss window, which must remain 1 segment of MSS bytes (to
   permit the lowest possible window size in the case of severe
   congestion).

   Furthermore, to limit any negative effect that a larger initial
   window may have on links with limited bandwidth or buffer space,
   implementations SHOULD fall back to <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> for the restart window
   (RW) if any packet loss is detected during either the initial window
   or a restart window, and more than 4 KB of data is sent.
   Implementations must also follow <a href="./rfc6298">RFC 6298</a> [<a href="./rfc6298" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>] in order to avoid
   spurious RTO as described in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Implementation%20Issues"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Implementation Issues</span>

   The HTTP 1.1 specification allows only two simultaneous connections
   per domain, while web browsers open more simultaneous TCP connections
   [<a href="#ref-Ste08" title='"Roundup on Parallel Connections"'>Ste08</a>], partly to circumvent the small initial window in order to
   speed up the loading of web pages as described above.

   When web browsers open simultaneous TCP connections to the same
   destination, they are working against TCP's congestion control
   mechanisms [<a href="#ref-FF99" title='"Promoting the Use of End-to-End Congestion Control in the Internet"'>FF99</a>].  Combining this behavior with larger initial
   windows further increases the burstiness and unfairness to other
   traffic in the network.  If a larger initial window causes harm to
   any other flows, then local application tuning will reveal that
   having fewer concurrent connections yields better performance for
   some users.  Any content provider deploying IW10 in conjunction with
   content distributed across multiple domains is explicitly encouraged
   to perform measurement experiments to detect such problems, and to
   consider reducing the number of concurrent connections used to
   retrieve their content.

   Some implementations advertise a small initial receive window (Table
   2 in [<a href="#ref-Duk10" title="&quot;An Argument for Increasing TCP's Initial Congestion Window&quot;">Duk10</a>]), effectively limiting how much window a remote host may
   use.  In order to realize the full benefit of the large initial
   window, implementations are encouraged to advertise an initial
   receive window of at least 10 segments, except for the circumstances
   where a larger initial window is deemed harmful. (See <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>
   below.)

   The TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) option [<a href="./rfc2018" title='"TCP Selective Acknowledgment Options"'>RFC2018</a>] was thought
   to be required in order for the larger initial window to perform
   well. But measurements from both a testbed and live tests showed that
   IW=10 without the SACK option outperforms IW=3 with the SACK option
   [<a href="#ref-CW10" title="long-lived">CW10</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Background</span>

   The TCP congestion window was introduced as part of the congestion
   control algorithm by Van Jacobson in 1988 [<a href="#ref-Jac88" title='"Congestion Avoidance and Control"'>Jac88</a>].  The initial value
   of one segment was used as the starting point for newly established
   connections to probe the available bandwidth on the network.

   Today's Internet is dominated by web traffic running on top of short-
   lived TCP connections [<a href="#ref-IOR2009" title='"Atlas Internet Observatory 2009 Annual Report"'>IOR2009</a>].  The relatively small initial window
   has become a limiting factor for the performance of many web
   applications.

   The global Internet has continued to grow, both in speed and
   penetration.  According to the latest report from Akamai [<a href="#ref-AKAM10" title='"The State of the Internet, 3rd Quarter 2009"'>AKAM10</a>],
   the global broadband (&gt; 2 Mbps) adoption has surpassed 50%,
   propelling the average connection speed to reach 1.7 Mbps, while the
   narrowband (&lt; 256 Kbps) usage has dropped to 5%.  In contrast, TCP's
   initial window has remained 4 KB for a decade [<a href="./rfc2414" title="&quot;Increasing TCP's Initial Window&quot;">RFC2414</a>],
   corresponding to a bandwidth utilization of less than 200 Kbps per
   connection, assuming an RTT of 200 ms.

   A large proportion of flows on the Internet are short web
   transactions over TCP and complete before exiting TCP slow start.
   Speeding up the TCP flow startup phase, including circumventing the
   initial window limit, has been an area of active research (see
   [<a href="#ref-Sch08" title='"Quick-Start, Jump-Start, and Other Fast Startup Approaches"'>Sch08</a>] and <a href="./rfc6077#section-3.4">Section 3.4 of [RFC6077]</a>).  Numerous proposals exist
   [<a href="#ref-LAJW07" title='"Congestion Control Without a Startup Phase"'>LAJW07</a>] [<a href="./rfc4782" title='"Quick- Start for TCP and IP"'>RFC4782</a>] [<a href="#ref-PRAKS02" title='"A Swifter Start for TCP"'>PRAKS02</a>] [<a href="#ref-PK98" title='"TCP Fast Start: A technique for speeding up web transfers"'>PK98</a>].  Some require router support
   [<a href="./rfc4782" title='"Quick- Start for TCP and IP"'>RFC4782</a>] [<a href="#ref-PK98" title='"TCP Fast Start: A technique for speeding up web transfers"'>PK98</a>], hence are not practical for the public Internet.
   Others suggested bold, but often radical ideas, likely requiring more
   years of research before standardization and deployment.

   In the mean time, applications have responded to TCP's "slow" start.
   Web sites use multiple subdomains [<a href="#ref-Bel10" title='"A Client-Side Argument For Changing TCP Slow Start"'>Bel10</a>] to circumvent HTTP 1.1
   regulation on two connections per physical host [<a href="./rfc2616" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>].  As of
   today, major web browsers open multiple connections to the same site
   (up to six connections per domain [<a href="#ref-Ste08" title='"Roundup on Parallel Connections"'>Ste08</a>] and the number is growing).
   This trend is to remedy HTTP serialized download to achieve
   parallelism and higher performance.  But it also implies that today
   most access links are severely under-utilized, hence having multiple
   TCP connections improves performance most of the time.  While raising
   the initial congestion window may cause congestion for certain users
   of these browsers, we argue that the browsers and other application



<span class="grey">Chu, et al.                   Experimental                      [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6928">RFC 6928</a>             Increasing TCP's Initial Window          April 2013</span>


   need to respect HTTP 1.1 regulation and stop increasing the number of
   simultaneous TCP connections.  We believe a modest increase of the
   initial window will help to stop this trend and provide the best
   interim solution to improve overall user performance and reduce the
   server, client, and network load.

   Note that persistent connections and pipelining are designed to
   address some of the above issues with HTTP [<a href="./rfc2616" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>].  Their presence
   does not diminish the need for a larger initial window, e.g., data
   from the Chrome browser shows that 35% of HTTP requests are made on
   new TCP connections.  Our test data also shows significant latency
   reduction with the large initial window even in conjunction with
   these two HTTP features [<a href="#ref-Duk10" title="&quot;An Argument for Increasing TCP's Initial Congestion Window&quot;">Duk10</a>].

   Also note that packet pacing has been suggested as a possible
   mechanism to avoid large bursts and their associated harm [<a href="#ref-VH97" title='"Improving Restart of Idle TCP Connections"'>VH97</a>].
   Pacing is not required in this proposal due to a strong preference
   for a simple solution.  We suspect for packet bursts of a moderate
   size, packet pacing will not be necessary.  This seems to be
   confirmed by our test results.

   More discussion of the increase in initial window, including the
   choice of 10 segments, can be found in [<a href="#ref-Duk10" title="&quot;An Argument for Increasing TCP's Initial Congestion Window&quot;">Duk10</a>] and [<a href="#ref-CD10" title="&quot;Increasing TCP's Initial Window&quot;">CD10</a>].

   An increase of the initial window from 3 segments to 10 segments
   reduces the total transfer time for data sets greater than 4 KB by up
   to 4 round trips.

   The table below compares the number of round trips between IW=3 and
   IW=10 for different transfer sizes, assuming infinite bandwidth, no
   packet loss, and the standard delayed ACKs with large delayed-ACK
   timer.

   For example, with the larger initial window, a transfer of 32
   segments of data will require only 2 rather than 5 round trips to
   complete.

   <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> stated that the main motivation for increasing the initial
   window to 4 KB was to speed up connections that only transmit a small
   amount of data, e.g., email and web.  The majority of transfers back
   then were less than 4 KB and could be completed in a single RTT
   [<a href="#ref-All00" title="&quot;A Web Server's View of the Transport Layer&quot;">All00</a>].

   Since <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> was published, web objects have gotten significantly
   larger [<a href="#ref-Chu09" title='"Tuning TCP Parameters for the 21st Century"'>Chu09</a>] [<a href="#ref-RJ10" title='"Aggregate Statistics of Size Related Metrics of Web Pages metrics"'>RJ10</a>].  Today only a small percentage of web objects
   (e.g., 10% of Google's search responses) can fit in the 4 KB initial
   window.  The average HTTP response size of gmail.com, a highly
   scripted web site, is 8 KB (Figure 1 in [<a href="#ref-Duk10" title="&quot;An Argument for Increasing TCP's Initial Congestion Window&quot;">Duk10</a>]).  The average web
   page, including all static and dynamic scripted web objects on the
   page, has seen even greater growth in size [<a href="#ref-RJ10" title='"Aggregate Statistics of Size Related Metrics of Web Pages metrics"'>RJ10</a>].  HTTP pipelining
   [<a href="./rfc2616" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>] and new web transport protocols such as SPDY [<a href="#ref-SPDY" title='"SPDY: An experimental protocol for a faster web"'>SPDY</a>] allow
   multiple web objects to be sent in a single transaction, potentially
   benefiting from an even larger initial window in order to transfer an
   entire web page in a small number of round trips.

   A greater-than-3-segment initial window increases the chance to
   recover packet loss through Fast Retransmit rather than the lengthy
   initial RTO [<a href="./rfc5681" title='"TCP Congestion Control"'>RFC5681</a>].  This is because the fast retransmit algorithm
   requires three duplicate ACKs as an indication that a segment has

   been lost rather than reordered.  While newer loss recovery
   techniques such as Limited Transmit [<a href="./rfc3042" title="&quot;Enhancing TCP's Loss Recovery Using Limited Transmit&quot;">RFC3042</a>] and Early Retransmit
   [<a href="./rfc5827" title='"Early Retransmit for TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)"'>RFC5827</a>] have been proposed to help speeding up loss recovery from a
   smaller window, both algorithms can still benefit from the larger
   initial window because of a better chance to receive more ACKs.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Connection"></a>    Connection</span>

   The larger bursts from an increase in the initial window may cause
   buffer overrun and packet drop in routers with small buffers, or
   routers experiencing congestion.  This could result in unnecessary
   retransmit timeouts.  For a large-window connection that is able to
   recover without a retransmit timeout, this could result in an
   unnecessarily early transition from the slow-start to the congestion-
   avoidance phase of the window increase algorithm.

   Premature segment drops are unlikely to occur in uncongested networks
   with sufficient buffering, or in moderately congested networks where
   the congested router uses active queue management (such as Random
   Early Detection [<a href="#ref-FJ93" title='"Random Early Detection gateways for Congestion Avoidance"'>FJ93</a>] [<a href="./rfc2309" title='"Recommendations on Queue Management and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet"'>RFC2309</a>] [<a href="./rfc3150" title='"End-to-end Performance Implications of Slow Links"'>RFC3150</a>]).

   Insufficient buffering is more likely to exist in the access routers
   connecting slower links.  A recent study of access router buffer size
   [<a href="#ref-DGHS07" title='"Characterizing Residential Broadband Networks"'>DGHS07</a>] reveals the majority of access routers provision enough
   buffer for 130 ms or longer, sufficient to cover a burst of more than
   10 packets at 1 Mbps speed, but possibly not sufficient for browsers
   opening simultaneous connections.

   A testbed study [<a href="#ref-CW10" title="long-lived">CW10</a>] on the effect of the larger initial window
   with five simultaneously opened connections revealed that, even with
   limited buffer size on slow links, IW=10 still reduced the total
   latency of web transactions, although at the cost of higher packet
   drop rates as compared to IW=3.

   Some TCP connections will receive better performance with the larger
   initial window, even if the burstiness of the initial window results
   in premature segment drops.  This will be true if (1) the TCP
   connection recovers from the segment drop without a retransmit
   timeout, and (2) the TCP connection is ultimately limited to a small
   congestion window by either network congestion or by the receiver's
   advertised window.

   An increase in the initial window may increase congestion in a
   network.  However, since the increase is one time only (at the
   beginning of a connection), and the rest of TCP's congestion backoff
   mechanism remains in place, it's unlikely the increase by itself will
   render a network in a persistent state of congestion, or even
   congestion collapse.  This seems to have been confirmed by the large-
   scale web experiments described later.

   It should be noted that the above may not hold if applications open a
   large number of simultaneous connections.

   Until this proposal is widely deployed, a fairness issue may exist
   between flows adopting a larger initial window vs. flows that are
   compliant with <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a>.  Although no severe unfairness has been
   detected on all the known tests so far, further study on this topic
   may be warranted.

   Some of the discussions from <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> are still valid for IW=10.

   Moreover, it is worth noting that although TCP NewReno increases the
   chance of duplicate segments when trying to recover multiple packet
   losses from a large window, the wide support of the TCP Selective
   Acknowledgment (SACK) option [<a href="./rfc2018" title='"TCP Selective Acknowledgment Options"'>RFC2018</a>] in all major OSes today should
   keep the volume of duplicate segments in check.

   Recent measurements [<a href="#ref-Get11" title='"Bufferbloat: Dark buffers in the Internet"'>Get11</a>] provide evidence of extremely large
   queues (in the order of one second or more) at access networks of the
   Internet.  While a significant part of the buffer bloat is
   contributed by large downloads/uploads such as video files, emails
   with large attachments, backups and download of movies to disk, some
   of the problem is also caused by web browsing of image-heavy sites
   [<a href="#ref-Get11" title='"Bufferbloat: Dark buffers in the Internet"'>Get11</a>].  This queuing delay is generally considered harmful for
   responsiveness of latency-sensitive traffic such as DNS queries,
   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), DHCP, Voice over IP (VoIP), and
   gaming.  IW=10 can exacerbate this problem when doing short
   downloads, such as web browsing [<a href="#ref-Get11-1" title='"IW10 Considered Harmful"'>Get11-1</a>].  The mitigations proposed
   for the broader problem of buffer bloating are also applicable in
   this case, such as the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN),
   Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes [<a href="#ref-CoDel" title='"Controlling Queue Delay"'>CoDel</a>], and traffic
   classification (QoS).

   Much of the negative impact from an increase in the initial window is
   likely to be felt by users behind slow links with limited buffers.
   The negative impact can be mitigated by hosts directly connected to a
   low-speed link advertising an initial receive window smaller than 10
   segments.  This can be achieved either through manual configuration
   by the users or through the host stack auto-detecting the low-
   bandwidth links.

   Additional suggestions to improve the end-to-end performance of slow
   links can be found in <a href="./rfc3150">RFC 3150</a> [<a href="./rfc3150" title='"End-to-end Performance Implications of Slow Links"'>RFC3150</a>].

   A large initial window increases the chance of spurious RTO on a low-
   bandwidth path, because the packet transmission time will dominate
   the round-trip time.  To minimize spurious retransmissions,
   implementations MUST follow <a href="./rfc6298">RFC 6298</a> [<a href="./rfc6298" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>] to restart the
   retransmission timer with the current value of RTO for each ACK
   received that acknowledges new data.

   In this section, we summarize our findings from large-scale Internet
   experiments with an initial window of 10 segments conducted via
   Google's front-end infrastructure serving a diverse set of
   applications.  We present results from two data centers, each chosen
   because of the specific characteristics of subnets served: AvgDC has
   connection bandwidths closer to the worldwide average reported in
   [<a href="#ref-AKAM10" title='"The State of the Internet, 3rd Quarter 2009"'>AKAM10</a>], with a median connection speed of about 1.7 Mbps; SlowDC
   has a larger proportion of traffic from slow-bandwidth subnets with
   nearly 20% of traffic from connections below 100 Kbps; and a third
   was below 256 Kbps.

   Guided by measurements data, we answer two key questions: what is the
   latency benefit when TCP connections start with a higher initial
   window, and on the flip side, what is the cost?

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.1.%20%20The%20Benefits"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.1" id="section-10.1">10.1</a>.  The Benefits</span>

   The average web search latency improvement over all responses in
   AvgDC is 11.7% (68 ms) and 8.7% (72 ms) in SlowDC.  We further
   analyzed the data based on traffic characteristics and subnet
   properties such as bandwidth (BW), round-trip time (RTT), and
   bandwidth-delay product (BDP).  The average response latency improved



<span class="grey">Chu, et al.                   Experimental                     [Page 11]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-12"></span>

   across the board for a variety of subnets with the largest benefits
   of over 20% from high RTT and high BDP networks, wherein most
   responses can fit within the pipe.  Correspondingly, responses from
   low RTT paths experienced the smallest improvements -- about 5%.

   Contrary to what we expected, responses from low-bandwidth subnets
   experienced the best latency improvements (between 10-20%) in the
   0-56 Kbps and 56-256 Kbps buckets.  We speculate low-BW networks
   observe improved latency for two plausible reasons: 1) fewer slow-
   start rounds: unlike many large-BW networks, low-BW subnets with
   dial-up modems have inherently large RTTs; and 2) faster loss
   recovery: an initial window larger than 3 segments increases the
   chances of a lost packet to be recovered through Fast Retransmit as
   opposed to a lengthy RTO.

   Responses of different sizes benefited to varying degrees; those
   larger than 3 segments naturally demonstrated larger improvements,
   because they finished in fewer rounds in slow start as compared to
   the baseline.  In our experiments, response sizes less than or equal
   to 3 segments also demonstrated small latency benefits.

   To find out how individual subnets performed, we analyzed average
   latency at a /24 subnet level (an approximation to a user base that
   is offered similar set of services by a common ISP).  We find that,
   even at the subnet granularity, latency improved at all quantiles
   ranging from 5-11%.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.2.%20%20The%20Cost"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.2" id="section-10.2">10.2</a>.  The Cost</span>

   To quantify the cost of raising the initial window, we analyzed the
   data specifically for subnets with low bandwidth and BDP,
   retransmission rates for different kinds of applications, as well as
   latency for applications operating with multiple concurrent TCP
   connections.  From our measurements, we found no evidence of negative
   latency impacts that correlate to BW or BDP alone, but in fact both
   kinds of subnets demonstrated latency improvements across averages
   and quantiles.

   As expected, the retransmission rate increased modestly when
   operating with larger initial congestion window.  The overall
   increase in AvgDC is 0.3% (from 1.98% to 2.29%) and in SlowDC is 0.7%
   (from 3.54% to 4.21%).  In our investigation, with the exception of
   one application, the larger window resulted in a retransmission
   increase of less than 0.5% for services in the AvgDC.  The exception
   is the Maps application that operates with multiple concurrent TCP
   connections, which increased its retransmission rate by 0.9% in AvgDC
   and 1.85% in SlowDC (from 3.94% to 5.79%).




<span class="grey">Chu, et al.                   Experimental                     [Page 12]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6928">RFC 6928</a>             Increasing TCP's Initial Window          April 2013</span>


   In our experiments, the percentage of traffic experiencing
   retransmissions did not increase significantly, e.g., 90% of web
   search and maps experienced zero retransmission in SlowDC
   (percentages are higher for AvgDC); a break up of retransmissions by
   percentiles indicate that most increases come from the portion of
   traffic already experiencing retransmissions in the baseline with
   initial window of 3 segments.

   One of the worst-case scenarios where latency can be adversely
   impacted due to bottleneck buffer overflow is represented by traffic
   patterns from applications using multiple concurrent TCP connections,
   all operating with a large initial window.  Our investigation shows
   that such a traffic pattern has not been a problem in AvgDC where all
   these applications, specifically maps and image thumbnails,
   demonstrated improved latencies varying from 2-20%.  In the case of
   SlowDC, while these applications continued showing a latency
   improvement in the mean, their latencies in higher quantiles (96 and
   above for maps) indicated instances where latency with larger window
   is worse than the baseline, e.g., the 99% latency for maps has
   increased by 2.3% (80 ms) when compared to the baseline.  There is no
   evidence from our measurements that such a cost on latency is a
   result of subnet bandwidth alone.  Although we have no way of knowing
   from our data, we conjecture that the amount of buffering at
   bottleneck links plays a key role in the performance of these
   applications.

   Besides the large-scale Internet experiments described above, a

   various environments.  These tests were summarized below, with more

   Further experiments are required before a larger initial window shall
   be enabled by default in the Internet.  The existing measurement
   results indicate that this does not cause significant harm to other
   traffic.  However, widespread use in the Internet could reveal issues
   not known yet, e.g., regarding fairness or impact on latency-
   sensitive traffic such as VoIP.

   Therefore, special care is needed when using this experimental TCP
   extension, in particular on large-scale systems originating a
   significant amount of Internet traffic or on large numbers of
   individual consumer-level systems that have similar aggregate impact.
   Anyone (stack vendors, network administrators, etc.) turning on a
   larger initial window SHOULD ensure that the performance is monitored
   before and after that change.  Key metrics to monitor are the rate of
   packet losses, ECN marking, and segment retransmissions during the
   initial burst.  The sender SHOULD cache such information about
   connection setups using an initial window larger than allowed by <a href="./rfc3390">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3390">3390</a>, and new connections SHOULD fall back to the initial window
   allowed by <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> if there is evidence of performance issues.
   Further experiments are needed on the design of such a cache and
   corresponding heuristics.

   Other relevant metrics that may indicate a need to reduce the IW
   include an increased overall percentage of packet loss or segment
   retransmissions as well as application-level metrics such as reduced
   data transfer completion times or impaired media quality.

   It is important also to take into account hosts that do not implement
   a larger initial window.  Furthermore, any deployment of IW10 should
   be aware that there are potential side effects to real-time traffic



<span class="grey">Chu, et al.                   Experimental                     [Page 14]</span></pre>

   (such as VoIP).  If users observe any significant deterioration of
   performance, they SHOULD fall back to an initial window as allowed by
   <a href="./rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> for safety reasons.  An increased initial window MUST NOT be
   turned on by default on systems without such monitoring capabilities.

   The IETF TCPM working group is very much interested in further
   reports from experiments with this specification and encourages the
   publication of such measurement data.  By now, there are no adequate
   studies available that either prove or do not prove the impact of
   IW10 to real-time traffic.  Further experimentation in this direction
   is encouraged.

   If no significant harm is reported, a follow-up document may revisit
   the question on whether a larger initial window can be safely used by
   default in all Internet hosts.  Resolution of these experiments and
   tighter specifications of the suggestions here might be grounds for a
   future Standards Track document on the same topic.

   It is recognized that if IW10 is causing harm to other traffic, that
   this may not be readily apparent to the software on the hosts using
   IW10.  In some cases, a local system or network administrator may be
   able to detect this and to selectively disable IW10.  In the general
   case, however, since the harm may occur on a remote network to other
   cross-traffic, there may be no good way at all for this to be
   detected or corrected.  Current experience and analysis does not
   indicate whether this is a real issue, beyond a hypothetical one.  As
   use of IW10 becomes more prevalent, monitoring and analysis of flows
   throughout the network will be needed to assess the impact across the
   spectrum of scenarios found on the real Internet.

   Two other proposals [<a href="#ref-All10" title='"Initial Congestion Window Specification"'>All10</a>] [<a href="#ref-Tou12" title='"Automating the Initial Window in TCP"'>Tou12</a>] have been published to raise
   TCP's initial window size over a large timescale.  Both aim at
   reducing the uncertain impact of a larger initial window at an
   Internet-wide scale.  Moreover, [<a href="#ref-Tou12" title='"Automating the Initial Window in TCP"'>Tou12</a>] seeks an algorithm to
   automate the adjustment of IW safely over a long period.

   Although a modest, static increase of IW to 10 may address the near-
   term need for better web performance, much work is needed from the
   TCP research community to find a long-term solution to the TCP flow
   startup problem.

   This document discusses the initial congestion window permitted for
   TCP connections.  Although changing this value may cause more packet
   loss, it is highly unlikely to lead to a persistent state of network
   congestion or even a congestion collapse.  Hence, it does not raise
   any known new security issues with TCP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/15.%20%20Conclusion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-15" id="section-15">15</a>.  Conclusion</span>

   This document suggests a simple change to TCP that will reduce the
   application latency over short-lived TCP connections or links with
   long RTTs (saving several RTTs during the initial slow-start phase)
   with little or no negative impact over other flows.  Extensive tests
   have been conducted through both testbeds and large data centers with
   most results showing improved latency with only a small increase in
   the packet retransmission rate.  Based on these results, we believe a
   modest increase of IW to 10 is the best solution for the near-term
   deployment, while scaling IW over the long run remains a challenge
   for the TCP research community.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20List%20of%20Concerns%20and%20Corresponding%20Test%20Results"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  List of Concerns and Corresponding Test Results</span>

   Concerns have been raised since the initial draft of this document
   was posted, based on a set of large-scale experiments.  To better
   understand the impact of a larger initial window and in order to
   confirm or dismiss these concerns, additional tests have been
   conducted using either large-scale clusters, simulations, or real
   testbeds.  The following attempts to compile the list of concerns and
   summarize findings from relevant tests.

   o  How complete are various tests in covering many different traffic
      patterns?

      The large-scale Internet experiments conducted at Google's front-
      end infrastructure covered a large portfolio of services beyond
      web search.  It included Gmail, Google Maps, Photos, News, Sites,
      Images, etc., and covered a wide variety of traffic sizes and
      patterns.  One notable exception is YouTube, because we don't
      think the large initial window will have much material impact,
      either positive or negative, on bulk data services.

      [<a id="ref-CW10">CW10</a>] contains some results from a testbed study on how short
      flows with a larger initial window might affect the throughput
      performance of other coexisting, long-lived, bulk data transfers.

   o  Larger bursts from the increase in the initial window cause
      significantly more packet drops.

      All the tests conducted on this subject ([<a href="#ref-Duk10" title="&quot;An Argument for Increasing TCP's Initial Congestion Window&quot;">Duk10</a>] [<a href="#ref-Sch11" title='"Performance and Fairness Evaluation of IW10 and Other Fast Startup Schemes"'>Sch11</a>] [<a href="#ref-Sch11-1" title='"Comparison of end-to-end and network- supported fast startup congestion control schemes"'>Sch11-1</a>]
      [<a href="#ref-CW10" title="long-lived">CW10</a>]) so far have shown only a modest increase of packet drops.
      The only exception is from the testbed study [<a href="#ref-CW10" title="long-lived">CW10</a>] under
      extremely high load and/or simultaneous opens.  But under those
      conditions, both IW=3 and IW=10 suffered very high packet loss
      rates.

   o  A large initial window may severely impact TCP performance over
      highly multiplexed links still common in developing regions.

      Our large-scale experiments described in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> above also
      covered Africa and South America.  Measurement data from those
      regions [<a href="#ref-DCCM10" title='"Increasing TCP initial window"'>DCCM10</a>] revealed improved latency, even for those
      services that employ multiple simultaneous connections, at the
      cost of a small increase in the retransmission rate.  It seems
      that the round-trip savings from a larger initial window more than
      make up the time spent on recovering more lost packets.

      Similar phenomena have also been observed from the testbed study
      [<a href="#ref-CW10" title="long-lived">CW10</a>].

   o  Why 10 segments?

      Questions have been raised on how the number 10 was picked.  We
      have tried different sizes in our large-scale experiments, and
      found that 10 segments seem to give most of the benefits for the
      services we tested while not causing significant increase in the
      retransmission rates.  Going forward, 10 segments may turn out to
      be too small when the average of web object sizes continues to
      grow.  But a scheme to "right size" the initial window
      automatically over long timescales has yet to be developed.

   o  More thorough analysis of the impact on slow links is needed.

      Although [<a href="#ref-Duk10" title="&quot;An Argument for Increasing TCP's Initial Congestion Window&quot;">Duk10</a>] showed the large initial window reduced the
      average latency even for the dialup link class of only 56 Kbps in
      bandwidth, more studies were needed in order to understand the
      effect of IW10 on slow links at the microscopic level.  [<a href="#ref-CW10" title="long-lived">CW10</a>] was
      conducted for this purpose.

      Testbeds in [<a href="#ref-CW10" title="long-lived">CW10</a>] emulated a 300 ms RTT, bottleneck link
      bandwidth as low as 64 Kbps, and route queue size as low as 40
      packets.  A large combination of test parameters were used.
      Almost all tests showed varying degrees of latency improvement
      from IW=10, with only a modest increase in the packet drop rate
      until a very high load was injected.  The testbed result was
      consistent with both the large-scale data center experiments
      [<a href="#ref-CD10" title="&quot;Increasing TCP's Initial Window&quot;">CD10</a>] [<a href="#ref-DCCM10" title='"Increasing TCP initial window"'>DCCM10</a>] and a separate study using the Network Simulation
      Cradle (NSC) framework [<a href="#ref-Sch11" title='"Performance and Fairness Evaluation of IW10 and Other Fast Startup Schemes"'>Sch11</a>] [<a href="#ref-Sch11-1" title='"Comparison of end-to-end and network- supported fast startup congestion control schemes"'>Sch11-1</a>].

   o  How will the larger initial window affect flows with initial
      windows of 4 KB or less?

      Flows with the larger initial window will likely grab more
      bandwidth from a bottleneck link when competing against flows with
      smaller initial windows, at least initially.  How long will this
      "unfairness" last?  Will there be any "capture effect" where flows
      with larger initial window possess a disproportional share of
      bandwidth beyond just a few round trips?

      If there is any "unfairness" issue from flows with different
      initial windows, it did not show up in the large-scale
      experiments, as the average latency for the bucket of all
      responses less than 4 KB did not seem to be affected by the
      presence of many other larger responses employing large initial
      window.  As a matter of fact, they seemed to benefit from the
      large initial window too, as shown in Figure 7 of [<a href="#ref-Duk10" title="&quot;An Argument for Increasing TCP's Initial Congestion Window&quot;">Duk10</a>].

      The same phenomenon seems to exist in the testbed experiments
      [<a href="#ref-CW10" title="long-lived">CW10</a>].  Flows with IW=3 only suffered slightly when competing
      against flows with IW=10 in light to medium loads.  Under high
      load, both flows' latency improved when mixed together.  Also
      long-lived, background bulk-data flows seemed to enjoy higher
      throughput when running against many foreground short flows of
      IW=10 than against short flows of IW=3.  One plausible explanation
      was that IW=10 enabled short flows to complete sooner, leaving
      more room for the long-lived, background flows.

      A study using an NSC simulator has also concluded that IW=10 works
      rather well and is quite fair against IW=3 [<a href="#ref-Sch11" title='"Performance and Fairness Evaluation of IW10 and Other Fast Startup Schemes"'>Sch11</a>] [<a href="#ref-Sch11-1" title='"Comparison of end-to-end and network- supported fast startup congestion control schemes"'>Sch11-1</a>].

   o  How will a larger initial window perform over cellular networks?

      Some simulation studies [<a href="#ref-JNDK10" title="&quot;A Simulation Study on Increasing TCP's IW&quot;">JNDK10</a>] [<a href="#ref-JNDK10-1" title='"Effect of IW and Initial RTO changes"'>JNDK10-1</a>] have been conducted to
      study the effect of a larger initial window on wireless links from
      2G to 4G networks (EGDE/HSPA/LTE).  The overall result seems mixed
      in both raw performance and the fairness index.
