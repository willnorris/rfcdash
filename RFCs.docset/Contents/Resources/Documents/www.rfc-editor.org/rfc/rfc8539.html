             <span class="h1">Softwire Provisioning Using DHCPv4 over DHCPv6</span>

Abstract

   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 (<a href="./rfc7341">RFC 7341</a>) is a mechanism for dynamically
   configuring IPv4 for use as an over-the-top service in an IPv6-only
   network.  Softwires are an example of such a service.  For DHCPv4
   over DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) to function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire
   mechanisms and deployment scenarios (e.g., <a href="./rfc7596">RFC 7596</a> or <a href="./rfc7597">RFC 7597</a>), the
   operator needs to know the IPv6 address that the client will use as
   the source of an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel.  This address, in
   conjunction with the client's IPv4 address, and (in some deployments)
   the Port Set ID are used to create a binding table entry in the
   operator's softwire tunnel concentrator.  This memo defines a DHCPv6
   option to convey IPv6 parameters for establishing the softwire tunnel
   and a DHCPv4 option (to be used only with DHCP 4o6) to communicate
   the source tunnel IPv6 address between the DHCP 4o6 client and
   server.  It is designed to work in conjunction with the IPv4 address
   allocation process.

   "DHCPv6 Options for Configuration of Softwire Address and Port-Mapped
   Clients" (<a href="./rfc7598">RFC 7598</a>) describes a deterministic DHCPv6-based mechanism
   for provisioning softwires.  This document updates <a href="./rfc7598">RFC 7598</a>, allowing
   OPTION_S46_BR (90) to be enumerated in the DHCPv6 client's Option
   Request Option (ORO) request and to appear directly within subsequent
   messages sent by the DHCPv6 server.

   Deterministic IPv4-over-IPv6 transition technologies require that
   elements be preconfigured with binding rules for routing traffic to
   clients.  This places a constraint on the choice of address used as
   the client's softwire source address: it must use a predetermined
   prefix, which is usually configured on the home gateway device.
   [<a href="./rfc7598" title='"DHCPv6 Options for Configuration of Softwire Address and Port-Mapped Clients"'>RFC7598</a>] describes a DHCPv6-based mechanism for provisioning such
   deterministic softwires.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8539">RFC 8539</a>           Softwire Provisioning with DHCP 4o6        March 2019</span>


   A dynamic provisioning model, such as using DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 (DHCP
   4o6) [<a href="./rfc7341" title='"DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) Transport"'>RFC7341</a>], allows much more flexibility in the location of the
   IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire source address.  In this model, the IPv6
   address is dynamically communicated back to the service provider,
   allowing the corresponding softwire configuration to be created in
   the border relay (BR).

   The DHCP 4o6 client and softwire client could be run on end devices
   attached to a network segment using any routable IPv6 prefix
   allocated to an end user, located anywhere within an arbitrary home
   network topology.  Dynamic allocation also helps to optimize IPv4
   resource usage, because only clients that are actively renewing their
   IPv4 lease hold on to the address.

   This document describes a mechanism for dynamically provisioning
   softwires created using DHCP 4o6, including provisioning the client
   with the address of the softwire BR and informing the service
   provider of a client's binding between the dynamically allocated IPv4
   address and Port Set ID and the IPv6 address that the softwire
   initiator will use for accessing IPv4-over-IPv6 services.

   The mechanism operates alongside the DHCP 4o6 message flows to
   communicate the binding information over the IPv6-only network.  The
   DHCP 4o6 server provides a single point in the network that holds the
   current client binding information.  The service provider can then
   use this binding information to provision other functional elements,
   such as the BR(s).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Applicability</span>

   The mechanism described in this document is only suitable for use for
   provisioning softwire clients via DHCP 4o6.  The options described
   here are only applicable within the DHCP 4o6 message-exchange
   process.  Current softwire technologies suitable for extending to
   incorporate DHCP 4o6 with dynamic IPv4 address leasing include
   [<a href="./rfc7597" title='"Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)"'>RFC7597</a>] and [<a href="./rfc7596" title='"Lightweight 4over6: An Extension to the Dual- Stack Lite Architecture"'>RFC7596</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Solution%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Solution Overview</span>

   In order to provision a softwire, both IPv6 and IPv4 configurations
   need to be passed to the client.  To map this to the DHCP 4o6
   configuration process, the IPv6 configuration is carried in DHCPv6
   options [<a href="./rfc8415" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC8415</a>], carried inside the DHCPv6 message DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   (21) sent by the server.  OPTION_S46_BR (90) is used to provision the
   remote IPv6 address for the softwire BR (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).
   OPTION_S46_BIND_IPV6_PREFIX (137) is optionally sent by the DHCP 4o6
   server to indicate to the client a preferred IPv6 prefix for binding
   the received IPv4 configuration and sourcing tunnel traffic.  This
   may be necessary if there are multiple IPv6 prefixes in use in the
   customer network (e.g., Unique Local Addresses (ULAs)) or if the
   specific IPv4-over-IPv6 transition mechanism requires the use of a
   particular prefix for any reason.

   IPv4 configuration is carried in DHCPv4 messages [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>] (inside
   the DHCP 4o6 option OPTION_DHCPV4_MSG (87)) using the mechanism
   described in [<a href="./rfc7341" title='"DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) Transport"'>RFC7341</a>].

   In order for the client to communicate the softwire source address, a
   new DHCPv4 option OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR (109) is defined in this
   document.  This is included in DHCPREQUEST messages sent by the
   client and is stored by the server for the lifetime of the IPv4
   address lease.

   <a href="./rfc7598#section-4.2">SectionÂ 4.2 of [RFC7598]</a> defines option OPTION_S46_BR (90) for
   communicating remote softwire BR IPv6 address(es) to a client, but it
   mandates that the option can only be used when encapsulated within
   one of the softwire container options: OPTION_S46_CONT_MAPE (94) or
   OPTION_S46_CONT_LW (96).  From <a href="./rfc7598#section-3">SectionÂ 3 of [RFC7598]</a>:

      Softwire46 DHCPv6 clients that receive provisioning options that
      are not encapsulated in container options MUST silently ignore
      these options.

   This document updates [<a href="./rfc7598" title='"DHCPv6 Options for Configuration of Softwire Address and Port-Mapped Clients"'>RFC7598</a>], removing this restriction for
   OPTION_S46_BR (90), allowing it to be enumerated in the client's ORO
   request and appear directly within subsequent messages sent by the
   DHCPv6 server.

   Step 1  The client constructs a DHCPv6 "DHCPV4-QUERY (20)" message.
           This message contains two options: DHCPv6 OPTION_ORO (6) and
           OPTION_DHCPV4_MSG (87).  OPTION_ORO lists "90"
           (OPTION_S46_BR) and "137" (OPTION_S46_BIND_IPV6_PREFIX).
           OPTION_DHCPV4_MSG contains a DHCPv4 DHCPDISCOVER message.

   Step 2  The server responds with a DHCPv6 "DHCPV4-RESPONSE (21)"
           message.  This message contains an OPTION_S46_BR (90)
           containing the IPv6 address of the BR for the client's
           softwire configuration.  The message may also optionally
           contain OPTION_S46_BIND_IPV6_PREFIX (137).  OPTION_DHCPV4_MSG
           contains a DHCPv4 DHCPOFFER message.  The DHCPv4 message
           contains an available IPv4 address.

   Step 3  The client sends a DHCPv6 "DHCPV4-QUERY (20)" message
           containing a DHCPv4 DHCPREQUEST message with the requested
           IPv4 address and OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR (109) with the IPv6
           address that the client will use as its softwire source
           address.

   Step 4  The server sends a DHCPv6 "DHCPV4-RESPONSE (21)" message.
           OPTION_DHCPV4_MSG contains a DHCPv4 DHCPACK message with the
           allocated IPv4 address.  OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR with the
           client's bound softwire source address is included.

   Note: The function of OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR may seem similar to
   the DHCPv4 message's "chaddr" field or the Client Identifier (61)
   option in that it provides a unique lower-layer address that the
   server can use for identifying the client.  However, as both of these
   are required to remain constant throughout the address lease
   lifetime, they cannot be used with the mechanism described in this
   document.  This is because the client may only be able to construct
   the IPv6 address to use as the source address after it has received
   the first DHCPV4-RESPONSE message from the server containing
   OPTION_S46_BIND_IPV6_PREFIX.

   A client requiring dynamic softwire configuration first enables DHCP
   4o6 configuration using the method described in <a href="./rfc7341#section-5">SectionÂ 5 of
   [RFC7341]</a>.  If OPTION_DHCP4_O_DHCP6_SERVER is received in the
   corresponding REPLY message, the client MAY continue with the
   configuration process described below.

   Before the dynamic softwire configuration process can commence, the
   client MUST be configured with a suitable IPv6 prefix to be used as
   the local softwire endpoint.  This could be obtained using DHCPv6,
   Router Advertisement (RA) / Prefix Information Option (PIO), or
   another mechanism.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.1.%20%20Client%20Initialization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" id="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Client Initialization</span>

   When constructing the initial DHCP 4o6 DHCPDISCOVER message, the
   client includes a DHCPv6 OPTION_ORO (6) within the options field of
   the DHCP-QUERY message.  OPTION_ORO contains the option codes for
   OPTION_S46_BR (90) and OPTION_S46_BIND_IPV6_PREFIX (137).

   On receipt of the DHCP 4o6 server's reply (a DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   containing a DHCPOFFER message), the client checks the contents of
   the DHCPv4-RESPONSE for the presence of a valid OPTION_S46_BR option.
   If this option is not present, or does not contain at least one valid
   IPv6 address for a BR, then the client MUST discard the message, as
   without the address of the BR the client cannot configure the
   softwire and so has no interface to request IPv4 configuration for.

   The DHCPV4-RESPONSE message may also include
   OPTION_S46_BIND_IPV6_PREFIX, which is used by the operator to
   indicate a preferred prefix that the client should bind IPv4
   configuration to.  If received, the client first checks the option
   according to <a href="#section-7.4">Section 7.4</a>.  If valid, the client uses this prefix as
   the "IPv6 binding prefix" and follows to the process described in
   <a href="./rfc7596#section-5.1">SectionÂ 5.1 of [RFC7596]</a> in order to select an active IPv6 prefix to
   construct the softwire.  If no match is found, or the client doesn't
   receive OPTION_S46_BIND_IPV6_PREFIX, the client MAY select any valid
   IPv6 prefix (of a suitable scope) to use as the tunnel source.

   Once the client has selected a suitable prefix, it MAY either use an
   existing IPv6 address that is already configured on an interface or
   create a new address specifically for use as the softwire source
   address (e.g., using an Interface Identifier constructed as per
   <a href="./rfc7597#section-6">SectionÂ 6 of [RFC7597]</a>).  If a new address is being created, the
   client MUST complete configuration of the new address, performing
   duplicate address detection (if required) before proceeding.

   The client then constructs a DHCPV4-QUERY message containing a DHCPv4
   DHCPREQUEST message.  OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR is included in the
   options field of the DHCPREQUEST message with the IPv6 address of its
   softwire source address in the softwire-ipv6-src-address field.

   When the client receives a DHCPv4 DHCPACK message from the server, it
   checks the IPv6 address in OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR against its
   active softwire source address.  If they match, the allocation
   process has concluded.  If there is a discrepancy, then the process
   described in <a href="#section-7.5">Section 7.5</a> is followed.

   If the client receives a DHCPv4 DHCPNAK message from the server, then
   the configuration process has been unsuccessful.  The client then
   restarts the process from Step 1 of Figure 1.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Address"></a>      Address</span>

   Whenever the client attempts to extend the lease time of the IPv4
   address, OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR with the IPv6 address of its
   softwire source address in the softwire-ipv6-src-address field MUST
   be included in the DHCPREQUEST message.

   Across the lifetime of the leased IPv4 address, it is possible that
   the client's IPv6 address will change, e.g., if there is an IPv6
   renumbering event.

   In this situation, the client MUST inform the server of the new
   address.  This is done by sending a DHCPREQUEST message containing
   OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR with the new IPv6 source address.

   When the client receives a DHCPv4 DHCPACK message from the server, it
   checks the IPv6 address in OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR against its
   active softwire source address.  If they match, the allocation
   process has concluded.  If there is a discrepancy, then the process
   described in <a href="#section-7.5">Section 7.5</a> is followed.

   If the client receives a DHCPv4 DHCPNAK message in response from the
   server, then the change of the bound IPv6 softwire source address has
   been unsuccessful.  In this case, the client MUST stop using the new
   IPv6 source address.  The client then restarts the process from Step
   1 of Figure 1.

   When the client no longer requires the IPv4 resource, it sends a
   DHCPv4 DHCPRELEASE message to the server.  As the options field is
   unused in this message type, OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR is not
   included.

   On receipt of the OPTION_S46_BIND_IPV6_PREFIX option, the client
   makes the following validation checks:

   o  The received bindprefix6-len value is not larger than 128.

   o  The number of bytes received in the bind-ipv6-prefix field is
      consistent with the received bindprefix6-len value (calculated as
      described in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>).

   If either check fails, the receiver discards the invalid option and
   proceeds to attempt configuration as if the option had not been
   received.

   The receiver MUST only use bits from the bind-ipv6-prefix field up to
   the value specified in the bindprefix6-len when performing the
   longest prefix match. bind-ipv6-prefix bits beyond this value MUST be
   ignored.

   If the client receives a DHCPACK message with an
   OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR containing an IPv6 address that differs from
   its active softwire source address, the client SHOULD wait for a
   randomized time interval and then resend the DHCPREQUEST message with
   the correct softwire source address.  <a href="./rfc2131#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of [RFC2131]</a>
   describes the retransmission backoff interval process.

   The default minimum time for the client to attempt retransmission is
   60 seconds.  If, after this time has expired, the client has not
   received a DHCPACK message with the correct bound IPv6 address,
   client MAY send a DHCPRELEASE message and restart the process
   described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.  The retry interval should be configurable
   and aligned with any server policy defining the minimum time interval
   for client address updates as described in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.

   [<a id="ref-RFC7618">RFC7618</a>] describes a mechanism for using DHCPv4 to distribute
   dynamic, shared IPv4 addresses to clients.  The mechanism described
   in this document is compatible with IPv4 address sharing and can be

   Beyond the normal DHCP 4o6 functionality defined in [<a href="./rfc7341" title='"DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) Transport"'>RFC7341</a>], the
   server MUST also store the IPv6 softwire source address of the client
   in the leasing address database, alongside the IPv4 address and
   client identifier.

   An OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR containing the bound softwire source
   address MUST be sent in every DHCPACK message sent by the server.

   The binding entry between the client's IPv6 softwire source address
   and the leased IPv4 address is valid as long as the IPv4 lease
   remains valid.

   In the event that the server receives a DHCPREQUEST message for an
   active IPv4 lease containing an OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR with an IPv6
   address that differs from the address that is currently stored, the
   server updates the stored softwire source address with the new
   address supplied by the client and sends a DHCPACK message containing
   the updated softwire source address in OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR.

   The server MAY implement a policy enforcing a minimum time interval
   between a client updating its softwire source IPv6 address.  If a
   client attempts to update the softwire source IPv6 address before the
   minimum time has expired, the server can either silently drop the
   client's message or send back a DHCPACK message containing the
   existing IPv6 address binding in OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR.  If
   implemented, the default minimum client source address update
   interval is 60 seconds.

   In order for traffic to be forwarded correctly, each customer edge's
   (CE's) softwire IPv6 source address must be unique.  To ensure this,
   on receipt of every client DHCPREQUEST message containing
   OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR, the DHCP 4o6 server MUST check the received
   IPv6 address against all existing CE source addresses stored for

   active client IPv4 leases.  If there is a match for any active lease
   other than the lease belonging to the client sending the DHCPREQUEST,
   then the client's IPv6 source address MUST NOT be stored or updated.

   Depending on where the client and server are in the address leasing
   lifecycle, the DHCP 4o6 server then takes the following action:

   o  If the DHCP 4o6 does not have a current, active IPv4 address lease
      for the client, then the DHCP address allocation process has not
      been successful.  The server returns a DHCPNAK message to the
      client.

   o  If the DHCP 4o6 does have a current, active IPv4 address lease,
      then the source address update process (see <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>) has not
      been successful.  The DHCP 4o6 server can either silently drop the
      client's message or return a DHCPACK message containing the
      existing IPv6 address binding in OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR.

   Security considerations that are applicable to [<a href="./rfc7341" title='"DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) Transport"'>RFC7341</a>] are also
   applicable here.

   A rogue client could attempt to use the mechanism described in
   <a href="#section-7.2.1">Section 7.2.1</a> to redirect IPv4 traffic intended for another client to
   itself.  This would be performed by sending a DHCPREQUEST message for
   another client's active IPv4 lease containing the attacker's softwire
   IPv6 address in OPTION_DHCP4O6_S46_SADDR.

   For such an attack to be effective, the attacker would need to know
   both the client identifier and the active IPv4 address lease
   currently in use by another client.  This could be attempted in three
   ways:

   1.  One customer learning the active IPv4 address lease and client
       identifier of another customer via snooping the DHCP4o6 message
       flow between the client and server.  The mechanism described in
       this document is intended for use in a typical ISP network
       topology with a dedicated Layer 2 access network per client,
       meaning that snooping of another client's traffic is not
       possible.  If the access network is a shared medium, then
       provisioning softwire clients using dynamic DHCP4o6 as described
       here is NOT RECOMMENDED.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8539">RFC 8539</a>           Softwire Provisioning with DHCP 4o6        March 2019</span>


   2.  Learning the active IPv4 address lease and client identifier via
       snooping the DHCP4o6 message flow between the client and server
       in the aggregation or core ISP network.  In this case, the
       attacker requires a level of access to the ISP's infrastructure
       that means they can already intercept or interfere with traffic
       flows to the client.

   3.  An attacker attempting to brute-force guess the IPv4 lease
       address and client identifier tuple.  The risk of this can be
       reduced by using a client identifier format that is not easily
       guessable, e.g., by using a random-based client identifier (see
       <a href="./rfc7844#section-3.5">SectionÂ 3.5 of [RFC7844]</a>).

   An attacker could attempt to redirect existing flows to a client
   unable to process the traffic.  This type of attack can be prevented
   by implementing network ingress filtering [<a href="#ref-BCP38" title='"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing"'>BCP38</a>] in conjunction with
   the BR source address validation processes described in <a href="./rfc7596#section-5.2">[RFC7596]
   SectionÂ 5.2</a> and <a href="./rfc7597#section-8.1">[RFC7597] SectionÂ 8.1</a>.

   A client may attempt to overload the server by sending multiple
   source address update messages (see <a href="#section-7.2.1">Section 7.2.1</a>) in a short time
   frame.  This risk can be reduced by implementing a server policy
   enforcing a minimum time interval between client address changes, as
   described in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.

   considerations and recommendations are also applicable to clients
   implementing the mechanism described in this document.  As DHCP 4o6
   only uses DHCPv6 as a stateless transport for DHCPv4 messages, the
   "Anonymity Profile for DHCPv4" described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> is most
   relevant here.

   In addition to the considerations given in [<a href="./rfc7844" title='"Anonymity Profiles for DHCP Clients"'>RFC7844</a>], the mechanism
   that the client uses for constructing the interface identifier for
   its IPv6 softwire source address (see <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>) could result in
   the device being trackable across different networks and sessions,
   e.g., if the client's softwire Interface Identifier (IID) is
   immutable.

   This can be mitigated by constructing the softwire source IPv6
   address as per <a href="./rfc7597#section-6">SectionÂ 6 of [RFC7597]</a>.  Here, the address's IID
   contains only the allocated IPv4 address (and port set identifier if
   [<a href="./rfc7618" title='"Dynamic Allocation of Shared IPv4 Addresses"'>RFC7618</a>] is being used).  This means no additional client
   information is exposed to the DHCP 4o6 server; it also means that the
   IID will change as the leased IPv4 address changes (e.g., between
   sessions when <a href="./rfc7844#section-3.5">SectionÂ 3.5 of [RFC7844]</a> is implemented).
