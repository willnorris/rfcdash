                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

     This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from January
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3%20to%20January%2015."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a> to January 15.</span>

     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.
These Hosts fall into two categories:

1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as
servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis for at
least two weeks.  Included here are:

       Network
       Address                Site            Computer
       -------                ----            --------
         133                  BBN             PDP-10 (B)
           8*                 SDC             IBM-370/155
          13                  Case            PDP-10
          15                  Ames/(Paoli)    ILLIAC-(B6500)

2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here
are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,
MITRE, NBS and BBN**).  This category also includes the Network
Control Center Computer (Network Address 5) which is used solely for
gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included among these
Hosts are the following:

       Network
       Address                Site            Computer
       -------                ----            --------
          7                  Rand            IBM-360/65
         73                  Harvard         PDP-1
         12                  Illinois        PDP-11
         19                  NBS             PDP-11

     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for
this period.

<span class="grey">*The SDC site is currently replacing their IBM 360/67 by an IBM</span>
370/155.  This site therefore is temporarily without any permanent
Host on the network, and for this reason was not included in the daily
testing for the preceding two weeks.
**The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as
such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to
refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

where
D =  Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
     partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)

H =  1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
     immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O =  Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)

R =  Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
    connection within 60 seconds.

*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a Network Job
Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to test
NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection to the NETRJS logger
indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.

times.
