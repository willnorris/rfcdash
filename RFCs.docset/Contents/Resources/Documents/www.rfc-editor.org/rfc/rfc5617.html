DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP)

Abstract

   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level
   authentication framework for email to permit verification of the
   source and contents of messages.  This document specifies an adjunct
   mechanism to aid in assessing messages that do not contain a DKIM
   signature for the domain used in the author's address.  It defines a
   record that can advertise whether a domain signs its outgoing mail as
   well as how other hosts can access that record.

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5617">RFC 5617</a>                          ADSP                       August 2009</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a mechanism by which email
   messages can be cryptographically signed, permitting a signing domain
   to claim responsibility for the introduction of a message into the
   mail stream.  Message recipients can verify the signature by querying
   the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key,
   and thereby confirm that the message was attested to by a party in
   possession of the private key for the signing domain.

   However, the legacy of the Internet is such that not all messages
   will be signed, and the absence of a signature on a message is not an
   a priori indication of forgery.  In fact, during early phases of
   deployment, it is very likely that most messages will remain
   unsigned.  However, some domains might decide to sign all of their
   outgoing mail, for example, to protect their brand names.  It might
   be desirable for such domains to be able to advertise that fact to
   other hosts.  This is the topic of Author Domain Signing Practices
   (ADSP).

   Hosts implementing this specification can inquire what Author Domain
   Signing Practices a domain advertises.  This inquiry is called an
   Author Domain Signing Practices check.

   The basic requirements for ADSP are given in [<a href="./rfc5016" title='"Requirements for a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signing Practices Protocol"'>RFC5016</a>].  This
   document refers extensively to [<a href="./rfc4871" title='"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures"'>RFC4871</a>] and assumes the reader is
   familiar with it.

   Requirements Notation:

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Language%20and%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Language and Terminology</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Terms%20Imported%20from%20the%20DKIM%20Signatures%20Specification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Terms Imported from the DKIM Signatures Specification</span>

   Some terminology used herein is derived directly from [<a href="./rfc4871" title='"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures"'>RFC4871</a>].  In
   several cases, references in that document to "Sender" have been
   changed to "Author" here, to emphasize the relationship to the Author
   address(es) in the From: header field described in [<a href="./rfc5322" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>].
   Briefly,

   o  A "Signer" is the agent that signs a message, as defined in
      <a href="./rfc4871#section-2.1">Section 2.1 of [RFC4871]</a>.

   o  A "Local-part" is the part of an address preceding the @
      character, as defined in [<a href="./rfc5322" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>] and used in [<a href="./rfc4871" title='"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures"'>RFC4871</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Valid%20Signature"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Valid Signature</span>

   A "Valid Signature" is any signature on a message that correctly
   verifies using the procedure described in <a href="./rfc4871#section-6.1">Section 6.1 of [RFC4871]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Author%20Address"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Author Address</span>

   An "Author Address" is an email address in the From: header field of
   a message [<a href="./rfc5322" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>].  If the From: header field contains multiple
   addresses, the message has multiple Author Addresses.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20Author%20Domain"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Author Domain</span>

   An "Author Domain" is everything to the right of the "@" in an Author
   Address (excluding the "@" itself).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.%20%20Alleged%20Author"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5" id="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Alleged Author</span>

   An "Alleged Author" is an Author Address of a message; it is
   "alleged" because it has not yet been checked.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.6.%20%20Author%20Domain%20Signing%20Practices"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6" id="section-2.6">2.6</a>.  Author Domain Signing Practices</span>

   "Author Domain Signing Practices" (or just "practices") consist of a
   machine-readable record published by the domain of an Alleged Author
   that includes statements about the domain's practices with respect to
   mail it sends with its domain in the From: line.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.7.%20%20Author%20Domain%20Signature"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7" id="section-2.7">2.7</a>.  Author Domain Signature</span>

   An "Author Domain Signature" is a Valid Signature in which the domain
   name of the DKIM signing entity, i.e., the d= tag in the DKIM-
   Signature header field, is the same as the domain name in the Author
   Address.  Following [<a href="./rfc5321" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>RFC5321</a>], domain name comparisons are case
   insensitive.

   For example, if the From: line address is bob@domain.example, and the
   message has a Valid Signature with the DKIM-Signature header field
   containing "d=domain.example", then the message has an Author Domain
   Signature.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Operation%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Operation Overview</span>

   Domain owners publish ADSP information via a query mechanism such as
   the Domain Name System; specific details are given in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.
   Hosts can look up the ADSP information of the domain(s) specified by
   the Author Address(es) as described in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.  If a message has
   multiple Author Addresses, the ADSP lookups SHOULD be performed
   independently on each address.  This document does not address the
   process a host might use to combine the lookup results.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20ADSP%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  ADSP Applicability</span>

   ADSP as defined in this document is bound to DNS.  For this reason,
   ADSP is applicable only to Author Domains with appropriate DNS
   records (i.e., A, AAAA, and/or MX) indicating the possible use of the
   domain for email.  The handling of other Author Domains is outside
   the scope of this document.  However, attackers may use such domain
   names in a deliberate attempt to sidestep an organization's ADSP
   policy statements.  It is up to the ADSP checker implementation to
   return an appropriate error result for Author Domains outside the
   scope of ADSP.

   ADSP applies to specific domains, not domain subtrees.  If, for
   example, an Author Address were user@domain.example, the Author
   Domain would be domain.example, and the applicable ADSP record would
   be at _adsp._domainkey.domain.example.  An Author Address in a
   subdomain such as user@sub.domain.example would have a different ADSP
   record at _adsp._domainkey.sub.domain.example.  ADSP makes no
   connection between a domain and its parent or child domains.

   Note:   If an organization wants to publish Author Domain Signing
           Practices for all the subdomains it uses, such as host names
           of servers within the domain, it does so by creating ADSP
           records for every _adsp._domainkey.&lt;sub&gt;.domain.example.
           Wildcards cannot be used (see <a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>.); however,
           suitable DNS management tools could automate creation of the
           ADSP records.

   Note:   The results from DNS queries that are intended to validate a
           domain name unavoidably approximate the set of Author Domains
           that can appear in legitimate email.  For example, a DNS A
           record could belong to a device that does not even have an
           email implementation.  It is up to the checker to decide what
           degree of approximation is acceptable.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20ADSP%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  ADSP Usage</span>

   Depending on the Author Domain(s) and the signatures in a message, a
   recipient gets varying amounts of useful information from each ADSP
   lookup.

   o  If a message has no Valid Signature, the ADSP result is directly
      relevant to the message.

   o  If a message has an Author Domain Signature, ADSP provides no
      benefit relative to that domain since the message is already known
      to be compliant with any possible ADSP for that domain.

   o  If a message has a Valid Signature other than an Author Domain
      Signature, the receiver can use both the Signature and the ADSP
      result in its evaluation of the message.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20ADSP%20Results"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  ADSP Results</span>

   An ADSP lookup for an Author Address produces one of four possible
   results:

   o  Messages from this domain might or might not have an Author Domain
      Signature.  This is the default if the domain exists in the DNS
      but no ADSP record is found.

   o  All messages from this domain are signed with an Author Domain
      Signature.

   o  All messages from this domain are signed with an Author Domain
      Signature and are discardable, i.e., if a message arrives without
      a valid Author Domain Signature, the domain encourages the
      recipient(s) to discard it.

   o  This domain is out of scope, i.e., the domain does not exist in
      the DNS.

   An ADSP lookup could terminate without producing any result if a DNS
   lookup results in a temporary failure.

   ADSP records are published using the DNS TXT resource record type.

   The RDATA for ADSP resource records is textual in format, with
   specific syntax and semantics relating to their role in describing
   ADSP.  The "Tag=Value List" syntax described in <a href="./rfc4871#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of
   [RFC4871]</a> is used, modified to use whitespace (WSP) rather than
   folding whitespace (FWS).  Records not in compliance with that syntax
   or the syntax of individual tags described in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a> MUST be
   ignored (considered equivalent to a NODATA result) for purposes of
   ADSP, although they MAY cause the logging of warning messages via an
   appropriate system logging mechanism.  If the RDATA contains multiple
   character strings, the strings are logically concatenated with no
   delimiters between the strings.

   Note:   ADSP changes the "Tag=Value List" syntax from [<a href="./rfc4871" title='"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures"'>RFC4871</a>] to
           use WSP rather than FWS in its DNS records.

   Domains MUST NOT publish ADSP records with wildcard names.  Wildcards
   within a domain publishing ADSP records pose a particular problem, as
   discussed in more detail in <a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Publication%20of%20ADSP%20Records"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Publication of ADSP Records</span>

   ADSP is intended to apply to all mail sent using the domain name
   string of an Alleged Author.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.1.%20%20Record%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1" id="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Record Syntax</span>

   ADSP records use the "tag=value" syntax described in <a href="./rfc4871#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of
   [RFC4871]</a>, modified to use WSP rather than FWS.  Every ADSP record
   MUST start with an outbound signing-practices tag, so the first four
   characters of the record are lowercase "dkim", followed by optional
   whitespace and "=".

   Tags used in ADSP records are described below.  Unrecognized tags
   MUST be ignored.  In the ABNF below, the WSP token is imported from
   [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].

   dkim=   Outbound Signing Practices for the domain (plain-text;

   Hosts doing an ADSP lookup MUST produce a result that is semantically
   equivalent to applying the following steps in the order listed below.
   In practice, these steps can be performed in parallel in order to
   improve performance.  However, implementations SHOULD avoid doing
   unnecessary DNS lookups.

   For the purposes of this section, a "valid ADSP record" is one that
   is both syntactically and semantically correct; in particular, it
   matches the ABNF for a "tag-list" and starts with a valid "dkim" tag.

   Check Domain Scope:
      An ADSP checker implementation MUST determine whether a given
      Author Domain is within the scope for ADSP.  Given the background
      in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>, the checker MUST decide which degree of
      approximation is acceptable.  The checker MUST return an
      appropriate error result for Author Domains that are outside the
      scope of ADSP.

      The host MUST perform a DNS query for a record corresponding to
      the Author Domain (with no prefix).  The type of the query can be
      of any type, since this step is only to determine if the domain
      itself exists in DNS.  This query MAY be done in parallel with the
      query to fetch the named ADSP Record.  If the result of this query
      is that the Author Domain does not exist in the DNS (often called
      an NXDOMAIN error, rcode=3 in [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>]), the algorithm MUST
      terminate with an error indicating that the domain is out of
      scope.  Note that a result with rcode=0 but no records (often
      called NODATA) is not the same as NXDOMAIN.

         NON-NORMATIVE DISCUSSION: Any resource record type could be
         used for this query since the existence of a resource record of
         any type will prevent an NXDOMAIN error.  MX is a reasonable
         choice for this purpose because this record type is thought to
         be the most common for domains used in email, and will
         therefore produce a result that can be more readily cached than
         a negative result.

      If the domain does exist, the checker MAY make more extensive
      checks to verify the existence of the domain, such as the ones
      described in <a href="./rfc5321#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC5321]</a>.  If those checks indicate

      that the Author Domain does not exist for mail, e.g., the domain
      has no MX, A, or AAAA record, the checker SHOULD terminate with an
      error indicating that the domain is out of scope.

   Fetch Named ADSP Record:
      The host MUST query DNS for a TXT record corresponding to the
      Author Domain prefixed by "_adsp._domainkey." (note the trailing
      dot).

      If the result of this query is a NOERROR response (rcode=0 in
      [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>]) with an answer that is a single record that is a valid
      ADSP record, use that record, and the algorithm terminates.

      If the result of the query is NXDOMAIN or NOERROR with zero
      records, there is no ADSP record.  If the result of the query
      contains more than one record, or a record that is not a valid
      ADSP record, the ADSP result is undefined.

      If a query results in a "SERVFAIL" error response (rcode=2 in
      [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>]), the algorithm terminates without returning a result;
      possible actions include queuing the message or returning an SMTP
      error indicating a temporary failure.

   See <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> for examples of ADSP lookup.

   Security considerations in the ADSP are mostly related to attempts on
   the part of malicious senders to represent themselves as Authors for
   whom they are not authorized to send mail, often in an attempt to
   defraud either the recipient or an Alleged Author.

   Additional security considerations regarding Author Domain Signing
   Practices are found in the DKIM threat analysis [<a href="./rfc4686" title='"Analysis of Threats Motivating DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)"'>RFC4686</a>].

   Email recipients often have a core set of content Authors that they
   already trust.  Common examples include financial institutions with
   which they have an existing relationship and Internet web transaction
   sites with which they conduct business.

   Email abuse often seeks to exploit a legitimate email Author's name-
   recognition among recipients by using the Author's domain name in the
   From: header field.  Especially since many popular Mail User Agents
   (MUAs) do not display the Author's email address, there is no
   empirical evidence of the extent that this particular unauthorized
   use of a domain name contributes to recipient deception or that
   eliminating it will have significant effect.

   However, closing this potential exploit could facilitate some types
   of optimized processing by receive-side message filtering engines,
   since it could permit them to maintain higher-confidence assertions
   about From: header field uses of a domain when the occurrence is
   authorized.

   Unauthorized uses of domain names occur elsewhere in messages, as do
   unauthorized uses of organizations' names.  These attacks are outside
   the scope of this specification.

   ADSP does not provide any benefit -- nor, indeed, have any effect at
   all -- unless an external system acts upon the verdict, either by
   treating the message differently during the delivery process or by
   showing some indicator to the end recipient.  Such a system is out of
   scope for this specification.

   ADSP checkers may perform multiple DNS lookups per Alleged Author
   Domain.  Since these lookups are driven by domain names in email
   message headers of possibly fraudulent email, legitimate ADSP
   checkers can become participants in traffic multiplication attacks on
   domains that appear in fraudulent email.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20DNS%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  DNS Considerations</span>

   An attacker might attack the DNS infrastructure in an attempt to
   impersonate ADSP records to influence a receiver's decision on how it
   will handle mail.  However, such an attacker is more likely to attack
   at a higher level, e.g., redirecting A or MX record lookups in order
   to capture traffic that was legitimately intended for the target
   domain.  These DNS security issues are addressed by DNSSEC [<a href="./rfc4033" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>].

   Because ADSP operates within the framework of the legacy email
   system, the default result in the absence of an ADSP record is that
   the domain does not sign all of its messages.  It is therefore
   important that the ADSP clients distinguish a DNS failure such as
   "SERVFAIL" from other DNS errors so that appropriate actions can be
   taken.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.3.%20%20DNS%20Wildcards"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" id="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  DNS Wildcards</span>

   DNS wildcards (described in [<a href="./rfc4592" title='"The Role of Wildcards in the Domain Name System"'>RFC4592</a>]) that exist in the DNS
   hierarchy at or above the domain being checked interfere with the
   ability to verify the scope of the ADSP check described in
   <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.  For example, a wildcard record for *.domain.example
   makes all subdomains such as foo.domain.example exist in the DNS.
   Domains that intend to make active use of ADSP by publishing a
   practice other than unknown are advised to avoid the use of wildcards
   in their hierarchy.

   If a domain contains wildcards, then any name that matches the
   wildcard can appear to be a valid mail domain eligible for ADSP.  But
   the "_adsp._domainkey." prefix on ADSP records does not allow
   publication of wildcard records that cover ADSP records without also
   covering non-ADSP records, nor does it allow publication of wildcard
   records that cover non-ADSP records without also covering ADSP
   records.  A domain that uses ADSP practices other than unknown SHOULD
   NOT publish wildcard records.

   In one model of DKIM usage, a domain signs messages that are in
   transit through their system.  Since any signature whose domain
   matches the Author Domain is, by definition, an Author Domain
   Signature, it would be unwise to sign mail whose Author Domain is the
   Signer's domain if the mail is not known to meet the domain's
   standards for an Author Domain Signature.

   One such use case is where a domain might apply such a signature
   following application of an Authentication-Results header field as
   described in <a href="./rfc5451#section-7.1">Section 7.1 of [RFC5451]</a>.  This problem can be easily
   avoided either by not applying a signature that might be confused
   with an Author Domain Signature or by applying a signature from some
   other domain, such as a subdomain of the Author Domain.

   Assume the example domain publishes these DNS records (in these
   examples, the numbers in parentheses are comments to help identify
   the records, not part of the records themselves):

   aaa.example                  A     192.0.2.1        (1)
   _adsp._domainkey.aaa.example TXT   "dkim=all"       (2)

   bbb.example                  MX 10 mail.bbb.example (3)
   mail.bbb.example             A     192.0.2.2        (4)

   A mail message contains this From: header line:

   From: bob@aaa.example (Bob the Author)

   The ADSP lookup first identifies the Author Address bob@aaa.example
   and the Author Domain aaa.example.  It does an MX DNS query for
   aaa.example and gets back a NOERROR result with no DNS records.
   (There's no MX record, but since record (1) exists, the name exists
   in the DNS.)  Since that query didn't return an error, the lookup
   proceeds to a TXT DNS query for _adsp._domainkey.aaa.example, which
   returns record (2).  Since this is a valid ADSP record, the result is
   that all messages from this domain are signed.

   A mail message contains this From: header line:

   From: alice@bbb.example (Old-fashioned Alice)

   The ADSP lookup first identifies the Author Address alice@bbb.example
   and the Author Domain bbb.example.  It does an MX DNS query for
   bbb.example and gets back record (3).  Since that query didn't return
   an error, it then proceeds to a TXT DNS query for
   _adsp._domainkey.bbb.example, which returns NXDOMAIN.  Since the
   domain exists but there is no ADSP record, ADSP returns the default
   unknown result: messages may or may not have an author domain
   signature.

   A mail message contains this From: header line:

   The ADSP lookup first identifies the Author Address frank@ccc.example
   and the Author Domain ccc.example.  It does an MX DNS query for
   ccc.example and gets back an NXDOMAIN result since there are no
   records at all for ccc.example.  The lookup terminates with the
   result that the domain does not exist in the DNS and so is out of
   scope.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20B.%20%20Usage%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B" id="appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Usage Examples</span>

   These examples are intended to illustrate typical uses of ADSP.  They
   are not intended to be exhaustive or to apply to every domain's or
   mail system's individual situation.

   Domain managers are advised to consider the ways that mail processing
   can modify messages in ways that will invalidate an existing DKIM
   signature, such as mailing lists, courtesy forwarders, and other
   paths that could add or modify headers, or modify the message body.
   If the modifications invalidate the DKIM signature, recipient hosts
   will consider the mail not to have an Author Domain Signature, even
   though the signature was present when the mail was originally sent.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/B.1.%20%20Single%20Location%20Domains"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.1" id="appendix-B.1">B.1</a>.  Single Location Domains</span>

   One common mail system configuration handles all of a domain's users'
   incoming and outgoing mail through a single Mail Transport Agent
   (MTA) or group of MTAs.  With this configuration, the MTA(s) can be
   configured to sign outgoing mail with an Author Domain Signature.

   In this situation, it might be appropriate to publish an ADSP record
   for the domain containing "all", depending on whether the users also
   send mail through other paths that do not apply an Author Domain
   Signature.  Such paths could include MTAs at hotels or hotspot
   networks used by travelling users, web sites that provide "mail an
   article" features, user messages sent through mailing lists, or
   third-party mail clients that support multiple user identities.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/B.2.%20%20Bulk%20Mailing%20Domains"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.2" id="appendix-B.2">B.2</a>.  Bulk Mailing Domains</span>

   Another common configuration uses a domain solely for bulk or
   broadcast mail, with no individual human users -- again, typically
   sending all the mail through a single MTA or group of MTAs that can
   apply an Author Domain Signature.  In this case, the domain's
   management can be confident that all of its outgoing mail will be
   sent through the signing MTA(s).  Lacking individual users, the
   domain is unlikely to participate in mailing lists, but could still
   send mail through other paths that might invalidate signatures.

   Domain owners often use specialist mailing providers to send their
   bulk mail.  In this case, the mailing provider needs access to a
   suitable signing key in order to apply an Author Domain Signature.
   One possible route would be for the domain owner to generate the key
   and give it to the mailing provider.  Another would be for the domain
   to delegate a subdomain to the mailing provider, for example,
   bigbank.example might delegate email.bigbank.example to such a
   provider; in this case, the provider can generate the keys and DKIM
   DNS records itself and use the subdomain in the Author Address in the
   mail.

   Regardless of the DNS and key management strategy chosen, whoever
   maintains the DKIM records for the domain could also install an ADSP
   record containing "all".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/B.3.%20%20Bulk%20Mailing%20Domains%20with%20Discardable%20Mail"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.3" id="appendix-B.3">B.3</a>.  Bulk Mailing Domains with Discardable Mail</span>

   In some cases, a domain might sign all of its outgoing mail with an
   Author Domain Signature and prefer that recipient systems discard
   mail without a valid Author Domain Signature in order to avoid having
   its mail confused with mail sent from sources that do not apply an
   Author Domain Signature.  (In the case of domains with tightly
   controlled outgoing mail, this latter kind of mail is sometimes
   loosely called "forgeries".)  In such cases, it might be appropriate
   to publish an ADSP record containing "discardable".  Note that a
   domain SHOULD NOT publish a "discardable" record if it wishes to
   maximize the likelihood that mail from the domain is delivered, since
   it could cause some fraction of the mail the domain sends to be
   discarded.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/B.4.%20%20Third-Party%20Senders"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.4" id="appendix-B.4">B.4</a>.  Third-Party Senders</span>

   Another common use case is for a third party to enter into an
   agreement whereby that third party will send bulk or other mail on
   behalf of a designated Author or Author Domain, using that domain in
   the [<a href="./rfc5322" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>] From: or other headers.  Due to the many and varied
   complexities of such agreements, third-party signing is not addressed
   in this specification.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/B.5.%20%20Domains%20with%20Independent%20Users%20and%20Liberal%20Use%20Policies"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.5" id="appendix-B.5">B.5</a>.  Domains with Independent Users and Liberal Use Policies</span>

   When a domain has independent users and its usage policy does not
   explicitly restrict them to sending mail only from designated mail
   servers (e.g., many ISP domains and even some corporate domains),
   then it is only appropriate to publish an ADSP record containing
   "unknown".  Publishing either "all" or "discardable" will likely
   result in significant breakage because independent users are likely
   to send mail from the external paths enumerated in <a href="#appendix-B.1">Appendix B.1</a>.

   If a domain sends no mail at all, it can safely publish a
   "discardable" ADSP record, since any mail with an Author Address in
   the domain is a forgery.
