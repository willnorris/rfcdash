    <span class="h1">RFC 4871 DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures -- Update</span>

Abstract

   This document updates <a href="./rfc4871">RFC 4871</a>, "DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
   Signatures".  Specifically, the document clarifies the nature, roles,
   and relationship of the two DKIM identifier tag values that are
   candidates for payload delivery to a receiving processing module.
   The Update is in the style of an Errata entry, albeit a rather long
   one.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   About the purpose for DKIM, [<a href="./rfc4871" title='"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures"'>RFC4871</a>] states:

      The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing domain
      to assert responsibility for a message, thus protecting message
      signer identity...

   Hence, DKIM has a signer that produces a signed message, a verifier
   that confirms the signature, and an assessor that consumes the
   validated signing domain.  So, the simple purpose of DKIM is to
   communicate an identifier to a receive-side assessor module.  The
   identifier is in the form of a domain name that refers to a
   responsible identity.  For DKIM to be interoperable and useful, the
   signer and assessor must share the same understanding of the details
   about the identifier.

   However, the <a href="./rfc4871">RFC 4871</a> specification defines two, potentially
   different, identifiers that are carried in the DKIM-Signature: header
   field, d= and i=.  Either might be delivered to a receiving
   processing module that consumes validated payload.  The DKIM
   specification fails to clearly define which is the "payload" to be
   delivered to a consuming module, versus what is internal and merely
   in support of achieving payload delivery.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5672">RFC 5672</a>                    <a href="./rfc4871">RFC 4871</a> Update                  August 2009</span>


   This currently leaves signers and assessors with the potential for
   making different interpretations between the two identifiers and may
   lead to interoperability problems.  A signer could intend one to be
   used for assessment, and have a different intent in setting the value
   in the other.  However the verifier might choose the wrong value to
   deliver to the assessor, thereby producing an unintended (and
   inaccurate) assessment.

   This Update resolves that confusion.  It defines additional, semantic
   labels for the two values, clarifies their nature, and specifies
   their relationship.  More specifically, it clarifies that the
   identifier intended for delivery to the assessor -- such as one that
   consults a whitelist -- is the value of the "d=" tag.  However, this
   does not prohibit message filtering engines from using the "i=" tag,
   or any other information in the message's header, for filtering
   decisions.

   For signers and verifiers that have been using the i= tag as the
   primary value that is delivered to the assessor, a software change to
   using the d= tag is intended.

   So, this Update clarifies the formal interface to DKIM, after
   signature verification has been performed.  It distinguishes DKIM's
   internal signing and verification activity, from its standardized
   delivery of data to that interface.

   The focus of the Update is on the portion of DKIM that is much like
   an API definition.  If DKIM is implemented as a software library for
   use by others, it needs to define what outputs are provided, that is,
   what data that an application developer who uses the library can
   expect to obtain as a result of invoking DKIM on a message.

   This Update defines the output of that library to include the yes/no
   result of the verification and the "d=" value.  In other words, it
   says what (one) identifier was formally specified for use by the
   signer and whether the use of that identifier has been validated.
   For a particular library, other information can be provided at the
   discretion of the library developer, since developers of assessors --
   these are the consumers of the DKIM library -- well might want more
   information than the standardized two pieces of information.
   However, that standardized set is the minimum that is required to be
   provided to a consuming module, in order to be able to claim that the
   library is DKIM compliant.

   This does not state what the implicit value of "i=" is, relative to
   "d=".  In this context, that fact is irrelevant.

   Another example is the difference between the socket interface to TCP
   versus the TCP protocol itself.  There is the activity within the
   protocol stack, and then there is the activity within in the software
   libraries that are actually used.

   i=  Identity of the user or agent (e.g., a mailing list manager) on
      behalf of which this message is signed (dkim-quoted-printable;
      OPTIONAL, default is an empty Local-part followed by an "@"
      followed by the domain from the "d=" tag).  The syntax is a
      standard email address where the Local-part MAY be omitted.  The
      domain part of the address MUST be the same as or a subdomain of
      the value of the "d=" tag.

      Internationalized domain names MUST be converted using the steps
      listed in <a href="./rfc3490#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC3490]</a> using the "ToASCII" function.

                      [ Local-part ] "@" domain-name

      INFORMATIVE NOTE: The Local-part of the "i=" tag is optional
      because in some cases a signer may not be able to establish a
      verified individual identity.  In such cases, the signer may
      wish to assert that although it is willing to go as far as
      signing for the domain, it is unable or unwilling to commit
      to an individual user name within their domain.  It can do so
      by including the domain part but not the Local-part of the
      identity.

      INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION: This document does not require the value
      of the "i=" tag to match the identity in any message header
      fields.  This is considered to be a verifier policy issue.

      identities in other header fields seek to apply basic
      authentication into the semantics of trust associated with a
      role such as content author.  Trust is a broad and complex
      topic and trust mechanisms are subject to highly creative
      attacks.  The real-world efficacy of
      bindings between the "i=" value and other identities is not
      well established, nor is its vulnerability to subversion by
      an attacker.  Hence reliance on the use of these options
      should be strictly limited.  In particular, it is not at all

         The Agent or User Identifier (AUID) on behalf of which the SDID
         is taking responsibility (dkim-quoted-printable; OPTIONAL,
         default is an empty Local-part followed by an "@" followed by
         the domain from the "d=" tag).

         The syntax is a standard email address where the Local-part MAY
         be omitted.  The domain part of the address MUST be the same
         as, or a subdomain of the value of, the "d=" tag.

         Internationalized domain names MUST be converted using the
         steps listed in <a href="./rfc3490#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC3490]</a> using the "ToASCII"

         The AUID is specified as having the same syntax as an email
         address, but is not required to have the same semantics.
         Notably, the domain name is not required to be registered in
         the DNS -- so it might not resolve in a query -- and the Local-
         part MAY be drawn from a namespace that does not contain the
         user's mailbox.  The details of the structure and semantics for
         the namespace are determined by the Signer.  Any knowledge or
         use of those details by verifiers or assessors is outside the
         scope of the DKIM Signing specification.  The Signer MAY choose
         to use the same namespace for its AUIDs as its users' email
         addresses or MAY choose other means of representing its users.
         However, the signer SHOULD use the same AUID for each message
         intended to be evaluated as being within the same sphere of

         using the AUID as a stable identifier that is finer grained
         than the SDID.

         INFORMATIVE NOTE: The Local-part of the "i=" tag is optional
         because, in some cases, a signer may not be able to establish a
         verified individual identity.  In such cases, the signer might
         wish to assert that although it is willing to go as far as
         signing for the domain, it is unable or unwilling to commit to
         an individual user name within their domain.  It can do so by
         including the domain part but not the Local-part of the
         identity.

      signature) is sub.example.com, or even sub1.sub2.example.com.  In

   Original Text:   (None.  New section.  Additional text.)

   Corrected Text:

      DKIM's primary task is to communicate from the Signer to a
      recipient-side Identity Assessor a single Signing Domain
      Identifier (SDID) that refers to a responsible identity.  DKIM MAY
      optionally provide a single responsible Agent or User Identifier
      (AUID).

      Hence, DKIM's mandatory output to a receive-side Identity Assessor
      is a single domain name.  Within the scope of its use as DKIM
      output, the name has only basic domain name semantics; any
      possible owner-specific semantics are outside the scope of DKIM.
      That is, within its role as a DKIM identifier, additional
      semantics cannot be assumed by an Identity Assessor.

      A receive-side DKIM verifier MUST communicate the Signing Domain
      Identifier (d=) to a consuming Identity Assessor module and MAY
      communicate the Agent or User Identifier (i=) if present.

      To the extent that a receiver attempts to intuit any structured
      semantics for either of the identifiers, this is a heuristic
      function that is outside the scope of DKIM's specification and
      semantics.  Hence, it is relegated to a higher-level service, such
      as a delivery handling filter that integrates a variety of inputs
      and performs heuristic analysis of them.

      INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION: This document does not require the value
      of the SDID or AUID to match the identifier in any other message
      header field.  This requirement is, instead, an assessor policy
      issue.  The purpose of such a linkage would be to authenticate the
      value in that other header field.  This, in turn, is the basis for
      applying a trust assessment based on the identifier value.  Trust
      is a broad and complex topic and trust mechanisms are subject to
      highly creative attacks.  The real-world efficacy of any but the
      most basic bindings between the SDID or AUID and other identities
      is not well established, nor is its vulnerability to subversion by
      an attacker.  Hence, reliance on the use of such bindings should
      be strictly limited.  In particular, it is not at all clear to
      what extent a typical end-user recipient can rely on any
      assurances that might be made by successful use of the SDID or
      AUID.

      It is beyond the scope of this specification to describe what
      actions a verifier system should make, but an authenticated email
      presents an opportunity to a receiving system that unauthenticated
      email cannot.  Specifically, an authenticated email creates a
      predictable identifier by which other decisions can reliably be
      managed, such as trust and reputation.  Conversely,
      unauthenticated email lacks a reliable identifier that can be used
      to assign trust and reputation.

   This Update clarifies core details about DKIM's payload.  As such, it
   affects interoperability, semantic characterization, and the
   expectations for the identifiers carried with a DKIM signature.
   Clarification of these details is likely to limit misinterpretation
   of DKIM's semantics.  Since DKIM is fundamentally a security
   protocol, this should improve its security characteristics.
