                        DOCUMENTATION CONVENTIONS




This note is a revision of NWG/RFC 10, 16, and 24.

The Network Working Group consists of interested people from existing
or potential ARPA network sites.  Membership is not closed.

The Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software,
the strategies for using the network, and initial experience with the
network.

Documentation of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.  Notes
may be produced at any site by anybody and included in this series.


CONTENT

The content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related
to the HOST software or other aspect of the network.  Notes are
encouraged to be timely rather than polished.  Philosophical positions
without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions or
implementation techniques without introductory or background
explication, and explicit questions without any attempted answers are
all acceptable.  The minimum length for a NWG note is one sentence.

These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two
reasons.  First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as
ipso facto authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and
discussion of considerably less than authoritative ideas.  Second,
there is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we
hope to ease this inhibition.

FORM

Every NWG note should bear the following information:

        1.  "Network Working Group"
            "Request for Comments: X" (X underscored)
              where X is a serial number.  Serial numbers are assigned
              by Steve Crocker at UCLA.

        2.  Author and affiliation

        3.  Date

        4.  Title
            The title need not be unique.
