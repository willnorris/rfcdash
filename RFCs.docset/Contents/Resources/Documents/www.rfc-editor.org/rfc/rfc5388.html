Abstract

   This document describes a standard way to store the configuration and
   the results of traceroute measurements.  This document first
   describes the terminology used in this document and the traceroute
   tool itself; afterwards, the common information model is defined,
   dividing the information elements into two semantically separated
   groups (configuration elements and results elements).  Moreover, an
   additional element is defined to relate configuration elements and
   results elements by means of a common unique identifier.  On the
   basis of the information model, a data model based on XML is defined
   to store the results of traceroute measurements.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Traceroutes are used by lots of measurement efforts, either as
   independent measurements or as a means of getting path information to
   support other measurement efforts.  That is why there is the need to
   standardize the way the configuration and the results of traceroute
   measurements are stored.  The standard metrics defined by the IPPM
   group in matters of delay, connectivity, and losses do not apply to
   the metrics returned by the traceroute tool.  Therefore, in order to
   compare results of traceroute measurements, the only possibility is
   to add to the stored results a specification of the operating system
   as well as the name and version for the traceroute tool used.  This
   document, in order to store results of traceroute measurements and
   allow comparison of them, defines a standard way to store them using
   an XML schema.

   The document is organized as follows: <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> defines the
   terminology used in this document; <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> describes the traceroute
   tool; <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> describes the results of a traceroute measurement as
   displayed to the screen from which the traceroute tool was launched;
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> and <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>, respectively, describe the information model
   and data model for storing configuration and results of the
   traceroute measurements; <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> contains the XML schema to be used
   as a template for storing and/or exchanging traceroute measurement
   information; the document ends with security considerations and IANA
   considerations in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> and <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The terminology used in this document is defined as follows:

   o  traceroute tool: a software tool for network diagnostic that
      behaves as described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>;

   o  traceroute measurement: an instance of the traceroute tool
      launched, with specific configuration parameters (traceroute
      measurement configuration parameters), from a specific host
      (initiator of the traceroute measurement) giving as output
      specific traceroute measurement results;

   o  traceroute probe: one of many IP packets sent out by the
      traceroute tool during a traceroute measurement;

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5388">RFC 5388</a>               Traceroute Storage Format           December 2008</span>


   o  traceroute measurement configuration parameters: the configuration
      parameters of a traceroute measurement;

   o  traceroute measurement results: the results of a traceroute
      measurement;

   o  traceroute measurement information: both the results and the
      configuration parameters of a traceroute measurement;

   o  traceroute measurement path: a sequence of hosts transited in
      order by traceroute probes during a traceroute measurement.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20The%20Traceroute%20Tool%20and%20Its%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  The Traceroute Tool and Its Operations</span>

   Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to determine the hop-by-
   hop path from a source to a destination and the Round Trip Time (RTT)
   from the source to each hop.  Traceroute can be therefore used to
   discover some information (hop counts, delays, etc.) about the path
   between the initiator of the traceroute measurement and other hosts.

   Typically, the traceroute tool attempts to discover the path to a
   destination by sending UDP probes with specific time-to-live (TTL)
   values in the IP packet header and trying to elicit an ICMP
   TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to some host.

   In more detail, a first set of probes with TTL equal to 1 is sent by
   the traceroute tool from the host initiating the traceroute
   measurement (some tool implementations allow setting the initial TTL
   to a value equal to "n" different from 1, so that the first "n-1"
   hops are skipped and the first hop that will be traced is the "n-th"
   in the path).  Upon receiving a probe, the first hop host decreases
   the TTL value (by one or more).  By observing a TTL value equal to
   zero, the host rejects the probe and typically returns an ICMP
   message with a TIME_EXCEEDED value.  The traceroute tool can
   therefore derive the IP address of the first hop from the header of
   the ICMP message and evaluate the RTT between the host initiating the
   traceroute measurement and the first hop.  The next hops are
   discovered following the same procedure, taking care to increase at
   each step the TTL value of the probes by one.  The TTL value is
   increased until either an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message is received,
   meaning that the destination host has been reached, or the maximum
   configured number of hops has been hit.

   Some implementations use ICMP Echoes, instead of UDP datagrams.
   However, many routers do not return ICMP messages about ICMP
   messages, i.e., no ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED is returned for an ICMP Echo.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5388">RFC 5388</a>               Traceroute Storage Format           December 2008</span>


   Therefore, this document recommends to base implementations on UDP
   datagrams.  Considerations on TCP-based implementations of the
   traceroute tool are reported in <a href="#appendix-A.1">Appendix A.1</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Results%20of%20Traceroute%20Measurements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Results of Traceroute Measurements</span>

   The following list reports the information fields provided as results
   by all traceroute tool implementations considered.  The order in
   which they are reported here is not relevant and changes in different
   implementations.  For each hop, the following information is
   reported:

   o  the hop index;

   o  the host symbolic address, provided that at least one of the
      probes received a response, the symbolic address could be resolved
      at the corresponding host, and the option to display only
      numerical addresses was not set;

   o  the host IP address, provided that at least one of the probes
      received a response;

   o  the RTT for each response to a probe.

   Depending on the traceroute tool implementation, additional
   information might be displayed in the output (for instance, MPLS-
   related information).

   It might happen that some probes do not receive a response within the
   configured timeout (for instance, if the probe is filtered out by a
   firewall).  In this case, an "*" is displayed in place of the RTT.
   The information model reflects this using a string with the value of
   "RoundTripTimeNotAvailable", meaning either the probe was lost
   because of a timeout or it was not possible to transmit a probe.  It
   may also happen that some implementations print the same line
   multiple times when a router decreases the TTL by more than one, thus
   looking like multiple hops.  The information model is not impacted by
   this since each line is handled separately; it is left to the
   applications handling the XML file how to deal with it.  Moreover,
   for delays below 1 ms, some implementations report 0 ms (e.g., UNIX
   and LINUX), while WINDOWS reports "&lt; 1 ms".

   The information model is composed of information elements; for
   defining these information elements, a template is used.  Such
   template is specified in the list below:




<span class="grey">Niccolini, et al.           Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>

   o  name - A unique and meaningful name for the information element.
      The preferred spelling for the name is to use mixed case if the
      name is compound, with an initial lower-case letter, e.g.,
      "sourceIpAddress".

   o  description - The semantics of this information element.

   o  dataType - One of the types listed in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> of this document
      or in an extension of the information model.  The type space for
      attributes is constrained to facilitate implementation.

   o  units - If the element is a measure of some kind, the units
      identify what the measure is.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Data%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Data Types</span>

   This section describes the set of basic valid data types of the
   information model.

   o  string - The type "string" represents a finite-length string of
      valid characters from the Unicode character encoding set.  Unicode
      allows for ASCII and many other international character sets to be
      used.  It is expected that strings will be encoded in UTF-8
      format, which is identical in encoding for US-ASCII characters but
      which also accommodates other Unicode multi-byte characters.

   o  string255 - Same type as "string" but with the restriction of 255
      characters.

   o  inetAddressType - The type "inetAddressType" represents a type of
      Internet address.  The allowed values are imported from [<a href="./rfc4001" title='"Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses"'>RFC4001</a>]
      (where the intent was to import only some of the values);
      additional allowed values are "asnumber" and "noSpecification".

   o  inetAddress - The type "inetAddress" denotes a generic Internet
      address.  The allowed values are imported from [<a href="./rfc4001" title='"Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses"'>RFC4001</a>] (the
      values imported are unknown, ipv4, ipv6, and dns), while non-
      global IPv4/IPv6 addresses (e.g., ipv4z and ipv6z) are excluded;
      an additional allowed value is the AS number, indicated as the
      actual number plus the indication of how the mapping from IP
      address to AS number was performed.  "Unknown" is used to indicate
      an IP address that is not in one of the formats defined.

   o  ipASNumberMappingType - The type "ipASNumberMappingType"
      represents a type of mapping from IP to AS number, it indicates
      the method that was used to do get the mapping (allowed values are
      "bgptables", "routingregistries", "nslookup", "others" or
      "unknown").

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5388">RFC 5388</a>               Traceroute Storage Format           December 2008</span>


   o  boolean - The type "boolean" represents a boolean value according
      to XML standards [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028">W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028</a>].

   o  unsignedInt - The type "unsignedInt" represents a value in the
      range (0..4294967295).

   o  unsignedShort - The type "unsignedShort" represents a value in the
      range (0..65535).

   o  unsignedByte - The type "unsignedByte" represents a value in the
      range (0..255).

   o  u8nonzero - The type "u8nonzero" represents a value in the range
      (1..255).

   o  probesType - The type "probesType" represents a way of indicating
      the protocol used for the traceroute probes.  Values defined in
      this document are UDP, TCP, and ICMP.

   o  operationResponseStatus - The type "operationResponseStatus" is
      used to report the result of an operation.  The allowed values are
      imported from [<a href="./rfc4560" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Remote Ping, Traceroute, and Lookup Operations"'>RFC4560</a>].

   o  dateTime - The type "dateTime" represents a date-time
      specification according to XML standards
      [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028">W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028</a>] but is restricted to the values
      defined in [<a href="./rfc3339" title='"Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps"'>RFC3339</a>].

   This section describes the elements related to the storing of a
   traceroute measurement.  The elements are grouped in two groups
   (configuration and results) according to their semantics.  In order
   to relate configuration and results elements by means of a common
   unique identifier, an additional element is defined belonging to both
   groups.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.1.%20%20Relationships%20between%20the%20Information%20Elements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.1" id="section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  Relationships between the Information Elements</span>

   Every traceroute measurement is represented by an instance of the
   "traceRoute" element.  This class provides a standardized
   representation for traceroute measurement data.  The "traceroute"
   element is an element that can be composed of (depending on the
   nature of the traceroute measurement):

   o  1 optional "RequestMetadata" element;

   o  0..2147483647 "Measurement" elements.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5388">RFC 5388</a>               Traceroute Storage Format           December 2008</span>


   Each "Measurement" element contains:

   o  1 optional "MeasurementMetadata" element;

   o  0..2147483647 "MeasurementResult" elements.

   The "RequestMetadata" element can be used for specifying parameters
   of a traceroute measurement to be performed at one or more nodes by
   one or more traceroute implementations.  Depending on the
   capabilities of a traceroute implementation, not all requested
   parameters can be applied.  Which parameters have actually been
   applied for a specific traceroute measurement is specified in a
   "MeasurementMetadata" element.

   The "RequestMetadata" element is a sequence that contains:

   o  1 "TestName" element;

   o  1 optional "ToolVersion" element;

   o  1 optional "ToolName" element;

   o  1 "CtlTargetAddress" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlBypassRouteTable" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlProbeDataSize" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlTimeOut" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlProbesPerHop" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlPort" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlMaxTtl" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlDSField" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlSourceAddress" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlIfIndex" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlMiscOptions" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlMaxFailures" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlDontFragment" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlInitialTtl" element;

   o  1 optional "CtlDescr" element;

   o  1 "CtlType" element.

   If the "RequestMetadata" element is omitted from an XML file, it
   means that the traceroute measurement configuration parameters
   requested were all used and the "MeasurementMetadata" element lists
   them in detail.

   The "MeasurementMetadata" element is a sequence that contains:

   o  1 "TestName" element;

   o  1 "OSName" element;

   o  1 "OSVersion" element;

   o  1 "ToolVersion" element;

   o  1 "ToolName" element;

   Configuration information elements can describe not just traceroute
   measurements that have already happened ("MeasurementMetadata"
   elements), but also the configuration to be used when requesting a
   measurement to be made ("RequestMetadata" element).  This is quite
   different semantically, even if the individual information elements
   are similar.  Due to this similarity, both "RequestMetadata" and
   "MeasurementMetadata" are represented by the same type in the XML
   schema.  All elements that are missing from the "RequestMetadata" or
   marked as optional in the "RequestMetadata" but mandatory in the
   "MeasurementMetadata" must be specified as empty elements.
   Specifying them as empty elements means use the default value.  The
   "CtlType" element could have been optional in the "RequestMetadata",
   but since default values cannot be specified for complex types in an
   XML schema, the element is mandatory in the "RequestMetadata".

   The "MeasurementResult" element is a sequence that contains:

   o  1 "TestName" element;

   o  1 "ResultsStartDateAndTime" element;

   o  1 "ResultsIpTgtAddrType" element;

   o  1 "ResultsIpTgtAddr" element;

   o  1 "ProbeResults" elements;

   o  1 "ResultsEndDateAndTime" element.

   Additionally, it is important to say that each "ProbeResults" element
   is a sequence that contains:

   o  1..255 "hop" elements.

   Each "hop" element is a sequence that contains:

   o  1..10 "probe" elements;

   o  1 optional "HopRawOutputData" element.

   Each "probe" element contains:

   o  1 "HopAddrType" element;

   o  1 "HopAddr" element;

   o  1 optional "HopName" element;

   o  0..255 optional "MPLSLabelStackEntry" elements;

   o  1 "ProbedRoundTripTime" element;

   o  1 "ResponseStatus" element;

   o  1 "Time" element.

   Different numbers of appearances of the three basic elements in the
   XML file are meant for different scopes:

   o  a file with only 1 "RequestMetadata" element represents a file
      containing the traceroute measurement configuration parameters of
      a traceroute measurement; it can be used to distribute the
      traceroute measurement configuration parameters over multiple
      nodes asked to run the same traceroute measurement;

   o  a file with 1 "Measurement" element containing 1
      "MeasurementMetadata" and 1 "MeasurementResult" element represents
      a file containing the traceroute measurement information of a
      traceroute measurement;

   o  a file with 1 "Measurement" element containing 1
      "MeasurementMetadata" and n "MeasurementResult" elements
      represents a file containing the traceroute measurement
      information of a set of traceroute measurements run over different
      times with always the same traceroute measurement configuration
      parameters;

   o  a file with 1 "RequestMetadata" and 1 "Measurement" element
      containing 1 "MeasurementMetadata" and 1 "Measurement" element
      represents a file containing the traceroute measurement
      information of a traceroute measurement (containing both the
      requested traceroute measurement configuration parameters and the
      ones actually used);

   o  other combinations are possible to store multiple traceroute
      measurements all in one XML file.

   For storing and transmitting information according to the information
   model defined in the previous section, a data model is required that
   specifies how to encode the elements of the information model.

   There are several design choices for a data model.  It can use a
   binary or textual representation and it can be defined from scratch
   or use already existing frameworks and data models.  In general, the
   use of already existing frameworks and models should be preferred.

   Binary and textual representations both have advantages and
   disadvantages.  Textual representations are (with some limitations)
   human-readable, while a binary representation consumes less resources
   for storing, transmitting, and parsing data.

   An already existing and closely related data model is the DISMAN-
   TRACEROUTE-MIB module [<a href="./rfc4560" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Remote Ping, Traceroute, and Lookup Operations"'>RFC4560</a>], which specifies a Structure of
   Management Information version 2 (SMIv2) encoding [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>],
   [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>], and [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>] for transmitting traceroute measurement
   information (configuration and results).  This data model is well
   suited and supported within network management systems, but as a
   general format for storing and transmitting traceroute results, it is
   not easily applicable.

   Another binary representation would be an extension of traffic-flow
   information encodings as specified for the IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) protocol [<a href="./rfc5101" title='"Specification of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol for the Exchange of IP Traffic Flow Information"'>RFC5101</a>], [<a href="./rfc5102" title='"Information Model for IP Flow Information Export"'>RFC5102</a>].  The IPFIX protocol is
   extensible.  However, the architecture behind this protocol [<a href="#ref-IPFIX" title='"Architecture for IP Flow Information Export"'>IPFIX</a>]
   is targeted at exporting passively measured flow information.
   Therefore, some obstacles are expected when trying to use it for
   transmitting traceroute measurement information.

   For textual representations, using the eXtensible Markup Language
   (XML) [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-xml-20060816">W3C.REC-xml-20060816</a>] is an obvious choice.  XML supports
   clean structuring of data and syntax checking of records.  With some

   limitations, it is human-readable.  It is supported well by a huge
   pool of tools and standards for generating, transmitting, parsing,
   and converting it to other data formats.  Its disadvantages are the
   resource consumption for processing, storing, and transmitting
   information.  Since the expected data volumes related to traceroute
   measurement in network operation and maintenance are not expected to
   be extremely high, the inefficient usage of resources is not a
   significant disadvantage.  Therefore, XML was chosen as a basis for
   the traceroute measurement information model that is specified in
   this memo.

   <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> contains the XML schema to be used as a template for
   storing and/or exchanging traceroute measurement information.  The
   schema was designed in order to use an extensible approach based on
   templates (pretty similar to how the IPFIX protocol is designed)
   where the traceroute configuration elements (both the requested
   parameters, "RequestMetadata", and the actual parameters used,
   "MeasurementMetadata") are metadata to be referenced by results
   information elements (data) by means of the "TestName" element (used
   as a unique identifier, chosen in accordance to the specification of
   [<a href="./rfc4560" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Remote Ping, Traceroute, and Lookup Operations"'>RFC4560</a>]).  Currently Open Grid Forum (OGF) is also using this
   approach and cross-requirements have been analyzed.  As a result of
   this analysis, the XML schema contained in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> is compatible
   with the OGF schema since both were designed in a way that limits the
   unnecessary redundancy and a simple one-to-one transformation between
   the two exists.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20XML%20Schema%20for%20Traceroute%20Measurements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  XML Schema for Traceroute Measurements</span>

   This section presents the XML schema to be used as a template for
   storing and/or exchanging traceroute measurement information.  The
   schema uses UTF-8 encoding as defined in [<a href="./rfc3629" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>RFC3629</a>].  In documents
   conforming to the format presented here, an XML declaration SHOULD be
   present specifying the version and the character encoding of the XML
   document.  The document should be encoded using UTF-8.  Since some of
   the strings can span multiple lines, [<a href="./rfc5198" title='"Unicode Format for Network Interchange"'>RFC5198</a>] applies.  XML
   processing instructions and comments MUST be ignored.  Mind that
   whitespace is significant in XML when writing documents conforming to
   this schema.  Documents using the presented format must be valid
   according to the XML schema shown in this section.  Since elements of
   type "_CtlType" may contain elements from unknown namespaces, those
   elements MUST be ignored if their namespace is unknown to the
   processor.  Values for elements using the XML schema type "dateTime"
   MUST be restricted to values defined in [<a href="./rfc3339" title='"Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps"'>RFC3339</a>].  Future versions
   of this format MAY extend this schema by creating a new schema that
   redefines all or some of the data types and elements defined in this
   version or by establishing a complete new schema.

   Security considerations discussed in this section are grouped into
   considerations related to conducting traceroute measurements and
   considerations related to storing and transmitting traceroute
   measurement information.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5388">RFC 5388</a>               Traceroute Storage Format           December 2008</span>


   This memo does not specify an implementation of a traceroute tool.
   Neither does it specify a certain procedure for storing traceroute
   measurement information.  Still, it is considered desirable to
   discuss related security issues below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.1.%20%20Conducting%20Traceroute%20Measurements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" id="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Conducting Traceroute Measurements</span>

   Conducting Internet measurements can raise both security and privacy
   concerns.  Traceroute measurements, in which traffic is injected into
   the network, can be abused for denial-of-service attacks disguised as
   legitimate measurement activity.

   Measurement parameters MUST be carefully selected so that the
   measurements inject trivial amounts of additional traffic into the
   networks they measure.  If they inject "too much" traffic, they can
   skew the results of the measurement, and in extreme cases cause
   congestion and denial of service.

   The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving
   measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic, or by
   an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic.  If routers can
   recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the
   measurements will not reflect actual user traffic.  If an attacker
   injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss
   rate will be artificially lowered.  Therefore, the measurement
   methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the
   probability that measurement traffic can be distinguished from
   "normal" traffic.

   Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used
   where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.2.%20%20Securing%20Traceroute%20Measurement%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" id="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Securing Traceroute Measurement Information</span>

   Traceroute measurement information is not considered highly
   sensitive.  Still, it may contain sensitive information on network
   paths, routing states, used IP addresses, and roundtrip times that
   operators of networks may want to protect for business or security
   reasons.

   It is thus important to control access to information acquired by
   conducting traceroute measurements, particularly when transmitting it
   over a networks but also when storing it.  It is RECOMMENDED that a
   transmission of traceroute measurement information over a network
   uses appropriate protection mechanisms for preserving privacy,
   integrity, and authenticity.  It is further RECOMMENDED that secure
   authentication and authorization are used for protecting stored
   traceroute measurement information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Traceroute%20Default%20Configuration%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Traceroute Default Configuration Parameters</span>

   This section lists traceroute measurement configuration parameters as
   well as their defaults on various platforms and illustrates how
   widely they may vary.  This document considers four major traceroute
   tool implementations and compares them based on configurable
   parameters and default values.  The LINUX (SUSE 9.1), BSD (FreeBSD
   7.0), and UNIX (SunOS 5.9) implementations are based on UDP
   datagrams, while the WINDOWS (XP SP2) one uses ICMP Echoes.  The
   comparison is summarized in the following table, where an N/A in the
   option column means that such parameter is not configurable for the
   specific implementation.  A comprehensive comparison of available
   implementations is outside the scope of this document; however, by
   sampling a few different implementations, it can be observed that
   they can differ quite significantly in terms of configurable
   parameters and also default values.  Note that in the following table
   only those options that are available in at least two of the
   considered implementations are reported.

   As stated above, the widespread use of firewalls might prevent UDP-
   or ICMP-based traceroutes to completely trace the path to a
   destination since traceroute probes might end up being filtered.  In
   some cases, such limitation might be overcome by sending instead TCP
   packets to specific ports that hosts located behind the firewall are
   listening for connections on.  TCP-based implementations use TCP,
   SYN, or FIN probes and listen for TIME_EXCEEDED messages, TCP RESET,
   and other messages from firewalls and gateways on the path.  On the
   other hand, some firewalls filter out TCP SYN packets to prevent
   denial-of-service attacks; therefore, the actual advantage of using
   TCP instead of UDP traceroute depends mainly on firewall
   configurations, which are not known in advance.  A detailed analysis
   of TCP-based traceroute tools and measurements is outside the scope
   of this document; regardless, for completeness reasons, the
   information model also supports the storing of TCP-based traceroute
   measurements.

      Metrics

   Because of implementation choices, a known inconsistency exists
   between the round-trip delay metric defined by the IPPM working group
   in <a href="./rfc2681">RFC 2681</a> and the results returned by the current traceroute tool
   implementations.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the traceroute
   tool implementations will implement the standard definition in the
   near future.  The only possibility is therefore to compare results of
   different traceroute measurements with each other; in order to do
   this, specifications both of the operating system (name and version)
   and of the traceroute tool version used were added to the metadata
   elements in order to help in comparing metrics between two different
   traceroute measurement results (if run using the same operating
   system and the same version of the tool).  Moreover, the traceroute
   tool has built-in configurable mechanisms like timeouts and can
   experience problems related to the crossing of firewalls; therefore,
   some of the packets that traceroute sends out end up being timeout or
   filtered.  As a consequence, it might not be possible to trace the
   path to a node or there might not be a complete enough set of probes
   describing the RTT to reach it.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20C.%20%20Differences%20to%20DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C" id="appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.  Differences to DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB</span>

   For performing remote traceroute operations at managed node, the IETF
   has standardized the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module in [<a href="./rfc4560" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Remote Ping, Traceroute, and Lookup Operations"'>RFC4560</a>].  This
   module allows:

   o  retrieving capability information of the traceroute tool
      implementation at the managed node;

   o  configuring traceroute measurements to be performed;

   o  retrieving information about ongoing and completed traceroute
      measurements;

   o  retrieving traceroute measurement statistics.

   The traceroute storage format described in this document has
   significant overlaps with this MIB module.  Particularly, the models
   for the traceroute measurement configuration and for the results from
   completed measurements are almost identical.  But for other parts of
   the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE MIB module there is no need to model them in a
   traceroute measurement storage format.  Particularly, the capability
   information, information about ongoing measurements, and measurement
   statistics are not covered by the DISMAN traceroute storage model.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5388">RFC 5388</a>               Traceroute Storage Format           December 2008</span>


   Concerning traceroute measurements and their results, there are
   structural differences between the two models caused by the different
   choices for the encoding of the specification.  For DISMAN-
   TRACEROUTE-MIB, the Structure of Management Information (SMIv2, STD
   58, <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>]) was used, while the IPPM traceroute
   measurement data model is encoded using XML.

   This difference in structure implies that the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB
   module contains SMI-specific information elements (managed objects)
   that concern tables of managed objects (specification, entry creation
   and deletion, status retrieval) that are not required for the XML-
   encoded traceroute measurement data model.

   But for most of the remaining information elements that concern
   configuration of traceroute measurements and results of completed
   measurements, the semantics are identical between the DISMAN-
   TRACEROUTE-MIB module and the traceroute measurement data model.
   There are very few exceptions to this; these are listed below.  Also,
   naming of information elements is identical between both models with
   a few exceptions.  For the traceroute measurement data model, a few
   information elements have been added, some because of the different
   structure and some to provide additional information on completed
   measurements.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/C.1.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C.1" id="appendix-C.1">C.1</a>.  Scope</span>

   There are some basic differences in nature and application between
   MIB modules and XML documents.  This results in two major differences
   of scope between the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module and the traceroute
   measurement data model.

   The first difference is the "traceRouteResultsTable" contained in the
   DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module.  This table allows online observation
   of status and progress of an ongoing traceroute measurement.  This
   highly dynamic information is not included in the traceroute
   measurement data model because it has not been envisioned to use the
   model for dynamically reporting progress of individual traceroute
   measurements.  The traceroute measurement data model is rather
   intended to be used for reporting completed traceroute measurements.

   The second difference is due to the fact that information in a MIB is
   typically tied to a local node hosting the MIB instance.  The
   "RequestMetadata" element specified in the traceroute measurement
   data model can be used for specifying a measurement request that may
   be applied to several probes in a network.  This concept does not
   exist in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module.





<span class="grey">Niccolini, et al.           Standards Track                    [Page 48]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-49"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5388">RFC 5388</a>               Traceroute Storage Format           December 2008</span>


   For the remaining elements in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module and in
   the traceroute measurement data model, there is a very good match
   between the two worlds.  The "traceRouteCtlTable" corresponds to the
   "MeasurementMetadata" element, and the combination of the
   "traceRouteProbeHistoryTable" and the "traceRouteHopsTable"
   corresponds to a collection of "MeasurementResult" elements.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/C.2.%20%20Naming"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C.2" id="appendix-C.2">C.2</a>.  Naming</span>

   Basically, names in both models are chosen using the same naming
   conventions.

   For the traceroute measurement configuration information, all names,
   such as "CtlProbesPerHop", are identical in both models except for
   the traceRoute prefix that was removed to avoid unnecessary
   redundancy in the XML file and for "CtlDataSize", which was renamed
   to "CtlProbeDataSize" for clarification in the traceroute measurement
   data model.

   Results of measurements in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB modules are
   distributed over two tables, the "traceRouteResultsTable" contains
   mainly information about ongoing measurements and the
   "traceRouteProbeHistoryTable" contains only information about
   completed measurements.  According to the SMIv2 naming conventions,
   names of information elements in these tables have different prefixes
   ("traceRouteResults" and "traceRouteProbeHistory").  Since the
   traceroute measurement data model only reports on completed
   measurements, this separation is not needed anymore and the prefix
   "Results" is used for all related information elements.

   Beyond that, there are only a few changes in element names.  The
   renaming actions include:

   o  "traceRouteProbeHistoryResponse" to "ProbeRoundTripTime";

   o  "traceRouteProbeHistoryHAddr" to "HopAddr";

   o  "traceRouteProbeHistoryTime" to "ResultsEndDateAndTime";

   o  "traceRouteProbeHistoryLastRC" to "ResultsHopRawOutputData".

   The semantics were changed for two information elements only.

   For "traceRouteProbeHistoryResponse" in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB, a
   value of 0 indicates that it is not possible to transmit a probe.
   For the traceroute measurement data model, a value of 0 for element



<span class="grey">Niccolini, et al.           Standards Track                    [Page 49]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-50"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5388">RFC 5388</a>               Traceroute Storage Format           December 2008</span>


   "RoundTripTime" indicates that the measured time was less than one
   millisecond.  For the case that it was not possible to transmit a
   probe, a string is used that indicates the problem.

   For "traceRouteCtlIfIndex" in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB, a value of 0
   indicates that the option to set the index is not available.  This
   was translated to the traceroute measurement data model, such that a
   value of 0 for this element indicates that the used interface is
   unknown.

   The element "traceRouteProbeHistoryLastRC" in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-
   MIB was replaced by element "ResultsHopRawOutputData".  While
   "traceRouteProbeHistoryLastRC" just reports a reply code,
   "ResultsHopRawOutputData" reports the full raw output data (per hop)
   produced by the traceroute measurement that was used.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/C.4.%20%20Additional%20Information%20Elements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C.4" id="appendix-C.4">C.4</a>.  Additional Information Elements</span>

   Only a few information elements have been added to the model of the
   DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module.

   o  For providing information on the MPLS label stack entries of a
      probe in the traceroute measurement path, "MPLSLabelStackEntry"
      was added.

   o  For providing additional timestamp beyond "ResultsEndDateAndTime",
      "ResultsStartDateAndTime" and "Time" were added.

   o  For providing DNS names at the time of the execution of the
      traceroute for each "HopAddr" (which may change over time),
      "HopName" was added.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20D.%20%20Traceroute%20Examples%20with%20XML%20Representation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-D" id="appendix-D">Appendix D</a>.  Traceroute Examples with XML Representation</span>

   This section shows some examples of traceroute applications.  In
   addition, the encoding of requests and results is shown for some of
   those examples.  Also, note that in these XML examples some lines
   appear wrapped due to the limited length of line.

   A typical traceroute on a LINUX system looks like the following:
   # traceroute  -f 4 www.example 1500
   traceroute to ww.example (192.0.2.42), 30 hops max, 1500-byte packets
    5  out.host1.example (192.0.2.254)  6.066 ms   5.625 ms   6.095 ms

   This traceroute ignores the first 4 hops and uses 1500-byte packets
   including the header.  It does not reach its goal since the last
   listed hop says that the network is not reachable (N!).  The XML

   The third and last example is based on the Microsoft Windows pendant
   of traceroute.  On an MS Windows system, the command is called
   "tracert" and typically looks as follows:

   # tracert -h 10 www.example.org

   Tracing route to www.example.org [192.0.2.11]
   over a maximum of 10 hops:

     1     1 ms     1 ms     8 ms  192.0.2.99

   The three examples given in this section are intended to give an
   impression of how a trace could be represented in XML.  The
   representation generated by an implementation may differ from the
   examples here depending on the system and the capabilities of the
   traceroute implementation.
