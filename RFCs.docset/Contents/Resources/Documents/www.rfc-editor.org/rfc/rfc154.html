As a pedagogical device for describing functions such as the one
below

           |                  +-----------------
           |                 /:
           |                / :
           |               /  :
           |              /   :

      -----+------------------------------------
           |                  a
           |

where two formulae, f1 and f2, are necessary for adjoining domains but
the function is continous at the boundary point, I usually write the
description in the form

        f(x) = f1(x) for x =&lt; a
        f(x) = f2(x) for x &gt;= a

The astute reader will note that the domains overlap, but that
f1(a) = f2(a), so no semantic ambiguity obtains.
