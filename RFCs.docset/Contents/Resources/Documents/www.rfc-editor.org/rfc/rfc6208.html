<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI) [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>], developed by the
   Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA), is the functional
   interface that applications will use to create, retrieve, update, and
   delete data elements from the cloud.  As part of this interface, the
   client will be able to discover the capabilities of the cloud storage
   offering and use this interface to manage containers and the data
   that is placed in them.  In addition, metadata can be set on
   containers and their contained data elements through this interface.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Requirements%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Requirements Language</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Cloud%20Data%20Management%20Domain%20and%20Its%20Relevance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Cloud Data Management Domain and Its Relevance</span>

   A storage cloud is a storage service hosted either on premise or off
   premise, across a network.  An important part of the cloud model, in
   general, is the concept of a pool of resources that are drawn from,
   on demand, in small increments (smaller than what one would typically
   purchase by buying equipment).  By abstracting data storage behind a
   set of service interfaces and delivering it on demand, a wide range
   of actual offerings and implementations are possible.  The only type
   of storage that is excluded from this definition is that which is
   delivered based on fixed capacity increments rather than on demand.

   The CDMI defines a set of functional interfaces (data paths) and
   management interfaces (control paths) to create, retrieve, update,
   and delete data elements from a storage cloud.  Another important
   concept in this standard is that of metadata.  When managing large
   amounts of data with differing requirements, metadata is a convenient
   mechanism to express those requirements in such a way that underlying
   data services can differentiate their treatment of the data to meet
   those requirements.  CDMI also defines an extensible metadata system
   for storage clouds.

   As part of the CDMI interface, the client will be able to discover
   the capabilities of the cloud storage offering and to use this
   interface to manage containers and the data that is placed in them.
   In addition, system metadata can be added to containers and their
   contained data elements through this interface.

   The hierarchy that CDMI defines is as follows:

   o  The basic element of storage is an object.

   o  Objects are stored in a container hierarchy.

   o  CDMI also defines an object, called a queue, which has special
      properties for in-order, first-in, first-out creation and fetching
      of queue objects, similar to a container of data objects.

   o  A cloud offering can also support domains, which allow
      administrative ownership to be associated with stored objects.
      Domains can also be hierarchical, allowing for corporate domains
      with multiple children domains for departments or individuals.
      The domain concept is also used to map Access Control Lists (ACLs)
      to principals as well as to aggregate usage data that is used to
      bill, meter, and monitor cloud usage.  (Note: The CDMI "domain"
      defined here is not a DNS domain name as specified in [<a href="./rfc1076" title='"HEMS monitoring and control language"'>RFC1076</a>]
      and [<a href="./rfc1024" title='"HEMS variable definitions"'>RFC1024</a>]).

   o  Finally, a capabilities resource and associated URI [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>]
      allows a client to discover the capabilities of the offering and
      its implementation of CDMI.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Processing%20Guidelines"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Processing Guidelines</span>

   This section summarizes the processing of each media type.  This
   document provides only the essential information.  The CDMI
   specification [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>], which has more details and appropriate
   examples, is the final authority on the processing aspects.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Media%20Type%3A%20application%2Fcdmi-object"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Media Type: application/cdmi-object</span>

   A CDMI object is the basic storage element in a CDMI system and is
   analogous to a file within a filesystem.  The object is represented
   in the CDMI interface in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format
   [<a href="./rfc4627" title='"The application/json Media Type for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)"'>RFC4627</a>].  (See the JSON web site at [<a href="#ref-JSON-1" title='"Introducing JSON"'>JSON-1</a>] for general
   information about JSON).  Each data object has a set of well-defined
   fields that includes a single value and optional metadata.  The
   implementations are free to store the data in any form they choose,
   but the application/cdmi-object SHOULD be represented in the CDMI
   interface as defined in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> of the CDMI specification [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Media%20Type%3A%20application%2Fcdmi-container"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Media Type: application/cdmi-container</span>

   A container object is the fundamental grouping of stored data within
   CDMI and is analogous to a directory within a filesystem.  Each
   container has zero or more child objects and a set of well-defined



<span class="grey">Sankar &amp; Jones                Informational                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6208">RFC 6208</a>                    CDMI Media Types                  April 2011</span>


   fields that includes standardized and custom metadata.  A container
   can include other containers similar to sub-directories in a
   filesystem.  The implementations are free to represent the container
   in any form they choose, but the application/cdmi-container SHOULD be
   represented in the CDMI interface as defined in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> of the CDMI
   specification [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Media%20Type%3A%20application%2Fcdmi-domain"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Media Type: application/cdmi-domain</span>

   Domain objects represent the concept of administrative ownership of
   stored data within a CDMI storage system.  A CDMI offering may
   include a hierarchy of domains that provide access to domain-related
   information within a CDMI context.  This domain hierarchy is a series
   of CDMI objects that correspond to parent and child domains, with
   each domain corresponding to logical groupings of objects that are to
   be managed together.  <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> of the CDMI specification [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>]
   details the information content, representation, and processing of
   domain objects.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Media%20Type%3A%20application%2Fcdmi-capability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Media Type: application/cdmi-capability</span>

   Capability objects form a special class of container objects that
   allows a CDMI client to discover what subset of the CDMI standard is
   implemented by a CDMI provider.  For each URI in a CDMI system, the
   set of interactions that the system is capable of performing against
   that URI is described by the presence of named "capabilities".  Each
   capability present for a given URI indicates what functionality the
   cloud storage system will allow against that URI.  Capabilities are
   always static.  <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a> of the CDMI specification [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>] details
   the representation and processing of capability objects.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.5.%20%20Media%20Type%3A%20application%2Fcdmi-queue"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" id="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Media Type: application/cdmi-queue</span>

   Queues are a special class of container object and are used to
   provide first-in, first-out access when storing and retrieving data.
   A queue writer PUTs objects in the queue, and a queue reader GETs
   objects from the queue, acknowledging the receipt of the last object
   that it received.  Queuing provides a simple mechanism for one or
   more writers to send data to a single reader in a reliable way.  If
   queues are supported by the cloud storage system, cloud clients
   create the queue objects by using the same mechanism used to create
   data objects.  <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a> of the CDMI specification [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>] details
   the operations and processing of queue objects.

   The CDMI operates over HTTP [<a href="./rfc2616" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>] and does not make sense outside

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This section was developed with <a href="./rfc3552">RFC 3552</a> [<a href="./rfc3552" title='"Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations"'>RFC3552</a>] as a guide.  CDMI
   is an application interface and the relevant security considerations
   include confidentiality, integrity, access control, and audit.
   Transport and endpoint security artifacts like Distributed Denial of
   Service (DDoS) are orthogonal, and domains like non-repudiation are
   left to the application that employs this interface.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20Confidentiality%20and%20Integrity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Confidentiality and Integrity</span>

   The confidentiality and integrity of the CDMI exchanges are
   determined by the application that uses the interface.  CDMI does not
   contain any specific mechanisms and relies on transport mechanisms
   such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) (see [<a href="./rfc2818" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>RFC2818</a>]) for
   confidentiality and integrity of the messages across the network.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20Access%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Access Control</span>

   The access control of the CDMI endpoint URLs are beyond this
   specification.  If required, applications should use appropriate URL
   authentication and authorization techniques, such as URI routers for
   different classes of users and restrict access based on URI origin.

   For fine-grained control of the CDMI objects, the CDMI specification
   [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>] contains the Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Access Control
   Entries (ACEs).  These are described fully in <a href="#section-16.1">Section 16.1</a> of the
   CDMI specification [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.3.%20%20Audit"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" id="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Audit</span>

   The CDMI specification [<a href="#ref-CDMI-1" title='"Cloud Data Management Interface Version 1.0"'>CDMI-1</a>] has defined a set of metadata fields,
   as explained in <a href="#section-16.3">Section 16.3</a>, to facilitate the incorporation of
   access and other audit markers.  The CDMI metadata system is
   extensible, and the implementations can add more metadata as required
   by the security posture of the domain.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.4.%20%20JSON%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.4" id="section-6.4">6.4</a>.  JSON Security Considerations</span>

   JSON-related security considerations, described in <a href="./rfc4627">RFC 4627</a>
   [<a href="./rfc4627" title='"The application/json Media Type for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)"'>RFC4627</a>], apply.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.5.%20%20Executable%2FActive%20Content"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.5" id="section-6.5">6.5</a>.  Executable/Active Content</span>

   The CDMI interface does not include any directives for active
   content.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Acknowledgements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Acknowledgements</span>

   The authors wish to acknowledge the guidance and wisdom of Mark
   Carlson and Peter Saint-Andre, comments from Patrick Faltstrom, and
   all the insightful discussions and ideas of the SNIA CDMI Cloud
   Technical Work Group.
