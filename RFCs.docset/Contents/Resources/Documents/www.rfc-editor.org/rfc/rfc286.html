                   <span class="h1">Network Library Information System</span>

        Georgetown University is designing a Learning Resource Center
   (LRC), part of which may consist of a system to enable computer query
   (hopefully on-line) of G.U.'s Library holdings.  The ARPA community
   might be of assistance in either of two ways:

        1.  One or more organizations may have a Library Retrieval
            System that they would like to share with Georgetown.

        2.  Since there probably are needs for such a system at most
            organizations, and since it would be highly beneficial
            for one organization to be able to query other library
            holdings as well, and subsequently arrange for inter-
            library loans, the ARPA community might undertake to
            design a Network Library Information System.

        If sufficient interest in such a system exists, a working group
   could be set up to establish the necessary protocols and iron out
   details of the system.

        It is probable that the NIC could provide valuable inputs to such
   an undertaking and perhaps would serve as a focal point for the system
   design and operation.

        Please contact me if either:

        1.  You have, or know of a Library Retrieval System that
            can be shared with Georgetown University,

        2.  Your organization is interested in participating in a
            Network Library Retrieval System, or

        3.  You are interested in participating in designing such a
            system.
