                  <span class="h1">the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)</span>

Abstract

   This document describes the requirements for using the Generic
   Associated Channel Label (GAL) in pseudowires (PWs) in MPLS Transport
   Profile (MPLS-TP) networks, and provides an update to the description
   of GAL usage in <a href="./rfc5586">RFC 5586</a> by removing the restriction that is imposed
   on using GAL for PWs, especially in MPLS-TP environments.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5586">RFC5586</a>] generalizes the Associated Channel mechanism of [<a href="./rfc5085" title='"Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV): A Control Channel for Pseudowires"'>RFC5085</a>]
   to be used for Sections, Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and Pseudowires
   (PWs) in MPLS networks.  [<a href="./rfc5085" title='"Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV): A Control Channel for Pseudowires"'>RFC5085</a>] defines the Associated Channel
   Header (ACH), and [<a href="./rfc5586" title='"MPLS Generic Associated Channel"'>RFC5586</a>] generalizes this for use as the Generic
   Associated Channel (G-ACh).

   [<a id="ref-RFC5586">RFC5586</a>] defines a generalized label-based exception mechanism using
   the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) to work together with the
   ACH for use with LSPs but prohibits GAL usage with PWs.

   This document removes the restriction imposed by [<a href="./rfc5586" title='"MPLS Generic Associated Channel"'>RFC5586</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20GAL%20Usage%20for%20MPLS-TP%20PW"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  GAL Usage for MPLS-TP PW</span>

   According to the MPLS-TP requirements document [<a href="./rfc5654" title='"Requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile"'>RFC5654</a>], it is
   necessary that MPLS-TP mechanisms and capabilities be able to
   interoperate with the existing IETF MPLS [<a href="./rfc3031" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>RFC3031</a>] and IETF PWE3
   [<a href="./rfc3985" title='"Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture"'>RFC3985</a>] architectures as appropriate.  [<a href="./rfc5586" title='"MPLS Generic Associated Channel"'>RFC5586</a>] differentiates
   between the usage of the GAL with PWs in MPLS and MPLS-TP
   environments in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> as follows:

      In MPLS-TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G-ACh on LSPs,
      Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and MUST NOT be
      used with PWs.

   This indicates that the GAL can be used for MPLS-TP LSPs and
   Sections, but not for PWs in an MPLS-TP network.

   However, there is no restriction imposed on the usage of the GAL in
   MPLS PWs, which is described immediately afterwards in the same
   section (<a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>) of [<a href="./rfc5586" title='"MPLS Generic Associated Channel"'>RFC5586</a>]:

      However, in other MPLS environments, this document places no
      restrictions on where the GAL may appear within the label stack or
      its use with PWs.

   The inconsistency between the usage of the GAL with MPLS PWs and
   MPLS-TP PWs may cause unnecessary implementation differences and is
   in disagreement with the MPLS-TP requirements.

   Therefore, this document specifies that the GAL can be used with
   packets on a G-ACh on LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, Sections,
   and PWs in both MPLS and MPLS-TP environments without discrimination.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6423">RFC 6423</a>                 Using GAL in MPLS-TP PW           November 2011</span>


   [<a id="ref-RFC5586">RFC5586</a>] is updated by removing the restrictions on using GAL for PW
   as follows:

   -  <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> (Introduction) in [<a href="./rfc5586" title='"MPLS Generic Associated Channel"'>RFC5586</a>], the original text:

         The GAL mechanism is defined to work together with the ACH for
         LSPs and MPLS Sections.

      is replaced by:

         The GAL mechanism is defined to work together with the ACH for
         LSPs and MPLS Sections, and for PWs.

   -  <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.  (GAL Applicability and Usage) in [<a href="./rfc5586" title='"MPLS Generic Associated Channel"'>RFC5586</a>], the
      original text:

         In MPLS-TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G-ACh on
         LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and
         MUST NOT be used with PWs.  It MUST always be at the bottom of
         the label stack (i.e., S bit set to 1).  However, in other MPLS
         environments, this document places no restrictions on where the
         GAL may appear within the label stack or its use with PWs.

      is replaced by:

         In MPLS-TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G-ACh on
         LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and MAY
         be used with PWs.  The presence of a GAL indicates that an ACH
         immediately follows the MPLS label stack.
