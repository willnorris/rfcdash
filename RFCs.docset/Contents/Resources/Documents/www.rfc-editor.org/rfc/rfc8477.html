<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  The investigated topics often require coordinated
   efforts from many organizations and industry bodies to improve an
   identified problem.  One of the targets of the workshops is to
   establish communication between relevant organizations, especially
   when the topics are out of the scope of the Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF).  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
   groups of the IETF.

   With the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), interoperability
   becomes more and more important.  Standards Developing Organizations
   (SDOs) have done a tremendous amount of work to standardize new
   protocols and profile existing protocols.

   At the application layer and at the level of solution frameworks,
   interoperability is not yet mature.  Particularly, the work on data
   formats (in the form of data models and information models) has not
   seen the same level of consistency throughout SDOs.

   One common problem is the lack of an encoding-independent
   standardization of the information, the so-called information model.
   Another problem is the strong relationship between data formats and
   the underlying communication architecture, such as a design in Remote
   Procedure Call (RPC) style or a RESTful design (where REST refers to
   Representational State Transfer).  Furthermore, groups develop
   solutions that are very similar on the surface but differ slightly in
   their standardized outcome, leading to interoperability problems.
   Finally, some groups favor different encodings for use with various
   application-layer protocols.

   Thus, the IAB decided to organize a workshop to reach out to relevant
   stakeholders to explore the state of the art and identify commonality
   and gaps [<a href="#ref-IOTSIAG" title='"IoT Semantic Interoperability Workshop Agenda"'>IOTSIAG</a>] [<a href="#ref-IOTSIWS" title='"IoT Semantic Interoperability Workshop 2016"'>IOTSIWS</a>].  In particular, the IAB was interested
   to learn about the following aspects:

   o  What is the state of the art in data and information models?  What
      should an information model look like?

   o  What is the role of formal languages, such as schema languages, in
      describing information and data models?

   o  What is the role of metadata, which is attached to data to make it
      self-describing?

   o  How can we achieve interoperability when different organizations,
      companies, and individuals develop extensions?

   o  What is the experience with interworking various data models
      developed from different groups, or with data models that evolved
      over time?

   o  What functionality should online repositories for sharing schemas
      have?

   o  How can existing data models be mapped against each other to offer
      interworking?

   o  Is there room for harmonization, or are the use cases of different
      groups and organizations so unique that there is no possibility
      for cooperation?

   o  How can organizations better work together to increase awareness
      and information sharing?

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The first roadblock to interoperability at the level of data models
   is the lack of a common vocabulary to start the discussion.
   [<a href="./rfc3444" title='"On the Difference between Information Models and Data Models"'>RFC3444</a>] provides a starting point by separating conceptual models
   for designers, or "information models", from concrete detailed
   definitions for implementers, or "data models".  There are concepts
   that are undefined in that RFC and elsewhere, such as the interaction
   with the resources of an endpoint, or "interaction model".
   Therefore, the three "main" common models that were identified were:

   Information Model
      An information model defines an environment at the highest level
      of abstraction and expresses the desired functionality.
      Information models can be defined informally (e.g., in prose) or
      more formally (e.g., Unified Modeling Language (UML), Entity-
      Relationship Diagrams, etc.).  Implementation details are hidden.

   Data Model
      A data model defines concrete data representations at a lower
      level of abstraction, including implementation- and protocol-
      specific details.  Some examples are SNMP Management Information
      Base (MIB) modules, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Thing
      Description (TD) Things, YANG modules, Lightweight Machine-to-
      Machine (LwM2M) Schemas, Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF)
      Schemas, and so on.

   Interaction Model
      An interaction model defines how data is accessed and retrieved
      from the endpoints, being, therefore, tied to the specific
      communication pattern that the system has (e.g., REST methods,
      Publish/Subscribe operations, or RPC calls).

   Another identified terminology issue is the semantic meaning overload
   that some terms have.  The meaning can vary depending on the context
   in which the term is used.  Some examples of such terms are as
   follows: semantics, models, encoding, serialization format, media
   types, and encoding types.  Due to time constraints, no concrete
   terminology was agreed upon, but work will continue within each
   organization to create various terminology documents.  The
   participants agreed to set up a GitHub repository [<a href="#ref-IOTSIGIT">IOTSIGIT</a>] for
   sharing information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20What%20Problems%20to%20Solve"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  What Problems to Solve</span>

   The participants agreed that there is not simply a single problem to
   be solved but rather a range of problems.  During the workshop, the
   following problems were discussed:

   o  Formal Languages for Documentation Purposes

   To simplify review and publication, SDOs need formal descriptions of
   their data and interaction models.  Several of them use a tabular
   representation found in the specification itself but use a formal
   language as an alternative way of describing objects and resources
   for formal purposes.  Some examples of formal language use are as
   follows.

   The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), now OMA SpecWorks, used an XML Schema
   [<a href="#ref-LWM2M-Schema">LWM2M-Schema</a>] to describe their object and resource definitions.
   The XML files of standardized objects are available for download at
   [<a href="#ref-OMNA" title='"OMA LightweightM2M (LwM2M) Object and Resource Registry"'>OMNA</a>].

   The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) defined Generic Attribute
   Profile (GATT) services and characteristics for use with Bluetooth
   Smart/Low Energy.  The services and characteristics are shown in a
   tabular form on the Bluetooth SIG website [<a href="#ref-SIG" title='"GATT Specifications"'>SIG</a>] and are defined as
   XML instance documents.

   The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) uses JSON Schemas to formally
   define data models and RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) to define
   interaction models.  The standard files are available online at
   &lt;oneIoTa.org&gt;.





<span class="grey">Jimenez, et al.               Informational                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8477">RFC 8477</a>                   IOTSI Workshop 2016              October 2018</span>


   The AllSeen Alliance uses AllJoyn Introspection XML to define data
   and interaction models in the same formal language, tailored for
   RPC-style interaction.  The standard files are available online on
   the AllSeen Alliance website, but both standard and vendor-defined
   model files can be obtained by directly querying a device for them at
   runtime.

   The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) uses the Resource Description
   Framework (RDF) to define data and interaction models using a format
   tailored for the web.

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) uses YANG to define data
   and interaction models.  Other SDOs may use various other formats.

   o  Formal Languages for Code Generation

   Code-generation tools that use formal data and information modeling
   languages are needed by developers.  For example, the AllSeen Visual
   Studio Plugin [<a href="#ref-AllSeen-Plugin">AllSeen-Plugin</a>] offers a wizard to generate code based
   on the formal description of the data model.  Another example of a
   data modeling language that can be used for code generation is YANG.
   A popular tool to help with code generation of YANG modules is pyang
   [<a href="#ref-PYANG" title='"An extensible YANG validator and converter in python"'>PYANG</a>].  An example of a tool that can generate code for multiple
   ecosystems is OpenDOF [<a href="#ref-OpenDOF" title='"The OpenDOF Project"'>OpenDOF</a>].  Use cases discussed for code
   generation included easing development of server-side device
   functionality, clients, and compliance tests.

   o  Debugging Support

   Debugging tools are needed that implement generic object browsers,
   which use standard data models and/or retrieve formal language
   descriptions from the devices themselves.  As one example, the nRF
   Bluetooth Smart sniffer from Nordic Semiconductor [<a href="#ref-nRF-Sniffer">nRF-Sniffer</a>] can
   be used to display services and characteristics defined by the
   Bluetooth SIG.  As another example, AllJoyn Explorer
   [<a href="#ref-AllJoynExplorer">AllJoynExplorer</a>] can be used to browse and interact with any
   resource exposed by an AllJoyn device, including both standard and
   vendor-defined data models, by retrieving the formal descriptions
   from the device at runtime.

   o  Translation

   The working assumption is that devices need to have a common data
   model with a priori knowledge of data types and actions.  However,
   that would imply that each consortium/organization will try to define
   their own data model.  That would cause a major interoperability





<span class="grey">Jimenez, et al.               Informational                     [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-7"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8477">RFC 8477</a>                   IOTSI Workshop 2016              October 2018</span>


   problem, possibly a completely intractable one given the number of
   variations, extensions, compositions, or versioning changes that will
   happen for each data model.

   Another potential approach is to have a minimal amount of information
   on the device to allow for a runtime binding to a specific model, the
   objective being to require as little prior knowledge as possible.

   Moreover, gateways, bridges and other similar devices need to
   dynamically translate (or map) one data model to another one.
   Complexity will increase as there are also multiple protocols and
   schemas that make interoperability harder to achieve.

   o  Runtime Discovery

   Runtime discovery allows IoT devices to exchange metadata about the
   data, potentially along with the data exchanged itself.  In some
   cases, the metadata not only describes data but also the interaction
   model as well.  An example of such an approach has been shown with
   Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) [<a href="#ref-HATEOAS" title='"Semantic Interoperability Requires Self-describing Interaction Models: HATEOAS for the Internet of Things"'>HATEOAS</a>].
   Another example is that all AllJoyn devices support such runtime
   discovery using a protocol mechanism called "introspection", where
   the metadata is queried from the device itself [<a href="#ref-AllSeen" title='"Summary of AllSeen Alliance Work Relevant to Semantic Interoperability"'>AllSeen</a>].

   There are various models, whether deployed or possible, for such
   discovery.  The metadata might be extracted from a specification,
   looked up on a cloud repository (e.g., oneIoTa for OCF models),
   looked up via a vendor's site, or obtained from the device itself
   (such as in the AllJoyn case).  The relevant metadata might be
   obtained from the same place or different pieces might be obtained
   from different places, such as separately obtaining (a) syntax
   information, (b) end-user descriptions in a desired language, and (c)
   developer-specific comments for implementers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Translation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Translation</span>

   In an ideal world where organizations and companies cooperate and
   agree on a single data model standard, there is no need for gateways
   that translate from one data model to another one.  However, this is
   far from reality today, and there are many proprietary data models in
   addition to the already standardized ones.  As a consequence,
   gateways are needed to translate between data models.  This leads to
   (n^2)-n combinations, in the worst case.

   There are analogies with gateways back in the 1980s that were used to
   translate between network layer protocols.  Eventually, IP took over,
   providing the necessary end-to-end interoperability at the network
   layer.  Unfortunately, the introduction of gateways leads to the loss



<span class="grey">Jimenez, et al.               Informational                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

   of expressiveness due to the translation between data models.  The
   functionality of IP was so valuable in the market that advanced
   features of other networking protocols became less attractive and
   were not used anymore.

   Participants discussed an alternative that they called a "red star",
   shown in Figure 1, where data models are translated to a common data
   model shown in the middle.  This reduces the number of translations
   that are needed down to 2n (in the best case).  The problem, of
   course, is that everyone wants their own data model to be the red
   star in the center.

            Figure 1: The "Red Star" in Data/Information Models

   While the workshop itself was not a suitable forum to discuss the
   design of such translation in detail, several questions were raised:

   o  Do we need a "red star" that does everything, or could we design
      something that offers a more restricted functionality?

   o  How do we handle loss of data and functionality?





<span class="grey">Jimenez, et al.               Informational                     [Page 8]</span></pre>

   o  Should data be translated between data models, or should data
      models themselves be translated?

   o  How can interaction models be translated?  They need to be dealt
      with in addition to the data models.

   o  Many (if not all) data and interaction models have some bizarre
      functionality that cannot be translated easily.  How can those be
      handled?

   o  What limitations are we going to accept in these translations?

   The participants also addressed the question of when translation
   should be done.  Two use cases were discussed:

   (a)  Design time: A translation between data model descriptions, such
        as translating a YANG module to a RAML/JSON model, can be
        performed once, during design time.  A single information model
        might be mapped to a number of different data models.

   (b)  Run time: Runtime translation of values in two standard data
        models can only be algorithmically done when the data model on
        one side is algorithmically derived from the data model on the
        other side.  This was called a "derived model".  It was
        discussed that the availability of runtime discovery can aid in
        semantic translation, such as when a vendor-specific data model
        on one side of a protocol bridge is resolved and the translator
        can algorithmically derive the semantically equivalent vendor-
        specific data model on the other side.  This situation is
        discussed in [<a href="#ref-BridgeTaxonomy">BridgeTaxonomy</a>].

   The participants agreed that algorithm translation will generally
   require custom code whenever one is translating to anything other
   than a derived model.

   Participants concluded that it is typically easier to translate data
   between systems that follow the same communication architecture.

   A large part of the workshop was dedicated to the evolution of
   devices and server-side applications.  Interactions between devices
   and services and how their relationship evolves over time is
   complicated by their respective interaction models.

   The workshop participants discussed various approaches to deal with
   change.  In the most basic case, a developer might use a description
   of an API and implement the protocol steps.  Sometimes, the data or

   information model can be used to generate code stubs.  Subsequent
   changes to an API require changes on the clients to upgrade to the
   new version, which requires some development of new code to satisfy
   the needs of the new API.

   These interactions could be made machine understandable in the first
   place, enabling for changes to happen at runtime.  In that scenario,
   a machine client could discover the possible interactions with a
   service, adapting to changes as they occur without specific code
   being developed to adapt to them.

   The challenge seems to be to code the human-readable specification
   into a machine-readable format.  Machine-readable languages require a
   shared vocabulary to give meaning to the tags.

   These types of interactions are often based on the REST architectural
   style.  Its principle is that a device or endpoint only needs a
   single entry point, with a host providing descriptions of the API
   in-band by means of web links and forms.

   By defining IoT-specific relation types, it is possible to drive
   interactions through links instead of hard-coding URIs into a RESTful
   client, thus making the system flexible enough for later changes.
   The definition of the basic hypermedia formats for IoT is still a
   work in progress.  However, some of the existing mechanisms can be
   reused, such as resource discovery, forms, or links.

   There were two types of security considerations discussed: use of
   formal data models for security configuration and security of data
   and data models in general.

   It was observed that the security assumptions and configuration, or
   "security model", varies by ecosystem today, making the job of a
   translator difficult.  For example, there are different types of
   security principals (e.g., user vs. device vs. application), the use
   of Access Control Lists (ACLs) versus capabilities, and what types of
   policies can be expressed, all vary by ecosystem.  As a result, the
   security model architecture generally dictates where translation can
   be done.

   One approach discussed was whether two endpoints might be able to use
   some overlay security model across a translator between two
   ecosystems, which only works if the two endpoints agree on a common
   data model for their communication.  Another approach discussed was
   simply having a translator act as a trusted intermediary, which
   enables the translator to translate between different data models.

   One suggestion discussed was either adding metadata into the formal
   data model language or having it accompany the data values over the
   wire, tagging the data with privacy levels.  However, sometimes even
   the privacy level of information might itself be sensitive.  Still,
   it was observed that being able to dynamically learn security
   requirements might help provide better UIs and translators.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Collaboration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Collaboration</span>

   The participants discussed how best to share information among their
   various organizations.  One discussion was around having joint
   meetings.  One current challenge reported was that organizations were
   not aware of when and where each other's meetings were scheduled, and
   sharing such information could help organizations better collocate
   meetings.  To facilitate this exchange, the participants agreed to
   add links to their respective meeting schedules from a common page in
   the IOTSI repository [<a href="#ref-IOTSIGIT">IOTSIGIT</a>].

   Another challenge reported was that organizations did not know how to
   find each other's published data models, and sharing such information
   could better facilitate reuse of the same information model.  To
   facilitate this exchange, the participants discussed whether a common
   repository might be used by multiple organizations.  The OCF's
   oneIoTa repository was discussed as one possibility, but it was
   reported that its terms of use at the time of the workshop prevented
   this.  The OCF agreed to take this back and look at updating the
   terms of use to allow other organizations to use it, as the
   restriction was not the intent.  &lt;schema.org&gt; was discussed as
   another possibility.  In the meantime, the participants agreed to add
   links to their respective repositories from a common page in the
   IOTSI repository [<a href="#ref-IOTSIGIT">IOTSIGIT</a>].

   It was also agreed that the iotsi@iab.org mailing list would remain
   open and available for sharing information between all relevant
   organizations.
