   This memo defines an encoding scheme for the Japanese Characters,
   describes "ISO-2022-JP-1", which is used in electronic mail [RFC-
   822], and network news [<a href="./rfc1036">RFC 1036</a>]. Also this memo provides a listing
   of the Japanese Character Set that can be used in this encoding
   scheme.

   This document uses terms that appear in capital letters to indicate
   particular requirements of this specification. Those terms are
   "MUST", "SHOULD", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY". The meaning of
   each term are found in [<a href="./rfc2119">RFC-2119</a>]

   <a href="./rfc1468">RFC 1468</a> defines the way Japanese Characters are encoded, likewise
   what this memo defines. It defines the use of JIS X 0208 as the
   double-byte character set in ISO-2022-JP text.

   Today, many operating systems support proprietary extended Japanese
   characters or JIS X 0212, This includes the Unicode character set,
   which does not conform to JIS X 0201 nor JIS X 0208. Therefore, this
   limits the ability to communicate and correspond precise information
   because of the limited availability of Kanji characters. Fortunately
   JIS (Japanese Industry Standard) defines JIS X 0212 as "code of the

   supplementary Japanese graphic character set for information
   interchange". Most Japanese characters which are used in regular
   electronic mail in most cases can be accommodated in JIS X 0201, JIS
   X 0208 and JIS X 0212.

   Also it is recognized that there is a tendency to use Unicode,
   however, Unicode is not yet widely used and there is a certain
   limitation with old electronic mail system. Furthermore, the purpose
   of this comment is to add the capability of writing out JIS X 0212.

   This comment does not describe any representation of iso-2022-jp-1
   version information in addition to JIS X 0212 support.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Description"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Description</span>

   In "ISO-2022-JP-1" text, the initial character code of the message is
   in ASCII. The "double-byte-seq"(see "Format Syntax" section) (ESC "$"
   "B" / ESC "$" "@" / ESC "$" "(" "D") is the only designator that
   indicates that the following character is double-byte, and it is
   valid until another escape sequence appears.  It is very discouraged
   to use (ESC "$" "@") for double byte character encoding, new
   implementation SHOULD use only (ESC "$" "B") for double byte encoding
   instead.

   The end of "ISO-2022-JP-1" text MUST be in ASCII. Also it is strongly
   recommended to back up to the ASCII at the end of each line rather
   than JIS X 0201-Roman if there is any none ASCII character in middle
   of a line.

   Since "ISO-2022-JP-1" is designed to add the capability of writing
   out JIS X 0212, if the message does not contain none of JIS X 0212
   characters. "ISO-2022-JP" text MUST BE used.

   JIS X 0201-Roman is not identical to the ASCII with two different
   characters.

   The following list are the escape sequences and character sets that
   can be used in "ISO-2022-JP-1" text. The registered number in the ISO
   2375 Register which allow double-byte ideographic scripts to be
   encoded within ISO/IEC 2022 code structure is indicated as reg#
   below.

   reg# character set     ESC sequence                  designated to

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20MIME%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>. MIME Considerations</span>

   The name to be used for the Japanese encoding scheme in content is
   "ISO-2022-JP-1". When this name is used in the MIME message form, it
   would be:

              Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-jp-1

   Since the "ISO-2022-JP-1" is 7bit encoding, it will be unnecessary to
   encode in another format by specifying the "Content-Transfer-
   Encoding" header. Also applying Based64 or Quoted-Printable encoding
   MAY cause today's software to fail to decode the message.

   "ISO-2022-JP-1" can be used in MIME headers. Also "ISO-2022-JP-1"
   text can be used with Base64 or Quoted-Printable encoding.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20Additional%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>. Additional Information</span>

   As long as mail systems are capable of writing out Unicode, it is
   recommended to also write out Unicode text in addition to "ISO-
   2022-JP-1" text. Also writing out "ISO-2022-JP" text in addition to
   "ISO-2022-JP-1" is strongly encouraged for backward compatibility
   reasons.

   Some mail systems write out 8bits characters in 'parameter' and
   'value' defined in [<a href="./rfc822">RFC 822</a>] and [<a href="./rfc1521">RFC 1521</a>]. All 8bit characters MUST
   NOT be used in those fields. The implementation of future mail
   systems SHOULD support those only for interoperability reasons.
