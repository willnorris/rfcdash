Abstract

   This document updates <a href="./rfc5761">RFC 5761</a> by clarifying the SDP offer/answer
   negotiation of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) multiplexing.  It
   makes it clear that an answerer can only include an "a=rtcp-mux"
   attribute in a Session Description Protocol (SDP) answer if the
   associated SDP offer contained the attribute.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc5761">RFC 5761</a> [<a href="./rfc5761" title='"Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port"'>RFC5761</a>] specifies how to multiplex RTP data packets and
   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets on a single UDP port, and how to
   negotiate usage of such multiplexing using the SDP offer/answer
   mechanism [<a href="./rfc3264" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] with an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute.  However, the
   text is unclear on whether an answerer is allowed to include the
   attribute in an answer even if the associated offer did not contain
   an attribute.

   This document updates <a href="./rfc5761">RFC 5761</a> [<a href="./rfc5761" title='"Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port"'>RFC5761</a>] by clarifying that an
   answerer can only include an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in an answer if
   the associated offer contained the attribute.  It also clarifies that
   the negotiation of RTP and RTCP multiplexing is for usage in both
   directions.

   OLD TEXT:

   When the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8] is used to negotiate
   RTP sessions following the offer/answer model [9], the "a=rtcp-mux"
   attribute (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>) indicates the desire to multiplex RTP and
   RTCP onto a single port.  The initial SDP offer MUST include this
   attribute at the media level to request multiplexing of RTP and RTCP
   on a single port.  For example:

       v=0
       o=csp 1153134164 1153134164 IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e
       s=-
       c=IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e
       t=1153134164 1153137764
       m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97
       a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000
       a=rtcp-mux

   This offer denotes a unicast voice-over-IP session using the RTP/AVP
   profile with iLBC coding.  The answerer is requested to send both RTP
   and RTCP to port 49170 on IPv6 address 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e.

   If the answerer wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port,
   it MUST include a media-level "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in the answer.
   The RTP payload types used in the answer MUST conform to the rules in
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   If the answer does not contain an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, the offerer
   MUST NOT multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.  Instead,
   it should send and receive RTCP on a port allocated according to the
   usual port-selection rules (either the port pair, or a signalled port
   if the "a=rtcp:" attribute [10] is also included).  This will occur
   when talking to a peer that does not understand the "a=rtcp-mux"
   attribute.

   When SDP is used in a declarative manner, the presence of an
   "a=rtcp-mux" attribute signals that the sender will multiplex RTP and
   RTCP on the same port.  The receiver MUST be prepared to receive RTCP
   packets on the RTP port, and any resource reservation needs to be
   made including the RTCP bandwidth.

   NEW TEXT:

   When the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8] is used to negotiate
   RTP sessions following the offer/answer model [9], the "a=rtcp-mux"
   attribute (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>) indicates the desire to multiplex RTP and
   RTCP onto a single port, and the usage is always negotiated for both
   directions.

   If the offerer wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port,
   the initial SDP offer MUST include the attribute at the media level
   to request multiplexing of RTP and RTCP on a single port.  For
   example:

        v=0
        o=csp 1153134164 1153134164 IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e
        s=-
        c=IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e
        t=1153134164 1153137764
        m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97
        a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000
        a=rtcp-mux

   This offer denotes a unicast voice-over-IP session using the RTP/AVP
   profile with Internet Low Bit Rate Codec (iLBC) coding.  The answerer
   is requested to send both RTP and RTCP to port 49170 on IPv6 address
   2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e.

   If the offer contains the "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, and if the answerer
   wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port, it MUST include
   a media-level "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in the answer.  The RTP payload
   types used in the answer MUST conform to the rules in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  If
   the offer does not contain the "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, the answerer
   MUST NOT include an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in the answer, and the
   answerer MUST NOT multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.

   If the answer contains an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, the offerer and
   answerer MUST multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.

   If the answer does not contain an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, the offerer
   and answerer MUST NOT multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single
   port.  Instead, they should send and receive RTCP on a port allocated
   according to the usual port-selection rules (either the port pair, or
   a signalled port if the "a=rtcp:" attribute [10] is also included).
   This will occur when talking to a peer that does not understand the
   "a=rtcp-mux" attribute.

   When SDP is used in a declarative manner, the presence of an "a=rtcp-
   mux" attribute signals that the sender will multiplex RTP and RTCP on
   the same port.  The receiver MUST be prepared to receive RTCP packets
   on the RTP port, and any resource reservation needs to be made
   including the RTCP bandwidth.

   The security considerations for RTP and RTCP multiplexing are
   described in <a href="./rfc5761">RFC 5761</a>.  This specification does not impact those
   security considerations.
