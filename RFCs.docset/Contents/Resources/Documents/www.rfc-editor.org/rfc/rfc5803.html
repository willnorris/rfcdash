   This document describes how the authPassword LDAP attribute
   [<a href="#ref-AUTHPASS" title='"LDAP Authentication Password Schema"'>AUTHPASS</a>] can be used for storing secrets used by [<a href="#ref-SCRAM" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Message (SCRAM) SASL Mechanisms"'>SCRAM</a>] Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer [<a href="./rfc4422" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>] Mechanisms.

      The "scheme" part of the authPassword attribute is the SCRAM
      mechanism name (always without the "-PLUS" suffix), e.g., "SCRAM-
      SHA-1".  See [<a href="#ref-SCRAM" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Message (SCRAM) SASL Mechanisms"'>SCRAM</a>] for the exact syntax of SCRAM mechanism
      names.

      The "authInfo" part of the authPassword attribute is the iteration
      count (iter-count in the ABNF below), followed by ":" and base64-
      encoded [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>] salt.

      The "authValue" part of the authPassword attribute is the base64-
      encoded [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>] StoredKey [<a href="#ref-SCRAM" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Message (SCRAM) SASL Mechanisms"'>SCRAM</a>], followed by ":" and base64-
      encoded [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>] ServerKey [<a href="#ref-SCRAM" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Message (SCRAM) SASL Mechanisms"'>SCRAM</a>].

   Syntax of the attribute can be expressed using ABNF [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].  Non-
   terminal references in the following ABNF are defined in either
   [<a href="#ref-AUTHPASS" title='"LDAP Authentication Password Schema"'>AUTHPASS</a>], [<a href="./rfc4422" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>], or [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].

       scram-mech     = "SCRAM-SHA-1" / scram-mech-ext
                      ; Complies with ABNF for &lt;scheme&gt;
                      ; defined in [<a href="#ref-AUTHPASS" title='"LDAP Authentication Password Schema"'>AUTHPASS</a>].

       scram-authInfo = iter-count ":" salt
                      ; Complies with ABNF for &lt;authInfo&gt;
                      ; defined in [<a href="#ref-AUTHPASS" title='"LDAP Authentication Password Schema"'>AUTHPASS</a>].

       scram-authValue = stored-key ":" server-key
                      ; Complies with ABNF for &lt;authValue&gt;
                      ; defined in [<a href="#ref-AUTHPASS" title='"LDAP Authentication Password Schema"'>AUTHPASS</a>].

       iter-count   = %x31-39 *DIGIT
                      ; SCRAM iteration count.
                      ; A positive number without leading zeros.

       salt         = &lt;base64-encoded value&gt;

       scram-mech-ext = "SCRAM-" 1*9mech-char

                      ; in the IANA registry for SASL

       mech-char    = &lt;Defined in <a href="./rfc4422">RFC 4422</a>&gt;

   Note that the authPassword attribute is multivalued.  For example, it
   may contain multiple SCRAM hashes for different hashing algorithms.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document defines how the authPassword attribute can be used to
   store SCRAM secrets.  Therefore, security considerations relevant to
   [<a href="#ref-SCRAM" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Message (SCRAM) SASL Mechanisms"'>SCRAM</a>] and hash functions used with it are also relevant to this
   document.

   General security considerations related to the authPassword attribute
   (as specified in [<a href="#ref-AUTHPASS" title='"LDAP Authentication Password Schema"'>AUTHPASS</a>]) also apply to the use of authPassword as
   specified in this document.  In particular, the values of
   authPassword SHOULD be protected as if they were cleartext passwords.
   A read operation on this attribute that is not protected by a privacy
   layer (such as IPsec or TLS) can expose this attribute to an attacker
   who a) would be able to use the intercepted value to impersonate the
   user to all servers providing SCRAM access using the same hash
   function, password, iteration count, and salt or b) would be able to
   perform an offline dictionary or brute-force attack in order to
   recover the user's password.

   Servers MUST validate the format of the authPassword attribute before
   using it for performing a SCRAM authentication exchange.  It is
   possible that an attacker compromised the LDAP server or got access
   to the entry containing the attribute in order to exploit a
   vulnerability in the subsystem performing the SCRAM authentication

   exchange.  Big iteration counts and invalid base64 encoding are two
   possible (but not the only) exploits in the format specified in the
   document.
