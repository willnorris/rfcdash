Abstract

   This document defines a BGP extension that allows the advertisement
   of multiple paths for the same address prefix without the new paths
   implicitly replacing any previous ones.  The essence of the extension
   is that each path is identified by a Path Identifier in addition to
   the address prefix.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The BGP specification [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] defines an Update-Send Process to
   advertise the routes chosen by the Decision Process to other BGP
   speakers.  No provisions are made to allow the advertisement of
   multiple paths for the same address prefix or Network Layer
   Reachability Information (NLRI).  In fact, a route with the same NLRI
   as a previously advertised route implicitly replaces the previous
   advertisement.

   This document defines a BGP extension that allows the advertisement
   of multiple paths for the same address prefix without the new paths
   implicitly replacing any previous ones.  The essence of the extension
   is that each path is identified by a Path Identifier in addition to
   the address prefix.

   The availability of the additional paths can help reduce or eliminate
   persistent route oscillations [<a href="./rfc3345" title='"Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Persistent Route Oscillation Condition"'>RFC3345</a>].  It can also help with
   optimal routing and routing convergence in a network by providing
   potential alternate or backup paths, respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7911">RFC 7911</a>                        ADD-PATH                       July 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20How%20to%20Identify%20a%20Path"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  How to Identify a Path</span>

   As defined in [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>], a path refers to the information reported in
   the Path Attribute field of an UPDATE message.  As the procedures
   specified in [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] allow only the advertisement of one path for a
   particular address prefix, a path for an address prefix from a BGP
   peer can be keyed on the address prefix.

   In order for a BGP speaker to advertise multiple paths for the same
   address prefix, a new identifier (termed "Path Identifier" hereafter)
   needs to be introduced so that a particular path for an address
   prefix can be identified by the combination of the address prefix and
   the Path Identifier.

   The assignment of the Path Identifier for a path by a BGP speaker is
   purely a local matter.  However, the Path Identifier MUST be assigned
   in such a way that the BGP speaker is able to use the (Prefix, Path
   Identifier) to uniquely identify a path advertised to a neighbor.  A
   BGP speaker that re-advertises a route MUST generate its own Path
   Identifier to be associated with the re-advertised route.  A BGP
   speaker that receives a route should not assume that the identifier
   carries any particular semantics.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Extended%20NLRI%20Encodings"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Extended NLRI Encodings</span>

   In order to carry the Path Identifier in an UPDATE message, the NLRI
   encoding MUST be extended by prepending the Path Identifier field,
   which is of four octets.

   For example, the NLRI encoding specified in [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] is extended as
   the following:

                  +--------------------------------+
                  | Path Identifier (4 octets)     |
                  +--------------------------------+
                  | Length (1 octet)               |
                  +--------------------------------+
                  | Prefix (variable)              |
                  +--------------------------------+

   The usage of the extended NLRI encodings is specified in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7911">RFC 7911</a>                        ADD-PATH                       July 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20ADD-PATH%20Capability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  ADD-PATH Capability</span>

   The ADD-PATH Capability is a BGP capability [<a href="./rfc5492" title='"Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4"'>RFC5492</a>], with
   Capability Code 69.  The Capability Length field of this capability
   is variable.  The Capability Value field consists of one or more of
   the following tuples:

                +------------------------------------------------+
                | Address Family Identifier (2 octets)           |
                +------------------------------------------------+
                | Subsequent Address Family Identifier (1 octet) |
                +------------------------------------------------+
                | Send/Receive (1 octet)                         |
                +------------------------------------------------+

   The meaning and use of the fields are as follows:

      Address Family Identifier (AFI):

         This field is the same as the one used in [<a href="./rfc4760" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>RFC4760</a>].

      Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI):

         This field is the same as the one used in [<a href="./rfc4760" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>RFC4760</a>].

      Send/Receive:

         This field indicates whether the sender is (a) able to receive
         multiple paths from its peer (value 1), (b) able to send
         multiple paths to its peer (value 2), or (c) both (value 3) for
         the &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;.

         If any other value is received, then the capability SHOULD be
         treated as not understood and ignored [<a href="./rfc5492" title='"Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4"'>RFC5492</a>].

   A BGP speaker that wishes to indicate support for multiple AFI/SAFIs
   MUST do so by including the information in a single instance of the
   ADD-PATH Capability.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Operation</span>

   The Path Identifier specified in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> can be used to advertise
   multiple paths for the same address prefix without subsequent
   advertisements replacing the previous ones.  Apart from the fact that
   this is now possible, the route advertisement rules of [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] are
   not changed.  In particular, a new advertisement for a given address
   prefix and a given Path Identifier replaces a previous advertisement

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7911">RFC 7911</a>                        ADD-PATH                       July 2016</span>


   for the same address prefix and Path Identifier.  If a BGP speaker
   receives a message to withdraw a prefix with a Path Identifier not
   seen before, it SHOULD silently ignore it.

   For a BGP speaker to be able to send multiple paths to its peer, that
   BGP speaker MUST advertise the ADD-PATH Capability with the Send/
   Receive field set to either 2 or 3, and MUST receive from its peer
   the ADD-PATH Capability with the Send/Receive field set to either 1
   or 3, for the corresponding &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;.

   A BGP speaker MUST follow the procedures defined in [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] when
   generating an UPDATE message for a particular &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt; to a peer
   unless the BGP speaker advertises the ADD-PATH Capability to the peer
   indicating its ability to send multiple paths for the &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;,
   and also receives the ADD-PATH Capability from the peer indicating
   its ability to receive multiple paths for the &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;, in which
   case the speaker MUST generate a route update for the &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;
   based on the combination of the address prefix and the Path
   Identifier, and use the extended NLRI encodings specified in this
   document.  The peer SHALL act accordingly in processing an UPDATE
   message related to a particular &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;.

   A BGP speaker SHOULD include the best route [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] when more than
   one path is advertised to a neighbor, unless it is a path received
   from that neighbor.

   As the Path Identifiers are locally assigned, and may or may not be
   persistent across a control plane restart of a BGP speaker, an
   implementation SHOULD take special care so that the underlying
   forwarding plane of a "Receiving Speaker" as described in [<a href="./rfc4724" title='"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"'>RFC4724</a>]
   is not affected during the graceful restart of a BGP session.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Deployment%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Deployment Considerations</span>

   The extension proposed in this document provides a mechanism for a
   BGP speaker to advertise multiple paths over a BGP session.  Care
   needs to be taken in its deployment to ensure consistent routing and
   forwarding in a network [<a href="#ref-ADDPATH" title='"Best Practices for Advertisement of Multiple Paths in IBGP"'>ADDPATH</a>].

   The only explicit indication that the encoding described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>
   is in use in a particular BGP session is the exchange of Capabilities
   described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  If the exchange is successful [<a href="./rfc5492" title='"Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4"'>RFC5492</a>],
   then the BGP speakers will be able to process all BGP UPDATES
   properly, as described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  However, if, for example, a
   packet analyzer is used on the wire to examine an active BGP session,
   it may not be able to properly decode the BGP UPDATES because it
   lacks prior knowledge of the exchanged Capabilities.

   When deployed as a provider edge router or a peering router that
   interacts with external neighbors, a BGP speaker usually advertises
   at most one path to the internal neighbors in a network.  In the case
   where the speaker is configured to advertise multiple paths to the
   internal neighbors, and additional information is needed for the
   application, the speaker could use attributes such as the
   Edge_Discriminator attribute [<a href="#ref-FAST" title='"Fast Connectivity Restoration Using BGP Add-path"'>FAST</a>].  The use of that type of
   additional information is outside the scope of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has assigned the value 69 for the ADD-PATH Capability described
   in this document.  This registration is in the "Capability Codes"
   registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document defines a BGP extension that allows the advertisement
   of multiple paths for the same address prefix without the new paths
   implicitly replacing any previous ones.  As a result, multiple paths
   for a large number of prefixes may be received by a BGP speaker,
   potentially depleting memory resources or even causing network-wide
   instability, which can be considered a denial-of-service attack.
   Note that this is not a new vulnerability, but one that is present in
   the base BGP specification [<a href="./rfc4272" title='"BGP Security Vulnerabilities Analysis"'>RFC4272</a>].

   The use of the ADD-PATH Capability is intended to address specific
   needs related to, for example, eliminating route oscillations that
   were induced by the MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) attribute [<a href="#ref-STOP-OSC" title='"BGP Persistent Route Oscillation Solutions"'>STOP-OSC</a>].
   While describing the applications for the ADD-PATH Capability is
   outside the scope of this document, users are encouraged to examine
   their behavior and potential impact by studying the best practices
   described in [<a href="#ref-ADDPATH" title='"Best Practices for Advertisement of Multiple Paths in IBGP"'>ADDPATH</a>].

   Security concerns in the base operation of BGP [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] also apply.
