   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) [<a href="./rfc4656" title='"A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)"'>RFC4656</a>] defines
   that only the NTP format [<a href="./rfc5905" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>RFC5905</a>] of a timestamp can be used in the
   OWAMP-Test protocol.  The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)
   [<a href="./rfc5357" title='"A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"'>RFC5357</a>] adopted the OWAMP-Test packet format and extended it by
   adding a format for a reflected test packet.  Both the sender's and
   reflector's packets timestamps are expected to follow the 64-bit-long
   NTP format [<a href="./rfc5905" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>RFC5905</a>].  NTP, when used over the Internet, typically
   achieves clock accuracy within 5 ms to 100 ms.  Surveys conducted
   recently suggest that 90% of devices achieve accuracy better than 100
   ms and 99% of devices achieve accuracy better than 1 sec.  It should
   be noted that NTP synchronizes clocks on the control plane, not on
   data plane.  Distribution of clock within a node may be supported by
   an independent NTP domain or via interprocess communication in a
   multiprocessor distributed system.  Any of the mentioned solutions
   will be subject to additional queuing delays that negatively affect
   data-plane clock accuracy.

   The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) [<a href="#ref-IEEE.1588">IEEE.1588</a>] has gained wide support
   since the development of OWAMP and TWAMP.  PTP, using on-path support
   and other mechanisms, allows sub-microsecond clock accuracy.  PTP is
   now supported in multiple implementations of fast-forwarding engines;
   thus, accuracy achieved by PTP is the accuracy of the clock in the
   data plane.  Having an option to use a more accurate clock as a
   source of timestamps for IP performance measurements is one of the
   advantages of this specification.  Another advantage is realized by
   simplification of hardware in the data plane.  To support OWAMP or
   TWAMP, test protocol timestamps must be converted from PTP to NTP.
   That requires resources, use of microcode or additional processing
   elements, that are always limited.  To address this, this document

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8186">RFC 8186</a>             1588 Timestamp Format in TWAMP            June 2017</span>


   proposes optional extensions to Control and Test protocols to support
   use of the IEEE 1588v2 timestamp format as an optional alternative to
   the NTP timestamp format.

   One of the goals of this specification is not only to allow endpoints
   of a test session to use a timestamp format other than NTP, but to
   support backwards compatibility with nodes that do not yet support
   this extension.

   OWAMP connection establishment follows the procedure defined in
   <a href="./rfc4656#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC4656]</a> and additional steps in TWAMP described in
   <a href="./rfc5357#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC5357]</a>.  In these procedures, the Modes field has
   been used to identify and select specific communication capabilities.
   At the same time, the Modes field has been recognized and used as an
   extension mechanism [<a href="./rfc6038" title='"Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Reflect Octets and Symmetrical Size Features"'>RFC6038</a>].  The new feature requires one bit
   position for the Server and Control-Client to negotiate which
   timestamp format can be used in some or all test sessions invoked
   with this control connection.  The endpoint of the test session,
   Session-Sender and Session-Receiver (for OWAMP) or Session-Reflector
   (for TWAMP), that supports this extension MUST be capable of
   interpreting the NTP and PTPv2 timestamp formats.  If the endpoint
   does not support this extension, then the value of the PTPv2
   Timestamp flag MUST be 0 because it is in Must Be Zero field.  If the
   value of the PTPv2 Timestamp flag is 0, then the advertising node can
   use and interpret only the NTP timestamp format.  Implementations of
   OWAMP and/or TWAMP MAY provide a configuration knob to bypass the

   timestamp format negotiation process and use the locally configured
   values instead.

   Use of PTPv2 Timestamp flags is discussed in the following
   subsections.  For details on the assigned values and bit positions,
   see the <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Timestamp%20Format%20Negotiation%20in%20OWAMP%20Connection%20Setup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Timestamp Format Negotiation in OWAMP Connection Setup</span>

   In OWAMP-Test [<a href="./rfc4656" title='"A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)"'>RFC4656</a>], the Session-Receiver and/or Fetch-Client
   interpret collected timestamps.  Thus, the Server uses the Modes
   field timestamp format to indicate which formats the Session-Receiver
   is capable of interpreting.  The Control-Client inspects values set
   by the Server for timestamp formats and sets values in the Modes
   field of the Set-Up-Response message according to the timestamp
   formats the Session-Sender can use.  The rules for setting timestamp
   flags in the Modes field in Server Greeting and Set-Up-Response
   messages and interpreting them are as follows:

   o  If the Session-Receiver supports this extension, then the Server
      that establishes test sessions on its behalf MUST set the PTPv2
      Timestamp flag to 1 in the Server Greeting message per the
      requirement listed in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.  Otherwise, the PTPv2 Timestamp
      flag will be set to 0 to indicate that the Session-Receiver
      interprets only the NTP format.

   o  If the Control-Client receives a greeting message with the PTPv2
      Timestamp flag set to 0, then the Session-Sender MUST use the NTP
      format for the timestamp in the test session, and the Control-
      Client SHOULD set the PTPv2 Timestamp flag to 0 in accordance with
      [<a href="./rfc4656" title='"A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)"'>RFC4656</a>].  If the Session-Sender cannot use NTP timestamps, then
      the Control-Client SHOULD close the TCP connection associated with
      the OWAMP-Control session.

   o  If the Control-Client receives a greeting message with the PTPv2
      Timestamp flag set to 1 and the Session-Sender can set the
      timestamp in PTPv2 format, then the Control-Client MUST set the
      PTPv2 Timestamp flag to 1 in the Modes field in the Set-Up-
      Response message and the Session-Sender MUST use PTPv2 timestamp
      format.

   o  If the Session-Sender doesn't support this extension and can set
      the timestamp in NTP format only, then the PTPv2 Timestamp flag in
      the Modes field in the Set-Up-Response message will be set to 0 as
      part of the Must Be Zero field and the Session-Sender will use the
      NTP format.

   If OWAMP-Control uses Fetch-Session commands, then selection and use
   of one timestamp format or another is a local decision for both
   Session-Sender and Session-Receiver.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Timestamp%20Format%20Negotiation%20in%20TWAMP%20Connection%20Setup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Timestamp Format Negotiation in TWAMP Connection Setup</span>

   In TWAMP-Test [<a href="./rfc5357" title='"A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"'>RFC5357</a>], the Session-Sender interprets collected
   timestamps.  Hence, in the Modes field, a Server advertises timestamp
   formats that the Session-Reflector can use in the TWAMP-Test message.
   The choice of the timestamp format to be used by the Session-Sender
   is a local decision.  The Control-Client inspects the Modes field and
   sets timestamp flag values to indicate the format that will be used
   by the Session-Reflector.  The rules of setting and interpreting flag
   values are as follows:

   o  The Server MUST set the PTPv2 Timestamp flag value to 1 in its
      greeting message if the Session-Reflector can set the timestamp in
      the PTPv2 format.  Otherwise, the PTPv2 Timestamp flag MUST be set
      to 0.

   o  If the value of the PTPv2 Timestamp flag in the received Server
      Greeting message is 0, then the Session-Reflector does not support
      this extension and will use the NTP timestamp format.  The
      Control-Client SHOULD set the PTPv2 Timestamp flag to 0 in the
      Set-Up-Response message in accordance with [<a href="./rfc4656" title='"A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)"'>RFC4656</a>].

   o  The Control-Client MUST set the PTPv2 Timestamp flag value to 1 in
      the Modes field in the Set-Up-Response message if the Server
      advertised that the Session-Reflector has the ability to use the
      PTPv2 format for timestamps.  Otherwise, the flag MUST be set to
      0.

   o  If the value of the PTPv2 Timestamp flag in the Set-Up-Response
      message is 0, then that means that the Session-Sender can only
      interpret the NTP timestamp format.  Therefore, the Session-
      Reflector MUST use the NTP timestamp format.  If the Session-
      Reflector does not support the NTP format, then the Server MUST
      close the TCP connection associated with the TWAMP-Control
      session.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20OWAMP-Test%20and%20TWAMP-Test%20Updates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  OWAMP-Test and TWAMP-Test Updates</span>

   Participants of a test session need to indicate which timestamp
   format is being used.  Currently, the Z field in the Error Estimate
   defined in <a href="./rfc4656#section-4.1.2">Section 4.1.2 of [RFC4656]</a> is used for this purpose.
   However, this document extends the Error Estimate to indicate the
   format of a collected timestamp, in addition to the estimate of error
   and synchronization.  This specification also changes the semantics

   of the Z bit field (the field between S and Scale fields) to be
   referred to as the Timestamp format; the value MUST be set as
   follows:

   o  0 - NTP 64-bit format of a timestamp.

   o  1 - PTPv2-truncated format of a timestamp.

   As a result of this value of the Z field from the Error Estimate, the
   Sender Error Estimate (in TWAMP) or Send Error Estimate (in OWAMP)
   and Receive Error Estimate SHOULD NOT be ignored and MUST be used
   when calculating delay and delay-variation metrics based on collected
   timestamps.

   This document does not specify how the Session-Sender and Session-
   Reflector in TWAMP Light mode are informed of the timestamp format to
   be used.  It is assumed that, for example, configuration could be
   used to direct the Session-Sender and Session-Reflector to use the
   timestamp format per their capabilities and rules listed in

   Use of a particular timestamp format in a test session does not
   appear to introduce any additional security threat to hosts that
   communicate with OWAMP and/or TWAMP as defined in [<a href="./rfc4656" title='"A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)"'>RFC4656</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc5357" title='"A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"'>RFC5357</a>], respectively.  The security considerations that apply to
   any active measurement of live networks are relevant here as well.
   See the Security Considerations sections in [<a href="./rfc4656" title='"A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)"'>RFC4656</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5357" title='"A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"'>RFC5357</a>].
