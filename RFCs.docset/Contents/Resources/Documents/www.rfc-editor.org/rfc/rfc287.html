                        <span class="h1">Status of Network Hosts</span>

     This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from
December 6 to December 18.  Due to hardware debugging, the BBN
prototype Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) was unavailable for most
of the two weeks from November 22 to December 6. There was, therefore,
no Host status reports for that period.

     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.
These Hosts fall into two categories:

   1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on
      the Network as servers (available for use from
      other sites) on a regular basis for at least two
      weeks. Included here are:

   Network
   Address              Site                Computer
   -------              ----                --------

     133                BBN                 PDP-10 (B)
      71                Rand                PDP-10
      13                Case                PDP-10
      15                Ames/(Paoli)        ILLIAC/(B6500)
      16                Ames                IBM-360/67

   2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.
      Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are
      presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).
      This category also includes the Network Control Center
      Computer (Network Address 5) which is used solely for
      gathering statistics from the Network. Finally,
      included among these Hosts are the following:

      19                NBS                 PDP-11

     The NBS Terminal IMP (Network Address 147) was installed in
Washington at the beginning of December.

     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this
period.

----------------
* The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as
such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used
to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

where
D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)
H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)
O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to
    users.)
R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)
T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
    connection within 60 seconds.)

*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a Network
Job Service (NETRJS); however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to
test NETJRS. We are assuming that initial connection to the NETRJS
logger indicates that NETJRS is also functioning.

# These sites advertise that they may not have their systems available
at these times.
