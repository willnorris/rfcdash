                                        Protocol Requirements

This document describes the SPIRITS protocol requirements, based on the
architecture presented in <a href="./rfc3136">RFC 3136</a>.  (SPIRITS stands for "Service in the
PSTN/IN Requesting InTernet Service".)  The purpose of the protocol is
to support services that originate in the Public Switched Telephone
Network (PSTN) and necessitate the interactions between the PSTN and the
Internet.  Similarly, such services are called SPIRITS services.
(Internet Call Waiting, Internet Caller-ID Delivery, and Internet Call
Forwarding are examples of SPIRIT services, but the protocol is to
define the building blocks from which many other services can be built.)
On the PSTN side, the SPIRITS services are initiated from the
Intelligent Network (IN) entities; the earlier IETF work on the
PSTN/Internet Interworking (PINT) resulted in the protocol (<a href="./rfc2848">RFC 2848</a>) in
support of the services initiated the other way around--from the
Internet to PSTN.

To this end, this document lists general requirements for the SPIRITS
protocol as well as those pertinent to IN, Wireless IN, and PINT
building blocks.  The document also presents the SPIRITS WG consensus on
the choice of the SPIRITS signaling protocol.  This memo provides
information for the Internet community.

This document describes a simple, interoperable mechanism that can be
employed in Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) networks
in order to decrease the data loss associated with deterministic
blackholing of packets during transient network conditions.  The
mechanism proposed here requires no IS-IS protocol changes and is
completely interoperable with the existing IS-IS specification.  This

This document defines a format for using compressed data as a
Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) content type.  Compressing data
before transmission provides a number of advantages, including the
elimination of data redundancy which could help an attacker, speeding up
processing by reducing the amount of data to be processed by later steps
(such as signing or encryption), and reducing overall message size.
Although there have been proposals for adding compression at other
levels (for example at the MIME or SSL level), these don't address the
problem of compression of CMS content unless the compression is supplied
by an external means (for example by intermixing MIME and CMS).

multicast and is specified for IPv4 and IPv6.  The IP multicast scope is
limited to link-local multicast.  This document specifies the Mbus
protocol, i.e., message syntax, addressing and transport mechanisms.

When discussing systems for making information accessible through the
Internet in standardized ways, it may be useful if the people who are
discussing it have a common understanding of the terms they use.  For
example, a reference to this document would give one the power to agree
that the DNS (Domain Name System) is a global lookup repository with
perimeter integrity and loose, converging consistency.  On the other
hand, a LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directory server is
a local, centralized repository with both lookup and search capability.
This document discusses one group of such systems which is known under
the term, "directories".  This memo provides information for the
Internet community.

For historical interest, this document captures the EF Design Team's
proposed solution, preferred by the original authors of <a href="./rfc2598">RFC 2598</a> but not
adopted by the working group in December 2000.  The original definition
of EF was based on comparison of forwarding on an unloaded network.
This experimental Delay Bound (DB) PHB requires a bound on the delay of
packets due to other traffic in the network.  At the Pittsburgh IETF
meeting in August 2000, the Differentiated Services working group faced
serious questions regarding <a href="./rfc2598">RFC 2598</a> - the group's standards track
definition of the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per Hop Behavior (PHB).  An
'EF Design Team' volunteered to develop a re-expression of <a href="./rfc2598">RFC 2598</a>,
bearing in mind the issues raised in the DiffServ group.  At the San
Diego IETF meeting in December 2000 the DiffServ working group decided
to pursue an alternative re-expression of the EF PHB.  This memo

HTTP/1.1 defines a Content-MD5 header that allows a server to include a
digest of the response body.  However, this is specifically defined to
cover the body of the actual message, not the contents of the full file
(which might be quite different, if the response is a Content-Range, or
uses a delta encoding).  Also, the Content-MD5 is limited to one
specific digest algorithm; other algorithms, such as SHA-1 (Secure Hash
Standard), may be more appropriate in some circumstances.  Finally,
HTTP/1.1 provides no explicit mechanism by which a client may request a
digest.  This document proposes HTTP extensions that solve these
problems.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

bit in the EDNS0 header to provide that explicit indication and
describes the necessary protocol changes to implement that notification.

This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent
routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile
node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current
point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home,
a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides
information about its current point of attachment to the Internet.  The
protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home agent.
The home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a
tunnel to the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel,
each datagram is then delivered to the mobile node.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) is a reliable multicast transport
protocol for applications that require ordered or unordered, duplicate-
free, multicast data delivery from multiple sources to multiple
receivers.  PGM guarantees that a receiver in the group either receives
all data packets from transmissions and repairs, or is able to detect
unrecoverable data packet loss.  PGM is specifically intended as a
workable solution for multicast applications with basic reliability
requirements.  Its central design goal is simplicity of operation with
due regard for scalability and network efficiency.  This memo defines an

This memo defines an extension of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In
particular, it defines objects for managing the insertion of interesting
Circuit Interfaces into the ifTable.  This is important for circuits
that must be used within other MIB modules which require an ifEntry.  It
allows for integrated monitoring of circuits as well as routing to
circuits using unaltered, pre-existing MIB modules.  [STANDARDS TRACK]
