                          Comments on <a href="./rfc123">RFC 123</a>

The following is my interpretation of the exchange between NCP's which
would be necessary to carry out the Initial Connection Protocol of RFC
123.

     Server NCP                                User NCP
     ----------                                --------

     STR, L, U, 32                                         A

     Send 32 bits of data
     in 1 message on link l

     (value is S)                              Receive 32 bits of data
                                               from link l (value is S)
