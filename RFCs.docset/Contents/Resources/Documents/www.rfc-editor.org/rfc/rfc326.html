                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

     This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from
March 13 to March 24.  During this period the SRI-AI computer
became a server.

     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.
These Hosts fall into two categories:

1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as
servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis for at
least two weeks.  Included here are:

         Network
         Address                Site            Computer
         -------                ----            --------
           134                  MIT-AI          PDP-10
            13                  Case            PDP-10

2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here
are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,
MITRE, NBS, ETAC, and BBN*).  This category also includes the Network
Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is used solely for
gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included among these
Hosts are the following:

         Network
         Address                Site            Computer
         -------                ----            --------
             7                  Rand            IBM-360/65
            73                  Harvard         PDP-1
            12                  Illinois        PDP-11
            19                  NBS             PDP-11

     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for
this period.

*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and
as such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being
used to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

where
D =  Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
     partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)

H =  1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
     immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O =  Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)

R =  Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T =  Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
     connection within 60 seconds.)
________________
*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a Network
 Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to
 test NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection to the NETRJS
 logger indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.

#These sites advertise that they may not have their system available at
 these times.
