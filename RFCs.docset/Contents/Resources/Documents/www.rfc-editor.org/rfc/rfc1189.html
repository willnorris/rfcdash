   This memo is a revision of <a href="./rfc1095">RFC 1095</a> - "The Common Management
   Information Services and Protocol over TCP/IP" [<a href="#ref-27" title='"The Common Management Information Services and Protocol over TCP/IP (CMOT)"'>27</a>].  It defines a
   network management architecture that uses the International
   Organization for Standardization's (ISO) Common Management
   Information Services/Common Management Information Protocol
   (CMIS/CMIP) in the Internet.  This architecture provides a means by
   which control and monitoring information can be exchanged between a
   manager and a remote network element.  In particular, this memo
   defines the means for implementing the International Standard (IS)
   version of CMIS/CMIP on top of both IP-based and OSI-based Internet
   transport protocols for the purpose of carrying management
   information defined in the Internet-standard management information
   base.  Together with the relevant ISO standards and the companion
   RFCs that describe the initial structure of management information
   and management information base, these documents provide the basis
   for a comprehensive architecture and system for managing both IP-
   based and OSI-based internets, and in particular the Internet.

   In creating this revision of <a href="./rfc1095">RFC 1095</a>, the following technical and
   editorial changes were made:

      1) The tutorial section on OSI Management included in <a href="./rfc1095">RFC 1095</a>
         has been removed from this document.  After some revisions,
         the tutorial material may be published as another RFC.

      2) The sections in <a href="./rfc1095">RFC 1095</a> which discussed the semantics of how
         to interpret requests in the context of Internet MIBs has been
         removed from this protocol document.  This topic is now
         discussed in the OIM-MIB-II draft document.  This protocol
         should be useable with MIB-I or MIB-II.  But, it will also be
         able to exploit the new features of the OIM-MIB-II.

      3) This document is based on the final International Standards
         for CMIS/CMIP (ISO 9595/9596) rather than the Draft
         International Standards.

      4) Many of the original agreements defined in <a href="./rfc1095">RFC 1095</a> have been
         accepted and included in the OIW NMSIG implementers agreements.
         Rather than duplicating these agreements, they have been removed
         from this memo.  This document should be read in conjunction
         with ISO 9595/9596 (CMIS/CMIP) and the OIW Stable Agreements
         document.

      5) The Association Negotiation describe in <a href="./rfc1095">RFC 1095</a> has been
         changed to align with current international and national
         agreements.  But, it has retained backwards compatibility with

   This memo is the output of the OSI Internet Management Working Group
   of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  As directed by the
   Internet Activites Board (IAB) in <a href="./rfc1052">RFC 1052</a>, it addresses the need for
   a long-term network management system based on ISO CMIS/CMIP.  This
   memo contains a set of protocol agreements for implementing a network
   management system based on these ISO Management standards.  Now that
   CMIS/CMIP has been voted an International Standard (IS), it has
   become a stable basis for product development.  This profile
   specifies how to apply CMIP to management of both IP-based and OSI-
   based Internet networks.  Network management using ISO CMIP to manage
   IP-based networks will be refered to as "CMIP Over TCP/IP" (CMOT).
   Network management using ISO CMIP to manage OSI-based networks will
   be refered to as "CMIP".  This memo specifies the protocol agreements
   necessary to implement CMIP and accompanying ISO protocols over OSI,
   TCP and UDP transport protocols.

   This memo must be read in conjunction with ISO and Internet documents
   defining specific protocol standards.  Documents defining the
   following ISO standards are required for the implementor: Abstract
   Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Information Processing Systems - Open Systems Interconnection, Specification of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)"'>5</a>, <a href="#ref-6" title='"Information Processing Systems - Open Systems Interconnection, Specification of Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract Notation One (ASN.1)"'>6</a>], Association Control (ACSE) [7,
   8], Remote Operations (ROSE) [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Information processing systems - Text Communication, Remote Operations: Model, Notation and Service Definition"'>9</a>, <a href="#ref-10" title='"Information processing systems - Text Communication, Remote Operations: Protocol Specification"'>10</a>], Common Management Information
   Services (CMIS) [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Information Processing Systems - Open Systems Interconnection, Management Information Service Definition - Part 2: Common Management Information Service"'>11</a>] and Common Management Information Protocol
   (CMIP) [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Information Processing Systems - Open Systems Interconnection, Management Information Protocol Specification - Part 2: Common Management Information Protocol"'>12</a>] with their addenda [32-35].  The specification of a
   lightweight presentation layer protocol is required for use with the
   CMOT section of this profile (see <a href="./rfc1085">RFC 1085</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title='"ISO Presentation Services on top of TCP/IP-based internets"'>13</a>]).  The SMI (see <a href="./rfc1065">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc1065">1065</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>2</a>]), the MIB-I (see <a href="./rfc1066">RFC 1066</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>3</a>]), the MIB-II (see <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a>
   [<a href="#ref-28" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>28</a>]), and the OIM-MIB-II (see [<a href="#ref-29" title='"OIM MIB-II"'>29</a>]) are used with this management
   system.

   This memo is divided into sections for each of the protocols for
   which implementors' agreements are needed: CMISE, ACSE, ROSE, and,
   for CMOT, the lightweight presentation protocol.  The protocol
   profile defined in this memo draws on the technical work of the OSI
   Network Management Forum [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Forum Interoperable Interface Protocols"'>14</a>] and the Network Management Special
   Interest Group (NMSIG) of the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology (NIST) (formerly the National Bureau of Standards) [<a href="#ref-30" title='"NIST Stable Implementers Agreements"'>30</a>].
   Wherever possible, an attempt has been made to either directly
   reference or remain consistent with the protocol agreements reached
   by these groups.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1189">RFC 1189</a>                     CMOT and CMIP                  October 1990</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Protocol%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Protocol Overview</span>

   This part of the document is a specification of the protocols of the
   OIM architecture.  Contained herein are the agreements required to
   implement interoperable network management systems using these
   protocols.  The protocol suite defined by these implementors'
   agreements will facilitate communication between equipment of
   different vendors, suppliers, and networks.  This will allow the
   emergence of powerful multivendor network management based on ISO
   models and protocols.

   The choice of a set of protocol standards together with further
   agreements needed to implement those standards is commonly referred
   to as a "profile."  The selection policy for this profile is to use
   existing standards from the international standards community (ISO
   and CCITT) and the Internet community.  Existing ISO standards and
   draft standards in the area of OSI network management form the basis
   of this profile.  Other ISO application layer standards (ROSE and
   ACSE) are used to support the ISO management protocol (CMIP).  To
   ensure interoperability, certain choices and restrictions are made
   here concerning various options and parameters provided by these
   standards.   Internet standards are used to provide the underlying
   network transport.  These agreements provide a precise statement of
   the implementation choices made for implementing ISO network
   management standards in IP-based and OSI-based internets.

   In addition to the OIM working group, there are at least two other
   bodies actively engaged in defining profiles for interoperable OSI
   network management: the OSI Implementors Workshop (OIW) and the OSI
   Network Management Forum.  Both of these groups are similar to the
   OIM working group in that they are each defining profiles for using
   ISO standards for network management.  Both differ in that they are
   specifying the use only of underlying ISO protocols, while the OIM
   working group is concerned with using OSI management in both OSI and
   TCP/IP networks.  In the interest of greater future compatibility,
   the OIM working group has attempted to make this profile conform as
   closely as possible to the ongoing work of these two bodies.

   This section will describe the CMOT Protocol Suite, the CMIP Protocol
   Suite and Conformance Requirements common to both CMOT and CMIP.
   Later sections will specify the implementers agreements for specific
   layer protocols that comprise the CMOT and CMIP Protocol Suites.

   A CMOT-conformant system must implement the following protocols:
   ACSE, ROSE, CMIP, LPP, and IP.  A CMOT-conformant system must support
   the use of the LPP over either UDP or TCP.  The use of the LPP over
   both UDP and TCP on the same system may be supported.

   A CMIP-conformant system must implement the following protocols:
   ACSE, ROSE, CMIP, ISO Presentation, ISO Session and ISO Transport.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1189">RFC 1189</a>                     CMOT and CMIP                  October 1990</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Common%20Management%20Information%20Service%20Element"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Common Management Information Service Element</span>

   The Common Management Information Service Element (CMISE) is
   specified in two ISO documents.  The service definition for the
   Common Management Information Service (CMIS) is given in ISO 9595
   [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Information Processing Systems - Open Systems Interconnection, Management Information Service Definition - Part 2: Common Management Information Service"'>11</a>].  The protocol specification for the Common Management
   Information Protocol (CMIP) is found in ISO 9596 [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Information Processing Systems - Open Systems Interconnection, Management Information Protocol Specification - Part 2: Common Management Information Protocol"'>12</a>].  In addition,
   the addenda for add/remove support in M-SET [<a href="#ref-32" title='"CMIS Add/Remove Addendum"'>32</a>, <a href="#ref-34" title='"CMIP Add/Remove Addendum"'>34</a>] must be
   supported for both CMOT and CMIP.  The addenda for M-CANCEL-GET [33,
   35] may be supported by an implementation, but it's use is negotiated
   as part of association negotiation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Association%20Policies"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Association Policies</span>

   The following ACSE services are required by CMISE: A-ASSOCIATE, A-
   RELEASE, A-ABORT, and A-P-ABORT.  The rest of the CMIP protocol uses
   the RO-INVOKE, RO-RESULT, RO-ERROR, and RO-REJECT services of ROSE.

   There are four types of association that may be negotiated between
   managing and managed systems.  These types are:

      Event               M-EVENT-REPORTs may be sent by the

                          are allowed

      Event/Monitor       same as Event type except that, in
                          addition, the managing system may
                          also issue M-GET requests and
                          receive M-GET responses over the
                          association

      Monitor/Control     managing system may issue M-GET,
                          M-SET, M-CREATE, M-DELETE and
                          M-ACTION requests over the
                          association; no event reporting is
                          allowed

      Full Mgr/Agent      all functions must be supported

   A conformant system  must support at least one of these Association
   types.  Note that a system may play both managing and managed system
   roles, but not on the same association.

   The negotiation process uses the A-ASSOCIATE and A-RELEASE services.
   Application Context Name is used to determine the requestor's "role"
   in an association (as managing or managed system) and to determine
   the type of the association.

   The following values for Application Context Name are registered for
   for CMOT and CMIP:

      {iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
           internet(1) mgmt(2) mib(1) oim(9) acn(1)

           (for backwards compatible negotiation with <a href="./rfc1095">RFC 1095</a> CMOT
           implementations)

      {iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
           internet(1) mgmt(2) mib(1) oim(9) acn(1)
           manager-event-association(2)}

      {iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
           internet(1) mgmt(2) mib(1) oim(9) acn(1)
           manager-event-monitor-association(3)}

      {iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
           internet(1) mgmt(2) mib(1) oim(9) acn(1)
           manager-monitor-control-association(4)}

      {iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
           internet(1) mgmt(2) mib(1) oim(9) acn(1)
           manager-full-association(5)}

      {iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
           internet(1) mgmt(2) mib(1) oim(9) acn(1)
           agent-event-association(6)}

   The following negotiation rules are to be used:

      1.   A managed system may only request an Event
           association and, in fact, must create an Event
           association if it has an event to report and no
           suitable association already exists.

      2.   Managing systems may request any association type.

      3.   An association is created by the requesting system
           issuing an A-ASSOCIATE request with the
           requestor's AE-TITLE and the desired application
           context.  The responding system then returns
           either 1) an A-ASSOCIATE response with the
           requestor's AE-TITLE and the application context
           which it wishes to accept or 2) an A-ASSOCIATE
           response rejecting the association.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1189">RFC 1189</a>                     CMOT and CMIP                  October 1990</span>


      4.   Managed systems may negotiate "downward" from
           Full to Monitor/Control, Event/Monitor or Event by
           returning the new application context in the
           A-ASSOCIATE response to the managing system during
           the association creation process.  In the same
           fashion, managed systems may negotiate from
           Event/Monitor to Event.

      5.   When a managing system receives an application
           context in an A-ASSOCIATE response that differs
           from the context sent in an A-ASSOCIATE request it
           may either proceed with the new context or refuse
           the new context by issuing an A-RELEASE request.

   A-RELEASE is used when the requestor does not agree with the new
   context.  A-ABORT is used for invalid negotiation.  If A-ABORT were
   to be used to terminate an association, there exists the potential
   for loss of information, such as pending events or confirmations.
   A-ABORT must be used, however, when a protocol violation occurs or
   where an association is not yet established.

   OIW Stable Agreements [<a href="#ref-30" title='"NIST Stable Implementers Agreements"'>30</a>] <a href="#section-18.6.2">section 18.6.2</a>.

   The following additional agreements are specified.

      o A system need only implement the services and service
        primitives required for the association types (<a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>)
        that it supports.

      o Current/Event times shall be fields shall use 1 millisecond
        granularity.  If the system generating the PDU does not have
        the current time, yet does have the time since last boot, then
        GeneralizedTime can be used to encode this information.  The
        time since last boot will be added to the base time "0001
        Jan 1 00:00:00.00" using the Gregorian calendar algorithm.
        (In the Gregorian calendar, all years have 365 days except
        those divisible by 4 and not by 400, which have 366.)  The use
        of the year 1 as the base year will prevent any confusion
        with current time.

        If no meaningful time is available, then the year 0 shall be
        used in GeneralizedTime to indicate this fact.

   The CMIS and CMIP implementers agreements documented in the OIW
   Stable Implementers Agreements [<a href="#ref-30" title='"NIST Stable Implementers Agreements"'>30</a>] plus those mandated by the CMIP
   standard will be used for both CMOT and CMIP.  In addition to these

   observed:

      o An implementation is required to support all filter items
        except subsetOf, supersetOf, nonNullSetIntersection, and
        substrings.

      o The "managedObjectInstance" field must be present in the

        field must be present in the NoSuchArgument Error PDU.


   [Temporary Note:  The CMIS/P implementers agreements have reach a
   fairly stable status in the OIW working agreements document.  It is
   expected that the CMIS/P agreements (18.6.2 and 18.6.3) will be
   recommended to be moved into the stable agreements document during
