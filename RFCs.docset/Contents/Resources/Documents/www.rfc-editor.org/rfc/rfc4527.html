Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory
   Access Protocol (LDAP) to allow the client to read the target entry
   of an update operation.  The client may request to read the entry
   before and/or after the modifications are applied.  These reads are
   done as an atomic part of the update operation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Background%20and%20Intent%20of%20Use"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Background and Intent of Use</span>

   This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory
   Access Protocol (LDAP) [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>] to allow the client to read the
   target entry of an update operation (e.g., Add, Delete, Modify,
   ModifyDN).  The extension utilizes controls [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] attached to
   update requests to request and return copies of the target entry.
   One request control, called the Pre-Read request control, indicates
   that a copy of the entry before application of update is to be
   returned.  Another control, called the Post-Read request control,
   indicates that a copy of the entry after application of the update is
   to be returned.  Each request control has a corresponding response
   control used to return the entry.

   To ensure proper isolation, the controls are processed as an atomic
   part of the update operation.

   The functionality offered by these controls is based upon similar
   functionality in the X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [<a href="#ref-X.511" title='"The Directory: Abstract Service Definition"'>X.511</a>].

   The Pre-Read controls may be used to obtain replaced or deleted
   values of modified attributes or a copy of the entry being deleted.

   The Post-Read controls may be used to obtain values of operational
   attributes, such as the 'entryUUID' [<a href="./rfc4530" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) EntryUUID Operational Attribute"'>RFC4530</a>] and 'modifyTimestamp'
   [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>] attributes, updated by the server as part of the update
   operation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Terminology</span>

   Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-X.680" title='"Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) - Specification of Basic Notation"'>X.680</a>] with implicit
   tags.  The term "BER-encoded" means the element is to be encoded
   using the Basic Encoding Rules [<a href="#ref-X.690" title='"Specification of ASN.1 encoding rules: Basic Encoding Rules (BER), Canonical Encoding Rules (CER), and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)"'>X.690</a>] under the restrictions
   detailed in <a href="./rfc4511#section-5.1">SectionÂ 5.1 of [RFC4511]</a>.

   DN stands for Distinguished Name.
   DSA stands for Directory System Agent (i.e., a directory server).
   DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Read%20Entry%20Controls"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Read Entry Controls</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20The%20Pre-Read%20Controls"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  The Pre-Read Controls</span>

   The Pre-Read request and response controls are identified by the
   1.3.6.1.1.13.1 object identifier.  Servers implementing these
   controls SHOULD publish 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 as a value of the
   'supportedControl' [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>] in their root DSE.

   The Pre-Read request control is a LDAP Control [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] whose
   controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 and whose controlValue is a BER-encoded
   AttributeSelection [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>], as extended by [<a href="./rfc3673" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAPv3): All Operational Attributes"'>RFC3673</a>].  The
   criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.  This control is appropriate for
   the modifyRequest, delRequest, and modDNRequest LDAP messages.

   The corresponding response control is a LDAP Control whose
   controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 and whose the controlValue, an OCTET
   STRING, contains a BER-encoded SearchResultEntry.  The criticality
   may be TRUE or FALSE.  This control is appropriate for the
   modifyResponse, delResponse, and modDNResponse LDAP messages with a
   resultCode of success (0).

   When the request control is attached to an appropriate update LDAP
   request, the control requests the return of a copy of the target
   entry prior to the application of the update.  The AttributeSelection
   indicates, as discussed in [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>][RFC3673], which attributes are
   requested to appear in the copy.  The server is to return a
   SearchResultEntry containing, subject to access controls and other
   constraints, values of the requested attributes.

   The normal processing of the update operation and the processing of
   this control MUST be performed as one atomic action isolated from
   other update operations.

   If the update operation fails (in either normal or control
   processing), no Pre-Read response control is provided.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20The%20Post-Read%20Controls"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  The Post-Read Controls</span>

   The Post-Read request and response controls are identified by the
   1.3.6.1.1.13.2 object identifier.  Servers implementing these
   controls SHOULD publish 1.3.6.1.1.13.2 as a value of the
   'supportedControl' [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>] in their root DSE.

   The Post-Read request control is a LDAP Control [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] whose
   controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.2 and whose controlValue, an OCTET

   extended by [<a href="./rfc3673" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAPv3): All Operational Attributes"'>RFC3673</a>].  The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.  This

   control is appropriate for the addRequest, modifyRequest, and
   modDNRequest LDAP messages.

   The corresponding response control is a LDAP Control whose
   controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.2 and whose controlValue is a BER-encoded
   SearchResultEntry.  The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.  This
   control is appropriate for the addResponse, modifyResponse, and

   When the request control is attached to an appropriate update LDAP
   request, the control requests the return of a copy of the target
   entry after the application of the update.  The AttributeSelection

   The Pre-Read and Post-Read controls may be combined with each other
   and/or with a variety of other controls.  When combined with the
   assertion control [<a href="./rfc4528" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Assertion Control"'>RFC4528</a>] and/or the manageDsaIT control [<a href="./rfc3296" title='"Named Subordinate References in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Directories"'>RFC3296</a>],
   the semantics of each control included in the combination applies.
   The Pre-Read and Post-Read controls may be combined with other
   controls as detailed in other technical specifications.

   The controls defined in this document extend update operations to
   support read capabilities.  Servers MUST ensure that the client is
   authorized for reading of the information provided in this control
   and that the client is authorized to perform the requested directory
   update.

   Security considerations for the update operations [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] extended
   by this control, as well as general LDAP security considerations
   [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>], generally apply to implementation and use of this
   extension
