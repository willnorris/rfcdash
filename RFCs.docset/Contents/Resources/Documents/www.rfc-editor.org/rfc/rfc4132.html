Abstract

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support the Camellia
   encryption algorithm as a bulk cipher algorithm.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
   protocol [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] to support the Camellia encryption algorithm as a bulk
   cipher algorithm.  This proposal provides a new option for fast and
   efficient bulk cipher algorithms.

   Note: This work was done when the first author worked for NTT.

   Camellia was selected as a recommended cryptographic primitive by the
   EU NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and
   Encryption) project [<a href="#ref-NESSIE" title="Integrity and Encryption)">NESSIE</a>] and included in the list of
   cryptographic techniques for Japanese e-Government systems, which
   were selected by the Japan CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and
   Evaluation Committees) [<a href="#ref-CRYPTREC" title=" CRYPTREC">CRYPTREC</a>].  Camellia is also included in
   specification of the TV-Anytime Forum [<a href="#ref-TV-ANYTIME">TV-ANYTIME</a>].  The TV-Anytime
   Forum is an association of organizations that seeks to develop

   specifications to enable audio-visual and other services based on
   mass-market high-volume digital storage in consumer platforms.
   Camellia is specified as Cipher Suite in TLS used by Phase 1 S-7
   (Bi-directional Metadata Delivery Protection) specification and S-5
   (TV-Anytime Rights Management and Protection Information for
   Broadcast Applications) specification.  Camellia has been submitted
   to other several standardization bodies such as ISO (ISO/IEC 18033)
   and IETF S/MIME Mail Security Working Group [<a href="#ref-Camellia-CMS" title='"Use of the Camellia Encryption Algorithm in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>Camellia-CMS</a>].

   Camellia supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key
   sizes; i.e., the same interface specifications as the Advanced
   Encryption Standard (AES) [<a href="#ref-AES" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)"'>AES</a>].

   Camellia was jointly developed by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric
   Corporation in 2000 [<a href="#ref-CamelliaTech" title='"Camellia: A 128-Bit Block Cipher Suitable for Multiple Platforms - Design and Analysis -"'>CamelliaTech</a>].  It was carefully designed to
   withstand all known cryptanalytic attacks and even to have a
   sufficiently large security leeway.  It has been scrutinized by
   worldwide cryptographic experts.

   Camellia was also designed to be suitable for both software and
   hardware implementations and to cover all possible encryption
   applications, from low-cost smart cards to high-speed network
   systems.  Compared to the AES, Camellia offers at least comparable
   encryption speed in software and hardware.  In addition, a
   distinguishing feature is its small hardware design.  Camellia
   perfectly meets one of the current TLS market requirements, for which
   low power consumption is mandatory.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [<a href="#ref-Camellia-Desc" title='"A Description of the Camellia Encryption Algorithm"'>Camellia-Desc</a>].  The Camellia homepage,
   <a href="http://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/camellia/">http://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/camellia/</a>, contains a wealth of information
   about camellia, including detailed specification, security analysis,
   performance figures, reference implementation, and test vectors.

   All the cipher suites described here use Camellia in cipher block
   chaining (CBC) mode as a bulk cipher algorithm.  Camellia is a 128-
   bit block cipher with 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key sizes; i.e., it
   supports the same block and key sizes as the Advanced Encryption
   Standard (AES).  However, this document only defines cipher suites
   for 128- and 256-bit keys as well as AES cipher suites for TLS
   [<a href="#ref-AES-TLS" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>AES-TLS</a>].  These cipher suites are efficient and practical enough
   for most uses, including high-security applications.

   All the cipher suites described here use SHA-1 [<a href="#ref-SHA-1" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>SHA-1</a>] in a Hashed
   Message Authentication Code (HMAC) construction, as described in
   section 5 of [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>].

   The cipher suites defined here differ in the type of certificate and
   key exchange method.  They use the following options:

   It is not believed that the new cipher suites are ever less secure
   than the corresponding older ones.  Camellia is considered secure,
   and it has withstood extensive cryptanalytic efforts in several open,
   worldwide cryptographic evaluation projects [<a href="#ref-CRYPTREC" title=" CRYPTREC">CRYPTREC</a>][NESSIE].

   At the time of writing this document, there are no known weak keys
   for Camellia.

   For other security considerations, please refer to the security
   considerations of the corresponding older cipher suites described in
   [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] and [<a href="#ref-AES-TLS" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>AES-TLS</a>].
