   This document defines the syntax for private-key information and a
   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [<a href="./rfc5652" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5652</a>] content type for it.
   Private-key information includes a private key for a specified
   public-key algorithm and a set of attributes.  The CMS can be used to
   digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt the asymmetric key
   format content type.  This document obsoletes PKCS #8 v1.2 [<a href="./rfc5208" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification Version 1.2"'>RFC5208</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The key package is defined using ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-X.680">X.680</a>], [<a href="#ref-X.681">X.681</a>], [<a href="#ref-X.682">X.682</a>], and

   The following summarizes the updates to [<a href="./rfc5208" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification Version 1.2"'>RFC5208</a>]:

   - Changed the name "PrivateKeyInfo" to "OneAsymmetricKey".  This
     reflects the addition of the publicKey field to allow both parts of
     the asymmetric key to be conveyed separately.  Not all algorithms
     will use both fields; however, the publicKey field was added for
     completeness.

   - Defined Asymmetric Key Package CMS content type.

   - Removed redundant IMPLICIT from attributes.

   - Added publicKey to OneAsymmetricKey and updated the version number.

   - Added that PKCS #9 attributes may be supported.

   - Added discussion of compatibility with other private-key formats.

   - Added requirements for encoding rule set.

   - Changed imports from PKCS #5 to [<a href="./rfc5912" title='"New ASN.1 Modules for the Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX)"'>RFC5912</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5911" title='"New ASN.1 Modules for Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and S/MIME"'>RFC5911</a>].

   - Replaced ALGORITHM-IDENTIFIER with ALGORITHM from [<a href="./rfc5912" title='"New ASN.1 Modules for the Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX)"'>RFC5912</a>].

   - Registers application/pkcs8 media type and .p8 file extension.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Asymmetric%20Key%20Package%20CMS%20Content%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Asymmetric Key Package CMS Content Type</span>

   The asymmetric key package CMS content type is used to transfer one
   or more plaintext asymmetric keys from one party to another.  An
   asymmetric key package MAY be encapsulated in one or more CMS
   protecting content types (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).  Earlier versions of this
   specification [<a href="./rfc5208" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification Version 1.2"'>RFC5208</a>] did not specify a particular encoding rule
   set, but generators SHOULD use DER [<a href="#ref-X.690">X.690</a>] and receivers MUST support
   BER [<a href="#ref-X.690">X.690</a>], which also includes DER [<a href="#ref-X.690">X.690</a>].

   The asymmetric key package content type has the following syntax:

     ct-asymmetric-key-package CONTENT-TYPE ::=
       { AsymmetricKeyPackage IDENTIFIED BY id-ct-KP-aKeyPackage }

     id-ct-KP-aKeyPackage OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
       { joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1)
         gov(101) dod(2) infosec(1) formats(2)
         key-package-content-types(78) 5
       }

     AsymmetricKeyPackage ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF OneAsymmetricKey

     OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
       version                   Version,
       privateKeyAlgorithm       PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier,
       privateKey                PrivateKey,
       attributes            [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
       ...,
       [[2: publicKey        [1] PublicKey OPTIONAL ]],
       ...
     }

     PrivateKeyInfo ::= OneAsymmetricKey

     -- PrivateKeyInfo is used by [<a href="#ref-P12" title='"PKCS #12 v1.0: Personal Information Exchange Syntax"'>P12</a>].  If any items tagged as version
     -- 2 are used, the version must be v2, else the version should be
     -- v1.  When v1, PrivateKeyInfo is the same as it was in [<a href="./rfc5208" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification Version 1.2"'>RFC5208</a>].

     Version ::= INTEGER { v1(0), v2(1) } (v1, ..., v2)

     PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier
                                        { PUBLIC-KEY,
                                          { PrivateKeyAlgorithms } }

     PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING
                        -- Content varies based on type of key.  The
                        -- algorithm identifier dictates the format of
                        -- the key.

     PublicKey ::= BIT STRING
                        -- Content varies based on type of key.  The
                        -- algorithm identifier dictates the format of
                        -- the key.

     Attributes ::= SET OF Attribute { { OneAsymmetricKeyAttributes } }

   The AsymmetricKeyPackage contains one or more OneAsymmetricKey
   elements.

   The syntax of OneAsymmetricKey accommodates a version number, an
   indication of the asymmetric algorithm to be used with the private
   key, a private key, optional keying material attributes (e.g.,
   userCertificate from [<a href="#ref-X.520">X.520</a>]), and an optional public key.  In
   general, either the public key or the certificate will be present.
   In very rare cases will both the public key and the certificate be
   present as this includes two copies of the public key.
   OneAsymmetricKey renames the PrivateKeyInfo syntax defined in
   [<a href="./rfc5208" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification Version 1.2"'>RFC5208</a>].  The new name better reflects the ability to carry both
   private- and public-key components.  Backwards compatibility with the
   original PrivateKeyInfo is preserved via version number.  The fields
   in OneAsymmetricKey are used as follows:

   - version identifies the version of OneAsymmetricKey.  If publicKey
     is present, then version is set to v2 else version is set to v1.

   - privateKeyAlgorithm identifies the private-key algorithm and
     optionally contains parameters associated with the asymmetric key
     pair.  The algorithm is identified by an object identifier (OID)
     and the format of the parameters depends on the OID, but the
     PrivateKeyAlgorithms information object set restricts the

     permissible OIDs.  The value placed in
     privateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier is the value an originator would
     apply to indicate which algorithm is to be used with the private
     key.

   - privateKey is an OCTET STRING that contains the value of the
     private key.  The interpretation of the content is defined in the
     registration of the private-key algorithm.  For example, a DSA key
     is an INTEGER, an RSA key is represented as RSAPrivateKey as
     defined in [<a href="./rfc3447" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.1"'>RFC3447</a>], and an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) key
     is represented as ECPrivateKey as defined in [<a href="./rfc5915" title='"Elliptic Curve Private Key Structure"'>RFC5915</a>].

   - attributes is OPTIONAL.  It contains information corresponding to
     the public key (e.g., certificates).  The attributes field uses the
     class ATTRIBUTE which is restricted by the
     OneAsymmetricKeyAttributes information object set.
     OneAsymmetricKeyAttributes is an open ended set in this document.
     Others documents can constrain these values.  Attributes from
     [<a href="./rfc2985" title='"PKCS #9: Selected Object Classes and Attribute Types Version 2.0"'>RFC2985</a>] MAY be supported.

   - publicKey is OPTIONAL.  When present, it contains the public key
     encoded in a BIT STRING.  The structure within the BIT STRING, if
     any, depends on the privateKeyAlgorithm.  For example, a DSA key is
     an INTEGER.  Note that RSA public keys are included in
     RSAPrivateKey (i.e., n and e are present), as per [<a href="./rfc3447" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.1"'>RFC3447</a>], and
     ECC public keys are included in ECPrivateKey (i.e., in the
     publicKey field), as per [<a href="./rfc5915" title='"Elliptic Curve Private Key Structure"'>RFC5915</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Encrypted%20Private%20Key%20Info"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Encrypted Private Key Info</span>

   This section gives the syntax for encrypted private-key information,
   which is used by [<a href="#ref-P12" title='"PKCS #12 v1.0: Personal Information Exchange Syntax"'>P12</a>].

   Encrypted private-key information shall have ASN.1 type
   EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo:

     EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
       encryptionAlgorithm  EncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
       encryptedData        EncryptedData }

     EncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier
                                        { CONTENT-ENCRYPTION,
                                          { KeyEncryptionAlgorithms } }

     EncryptedData ::= OCTET STRING

   The fields in EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo are used as follows:

   - encryptionAlgorithm identifies the algorithm under which the
     private-key information is encrypted.

   - encryptedData is the result of encrypting the private-key
     information  (i.e., the PrivateKeyInfo).

   The encryption process involves the following two steps:

   1. The private-key information is encoded, yielding an octet string.
      Generators SHOULD use DER [<a href="#ref-X.690">X.690</a>] and receivers MUST support BER
      [<a href="#ref-X.690">X.690</a>], which also includes DER [<a href="#ref-X.690">X.690</a>].

   2. The result of step 1 is encrypted with the secret key to give an
      octet string, the result of the encryption process.

   CMS protecting content types, [<a href="./rfc5652" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5652</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5083" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type"'>RFC5083</a>], can be used to
   provide security to the AsymmetricKeyPackage:

   - SignedData can be used to apply a digital signature to the
     AsymmetricKeyPackage.

   - EncryptedData can be used to encrypt the AsymmetricKeyPackage with
     symmetric encryption, where the sender and the receiver already
     share the necessary encryption key.

   - EnvelopedData can be used to encrypt the AsymmetricKeyPackage with
     symmetric encryption, where the sender and the receiver do not
     share the necessary encryption key.

   - AuthenticatedData can be used to protect the AsymmetricKeyPackage
     with message authentication codes, where key management information
     is handled in a manner similar to EnvelopedData.

   - AuthEnvelopedData can be used to protect the AsymmetricKeyPackage
     with algorithms that support authenticated encryption, where key
     management information is handled in a manner similar to
     EnvelopedData.

   This document defines the syntax and the semantics for a content type
   that exchanges asymmetric private keys.  There are two other formats
   that have been used for the transport of asymmetric private keys:

   - Personal Information Exchange (PFX) Syntax Standard [<a href="#ref-P12" title='"PKCS #12 v1.0: Personal Information Exchange Syntax"'>P12</a>], which is
     more commonly referred to as PKCS #12 or simply P12, is a transfer
     syntax for personal identity information, including private keys,
     certificates, miscellaneous secrets, and extensions.
     OneAsymmetricKey, PrivateKeyInfo, and EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo can
     be carried in a P12 message.  The private key information,
     OneAsymmetricKey and PrivateKeyInfo, are carried in the P12 keyBag
     BAG-TYPE.  EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo is carried in the P12
     pkcs8ShroudedKeyBag BAG-TYPE.  In current implementations, the file
     extensions .pfx and .p12 can be used interchangeably.

   - Microsoft's private-key proprietary transfer syntax.  The .pvk file
     extension is used for local storage.

   The .pvk and .p12/.pfx formats are not interchangeable; however,
   conversion tools exist to convert from one format to another.

   To extract the private-key information from the AsymmetricKeyPackage,
   the encapsulating layers need to be removed.  At a minimum, the outer
   ContentInfo [<a href="./rfc5652" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5652</a>] layer needs to be removed.  If the
   AsymmetricKeyPackage is encapsulated in a SignedData [<a href="./rfc5652" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5652</a>], then
   the SignedData and EncapsulatedContentInfo layers [<a href="./rfc5652" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5652</a>] also need
   to be removed.  The same is true for EnvelopedData, EncryptedData,
   and AuthenticatedData all from [<a href="./rfc5652" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5652</a>] as well as AuthEnvelopedData
   from [<a href="./rfc5083" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type"'>RFC5083</a>].  Once all the outer layers are removed, there are as
   many sets of private-key information as there are OneAsymmetricKey
   structures.  OneAsymmetricKey and PrivateKeyInfo are the same
   structure; therefore, either can be saved as a .p8 file or copied in
   to the P12 KeyBag BAG-TYPE.  Removing encapsulating security layers
   will invalidate any signature and may expose the key to unauthorized
   disclosure.

   .p8 files are sometimes PEM-encoded.  When .p8 files are PEM encoded
   they use the .pem file extension.  PEM encoding is either the Base64
   encoding, from <a href="./rfc4648#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC4648]</a>, of the DER-encoded
   EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo sandwiched between:

   -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
   -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----

   or the Base64 encoding, see <a href="./rfc4648#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC4648]</a>, of the DER-
   encoded PrivateKeyInfo sandwiched between:

   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

   Protection of the private-key information is vital to public-key
   cryptography.  Disclosure of the private-key material to another
   entity can lead to masquerades.  The encryption algorithm used in the
   encryption process must be as 'strong' as the key it is protecting.

   The asymmetric key package contents are not protected.  This content
   type can be combined with a security protocol to protect the contents
   of the package.
