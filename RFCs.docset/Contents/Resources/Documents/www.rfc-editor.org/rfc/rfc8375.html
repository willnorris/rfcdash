Abstract

   This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain
   Name System with regard to DNS queries for names ending with
   '.home.arpa.' and designates this domain as a special-use domain
   name. 'home.arpa.' is designated for non-unique use in residential
   home networks.  The Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP) is
   updated to use the 'home.arpa.' domain instead of '.home'.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8375">RFC 8375</a>                       home.arpa.                       May 2018</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Users and devices within a home network (hereafter referred to as
   "homenet") require devices and services to be identified by names
   that are unique within the boundaries of the homenet [<a href="./rfc7368" title='"IPv6 Home Networking Architecture Principles"'>RFC7368</a>].  The
   naming mechanism needs to function without configuration from the
   user.  While it may be possible for a name to be delegated by an ISP,
   homenets must also function in the absence of such a delegation.
   This document reserves the name 'home.arpa.' to serve as the default
   name for this purpose, with a scope limited to each individual
   homenet.

   This document corrects an error in [<a href="./rfc7788" title='"Home Networking Control Protocol"'>RFC7788</a>] by replacing '.home'
   with 'home.arpa.' as the default domain name for homenets. '.home'
   was selected as the most user-friendly option; however, there are
   existing uses of '.home' that may be in conflict with this use.
   Evidence indicates that '.home' queries frequently leak out and reach
   the root name servers [<a href="#ref-ICANN1" title='"New gTLD Collision Risk Mitigation"'>ICANN1</a>] [<a href="#ref-ICANN2" title='"New gTLD Collision Occurence Management"'>ICANN2</a>].

   In addition, for compatibility with DNSSEC (see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>), it's
   necessary that an insecure delegation (see <a href="./rfc4035#section-4.3">Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]</a>)
   be present for the name.  There is an existing process for allocating
   names under '.arpa.'  [<a href="./rfc3172" title='"Management Guidelines &amp; Operational Requirements for the Address and Routing Parameter Area Domain ("'>RFC3172</a>].  No such process is available for
   requesting a similar delegation in the root at the request of the
   IETF, which does not administer that zone.  As a result, all
   unregistered uses of '.home' (that is, all current uses at the time
   of this document's publication), particularly as specified in
   [<a href="./rfc7788" title='"Home Networking Control Protocol"'>RFC7788</a>], are deprecated.

   This document registers the domain 'home.arpa.' as a special-use
   domain name [<a href="./rfc6761" title='"Special-Use Domain Names"'>RFC6761</a>] and specifies the behavior that is expected
   from the Domain Name System with regard to DNS queries for names
   whose rightmost non-terminal labels are 'home.arpa.'.  Queries for
   names ending with '.home.arpa.' are of local significance within the
   scope of a homenet, meaning that identical queries will result in
   different results from one homenet to another.  In other words, a
   name ending in '.home.arpa.' is not globally unique.

   Although this document makes specific reference to [<a href="./rfc7788" title='"Home Networking Control Protocol"'>RFC7788</a>], it is
   not intended that the use of 'home.arpa.' be restricted solely to
   networks where HNCP is deployed.  Rather, 'home.arpa.' is intended to
   be the correct domain for uses like the one described for '.home' in
   [<a href="./rfc7788" title='"Home Networking Control Protocol"'>RFC7788</a>]: local name service in residential homenets.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20General%20Guidance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  General Guidance</span>

   The domain name 'home.arpa.' is to be used for naming within
   residential homenets.  Names ending with '.home.arpa.' reference a
   zone that is served locally, the contents of which are unique only to
   a particular homenet and are not globally unique.  Such names refer
   to nodes and/or services that are located within a homenet (e.g., a
   printer or a toaster).

   DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are resolved using
   local resolvers on the homenet.  Such queries MUST NOT be recursively
   forwarded to servers outside the logical boundaries of the homenet.

   Some service discovery user interfaces that are expected to be used
   on homenets conceal information such as domain names from end users.
   However, in some cases, it is still expected that users will need to
   see, remember, and even type names ending with '.home.arpa.'.  The
   Homenet Working Group hopes that this name will in some way indicate
   to as many readers as possible that such domain names are referring
   to devices in the home, but we recognize that it is an imperfect
   solution.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Domain%20Name%20Reservation%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations</span>

   This section specifies considerations for systems involved in domain
   name resolution when resolving queries for names ending with
   '.home.arpa.'.  Each item in this section addresses some aspect of
   the DNS or the process of resolving domain names that would be
   affected by this special-use allocation.  Detailed explanations of
   these items can be found in <a href="./rfc6761#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC6761]</a>.  Although the
   term 'homenet' in [<a href="./rfc7788" title='"Home Networking Control Protocol"'>RFC7788</a>] refers to home networks that implement a
   particular set of features, in this document the term is used to mean
   any home network, regardless of the set of features it implements.

   1.  Users can use names ending with '.home.arpa.' just as they would
       use any other domain name.  The 'home.arpa.' name is chosen to be
       readily recognized by users as signifying that the name is
       addressing a service on the homenet to which the user's device is
       connected.




<span class="grey">Pfister &amp; Lemon              Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8375">RFC 8375</a>                       home.arpa.                       May 2018</span>


   2.  Application software SHOULD NOT treat names ending in
       '.home.arpa.' differently than other names.  In particular, there
       is no basis for trusting names that are subdomains of
       'home.arpa.' (see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>).

   3.  Name resolution APIs and libraries MUST NOT recognize names that
       end in '.home.arpa.' as special and MUST NOT treat them as having
       special significance, except that it may be necessary that such
       APIs not bypass the locally configured recursive resolvers.

       One or more IP addresses for recursive DNS servers will usually
       be supplied to the client through router advertisements or DHCP.
       For an administrative domain that uses subdomains of
       'home.arpa.', such as a homenet, the recursive resolvers provided
       by that domain will be able to answer queries for subdomains of
       'home.arpa.'; other resolvers will not, or they will provide
       answers that are not correct within that administrative domain.

       A host that is configured to use a resolver other than one that
       has been provided by the local network may be unable to resolve,
       or may receive incorrect results for, subdomains of 'home.arpa.'.
       In order to avoid this, it is permissible that hosts use the
       resolvers that are locally provided for resolving 'home.arpa.',
       even when they are configured to use other resolvers.

   4.  There are three considerations for recursive resolvers that
       follow this specification:

       A.  Recursive resolvers at sites using 'home.arpa.'  MUST
           transparently support DNSSEC queries: queries for DNSSEC
           records and queries with the DNSSEC OK (DO) bit set (see
           <a href="./rfc4035#section-3.2.1">Section 3.2.1 of [RFC4035]</a>).  While validation is not
           required, it is strongly encouraged: a caching recursive
           resolver that does not validate answers that can be validated
           may cache invalid data.  This, in turn, will prevent
           validating stub resolvers from successfully validating
           answers.

       B.  Unless configured otherwise, recursive resolvers and DNS
           proxies MUST behave as described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of the Locally
           Served Zones document [<a href="./rfc6303" title='"Locally Served DNS Zones"'>RFC6303</a>].  That is, queries for
           'home.arpa.' and subdomains of 'home.arpa.'  MUST NOT be
           forwarded, with one important exception: a query for a DS
           record with the DO bit set MUST return the correct answer for
           that question, including correct information in the authority
           section that proves that the record is nonexistent.





<span class="grey">Pfister &amp; Lemon              Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8375">RFC 8375</a>                       home.arpa.                       May 2018</span>


           So, for example, a query for the NS record for 'home.arpa.'
           MUST NOT result in that query being forwarded to an upstream
           cache nor to the authoritative DNS server for '.arpa.'.
           However, as necessary to provide accurate authority
           information, a query for the DS record MUST result in
           forwarding whatever queries are necessary; typically, this
           will just be a query for the DS record, since the necessary
           authority information will be included in the authority
           section of the response if the DO bit is set.

       C.  In addition to the behavior specified above, recursive
           resolvers that can be used in a homenet MUST be configurable
           to forward queries for 'home.arpa.' and subdomains of
           'home.arpa.' to an authoritative server for 'home.arpa.'.
           This server will provide authoritative data for 'home.arpa.'
           within a particular homenet.  The special handling for DS
           records for the 'home.arpa.' delegation is still required.

           It is permissible to combine the recursive resolver function
           for general DNS lookups with an authoritative resolver for
           'home.arpa.'; in this case, rather than forwarding queries
           for subdomains of 'home.arpa.' to an authoritative server,
           the resolver answers them authoritatively.  The behavior with
           respect to forwarding queries specifically for 'home.arpa.'
           remains the same.

   5.  No special processing of 'home.arpa.' is required for
       authoritative DNS server implementations.  It is possible that an
       authoritative DNS server might attempt to check the authoritative
       servers for 'home.arpa.' for a delegation beneath that name
       before answering authoritatively for such a delegated name.  In
       such a case, because the name always has only local significance,
       there will be no such delegation in the 'home.arpa.' zone, and so
       the server would refuse to answer authoritatively for such a
       zone.  A server that implements this sort of check MUST be
       configurable so that either it does not do this check for the
       'home.arpa.' domain or it ignores the results of the check.

   6.  DNS server operators MAY configure an authoritative server for
       'home.arpa.' for use in homenets and other home networks.  The
       operator for the DNS servers authoritative for 'home.arpa.' in
       the global DNS will configure any such servers as described in
       <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   7.  'home.arpa.' is a subdomain of the 'arpa' top-level domain, which
       is operated by IANA under the authority of the Internet
       Architecture Board according to the rules established in
       [<a href="./rfc3172" title='"Management Guidelines &amp; Operational Requirements for the Address and Routing Parameter Area Domain ("'>RFC3172</a>].  There are no other registrars for '.arpa'.

   The final paragraph in <a href="./rfc7788#section-8">Section 8 of [RFC7788]</a>, the Home Networking
   Control Protocol, is updated as follows:

   OLD:
      Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide
      naming and service discovery with local significance.  A network-
      wide zone is appended to all single labels or unqualified zones in
      order to qualify them. ".home" is the default; however, an
      administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV
      (<a href="#section-10.6">Section 10.6</a>) for the network to use a different one.  In case
      multiple are announced, the domain of the node with the greatest
      node identifier takes precedence.

   NEW:
      Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide
      naming and service discovery with local significance.  A network-
      wide zone is appended to all single labels or unqualified zones in
      order to qualify them. 'home.arpa.' is the default; however, an
      administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV
      (<a href="#section-10.6">Section 10.6</a>) for the network to use a different one.  In case
      multiple TLVs are announced, the domain of the node with the
      greatest node identifier takes precedence.

      The 'home.arpa.' special-use name does not require a special
      resolution protocol.  Names for which the rightmost two labels are
      'home.arpa.' are resolved using the DNS protocol [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20Local%20Significance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Local Significance</span>

   A DNS record that is returned as a response to a query for a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that is a subdomain of 'home.arpa.' is
   expected to have local significance.  It is expected to be returned
   by a server involved in name resolution for the homenet the device is
   connected in.  However, such a response MUST NOT be considered more
   trustworthy than a similar response for any other DNS query.

   Because 'home.arpa.' is not globally scoped and cannot be secured
   using DNSSEC based on the root domain's trust anchor, there is no way
   to tell, using a standard DNS query, in which homenet scope an answer
   belongs.  Consequently, users may experience surprising results with
   such names when roaming to different homenets.






<span class="grey">Pfister &amp; Lemon              Standards Track                    [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-8"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8375">RFC 8375</a>                       home.arpa.                       May 2018</span>


   To prevent this from happening, it could be useful for the resolver
   on the host to securely differentiate between different homenets and
   between identical names on different homenets.  However, a mechanism
   for doing this has not yet been standardized and doing so is out of
   scope for this document.  It is expected that this will be explored
   in future work.

   The advice in <a href="./rfc6303#section-7">[RFC6303], Section 7</a>, to install local trust anchors
   for locally served zones can only work if there is some way of
   configuring the trust anchor in the host.  Homenet currently
   specifies no mechanism for configuring such trust anchors.  As a
   result, while this advice sounds good, it is not practicable.

   Also, although it might be useful to install a trust anchor for a
   particular instance of 'home.arpa.', it's reasonable to expect that a
   host with such a trust anchor might, from time to time, connect to
   more than one network with its own instance of 'home.arpa.'.  Such a
   host would be unable to access services on any instance of
   'home.arpa.' other than the one for which a trust anchor was
   configured.

   It is, in principle, possible to attach an identifier to an instance
   of 'home.arpa.' that could be used to identify which trust anchor to
   rely on for validating names in that particular instance.  However,
   the security implications of this are complicated, and such a
   mechanism, as well as a discussion of those implications, is out of
   scope for this document.

   It is not possible to install a trust anchor (a DS RR) for this zone
   in the '.arpa' zone.  The reason for this is that in order to do so,
   it would be necessary to have the key-signing key for the zone (see
   <a href="./rfc4034#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC4034]</a>).  Since the zone is not globally unique, no
   one key would work.

   An alternative would be to provide an authenticated denial of
   existence (see <a href="./rfc4033#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of [RFC4033]</a>).  This would be done simply
   by not having a delegation from the 'arpa.' zone.  However, this
   requires the validating resolver to treat 'home.arpa.' specially.  If
   a validating resolver that doesn't treat 'home.arpa.' specially
   attempts to validate a name in 'home.arpa.', an authenticated denial
   of existence of 'home' as a subdomain of 'arpa.' would cause the
   validation to fail.  Therefore, the only delegation that will allow
   names under 'home.arpa.' to be resolved by all validating resolvers
   is an insecure delegation, as in <a href="./rfc6303#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC6303]</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8375">RFC 8375</a>                       home.arpa.                       May 2018</span>


   Consequently, unless a trust anchor for the particular instance of
   the 'home.arpa.' zone being validated is manually configured on the
   validating resolver, DNSSEC signing and validation of names within
   the 'home.arpa.' zone is not possible.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.3.%20%20Bypassing%20Manually%20Configured%20Resolvers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" id="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Bypassing Manually Configured Resolvers</span>

   In item 3 of <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>, an exception is made to the behavior of stub
   resolvers that allows them to query local resolvers for subdomains of
   'home.arpa.' even when they have been manually configured to use
   other resolvers.  This behavior obviously has security and privacy
   implications and may not be desirable depending on the context.  It
   may be better to simply ignore this exception and, when one or more
   recursive resolvers are configured manually, simply fail to provide
   correct answers for subdomains of 'home.arpa.'.  At this time, we do
   not have operational experience that would guide us in making this
   decision; implementors are encouraged to consider the context in
   which their software will be deployed when deciding how to resolve
   this question.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Delegation%20of%20%27home.arpa.%27"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Delegation of 'home.arpa.'</span>

   In order to be fully functional, there must be a delegation of
   'home.arpa.' in the '.arpa.' zone [<a href="./rfc3172" title='"Management Guidelines &amp; Operational Requirements for the Address and Routing Parameter Area Domain ("'>RFC3172</a>].  This delegation MUST
   NOT include a DS record and MUST point to one or more black hole
   servers, for example, 'blackhole-1.iana.org.' and 'blackhole-
   2.iana.org.'.  The reason that this delegation must not be signed is
   that not signing the delegation breaks the DNSSEC chain of trust,
   which prevents a validating stub resolver from rejecting names
   published under 'home.arpa.' on a homenet name server.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has recorded the domain name 'home.arpa.' in the "Special-Use
   Domain Names" registry [<a href="#ref-SUDN" title='"Special-Use Domain Names"'>SUDN</a>].  IANA, with the approval of the IAB,
   has implemented the delegation requested in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   IANA has created a new subregistry within the "Locally-Served DNS
   Zones" registry [<a href="#ref-LSDZ" title='"Locally-Served DNS Zones"'>LSDZ</a>], titled "Transport-Independent Locally-Served
   DNS Zone Registry", with the same format as the other subregistries.
   IANA has added an entry in this new registry for 'home.arpa.' with
   the description "Homenet Special-Use Domain", listing this document
   as the reference.  The registration procedure for this subregistry
   should be the same as for the others, currently "IETF Review" (see
   <a href="./rfc8126#section-4.8">Section 4.8 of [RFC8126]</a>).
