Request for Comments: 659                                        SRI-ARC
NIC: 31177                                               18 October 1974


                  <span class="h1">Announcing Addtional Telnet Options</span>

   This is to announce the set of Telnet Options defined in Request For
   Comments 651 through 658 (NIC 31154 through 31161) are part of the
   official Telnet Options and should be added to the Protocol Notebook.

   <a href="./rfc651">RFC 651</a> is a revision of the Status Option to utilize the subcommand
   feature and reduce the number of bits required to convey the status
   information.  This revised Status Option replaces the previous Status
   Option.

   The other RFCs (652 through 658) are new Options for controlling the
   behavior of the format effector characters Carriage Return,
   Horizontal Tab, Form Feed, Vertical Tab, and Line Feed.

   Your attention is also called to <a href="./rfc645">RFC 645</a> (NIC 30899) "Network
   Standard Data Specification Syntax" which was prepared some time ago
   but has not received wide circulation.

   Unfortunately the Network Information Center can not provide hardcopy
   documents.  Currently the author is responsible for distribution of
   RFCs.
