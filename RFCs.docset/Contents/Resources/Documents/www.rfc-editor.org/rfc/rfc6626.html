<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The base NEMOv4 specification [<a href="./rfc5177" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4"'>RFC5177</a>] defines extensions to Mobile
   IPv4 [<a href="./rfc5944" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4, Revised"'>RFC5944</a>] for mobile networks.  This specification adds support
   for dynamic allocation of mobile prefixes by the home agent.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Dynamic%20Mobile%20Prefix%20Allocation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Dynamic Mobile Prefix Allocation</span>

   The following extension is defined according to this specification.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Mobile%20Client%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Mobile Client Considerations</span>

   According to this specification, the Prefix field of the Mobile
   Network Request extension MUST be set to zero to indicate that the
   Mobile Router requests mobile network prefix(es) be assigned to it by
   the home agent.  In this case, the Mobile Router MAY set the prefix
   length field of such extensions to zero or to a length of its choice
   as a hint to the home agent.  According to this specification, Mobile
   Network Request extensions with the Prefix field set to zero MAY be
   included in a registration request message either during initial
   registration or during a subsequent registration.

   When a Mobile Router receives a registration reply, it MUST process
   it as defined in Mobile IPv4 [<a href="./rfc5944" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4, Revised"'>RFC5944</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5177" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4"'>RFC5177</a>].  If one or more
   network acknowledgement extensions are included with the Code field
   set to "Success", the Mobile Router SHOULD treat the prefixes in the
   corresponding Prefix fields as allocated prefixes and create the
   appropriate bindings as defined in [<a href="./rfc5177" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4"'>RFC5177</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6626">RFC 6626</a>          Dynamic Prefix Allocation for NEMOv4          May 2012</span>


   In response to a registration request with a Mobile Network Request
   extension with the Prefix field set to zero, if a Mobile Router
   receives a registration reply with a network acknowledgement
   extension including Code field set to 1 "invalid prefix", it may use
   it as a hint that the home agent does not support dynamic prefix
   allocation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Home%20Agent%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Home Agent Considerations</span>

   A home agent receiving a Mobile Network Request extension with the
   Prefix field set to zero MAY return a Mobile Network Acknowledgement
   extension [<a href="./rfc5177" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4"'>RFC5177</a>] with the Prefix field set to the prefix allocated
   to the Mobile Router.  The length of that prefix is at the discretion
   of the home agent.  The home agent MAY take into account the prefix
   length hint if one is included in the Mobile Network Request
   extension.  Once the home agent allocates a prefix, it MUST maintain
   the prefix registration table as defined in [<a href="./rfc5177" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4"'>RFC5177</a>].
   Alternatively, the home agent MAY return a Mobile Network
   Acknowledgement extension with the Code field set to one of the
   negative codes defined in [<a href="./rfc5177" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4"'>RFC5177</a>].

   Dynamic mobile prefix allocation, as defined in this specification,
   MAY be combined with dynamic home address allocation, as defined in
   [<a href="./rfc5177" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4"'>RFC5177</a>].  In other words, the home address field of the
   registration request message MAY be set to zero while the message
   also includes one or more Mobile Network Request extensions with the
   Prefix field also set to zero.

   Once the home agent allocates a prefix, it MUST maintain the prefix
   registration table as defined in [<a href="./rfc5177" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4"'>RFC5177</a>].  The lifetime of the
   allocated prefix will be equal to the lifetime of the binding cache
   entry.  The Mobile Router may request for multiple mobile network
   prefixes to be assigned by the home agent.  For a Mobile Network
   Prefix for which the assignment was unsuccessful, the Code field in
   the corresponding Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension should be
   set to 4 (MOBNET_UNASSIGNED).

   For dynamic prefix allocation, the Mobile Router's home address MAY
   be used to identify the client if it is not set to zero.  Otherwise,
   as defined in the Network Access Identifier (NAI) extension [<a href="./rfc2794" title='"Mobile IP Network Access Identifier Extension for IPv4"'>RFC2794</a>]
   of Mobile IPv4 [<a href="./rfc2794" title='"Mobile IP Network Access Identifier Extension for IPv4"'>RFC2794</a>], the NAI extension needs to be included in
   the registration request, in which case the same extension SHOULD be
   used to identify the Mobile Router for prefix allocation purposes.

   This specification operates in the security constraints and
   requirements of Mobile IPv4 [<a href="./rfc5944" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4, Revised"'>RFC5944</a>], NAI [<a href="./rfc2794" title='"Mobile IP Network Access Identifier Extension for IPv4"'>RFC2794</a>], and [<a href="./rfc5177" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4"'>RFC5177</a>].

   Home agent implementations SHOULD take steps to prevent address
   exhaustion attacks.  One way to limit the effectiveness of such an
   attack is to limit the number and size of prefixes any one Mobile
   Router can be allocated.

   A new value has been assigned in the Mobile Network Acknowledgement
   Extension registry: 4 - Home Agent cannot assign a mobile network
   prefix (MOBNET_UNASSIGNED).
