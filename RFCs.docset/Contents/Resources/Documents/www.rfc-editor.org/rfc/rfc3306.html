Abstract

   This specification defines an extension to the multicast addressing
   architecture of the IP Version 6 protocol.  The extension presented
   in this document allows for unicast-prefix-based allocation of
   multicast addresses.  By delegating multicast addresses at the same
   time as unicast prefixes, network operators will be able to identify
   their multicast addresses without needing to run an inter-domain
   allocation protocol.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3306">RFC 3306</a>          Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast        August 2002</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document specifies an extension to the multicast portion of the
   IPv6 addressing architecture [<a href="#ref-ADDRARCH" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>ADDRARCH</a>].  The current architecture
   does not contain any built-in support for dynamic address allocation.
   This proposal introduces encoded information in the multicast address
   to allow for dynamic allocation of IPv6 multicast addresses and IPv6
   source-specific multicast addresses.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Motivation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Motivation</span>

   The current IPv4 multicast address allocation architecture [<a href="./rfc2908">RFC 2908</a>]
   is based on a multi-layered, multi-protocol system.  The goal of this
   proposal is to reduce the number of protocols that need to be
   deployed in order to get dynamic multicast address allocation.

   The use of unicast prefix-based multicast address allocation will, at
   a minimum, remove the need to run the Multicast Address Allocation
   Protocol (AAP) [AAP WORK] and the Multicast Address-Set Claim (MASC)
   Protocol [<a href="./rfc2909">RFC 2909</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Multicast%20Address%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Multicast Address Format</span>

   Section 2.7 of [<a href="#ref-ADDRARCH" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>ADDRARCH</a>] defines the following operational format of
   IPv6 multicast addresses:

      |    8   |  4 |  4 |                     112                     |
      +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+
      |11111111|flgs|scop|                  group ID                   |
      +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3306">RFC 3306</a>          Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast        August 2002</span>


   This document introduces a new format that incorporates unicast
   prefix information in the multicast address.  The following
   illustrates the new format:

      |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    |
      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+
      |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved|  plen  | network prefix | group ID |
      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+

                                   +-+-+-+-+
   flgs is a set of 4 flags:       |0|0|P|T|
                                   +-+-+-+-+

         o  P = 0 indicates a multicast address that is not assigned
            based on the network prefix.  This indicates a multicast
            address as defined in [<a href="#ref-ADDRARCH" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>ADDRARCH</a>].

         o  P = 1 indicates a multicast address that is assigned based
            on the network prefix.

         o  If P = 1, T MUST be set to 1, otherwise the setting of the T
            bit is defined in Section 2.7 of [<a href="#ref-ADDRARCH" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>ADDRARCH</a>].

   The reserved field MUST be zero.

   plen indicates the actual number of bits in the network prefix field
   that identify the subnet when P = 1.

   network prefix identifies the network prefix of the unicast subnet
   owning the multicast address.  If P = 1, this field contains the
   unicast network prefix assigned to the domain owning, or allocating,
   the multicast address.  All non-significant bits of the network
   prefix field SHOULD be zero.

   It should be noted that the Interface Identifier requirements in
   Section 2.5.1 of [<a href="#ref-ADDRARCH" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>ADDRARCH</a>] effectively restrict the length of the
   unicast prefix to 64 bits, hence the network prefix portion of the
   multicast address will be at most 64 bits.

   Group ID is set based on the guidelines outlined in [IPV6 GID].

   The scope of the unicast-prefix based multicast address MUST NOT
   exceed the scope of the unicast prefix embedded in the multicast
   address.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3306">RFC 3306</a>          Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast        August 2002</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20Address%20Lifetime"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. Address Lifetime</span>

   The lifetime of a unicast prefix-based multicast address SHOULD NOT
   exceed the Valid Lifetime field in the Prefix Information option,
   corresponding to the unicast prefix being used, contained in the
   Neighbor Discovery Router Advertisement message [<a href="./rfc2461">RFC 2461</a>].  The
   lifetime of the multicast address is needed to support the Abstract
   API for Multicast Address Allocation [<a href="./rfc2771">RFC 2771</a>].

   It should be noted that the unicast prefix's Valid Lifetime in the
   Router Advertisement message does not indicate that the prefix will
   become invalid at the end of the lifetime.  Rather, that value is
   typically a constant until a renumbering event is scheduled after
   which, the prefix does become invalid.

   The use of unicast prefix-based multicast addresses after the unicast
   prefix has become invalid may lead to operational problems.  For
   example, routers that perform policy checks comparing the multicast
   prefix against the unicast prefix assigned to an AS may discard the
   packet.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20Source-Specific%20Multicast%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>. Source-Specific Multicast Addresses</span>

   The unicast prefix-based IPv6 multicast address format supports
   Source-specific multicast addresses, as defined by [SSM ARCH].  To
   accomplish this, a node MUST:

         o  Set P = 1.
         o  Set plen = 0.
         o  Set network prefix = 0.

   These settings create an SSM range of FF3x::/32 (where 'x' is any
   valid scope value).  The source address field in the IPv6 header
   identifies the owner of the multicast address.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>. Examples</span>

   The following are a few examples of the structure of unicast prefix-
   based multicast addresses.

         -  Global prefixes - A network with a unicast prefix of
            3FFE:FFFF:1::/48 would also have a unicast prefix-based
            multicast prefix of FF3x:0030:3FFE:FFFF:0001::/96 (where 'x'
            is any valid scope).

         -  SSM - All IPv6 SSM multicast addresses will have the format
            FF3x::/96.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   It is possible that the embedded unicast prefix can aid in
   identifying the allocation domain of a given multicast address,
   though an allocation domain choosing to avoid being traced has no
   obstacles currently to creating addresses using a prefix not assigned
   to it, or using a smaller scope embedded prefix.

   Using source-specific multicast addresses can sometimes aid in the
   prevention of denial-of-service attacks by arbitrary sources,
   although no guarantee is provided.  A more in-depth discussion of the
   security considerations for SSM can be found in [SSM ARCH].
