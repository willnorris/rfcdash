Abstract

   This document describes an option for negotiating the use of header
   compression on IP datagrams transmitted over the Point-to-Point
   Protocol (<a href="./rfc1661">RFC 1661</a>).  It defines extensions to the PPP Control
   Protocols for IPv4 and IPv6 (<a href="./rfc1332">RFC 1332</a>, <a href="./rfc2472">RFC 2472</a>).  Header compression
   may be applied to IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams in combination with TCP,
   UDP and RTP transport protocols as specified in <a href="./rfc2507">RFC 2507</a>, <a href="./rfc2508">RFC 2508</a>
   and <a href="./rfc3545">RFC 3545</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IP Header Compression (IPHC) defined in [<a href="./rfc2507" title='"Header Compression for IP"'>RFC2507</a>] may be used for
   compression of both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams or packets encapsulated
   with multiple IP headers.  IPHC is also capable of compressing both
   TCP and UDP transport protocol headers.  The IP/UDP/RTP header
   compression defined in [<a href="./rfc2508" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links"'>RFC2508</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3545" title='"Enhanced Compressed RTP (CRTP) for Links with High Delay, Packet Loss and Reordering"'>RFC3545</a>] fits within the
   framework defined by IPHC so that it may also be applied to both IPv4
   and IPv6 packets.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3544">RFC 3544</a>             IP Header Compression over PPP            July 2003</span>


   In order to establish compression of IP datagrams sent over a PPP
   link each end of the link must agree on a set of configuration
   parameters for the compression.  The process of negotiating link
   parameters for network layer protocols is handled in PPP by a family
   of network control protocols (NCPs).  Since there are separate NCPs
   for IPv4 and IPv6, this document defines configuration options to be
   used in both NCPs to negotiate parameters for the compression scheme.

   This document obsoletes <a href="./rfc2509">RFC 2509</a>, adding two new suboptions to the IP
   header compression configuration option.  One suboption negotiates
   usage of Enhanced RTP-Compression (specified in [<a href="./rfc3545" title='"Enhanced Compressed RTP (CRTP) for Links with High Delay, Packet Loss and Reordering"'>RFC3545</a>]), and the
   other suboption negotiates header compression for only TCP or only
   non-TCP packets.

   IPHC relies on the link layer's ability to indicate the types of
   datagrams carried in the link layer frames.  In this document nine
   new types for the PPP Data Link Layer Protocol Field are defined
   along with their meaning.

   In general, header compression schemes that use delta encoding of
   compressed packets require that the lower layer does not reorder
   packets between compressor and decompressor.  IPHC uses delta
   encoding of compressed packets for TCP and RTP.  The IPHC
   specification [<a href="./rfc2507" title='"Header Compression for IP"'>RFC2507</a>] includes methods that allow link layers that
   may reorder packets to be used with IPHC.  Since PPP does not reorder
   packets these mechanisms are disabled by default.  When using
   reordering mechanisms such as multiclass multilink PPP [<a href="./rfc2686" title='"The Multi-Class Extension to Multi-Link PPP"'>RFC2686</a>],
   care must be taken so that packets that share the same compression
   context are not reordered.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Configuration%20Option"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Configuration Option</span>

   This document specifies a new compression protocol value for the IPCP
   IP-Compression-Protocol option as specified in [<a href="./rfc1332" title='"The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)"'>RFC1332</a>].  The new
   value and the associated option format are described in <a href="#section-2.1">section 2.1</a>.

   The option format is structured to allow future extensions to the
   IPHC scheme.

   NOTE: The specification of link and network layer parameter
      negotiation for PPP [<a href="./rfc1661" title='"The Point-To-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>RFC1661</a>], [<a href="./rfc1331">RFC1331</a>], [<a href="./rfc1332" title='"The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)"'>RFC1332</a>] does not
      prohibit multiple instances of one configuration option but states
      that the specification of a configuration option must explicitly
      allow multiple instances.  [<a href="./rfc3241" title='"Robust Header Compression (ROHC) over PPP"'>RFC3241</a>] updates <a href="./rfc1332">RFC 1332</a> by
      explicitly allowing the sending of multiple instances of the IP-
      Compression-Protocol configuration option, each with a different
      value for IP-Compression-Protocol.  Each type of compression
      protocol may independently establish its own parameters.

   NOTE: [<a href="./rfc1332" title='"The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)"'>RFC1332</a>] is not explicit about whether the option
      negotiates the capabilities of the receiver or of the sender.  In
      keeping with current practice, we assume that the option describes
      the capabilities of the decompressor (receiving side) of the peer
      that sends the Config-Req.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Configuration%20Option%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Configuration Option Format</span>

   Both the network control protocol for IPv4, IPCP [<a href="./rfc1332" title='"The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)"'>RFC1332</a>] and the
   IPv6 NCP, IPV6CP [<a href="./rfc2472" title='"IP Version 6 over PPP"'>RFC2472</a>] may be used to negotiate IP Header
   Compression parameters for their respective protocols.  The format of
   the configuration option is the same for both IPCP and IPV6CP.

   Description

      This NCP configuration option is used to negotiate parameters for
      IP Header Compression.  Successful negotiation of parameters
      enables the use of Protocol Identifiers FULL_HEADER,
      COMPRESSED_TCP, COMPRESSED_TCP_NODELTA, COMPRESSED_NON_TCP and
      CONTEXT_STATE as specified in [<a href="./rfc2507" title='"Header Compression for IP"'>RFC2507</a>].  The option format is
      summarized below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   TCP_SPACE
      The TCP_SPACE field is two octets and indicates the maximum value
      of a context identifier in the space of context identifiers
      allocated for TCP.

         Suggested value: 15

      TCP_SPACE must be at least 0 and at most 255 (the value 0 implies
      having one context).

   NON_TCP_SPACE
      The NON_TCP_SPACE field is two octets and indicates the maximum
      value of a context identifier in the space of context identifiers
      allocated for non-TCP.  These context identifiers are carried in
      COMPRESSED_NON_TCP, COMPRESSED_UDP and COMPRESSED_RTP packet
      headers.

         Suggested value: 15

      NON_TCP_SPACE must be at least 0 and at most 65535 (the value 0
      implies having one context).

   F_MAX_PERIOD
      Maximum interval between full headers.  No more than F_MAX_PERIOD
      COMPRESSED_NON_TCP headers may be sent between FULL_HEADER
      headers.

         Suggested value: 256

      A value of zero implies infinity, i.e. there is no limit to the
      number of consecutive COMPRESSED_NON_TCP headers.

   F_MAX_TIME
      Maximum time interval between full headers.  COMPRESSED_NON_TCP
      headers may not be sent more than F_MAX_TIME seconds after sending
      the last FULL_HEADER header.

         Suggested value: 5 seconds

      A value of zero implies infinity.

   MAX_HEADER
      The largest header size in octets that may be compressed.

         Suggested value: 168 octets

      The value of MAX_HEADER should be large enough so that at least
      the outer network layer header can be compressed.  To increase
      compression efficiency MAX_HEADER should be set to a value large
      enough to cover common combinations of network and transport layer
      headers.

   suboptions
      The suboptions field consists of zero or more suboptions.  Each
      suboption consists of a type field, a length field and zero or
      more parameter octets, as defined by the suboption type.  The
      value of the length field indicates the length of the suboption in
      its entirety, including the lengths of the type and length fields.

   The RTP-Compression suboption is included in the NCP IP-Compression-
   Protocol option for IPHC if IP/UDP/RTP compression is to be enabled.

   Inclusion of the RTP-Compression suboption enables use of additional
   Protocol Identifiers COMPRESSED_RTP and COMPRESSED_UDP along with
   additional forms of CONTEXT_STATE as specified in [<a href="./rfc2508" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links"'>RFC2508</a>].

   To use the enhanced RTP header compression defined in [<a href="./rfc3545" title='"Enhanced Compressed RTP (CRTP) for Links with High Delay, Packet Loss and Reordering"'>RFC3545</a>], a
   new sub-option 2 is added.  Sub-option 2 is negotiated instead of,
   not in addition to, sub-option 1.

      Identifier COMPRESSED_UDP with additional flags and use of the C
      flag with the FULL_HEADER Protocol Identifier to indicate use of
      HDRCKSUM with COMPRESSED_RTP and COMPRESSED_UDP packets.

   In <a href="./rfc2509">RFC 2509</a> it was not possible to negotiate only TCP header
   compression or only non-TCP header compression because a value of 0
   in the TCP_SPACE or the NON_TCP_SPACE fields actually means that 1
   context is negotiated.

   A new suboption 3 is added to allow specifying that the number of
   contexts for TCP_SPACE or NON_TCP_SPACE is zero, disabling use of the
   corresponding compression.

      Parameter

      The parameter is 1 byte with one of the following values:

      1 = the number of contexts for TCP_SPACE is 0
      2 = the number of contexts for NON_TCP_SPACE is 0

   This suboption overrides the values that were previously assigned to
   TCP_SPACE and NON_TCP_SPACE in the IP Header Compression option.

   If suboption 3 is included multiple times with parameter 1 and 2,
   compression is disabled for all packets.

   The IPHC protocol is able to compress both IPv6 and IPv4 datagrams.
   Both IPCP and IPV6CP are able to negotiate option parameter values
   for IPHC.  These values apply to the compression of packets where the
   outer header is an IPv4 header and an IPv6 header, respectively.

   For the compression and decompression of IPv4 and IPv6 datagram
   headers the context identifier space is shared.  While the parameter
   values are independently negotiated, sharing the context identifier
   spaces becomes more complex when the parameter values differ.  Since
   the compressed packets share context identifier space, the
   compression engine must allocate context identifiers out of a common
   pool; for compressed packets, the decompressor has to examine the
   context state to determine what parameters to use for decompression.

   Context identifier spaces are not shared between TCP and non-
   TCP/UDP/RTP.  Doing so would require additional mechanisms to ensure
   that no error can occur when switching from using a context
   identifier for TCP to non-TCP.

   The IPHC specification [<a href="./rfc2507" title='"Header Compression for IP"'>RFC2507</a>] defines four header formats for
   different types of compressed headers.  They are compressed TCP,
   compressed TCP with no delta encoding, compressed non-TCP with 8 bit
   CID and compressed non-TCP with 16 bit CID.  The two non-TCP formats
   may be distinguished by their contents so both may use the same
   link-level identifier.  A fifth header format, the full header is
   distinct from a regular header in that it carries additional
   information to establish shared context between the compressor and
   decompressor.

   The specification of IP/UDP/RTP Header Compression [<a href="./rfc2508" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links"'>RFC2508</a>] defines
   four additional formats of compressed headers.  They are for
   compressed UDP and compressed RTP (on top of UDP), both with either
   8- or 16-bit CIDs.  In addition, there is an explicit error message
   from the decompressor to the compressor.

   The link layer must be able to indicate these header formats with
   distinct values.  Nine PPP Data Link Layer Protocol Field values are
   specified below.

   FULL_HEADER
      The frame contains a full header as specified in [<a href="./rfc2508" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links"'>RFC2508</a>] <a href="#section-3.3.1">Section</a>
      <a href="#section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  This is the same as the FULL_HEADER specified in <a href="./rfc2507#section-5.3">[RFC2507]
      Section 5.3</a>.
         Value: 0061 (hex)

   COMPRESSED_TCP
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed header with the
      format as specified in <a href="./rfc2507#section-6">[RFC2507] Section 6</a>a.
         Value: 0063 (hex)

   COMPRESSED_TCP_NODELTA
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed header with the
      format as specified in <a href="./rfc2507#section-6">[RFC2507] Section 6</a>b.
         Value: 2063 (hex)

   COMPRESSED_NON_TCP
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed header with the
      format as specified in either <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>c or Section 6d of
      [<a href="./rfc2507" title='"Header Compression for IP"'>RFC2507</a>].

   This document does not require any additional allocations from
   existing namespaces in the IANA Point-to-Point Protocol Field
   Assignments registry.  However, there are three namespaces that were
   defined by <a href="./rfc1332">RFC 1332</a>, <a href="./rfc2472">RFC 2472</a>, and <a href="./rfc2509">RFC 2509</a> but not created in the
   registry.  Those three namespaces, described below, have been added
   to the PPP registry.  This document specifies two additional
   allocations in the third one.

   <a href="./rfc1332#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of RFC 1332</a> specifies an IP-Compression-Protocol
   Configuration Option for the PPP IP Control Protocol and defines one
   value for the IP-Compression-Protocol type field in that option.  An
   IANA registry has been created to allocate additional values for that
   type field.  As stated in <a href="./rfc1332">RFC 1332</a>, the values for the IP-
   Compression-Protocol type field are always the same as the (primary)
   PPP DLL Protocol Number assigned to packets of the particular
   compression protocol.  Assignment of additional IP-Compression-
   Protocol type values is through the IETF consensus procedure as
   specified in [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC2434</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3544">RFC 3544</a>             IP Header Compression over PPP            July 2003</span>


   <a href="./rfc2472#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of RFC 2472</a> specifies an IPv6-Compression-Protocol
   Configuration Option for the PPP IPv6 Control Protocol and defines
   one value for the IPv6-Compression-Protocol type field in that
   option.  An IANA registry has been created to allocate additional
   values for that type field.  The IPv6-Compression-Protocol
   Configuration Option has the same structure as the IP-Compression-
   Protocol Configuration Option defined in <a href="./rfc1332">RFC 1332</a>, but the set of
   values defined for the type field may be different.  As stated in <a href="./rfc2472">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2472">2472</a>, the values for the IPv6-Compression-Protocol type field are
   always the same as the (primary) PPP DLL Protocol Number assigned to
   packets of the particular compression protocol.  Assignment of
   additional IPv6-Compression-Protocol type values is through the IETF
   consensus procedure as specified in [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC2434</a>].

   <a href="./rfc2509#section-2.1">Section 2.1 of RFC 2509</a> specifies an additional type value to be
   registered for both the IP-Compression-Protocol Configuration Option
   and the IPv6-Compression-Protocol Configuration Option to indicate
   use of the "IP Header Compression" protocol.  The specification of
   that type value is repeated in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> of this document which
   obsoletes <a href="./rfc2509">RFC 2509</a>.  In conjunction with the additional type value,
   the format for the variable-length option is specified.  The format
   includes a suboption field that may contain one or more suboptions.
   Each suboption begins with a suboption type value.  An IANA registry
   has been created for the suboption type values; and is titled, "IP
   Header Compression Configuration Option Suboption Types".

   <a href="./rfc2509#section-2.2">Section 2.2 of RFC 2509</a> (and this document) defines one suboption
   type.  Sections <a href="#section-2.3">2.3</a> and <a href="#section-2.4">2.4</a> of this document define two additional
   suboption types.  It is expected that the number of additional
   suboptions that will need to be defined is small.  Therefore, anyone
   wishing to define new suboptions is required to produce a revision of
   this document to be vetted through the normal Internet Standards
   process, as specified in [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC2434</a>].

   <a href="./rfc2509">RFC 2509</a> also defines nine PPP Data Link Layer Protocol Field values
   which are already listed in the IANA registry of Point-to-Point
   Protocol Field Assignments.  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of this document repeats the
   specification of those values without change.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Negotiation of the option defined here imposes no additional security
   considerations beyond those that otherwise apply to PPP [<a href="./rfc1661" title='"The Point-To-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>RFC1661</a>].

   The use of header compression can, in rare cases, cause the
   misdelivery of packets.  If necessary, confidentiality of packet
   contents should be assured by encryption.

   Encryption applied at the IP layer (e.g., using IPSEC mechanisms)
   precludes header compression of the encrypted headers, though
   compression of the outer IP header and authentication/security
   headers is still possible as described in [<a href="./rfc2507" title='"Header Compression for IP"'>RFC2507</a>].  For RTP
   packets, full header compression is possible if the RTP payload is
   encrypted by itself without encrypting the UDP or RTP headers, as
   described in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  This method is appropriate when the UDP and
   RTP header information need not be kept confidential.
