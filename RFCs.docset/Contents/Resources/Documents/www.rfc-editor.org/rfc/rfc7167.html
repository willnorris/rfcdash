Abstract

   The Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the
   common set of MPLS protocol functions defined to enable the
   construction and operation of packet transport networks.  The MPLS-TP
   supports both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint transport paths.
   This document defines the elements and functions of the MPLS-TP
   architecture that are applicable specifically to supporting point-to-
   multipoint transport paths.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Applicability</span>

   The point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by an MPLS-TP network
   is based on the point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by MPLS
   networks.  Traffic Engineered P2MP LSP support is discussed in
   [<a href="./rfc4875" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to-Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5332" title='"MPLS Multicast Encapsulations"'>RFC5332</a>], and P2MP PW support is being developed based
   on [<a href="#ref-P2MP-PW-REQS">P2MP-PW-REQS</a>] and [<a href="#ref-VPMS-FRMWK-REQS">VPMS-FRMWK-REQS</a>].  MPLS-TP point-to-multipoint
   connectivity is analogous to that provided by traditional transport
   technologies such as Optical Transport Network point-to-multipoint
   [<a href="#ref-G.798" title='"Characteristics of optical transport network hierarchy equipment functional blocks"'>G.798</a>] and drop-and-continue [<a href="#ref-G.780" title='"Terms and definitions for synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) networks"'>G.780</a>], and thus supports the same
   class of traditional applications, e.g., video distribution.

   The scope of this document is limited to point-to-multipoint
   functions and it does not discuss multipoint-to-multipoint support.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20MPLS-TP%20P2MP%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  MPLS-TP P2MP Requirements</span>

   The requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in [<a href="./rfc5654" title='"Requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile"'>RFC5654</a>], [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>],
   and [<a href="./rfc5951" title='"Network Management Requirements for MPLS-based Transport Networks"'>RFC5951</a>].  This section provides a brief summary of point-to-
   multipoint transport requirements as set out in those documents; the
   reader is referred to the documents themselves for the definitive and
   complete list of requirements.  This summary does not include the <a href="./rfc2119">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2119">2119</a> [<a href="#ref-BCP14" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>BCP14</a>] conformance language used in the original documents as
   this document is not authoritative.

   From [<a href="./rfc5654" title='"Requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile"'>RFC5654</a>]:

   o  MPLS-TP must support traffic-engineered point-to-multipoint
      transport paths.

   o  MPLS-TP must support unidirectional point-to-multipoint transport
      paths.

   o  MPLS-TP must be capable of using P2MP server (sub)layer
      capabilities as well as P2P server (sub)layer capabilities when
      supporting P2MP MPLS-TP transport paths.

   o  The MPLS-TP control plane must support establishing all the
      connectivity patterns defined for the MPLS-TP data plane (i.e.,
      unidirectional P2P, associated bidirectional P2P, co-routed
      bidirectional P2P, unidirectional P2MP) including configuration of
      protection functions and any associated maintenance functions.

   o  Recovery techniques used for P2P and P2MP should be identical to
      simplify implementation and operation.

   o  Unidirectional 1+1 and 1:n protection for P2MP connectivity must
      be supported.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery in a ring must protect unidirectional P2MP
      transport paths.

   From [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>]:

   o  The protocol solution(s) developed to perform the following OAM
      functions must also apply to point-to-point associated
      bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional LSPs, and point-
      to-multipoint LSPs:

      *  Continuity Check

      *  Connectivity Verification, proactive

      *  Lock Instruct

      *  Lock Reporting

      *  Alarm Reporting

      *  Client Failure Indication

      *  Packet Loss Measurement

      *  Packet Delay Measurement

   o  The protocol solution(s) developed to perform the following OAM
      functions may also apply to point-to-point associated
      bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional LSPs, and point-
      to-multipoint LSPs:

      *  Connectivity Verification, on-demand

      *  Route Tracing

      *  Diagnostic Tests

      *  Remote Defect Indication

   From [<a href="./rfc5951" title='"Network Management Requirements for MPLS-based Transport Networks"'>RFC5951</a>]:

   o  For unidirectional (P2P and point-to-multipoint (P2MP))
      connection, proactive measurement of packet loss and loss ratio is
      required.

   o  For a unidirectional (P2P and P2MP) connection, on-demand
      measurement of delay measurement is required.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Architecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Architecture</span>

   The overall architecture of the MPLS-TP is defined in [<a href="./rfc5921" title='"A Framework for MPLS in Transport Networks"'>RFC5921</a>].  The
   architecture for point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP comprises the following
   additional elements and functions:

   o  Unidirectional point-to-multipoint LSPs

   o  Unidirectional point-to-multipoint PWs

   o  Optional point-to-multipoint LSP and PW control planes

   o  Survivability, network management, and Operations, Administration,
      and Maintenance functions for point-to-multipoint PWs and LSPs.

   The following subsection summarises the encapsulation and forwarding
   of point-to-multipoint traffic within an MPLS-TP network, and the
   encapsulation options for delivery of traffic to and from MPLS-TP CE
   devices when the network is providing a packet transport service.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20MPLS-TP%20Encapsulation%20and%20Forwarding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  MPLS-TP Encapsulation and Forwarding</span>

   Packet encapsulation and forwarding for MPLS-TP point-to-multipoint
   LSPs is identical to that for MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs.
   MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs were introduced in [<a href="./rfc4875" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to-Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>] and the
   related data-plane behaviour was further clarified in [<a href="./rfc5332" title='"MPLS Multicast Encapsulations"'>RFC5332</a>].
   MPLS-TP allows for both upstream-assigned and downstream-assigned
   labels for use with point-to-multipoint LSPs.

   Packet encapsulation and forwarding for point-to-multipoint PWs has
   been discussed within the PWE3 Working Group [<a href="#ref-P2MP-PW-ENCAPS">P2MP-PW-ENCAPS</a>], but
   such definition is for further study.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Operations%2C%20Administration%2C%20and%20Maintenance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance</span>

   The requirements for MPLS-TP OAM are specified in [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>].  The
   overall OAM architecture for MPLS-TP is defined in [<a href="./rfc6371" title='"Operations, Administration, and Maintenance Framework for MPLS-Based Transport Networks"'>RFC6371</a>], and
   P2MP OAM design considerations are described in <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a> of that
   RFC.

   All the traffic sent over a P2MP transport path, including OAM
   packets generated by a MEP, is sent (multicast) from the root towards
   all the leaves, and thus may be processed by all the MIPs and MEPs
   associated with a P2MP MEG.  If an OAM packet is to be processed by
   only a specific leaf, it requires information to indicate to all
   other leaves that the packet must be discarded.  To address a packet
   to an intermediate node in the tree, Time-to-Live-based addressing is
   used to set the radius and additional information in the OAM payload

   is used to identify the specific destination.  It is worth noting
   that a MIP and MEP may be instantiated on a single node when it is
   both a branch and leaf node.

   P2MP paths are unidirectional; therefore, any return path to an
   originating MEP for on-demand transactions will be out of band.  Out-
   of-band return paths are discussed in <a href="./rfc5921#section-3.8">Section 3.8 of [RFC5921]</a>.

   A more detailed discussion of P2MP OAM considerations can be found in
   [<a href="#ref-MPLS-TP-P2MP-OAM">MPLS-TP-P2MP-OAM</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Control%20Plane"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Control Plane</span>

   The framework for the MPLS-TP control plane is provided in [<a href="./rfc6373" title='"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Control Plane Framework"'>RFC6373</a>].
   This document reviews MPLS-TP control-plane requirements as well as
   provides details on how the MPLS-TP control plane satisfies these
   requirements.  Most of the requirements identified in [<a href="./rfc6373" title='"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Control Plane Framework"'>RFC6373</a>] apply
   equally to P2P and P2MP transport paths.  The key P2MP-specific
   control-plane requirements are:

   o  requirement 6 (P2MP transport paths),

   o  requirement 34 (use P2P sub-layers),

   o  requirement 49 (common recovery solutions for P2P and P2MP),

   o  requirement 59 (1+1 protection),

   o  requirement 62 (1:n protection), and

   o  requirement 65 (1:n shared mesh recovery).

   [<a id="ref-RFC6373">RFC6373</a>] defines the control-plane approach used to support MPLS-TP
   transport paths.  It identifies GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-
   TP LSPs and tLDP as the control plane for PWs.  MPLS-TP allows that
   either, or both, LSPs and PWs to be provisioned statically or via a
   control plane.  Quoting from [<a href="./rfc6373" title='"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Control Plane Framework"'>RFC6373</a>]:

      The PW and LSP control planes, collectively, must satisfy the
      MPLS-TP control-plane requirements.  As with P2P services, when
      P2MP client services are provided directly via LSPs, all
      requirements must be satisfied by the LSP control plane.  When
      client services are provided via PWs, the PW and LSP control
      planes can operate in combination, and some functions may be
      satisfied via the PW control plane while others are provided to
      PWs by the LSP control plane.  This is particularly noteworthy for
      P2MP recovery.

   The MPLS-TP control plane for P2MP LSPs uses GMPLS and is based on
   RSVP-TE for P2MP LSPs as defined in [<a href="./rfc4875" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to-Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>].  A detailed listing of
   how GMPLS satisfies MPLS-TP control-plane requirements is provided in
   [<a href="./rfc6373" title='"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Control Plane Framework"'>RFC6373</a>].

   [<a id="ref-RFC6373">RFC6373</a>] notes that recovery techniques for traffic engineered P2MP
   LSPs are not formally defined, and that such a definition is needed.
   A formal definition will be based on existing RFCs and may not
   require any new protocol mechanisms but, nonetheless, should be
   documented.  GMPLS recovery is defined in [<a href="./rfc4872" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions in Support of End-to-End Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Recovery"'>RFC4872</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4873" title='"GMPLS Segment Recovery"'>RFC4873</a>].
   Protection of P2MP LSPs is also discussed in <a href="./rfc6372#section-4.7.3">[RFC6372] Section 4.7.3</a>.

   as required for P2MP applications.  A detailed specification of the
   control plane for P2MP PWs is for further study.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Survivability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Survivability</span>

   The overall survivability architecture for MPLS-TP is defined in
   [<a href="./rfc6372" title='"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS- TP) Survivability Framework"'>RFC6372</a>], and <a href="#section-4.7.3">Section 4.7.3</a> of that RFC in particular describes the
   application of linear protection to unidirectional P2MP entities
   using 1+1 and 1:1 protection architecture.  For 1+1, the approach is
   for the root of the P2MP tree to bridge the user traffic to both the
   working and protection entities.  Each sink/leaf MPLS-TP node selects
   the traffic from one entity according to some predetermined criteria.
   For 1:1, the source/root MPLS-TP node needs to identify the existence
   of a fault condition impacting delivery to any of the leaves.  Fault
   notification happens from the node identifying the fault to the root
   node via an out-of-band path.  The root then selects the protection
   transport path for traffic transfer.  More sophisticated
   survivability approaches such as partial tree protection and 1:n
   protection are for further study.

   The IETF has no experience with P2MP PW survivability as yet;
   therefore, it is proposed that the P2MP PW survivability will
   initially rely on the LSP survivability.  Further work is needed on
   this subject, particularly if a requirement emerges to provide
   survivability for P2MP PWs in an MPLS-TP context.

   An overview of network management considerations for MPLS-TP can be
   found in <a href="./rfc5921#section-3.14">Section 3.14 of [RFC5921]</a>.  The provided description applies
   equally to P2MP transport paths.

   The network management architecture and requirements for MPLS-TP are
   specified in [<a href="./rfc5951" title='"Network Management Requirements for MPLS-based Transport Networks"'>RFC5951</a>].  They derive from the generic specifications
   described in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [<a href="#ref-G.7710" title='"Common equipment management function requirements"'>G.7710</a>] for transport technologies.
   They also incorporate the OAM requirements for MPLS networks
   [<a href="./rfc4377" title='"Operations and Management (OAM) Requirements for Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Networks"'>RFC4377</a>] and MPLS-TP networks [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>] and expand on those
   requirements to cover the modifications necessary for fault,
   configuration, performance, and security in a transport network.
   [<a href="./rfc5951" title='"Network Management Requirements for MPLS-based Transport Networks"'>RFC5951</a>] covers all MPLS-TP connection types, including P2MP.

   [<a id="ref-RFC6639">RFC6639</a>] provides the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP.  It
   reviews the interrelationships between different MIB modules that are
   not MPLS-TP specific and that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network
   management, and identifies areas where additional MIB modules are
   required.  While the document does not consider P2MP transport paths,
   it does provide a foundation for an analysis of areas where MIB-
   module modification and addition may be needed to fully support P2MP
   transport paths.  There has also been work in the MPLS working group
   on a P2MP specific MIB, [<a href="#ref-MPLS-TE-P2MP-MIB">MPLS-TE-P2MP-MIB</a>].

   General security considerations for MPLS-TP are covered in [<a href="./rfc5921" title='"A Framework for MPLS in Transport Networks"'>RFC5921</a>].
   Additional security considerations for P2MP LSPs are provided in
   [<a href="./rfc4875" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to-Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>].  This document introduces no new security considerations
   beyond those covered in those documents.
