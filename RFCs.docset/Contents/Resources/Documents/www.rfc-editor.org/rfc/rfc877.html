This RFC specifies a standard adopted by CSNET, the VAN gateway, and
other organizations for the transmission of IP datagrams over the
X.25-based public data networks.

An X.25 virtual circuit is opened on demand when a datagram arrives at
the network interface for transmission. A virtual circuit is closed
after some period of inactivity (the length of the period depends on
the cost associated with an open virtual circuit). A virtual circuit
may also be closed if the interface runs out of virtual circuits. An
algorithm for managing virtual circuits during peak demand is given
in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"CSNET Protocol Software: The IP-to-X.25 Interface"'>1</a>].
