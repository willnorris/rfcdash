Abstract

   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
   information networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network-
   performance criteria (e.g., latency) are becoming as critical to
   data-path selection as other metrics.

   This document describes extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering
   Extensions (<a href="./rfc5305">RFC 5305</a>).  These extensions provide a way to distribute
   and collect network-performance information in a scalable fashion.
   The information distributed using IS-IS TE Metric Extensions can then
   be used to make path-selection decisions based on network
   performance.

   Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which
   network-performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for
   measuring network performance or acting on that information, once
   distributed, are outside the scope of this document.

   This document obsoletes <a href="./rfc7810">RFC 7810</a>.

   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
   information networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network-
   performance information (e.g., latency) is becoming as critical to
   data-path selection as other metrics.

   In these networks, extremely large amounts of money rest on the
   ability to access market data in "real time" and to predictably make
   trades faster than the competition.  Because of this, using metrics
   such as hop count or cost as routing metrics is becoming only
   tangentially important.  Rather, it would be beneficial to be able to
   make path-selection decisions based on performance data (such as
   latency) in a cost-effective and scalable way.

   This document describes extensions (hereafter called "IS-IS TE Metric
   Extensions") to the Extended IS Reachability TLV defined in
   [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>]; these extensions can be used to distribute network-
   performance information (such as link delay, delay variation, packet
   loss, residual bandwidth, and available bandwidth).

   The data distributed by the IS-IS TE Metric Extensions described in
   this document is meant to be used as part of the operation of the
   routing protocol (e.g., by replacing cost with latency or considering
   bandwidth as well as cost), to enhance Constrained Shortest Path
   First (CSPF), or for other uses such as supplementing the data used
   by an Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) server [<a href="./rfc7285" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol"'>RFC7285</a>].
   With respect to CSPF, the data distributed by IS-IS TE Metric
   Extensions can be used to set up, fail over, and fail back data paths
   using protocols such as RSVP-TE [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>].

   Note that the mechanisms described in this document only disseminate
   performance information.  The methods for initially gathering that
   performance information (such as the methods described in [<a href="./rfc6375" title='"A Packet Loss and Delay Measurement Profile for MPLS-Based Transport Networks"'>RFC6375</a>])
   or how to act on the information once it is distributed are outside
   the scope of this document.  Example mechanisms to measure latency,
   delay variation, and loss in an MPLS network are given in [<a href="./rfc6374" title='"Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks"'>RFC6374</a>].
   While this document does not specify how the performance information
   should be obtained, the measurement of delay SHOULD NOT vary
   significantly based upon the offered traffic load.  Thus, queuing
   delays SHOULD NOT be included in the delay measurement.  For links
   such as forwarding adjacencies [<a href="./rfc4206" title='"Label Switched Paths (LSP) Hierarchy with Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)"'>RFC4206</a>], care must be taken that
   measurement of the associated delay avoids significant queuing
   delays; that could be accomplished in a variety of ways, including
   either (1) measuring with a traffic class that experiences minimal
   queuing or (2) summing the measured link delays of the components of
   the link's path.

   This document obsoletes [<a href="./rfc7810" title='"IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions"'>RFC7810</a>].

   This document registers new IS-IS TE sub-TLVs in the "Sub-TLVs for
   TLVs 22, 23, 141, 222, and 223" registry.  These new sub-TLVs provide
   ways to distribute network-performance information.  The extensions
   in this document build on the extensions provided in IS-IS TE
   [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>] and GMPLS [<a href="./rfc4203" title='"OSPF Extensions in Support of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)"'>RFC4203</a>].

   The Extended IS Reachability TLV (type 22) (defined in [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>]),
   Inter-AS Reachability TLV (also called "inter-AS reachability
   information TLV") (type 141) (defined in [<a href="./rfc5316" title='"ISIS Extensions in Support of Inter-Autonomous System (AS) MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5316</a>]), and MT-ISN TLV
   (type 222) (defined in [<a href="./rfc5120" title='"M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs)"'>RFC5120</a>]) have nested sub-TLVs that permit
   the TLVs to be readily extended.  This document registers several
   sub-TLVs:

      Type    Description
      ----------------------------------------------------
       33     Unidirectional Link Delay

       34     Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay

       35     Unidirectional Delay Variation

       36     Unidirectional Link Loss

       37     Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth

       38     Unidirectional Available Bandwidth

       39     Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth

   As can be seen in the list above, the sub-TLVs described in this
   document carry different types of network-performance information.
   The new sub-TLVs include a bit called the Anomalous (or "A") bit.
   When the A bit is clear (or when the sub-TLV does not include an
   A bit), the sub-TLV describes steady-state link performance.  This
   information could conceivably be used to construct a steady-state
   performance topology for initial tunnel-path computation or to verify
   alternative failover paths.

   When network performance violates configurable link-local thresholds,
   a sub-TLV with the A bit set is advertised.  That sub-TLV could be
   used by the receiving node to determine whether to (1) fail traffic
   to a backup path or (2) calculate an entirely new path.  From an MPLS
   perspective, the intent of the A bit is to permit label switched path
   ingress nodes to determine whether the link referenced in the sub-TLV
   affects any of the label switched paths for which it is ingress.  If




<span class="grey">Ginsberg, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8570">RFC 8570</a>               IS-IS TE Metric Extensions             March 2019</span>


   they are affected, then they can determine whether those label
   switched paths still meet end-to-end performance objectives.  If not,
   then the node could conceivably move affected traffic to a
   pre-established protection label switched path or establish a new
   label switched path and place the traffic in it.

   If link performance then improves beyond a configurable minimum value
   (reuse threshold), that sub-TLV can be re-advertised with the A bit
   cleared.  In this case, a receiving node can conceivably do whatever
   re-optimization (or failback) it wishes to do (including nothing).

   Note that when a sub-TLV does not include the A bit, that sub-TLV
   cannot be used for failover purposes.  The A bit was intentionally
   omitted from some sub-TLVs to help mitigate oscillations.  See
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> for more information.

   Consistent with the existing IS-IS TE specification [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>], the
   bandwidth advertisements defined in this document MUST be encoded as
   IEEE floating-point values [<a href="#ref-IEEE754" title='"IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic"'>IEEE754</a>].  The delay and delay-variation
   advertisements defined in this document MUST be encoded as integer
   values.  Delay values MUST be quantified in units of microseconds,
   packet loss MUST be quantified as a percentage of packets sent, and
   bandwidth MUST be sent as bytes per second.  All values (except
   residual bandwidth) MUST be calculated as rolling averages, where the
   averaging period MUST be a configurable period of time.  See
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> for more information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Interface%20and%20Neighbor%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Interface and Neighbor Addresses</span>

   The use of IS-IS TE Metric Extensions sub-TLVs is not confined to the
   TE context.  In other words, IS-IS TE Metric Extensions sub-TLVs
   defined in this document can also be used for computing paths in the
   absence of a TE subsystem.

   However, as for the TE case, Interface Address and Neighbor Address
   sub-TLVs (IPv4 or IPv6) MUST be present.  The encoding is defined in
   [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>] for IPv4 and in [<a href="./rfc6119" title='"IPv6 Traffic Engineering in IS-IS"'>RFC6119</a>] for IPv6.

   It is possible for Min Delay and Max Delay to be the same value.

   When the delay value (Min Delay or Max Delay) is set to the maximum

      than this and (2) high-speed links with over 50% loss are
      unusable).  Therefore, measured values that are larger than the

   Residual Bandwidth:  This field carries the residual bandwidth on a
      link, forwarding adjacency [<a href="./rfc4206" title='"Label Switched Paths (LSP) Hierarchy with Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)"'>RFC4206</a>], or bundled link in IEEE
      floating-point format with units of bytes per second.  For a link
      or forwarding adjacency, residual bandwidth is defined to be the
      maximum bandwidth [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>] minus the bandwidth currently
      allocated to RSVP-TE label switched paths.  For a bundled link,
      residual bandwidth is defined to be the sum of the component link
      residual bandwidths.

      The calculation of residual bandwidth is different than that of
      unreserved bandwidth [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>].  This calculation subtracts tunnel
      reservations from maximum bandwidth (i.e., the link capacity)
      [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>] and provides an aggregated remainder across priorities.
      Unreserved bandwidth, on the other hand, is subtracted from the
      maximum reservable bandwidth (the bandwidth that can theoretically
      be reserved) and provides per-priority remainders.  Residual
      bandwidth and unreserved bandwidth [<a href="./rfc5305" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>] can be used
      concurrently, and each has a separate use case (e.g., the former
      can be used for applications like Weighted ECMP, while the latter
      can be used for call admission control).

   The values advertised in all sub-TLVs (except minimum/maximum delay
   and residual bandwidth) MUST represent an average over a period of

   an average.  For example, a rolling average is one such filter.

   Minimum and maximum delay MUST each be derived in one of the
   following ways: by taking the lowest and/or highest measured value
   over a measurement interval or by making use of a filter or other
   technique to obtain a reasonable representation of a minimum value
   and a maximum value representative of the interval, with compensation
   for outliers.

   The measurement interval, any filter coefficients, and any
   advertisement intervals MUST be configurable per sub-TLV.

   In addition to the measurement intervals governing re-advertisement,
   implementations SHOULD provide configurable accelerated advertisement
   thresholds per sub-TLV, such that:

   1.  If the measured parameter falls outside a configured upper bound
       for all but the minimum delay metric (or lower bound for the
       minimum delay metric only) and the advertised sub-TLV is not
       already outside that bound, or

   2.  If the difference between the last advertised value and current
       measured value exceeds a configured threshold, then

   3.  The advertisement is made immediately.

   4.  For sub-TLVs that include an A bit, an additional threshold
       SHOULD be included corresponding to the threshold for which the
       performance is considered anomalous (and sub-TLVs with the A bit
       are sent).  The A bit is cleared when the sub-TLV's performance
       has been below (or re-crosses) this threshold for one or more
       advertisement intervals to permit failback.

   To prevent oscillations, only the high threshold or the low threshold
   (but not both) may be used to trigger any given sub-TLV that
   supports both.

   Additionally, once outside the bounds of the threshold, any
   re-advertisement of a measurement within the bounds would remain
   governed solely by the measurement interval for that sub-TLV.

   When link-performance values change by small amounts that fall under
   thresholds that would cause the announcement of a sub-TLV,
   implementations SHOULD suppress sub-TLV re-advertisement and/or
   lengthen the period within which the sub-TLVs are refreshed.

   Only the accelerated advertisement threshold mechanism described in
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> may shorten the re-advertisement interval.  All suppression
   and re-advertisement interval backoff timer features SHOULD be
   configurable.

   Sections <a href="#section-5">5</a> and <a href="#section-6">6</a> provide configurable mechanisms to bound the number
   of re-advertisements.  Instability might occur in very large networks
   if measurement intervals are set low enough to overwhelm the
   processing of flooded information at some of the routers in the
   topology.  Therefore, care should be taken in setting these values.

   Additionally, the default measurement interval for all sub-TLVs
   SHOULD be 30 seconds.

   Announcements MUST also be able to be throttled using configurable
   inter-update throttle timers.  The minimum announcement periodicity
   is one announcement per second.  The default value SHOULD be set to
   120 seconds.

   Implementations SHOULD NOT permit the inter-update timer to be lower
   than the measurement interval.

   Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that any underlying performance-
   measurement mechanisms not include any significant buffer delay, any
   significant buffer-induced delay variation, or any significant loss
   due to buffer overflow or due to active queue management.

   Implementations SHOULD follow the described guidelines to mitigate
   the risk of instability.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5304">RFC5304</a>] describes an authentication method for IS-IS Link State
   PDUs that allows cryptographic authentication of IS-IS Link State
   PDUs.

   It is anticipated that in most deployments, the IS-IS protocol is
   used within an infrastructure entirely under the control of the same
   operator.  However, it is worth considering that the effect of
   sending IS-IS Traffic Engineering sub-TLVs over insecure links could
   include a man-in-the-middle attacker delaying real-time data to a
   given site or destination; this could negatively affect the value of
   the data for that site or destination.  The use of Link State PDU
   cryptographic authentication allows mitigation of the risk of
   man-in-the-middle attacks.

   Errata ID 5293 (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5293">https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5293</a>) correctly
   identified that in [<a href="./rfc7810" title='"IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions"'>RFC7810</a>] the length associated with the following
   sub-TLVs did not match the figures associated with each:

      37    Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth

      38    Unidirectional Available Bandwidth

      39    Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth

   The length specified was 4, which did not include the RESERVED field
   shown in the figures.  Subsequent investigation revealed that some
   implementations had used the specified length (4) and omitted the
   RESERVED field while other implementations included the specified
   RESERVED field and used a length of 5.

   Because these different implementation choices are not interoperable,
   it was decided that a bis version should be generated to resolve this
   ambiguity.

   The choice made here is to omit the unused RESERVED field from these
   sub-TLVs and use the length of 4.  This matches the corresponding
   advertisements specified in the equivalent OSPF TE specification
   [<a href="./rfc7471" title='"OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions"'>RFC7471</a>] and the corresponding BGP - Link State (BGP-LS)
   specification [<a href="./rfc8571" title='"BGP - Link State (BGP-LS) Advertisement of IGP Traffic Engineering Performance Metric Extensions"'>RFC8571</a>].

   Some minor editorial corrections have also been made.

   Errata ID 5486 (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5486">https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5486</a>) identified
   that in <a href="./rfc7810#section-4.6">SectionÂ 4.6 of [RFC7810]</a> the definition of available
   bandwidth on bundled links used a circular definition, i.e., it used
   "sum of the component link available bandwidths" when it should have
   used "sum of the component link residual bandwidths".  This has been
   corrected and clarified.
