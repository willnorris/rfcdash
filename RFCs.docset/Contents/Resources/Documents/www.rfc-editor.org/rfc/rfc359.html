         HE STATUS OF THE RELEASE OF THE NEW IMP SYSTEM (2600)

        We have still not managed to get the new IMP system up.


     To recapitulate:

     We tried the first time May 15; but, completely under- estimating
the difficulty of distributing the new system to over twenty-five
sites, we never even got around to debugging the system.

     We developed a suitable distribution mechanism and tried again
May 31.  This time we got to debug the new IMP system and found a
number of problems which precluded leaving the new system up.

     Trying again June 6, we got the new IMP system up and working
quite well, but the version of the TIP system which runs with the new
IMP system wouldn't work hardly at all.  So we put the old systems
back up again.

     The day before yesterday, June 20, we tried again.  The IMPs and
TIPs loaded and seemed to fly quite well, so we left the new systems
up.  But by yesterday, June 21, afternoon, with crashes happening in
TIPs at the rate of about one per hour, we backed off again and put
the old systems back up.  (One TIP crash per hour in the network means
there is about one crash every eight or ten hours debugging with one
TIP which makes it nasty to debug.)

     We plan to skip Tuesday, June 27, and Tuesday, July 4, and to try
again Thursday, July 6 (1972), and if necessary, again on Tuesday,
July 18, and following Tuesdays, as per RFC #343.
