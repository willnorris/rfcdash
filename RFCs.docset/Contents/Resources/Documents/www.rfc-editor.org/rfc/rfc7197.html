    <span class="h1">Duplication Delay Attribute in the Session Description Protocol</span>

Abstract

   A straightforward approach to provide protection against packet
   losses due to network outages with a longest duration of T time units
   is to duplicate the original packets and send each copy separated in
   time by at least T time units.  This approach is commonly referred to
   as "time-shifted redundancy", "temporal redundancy", or simply
   "delayed duplication".  This document defines an attribute to
   indicate the presence of temporally redundant media streams and the
   duplication delay in the Session Description Protocol.

   Inside an IP network, packet delivery may be interrupted due to
   failure of a physical link, interface, or device.  To reduce the
   impact of such interruptions, some networks are built in a resilient
   manner, allowing for multiple alternative paths between two
   endpoints.  However, if there is no resiliency in the network or the
   failure happens in a non-resilient part of the network, a temporary
   outage will occur (i.e., packets will get dropped).  The outage will
   last until network reconvergence takes place (i.e., until
   connectivity is restored) around the failure.  Typically, network
   reconvergence takes between tens and hundreds of milliseconds,
   depending on the size and features of the network.

   There are a number of network-reconvergence technologies available
   today, such as IP Fast Convergence, MPLS Traffic Engineering Fast
   Reroute, and Multicast Only Fast Reroute.  These technologies can be
   augmented by different types of application-layer loss-repair methods
   such as Forward Error Correction (FEC), retransmission, temporal

   redundancy, and spatial redundancy to minimize (and sometimes totally
   eliminate) the impact of outages.  Each combination has its distinct
   requirements in terms of bandwidth consumption and results in a
   different network complexity.  Thus, a network operator has to
   carefully consider what combination to deploy for different parts of
   a network (e.g., core vs. edge).  A detailed overview of network-
   convergence technologies and loss-repair methods is provided in
   [<a href="#ref-IC2011" title='"Toward Lossless Video Transport"'>IC2011</a>].

   One of the loss-repair methods is temporal redundancy, also known as
   delayed duplication.  A media sender using this method transmits an
   original source packet and transmits its duplicate after a certain
   delay following the original transmission.  If a network outage hits
   the original transmission, the expectation is that the second
   transmission arrives at the receiver (with a high probability).
   Alternatively, the second transmission may be hit by an outage and so
   gets dropped, and the original transmission completes successfully.
   Also, both transmissions can arrive on the receiver side; in that
   case, the receiver (or the node that does the duplicate suppression)
   needs to identify the duplicate packets and discard them
   appropriately, thereby producing a duplicate-free stream.

   Delayed duplication can be used in a variety of multimedia
   applications where there is sufficient bandwidth for the duplicated
   traffic and the application can tolerate the introduced delay.
   However, it must be used with care, since it might easily result in a
   new series of denial-of-service attacks.  Delayed duplication is
   harmful in cases where the primary cause of packet loss is
   congestion, rather than a network outage due to a temporary link or
   network element failure.  Duplication should only be used by
   endpoints that want to protect against network failures; protection
   against congestion must be achieved through other means, as
   duplication will only make congestion worse.

   One particular use case for delayed duplication is to improve the
   reliability of real-time video feeds inside a core IP network where
   bandwidth is plentiful and maximum reliability (preferably zero loss)
   is desired [<a href="#ref-IC2011" title='"Toward Lossless Video Transport"'>IC2011</a>].  Compared to other redundancy approaches such as
   FEC [<a href="./rfc6363" title='"Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework"'>RFC6363</a>] and redundant data encoding (e.g., [<a href="./rfc2198" title='"RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data"'>RFC2198</a>]), delayed
   duplication is easy to implement, since it does not require any
   special type of encoding or decoding.

   For duplicate suppression, the receiver has to be able to identify
   the identical packets.  This is straightforward for media packets
   that carry one or more unique identifiers such as the sequence number
   field in the RTP header [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  In non-RTP applications, the
   receiver can use unique sequence numbers if available or other
   alternative approaches to compare the incoming packets and discard
   the duplicate ones.

   This specification introduces a new Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] attribute for applications/services using the delayed
   duplication method to indicate the relative delay for each additional
   duplication.  The attribute is used with the duplication grouping
   semantics defined in [<a href="./rfc7104" title='"Duplication Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol"'>RFC7104</a>].

   This specification does not explain how to select the duplication
   delay that a sender should use; the selection technique depends on
   the underlying network and the reconvergence technologies used inside
   such a network.  This specification does not explain how the receiver
   should suppress the duplicate packets and merge the incoming streams
   to produce a loss-free and duplication-free output stream (a process
   commonly called "stream merging"), either.  An application or a
   transport service that will use the delayed duplication method must
   determine its own rules about stream merging.

   In practice, more than two redundant streams are unlikely to be used,
   since the additional delay and increased overhead are not easily
   justified.  However, we define the new attribute in a general way so
   that it could be used with more than two redundant streams (i.e.,
   multiple duplications), if needed.  While the primary focus in this
   specification is the RTP-based transport, the new attribute is
   applicable to both RTP and non-RTP streams.  Protocol issues and
   details on duplicating RTP streams are presented in [<a href="./rfc7198" title='"Duplicating RTP Streams"'>RFC7198</a>].

   The following ABNF [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] syntax formally describes the
   'duplication-delay' attribute:

      delaying-attribute     = "a=duplication-delay:" periods CRLF
      periods                = period *( SP period)
      period                 = 1*DIGIT ; in milliseconds

             ABNF Syntax for the 'duplication-delay' Attribute

   The 'duplication-delay' attribute is defined as both a media-level
   and session-level attribute.  It specifies the relative delay with
   respect to the previous transmission of each duplication in
   milliseconds (ms) at the time of transmission.  The following rules
   apply:

   o  If used as a media-level attribute, it MUST be used with the
      'ssrc-group' attribute and "DUP" grouping semantics as defined in
      [<a href="./rfc7104" title='"Duplication Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol"'>RFC7104</a>].  When used as a media-level attribute, the relative
      delay value(s) it specifies SHALL apply to every Synchronization
      Source (SSRC)-based duplication grouping in the same media
      description.  In other words, one cannot specify different
      duplication delay values for different duplication groups in the
      same media description.

   o  If used as a session-level attribute, it MUST be used with 'group'
      attribute and "DUP" grouping semantics as defined in [<a href="./rfc7104" title='"Duplication Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol"'>RFC7104</a>].
      When used as a session-level attribute, the relative delay
      value(s) it specifies SHALL apply to every duplication grouping in
      the same SDP description.  In other words, one cannot specify
      different duplication delay values for different duplication
      groups in the same SDP description.  If one needs to specify
      different duplication delay values for different duplication
      groups, then one MUST use different SDP descriptions for each or
      MUST use the 'duplication-delay' attribute at the media level.  In
      that case, the 'duplication-delay' attribute MUST NOT be used at
      the session level.

   o  For offer/answer model considerations, refer to [<a href="./rfc7104" title='"Duplication Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol"'>RFC7104</a>].

   In the first example below, the multicast stream consists of two RTP
   streams, each duplicated once, resulting in two sets of two-stream
   groups.  The same duplication delay of 100 ms is applied to each
   grouping.  The first set's streams have SSRCs of 1000 and 1010, and
   the second set's streams have SSRCs of 1020 and 1030.

   Note that in actual use, SSRC values, which are random 32-bit
   numbers, could be much larger than the ones shown in this example.

   In the second example below, the multicast stream is duplicated
   twice.  50 ms after the original transmission, the first duplicate is
   transmitted, and 100 ms after that, the second duplicate is
   transmitted.  In other words, the same packet is transmitted three
   times over a period of 150 ms.

   In the third example below, the multicast UDP stream is duplicated
   with a duplication delay of 50 ms.  Redundant streams are sent in
   separate source-specific multicast (SSM) sessions, so the receiving
   host has to join both SSM sessions if it wants to receive both
   streams.

   The 'duplication-delay' attribute is not believed to introduce any
   significant security risk to multimedia applications.  A malevolent
   third party could use this attribute to misguide the receiver(s)
   about the duplication delays and/or the number of redundant streams.
   For example, if the malevolent third party increases the value of the
   duplication delay, the receiver(s) will unnecessarily incur a longer
   delay, since they will have to wait for the entire period.  Or, if
   the duplication delay is reduced by the malevolent third party, the
   receiver(s) might not wait long enough for the duplicated
   transmission and incur unnecessary packet losses.  However, these
   require intercepting and rewriting the packets carrying the SDP
   description; if an interceptor can do that, many more attacks are
   also possible.

   In order to avoid attacks of this sort, the SDP description needs to
   be integrity protected and provided with source authentication.  This
   can, for example, be achieved on an end-to-end basis using S/MIME
   [<a href="./rfc5652" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5652</a>] [<a href="./rfc5751" title='"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Message Specification"'>RFC5751</a>] when SDP is used in a signaling packet using MIME
   types (application/sdp).  Alternatively, HTTPS [<a href="./rfc2818" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>RFC2818</a>] or the
   authentication method in the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [<a href="./rfc2974" title='"Session Announcement Protocol"'>RFC2974</a>] could be used as well.



<span class="grey">Begen, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-8"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7197">RFC 7197</a>           Duplication Delay Attribute in SDP         April 2014</span>


   Another security risk is due to possible software misconfiguration or
   a software bug where a large number of duplicates could be
   unwillingly signaled in the 'duplication-delay' attribute.
   Similarly, an attacker can use this attribute to start a denial-of-
   service attack by signaling and sending too many duplicated streams.
   In applications where this attribute is to be used, it is a good
   practice to put a hard limit on both the number of duplicate streams
   and the total delay introduced due to duplication, regardless of what
   the SDP description specifies.

   Since this mechanism causes duplication of media packets, if those
   packets are also cryptographically protected (e.g., encrypted) then
   such duplication could act as an accelerator if any Million Message
   [<a href="./rfc3218" title='"Preventing the Million Message Attack on Cryptographic Message Syntax"'>RFC3218</a>] or similar attack such as Lucky 13 [<a href="#ref-Lucky13" title='"Lucky Thirteen: Breaking the TLS and DTLS Record Protocols"'>Lucky13</a>] exists against
   the security mechanism that is in use.  Such acceleration could turn
   an otherwise infeasible attack into one that is practical; however,
   assuming that the amount of duplication is small and that such weak
   or broken security mechanisms should really not be used, the overall
   security impact of the duplication should be minimal.  If, however, a
   bad actor were in control of the SDP but did not have access to the
   keying material used for media, then such a bad actor could
   potentially use the SDP to cause the media handling to use a weak or
   broken mechanism with a lot of duplication, in which case the
   duplication could be significant.  Deployments where the SDP is
   controlled by an actor who should not have access to the media keying
   material should therefore be cautious in their use of this
   duplication mechanism.

   If this mechanism were used in conjunction with a source description
   (SDES) and if the key being used for media protection is derived from
   a human-memorable or otherwise dictionary-attackable secret, then the
   duplication done here could allow for a more efficient dictionary
   attack against the media.  The right countermeasure is to use proper
   keying or, if using an SDES, to ensure that the keys used are not
   dictionary-attackable.
