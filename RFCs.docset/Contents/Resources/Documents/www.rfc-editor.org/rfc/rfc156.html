Status of the Illinois Site (Response to <a href="./rfc0116">RFC 0116</a>)

As of the date of the report, 26 April, the Illinois Site has complete
operational hardware connecting the PDP-11 system with the IMP.

Due to much trouble with the Burroughs B6500 computer, final checkout
of the operating system plus the network control program for the
PDP-11 has been seriously curtailed.  Current expectations are:

     --checkout of the NCP by the latter part of May

     --installation of the PDP-11 system in Paoli, PA (the operating
       link between Illinois and Burroughs in Paoli) so that the system
       will be operational during June
