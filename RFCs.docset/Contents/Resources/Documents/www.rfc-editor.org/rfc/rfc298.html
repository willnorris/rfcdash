                          NETWORK HOST STATUS


   This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from January 17
   to January 28.

   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These
   Hosts fall into two categories:

   1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as
      servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis
      for at least two weeks.  Included here are:

         NETWORK             SITE           COMPUTER
         ADDRESS

         133                 BBN            PDP-10(B)
         13                  Case           PDP-10
         15                  Ames/(Paoli)   ILLIAC/(B6500)

   2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included
      here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network
      (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).  This category also includes the
      Network Control Center (Network Address 5) which is used solely
      for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included
      among these Hosts are the following:

         NETWORK             SITE           COMPUTER
         ADDRESS

         7                   Rand           IBM-360/65
         73                  Harvard        PDP-1
         12                  Illinois       PDP-11
         19                  NBS            PDP-11

   NOTE:  During this interval both the UTAH PDP-10 and the RAND PDP-10
          became Network servers.

   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this
   period.

   * The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as
   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to
   refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

    where

      D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to
      network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal
      IMP.)

      H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
      immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

      O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible
      to users.)

      R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

      T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open
      a connection within 60 second)

      * The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a
      Network Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not
      equipped to test NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection
      to the NETRJS logger indicated the NETRJS is also functioning.

      #These sites advertise that they may not have their system
