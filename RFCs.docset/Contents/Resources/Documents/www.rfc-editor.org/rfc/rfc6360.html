<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Background</span>

   The For Your Information (FYI) sub-series of RFCs was established by
   <a href="./rfc1150">RFC 1150</a> [<a href="./rfc1150" title='"FYI on FYI: Introduction to the FYI Notes"'>RFC1150</a>] in 1990 for use by the IETF User Services Area,
   which has not met since IETF 53 held in March 2001.  This RFC sub-
   series was designed to provide Internet users with a repository of
   information regarding the Internet that might be interesting to a
   wide range of people.

   The publication of <a href="./rfc1150">RFC 1150</a> [<a href="./rfc1150" title='"FYI on FYI: Introduction to the FYI Notes"'>RFC1150</a>] introduced the FYI sub-series
   of RFCs.  Since that time, a total of 38 FYI numbers have been
   assigned.  Many other Informational RFCs have been published that are
   not part of the FYI sub-series.

   The list of documents in the FYI sub-series can be found on the RFC
   Editor web site [<a href="#ref-INDEX" title='"FYI Index"'>INDEX</a>].

   The IESG does not intend to make any further additions to the FYI
   sub-series.  The IESG intends to continue to produce Informational
   RFCs, but none of them will be assigned an FYI number.

   All published RFCs that are currently part of the FYI sub-series will
   retain their FYI numbers.  The FYI numbers continue to provide
   reference points for these documents, and the FYI number can be used
   in citations to these documents.

   If a future RFC is published that obsoletes an existing member of the
   FYI sub-series, the new RFC will not be assigned an FYI number.

   This document moves <a href="./rfc1150">RFC 1150</a> [<a href="./rfc1150" title='"FYI on FYI: Introduction to the FYI Notes"'>RFC1150</a>] to Historic.  The procedural
   information in <a href="./rfc1150">RFC 1150</a> is no longer valid.  If it becomes desirable
   to make additions to the FYI sub-series in the future, new procedures
   can be developed to replace this document.

   No Internet security issues are anticipated by the actions described
   in this document.
