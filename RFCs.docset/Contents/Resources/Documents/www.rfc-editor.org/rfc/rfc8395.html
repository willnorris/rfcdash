<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The mechanism described in [<a href="./rfc6391" title='"Flow-Aware Transport of Pseudowires over an MPLS Packet Switched Network"'>RFC6391</a>] uses an additional label (Flow
   Label) in the MPLS label stack to allow Label Switching Routers
   (LSRs) to balance flows within Pseudowires (PWs) at a finer
   granularity than the individual PWs across the Equal Cost Multiple
   Paths (ECMPs) that exists within the Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   Furthermore, [<a href="./rfc6391" title='"Flow-Aware Transport of Pseudowires over an MPLS Packet Switched Network"'>RFC6391</a>] defines the LDP protocol extensions required
   to synchronize the flow label states between the ingress and egress
   PEs when using the signaling procedures defined in the [<a href="./rfc8077" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC8077</a>].

   A PW [<a href="./rfc3985" title='"Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture"'>RFC3985</a>] is transported over one single network path, even if
   ECMPs exist between the ingress and egress PW provider edge (PE)
   equipment.  This is required to preserve the characteristics of the
   emulated service.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8395">RFC 8395</a>               BGP-Signaled FAT PW Labels              June 2018</span>


   This document introduces an optional mode of operation allowing a PW
   to be transported over ECMPs, for example when the use of ECMPs is
   known to be beneficial to the operation of the PW.  This
   specification uses the principles defined in [<a href="./rfc6391" title='"Flow-Aware Transport of Pseudowires over an MPLS Packet Switched Network"'>RFC6391</a>] and augments
   the BGP-signaling procedures of [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="./rfc6624" title='"Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC6624</a>].  The use of
   a single path to preserve the packet delivery order remains the
   default mode of operation of a PW and is described in [<a href="./rfc4385" title='"Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Control Word for Use over an MPLS PSN"'>RFC4385</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc4928" title='"Avoiding Equal Cost Multipath Treatment in MPLS Networks"'>RFC4928</a>].

   High-bandwidth Ethernet-based services are a prime example that use
   of the optional mode benefits from the ability to load-balance flows
   in a PW over multiple PSN paths.  In general, load-balancing is
   applicable when the PW attachment circuit bandwidth and PSN core link
   bandwidth are of the same order of magnitude.

   To achieve the load-balancing goal, [<a href="./rfc6391" title='"Flow-Aware Transport of Pseudowires over an MPLS Packet Switched Network"'>RFC6391</a>] introduces the notion
   of an additional Label Stack Entry (LSE) (flow label) located at the
   bottom of the stack (right after PW LSE).  LSRs commonly generate a
   hash of the label stack in order to discriminate and distribute flows
   over available ECMPs.  The presence of the flow label (closely
   associated to a flow determined by the ingress PE) will normally
   provide the greatest entropy.

   Furthermore, following the procedures for inter-AS scenarios
   described in <a href="./rfc4761#section-3.4">Section 3.4 of [RFC4761]</a>, the flow label should never be
   handled by the ASBRs; only the terminating PEs on each AS will be
   responsible for popping or pushing this label.  This is equally
   applicable to Method B as described in <a href="./rfc4761#section-3.4.2">Section 3.4.2 of [RFC4761]</a>,
   where ASBRs are responsible for swapping the PW label as traffic
   traverses from ASBR to PE and ASBR to ASBR.  Therefore, the flow
   label will remain untouched across AS boundaries.

   The Layer2 Info Extended Community is used to signal control
   information about the PWs to be set up.  The Extended Community
   format is described in [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>].  The format of this Extended
   Community is described as:

            +------------------------------------+
            | Extended Community type (2 octets) |
            +------------------------------------+
            |  Encaps Type (1 octet)             |

   Control Flags:

   This field contains bit flags relating to the control information
   about PWs.  This field is augmented with a definition of two new
   flags fields.

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

            Figure 2: Control Flags Bit Vector

   With reference to the Control Flags Bit Vector, the following bits in
   the Control Flags are defined.  The remaining bits, designated "Z",
   MUST be set to zero when sending and MUST be ignored when receiving
   this Extended Community.

      T   When the bit value is 1, the PE announces the ability to send
          a PW packet that includes a flow label.  When the bit value is
          0, the PE is indicating that it will not send a PW packet
          containing a flow label.

      R   When the bit value is 1, the PE is able to receive a PW packet
          with a flow label present.  When the bit value is 0, the PE is
          unable to receive a PW packet with the flow label present.

   As part of the PW signaling procedures described in [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>], a
   Layer2 Info Extended Community is advertised in the Virtual Private
   LAN Service (VPLS) BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).

   A PE that wishes to send a flow label in a PW packet MUST include in
   its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer2 Info Extended Community using Control
   Flags field with T = 1.

   A PE that is willing to receive a flow label in a PW packet MUST
   include in its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer2 Info Extended Community using
   Control Flags field with R = 1.

   A PE that receives a VPLS BGP NLRI containing a Layer2 Info Extended
   Community with R = 0 MUST NOT include a flow label in the PW packet.

   Therefore, a PE sending a Control Flags field with T = 1 and
   receiving a Control Flags field with R = 1 MUST include a flow label
   in the PW packet.  With any other combination, a PE MUST NOT include
   a flow label in the PW packet.

   A PE MAY support the configuration of the flow label (T and R bits)
   on a per-service basis (e.g., a VPLS VPN Forwarding Instance (VFI)).
   Furthermore, it is also possible that on a given service, PEs may not
   share the same flow label settings.  The presence of a flow label is
   therefore determined on a per-peer basis and according to the local
   and remote T and R bit values.  For example, a PE part of a VPLS and
   with a local T = 1 must only transmit traffic with a flow label to
   those peers that signaled R = 1.  If the same PE has local R = 1, it
   must only expect to receive traffic with a flow label from peers with
   T = 1.  Any other traffic must not have a flow label.  A PE expecting
   to receive traffic from a remote peer with a flow label MAY drop
   traffic that has no flow label.  A PE expecting to receive traffic
   from a remote peer with no flow label MAY drop traffic that has a
   flow label.

   Modification of flow label settings may impact traffic over a PW, as
   these could trigger changes in the PEs data-plane programming (i.e.,
   imposition/disposition of the flow label).  This is an
   implementation-specific behavior and is outside the scope of this
   document.

   The signaling procedures in [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] state that the unspecified bits
   in the Control Flags field (bits 0-5) MUST be set to zero when
   sending and MUST be ignored when receiving.  The signaling procedure
   described here is therefore backwards compatible with existing
   implementations.  A PE not supporting the extensions described in
   this document will always advertise a value of zero in the R bit;
   therefore, a flow label will never be included in a packet sent to it
   by one of its peers.  Similarly, it will always advertise a value of
   zero in the T bit; therefore, a peer will know that a flow label will
   never be included in a packet sent by it.

   Note that what is signaled is the desire to include the flow LSE in
   the label stack.  The value of the flow label is a local matter for
   the ingress PE, and the label value itself is not signaled.

   Although [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] defined a Control Flags Bit Vector as part of the
   Layer2 Info Extended Community, it did not ask for the creation of a
   registry.

   Per this document, IANA has created the "Layer2 Info Extended
   Community Control Flags Bit Vector" registry
   &lt;<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-extended-communities">https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-extended-communities</a>&gt;.

   Based on [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and this document, the initial contents of this
   registry are as follows:

   Value   Name                               Reference

   As per [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and this document, the remaining bits are
   unassigned, and MUST be set to zero when sending and MUST be ignored
   when receiving the Layer2 Info Extended Community.
