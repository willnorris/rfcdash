      <span class="h1">Signal-Free Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Multicast</span>

Abstract

   When multicast sources and receivers are active at Locator/ID
   Separation Protocol (LISP) sites, the core network is required to use
   native multicast so packets can be delivered from sources to group
   members.  When multicast is not available to connect the multicast
   sites together, a signal-free mechanism can be used to allow traffic
   to flow between sites.  The mechanism described in this document uses
   unicast replication and encapsulation over the core network for the
   data plane and uses the LISP mapping database system so encapsulators
   at the source LISP multicast site can find decapsulators at the
   receiver LISP multicast sites.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   When multicast sources and receivers are active at LISP sites, and
   the core network between the sites does not provide multicast
   support, a signal-free mechanism can be used to create an overlay
   that will allow multicast traffic to flow between sites and connect
   the multicast trees at the different sites.

   The signal-free mechanism proposed here does not extend PIM [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>]
   over the overlay as proposed in [<a href="./rfc6831" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) for Multicast Environments"'>RFC6831</a>], nor does the mechanism
   utilize direct signaling between the Receiver-ETRs and Sender-ITRs as
   described in [<a href="#ref-LISP-MULTI-SIGNALING">LISP-MULTI-SIGNALING</a>].  The signal-free mechanism
   proposed reduces the amount of signaling required between sites to a
   minimum and is centered around the registration of receiver sites for
   a particular multicast group or multicast channel with the LISP
   mapping system.

   Registrations from the different receiver sites will be merged at the
   mapping system to assemble a multicast-replication-list inclusive of
   all Routing Locators (RLOCs) that lead to receivers for a particular
   multicast group or multicast channel.  The replication list for each
   specific multicast entry is maintained as a database mapping entry in
   the LISP mapping system.

   When the Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) at the source site receives
   multicast traffic from sources at its site, the ITR can query the
   mapping system by issuing Map-Request messages for the (S,G) source
   and destination addresses in the packets received.  The mapping
   system will return the RLOC replication list to the ITR, which the
   ITR will cache as per standard LISP procedure.  Since the core is
   assumed to not support multicast, the ITR will replicate the
   multicast traffic for each RLOC on the replication list and will
   unicast encapsulate the traffic to each RLOC.  The combined function
   or replicating and encapsulating the traffic to the RLOCs in the
   replication list is referred to as "rep-encapsulation" in this
   document.

   The document describes general procedures (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>) and information
   encoding that are required at the receiver sites and source sites to
   achieve signal-free multicast interconnectivity.  The general
   procedures for mapping system notifications to different sites are
   also described.  A section dedicated to the specific case of Source-
   Specific Multicast (SSM) trees discusses the implications to the
   general procedures for SSM multicast trees over different topological
   scenarios.  A section on Any-Source Multicast (ASM) support is
   included to identify the constraints that come along with supporting
   it using LISP signal-free multicast.

   There is a section dedicated to Replication Engineering, which is a
   mechanism to reduce the impact of head-end replication.  The mapping
   system, via LISP signal-free mechanisms, can be used to build a layer
   of Re-encapsulating Tunnel Routers (RTRs).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Definition%20of%20Terms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Definition of Terms</span>

   LISP-related terms, notably Map-Request, Map-Reply, Ingress Tunnel
   Router (ITR), Egress Tunnel Router (ETR), Map-Server (MS), and
   Map-Resolver (MR) are defined in the LISP specification [<a href="./rfc6830" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)"'>RFC6830</a>].

   Extensions to the definitions in [<a href="./rfc6830" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)"'>RFC6830</a>] for their application to
   multicast routing are documented in [<a href="./rfc6831" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) for Multicast Environments"'>RFC6831</a>].

   Terms defining interactions with the LISP mapping system are defined
   in [<a href="./rfc6833" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Map-Server Interface"'>RFC6833</a>].

   The following terms are consistent with the definitions in [<a href="./rfc6830" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)"'>RFC6830</a>]
   and [<a href="./rfc6831" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) for Multicast Environments"'>RFC6831</a>].  The terms are specific cases of the general terms and
   are defined here to facilitate the descriptions and discussions
   within this particular document.

   Source: Multicast source endpoint.  The host that originates
   multicast packets.

   Receiver: Multicast group member endpoint.  The host joins a
   multicast group as a receiver of multicast packets sent to the group.

   Receiver site: LISP site where multicast receivers are located.

   Source site: LISP site where multicast sources are located.

   RP site: LISP site where an ASM PIM Rendezvous Point (RP) [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>]
   is located.  The RP site and the source site MAY be the same in some
   situations.

   Receiver-ETR: LISP decapsulating the Tunnel Router (xTR) at the
   receiver site.  This is a multicast ETR.

   Source-ITR: LISP encapsulating xTR at the source site.  This is a
   multicast ITR.

   RP-xTR: LISP xTR at the RP site.  This is typically a multicast ITR.

   Replication list: Mapping-entry containing the list of RLOCs that
   have registered receivers for a particular multicast entry.

   Multicast entry: A tuple identifying a multicast tree.  Multicast
   entries are in the form of (S-prefix, G-prefix).

   Rep-encapsulation: The process of replicating and then encapsulating
   traffic to multiple RLOCs.

   Re-encapsulating Tunnel Router (RTR): An RTR is a router that
   implements the re-encapsulating tunnel function detailed in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>
   of the main LISP specification [<a href="./rfc6830" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)"'>RFC6830</a>].  A LISP RTR performs packet
   re-routing by chaining ETR and ITR functions, whereby it first
   removes the LISP header of an ingress packet and then prepends a new
   LISP header to an egress packet.

   RTR Level: An RTR level is encoded in a Replication List Entry (RLE)
   LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) Type detailed in [<a href="./rfc8060" title='"LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF)"'>RFC8060</a>].
   Each entry in the replication list contains an address of an xTR and
   a level value.  Level values are used to create a replication
   hierarchy so that ITRs at source LISP sites replicate to the lowest
   (smaller value) level number RTRs in an RLE.  And then RTRs at a
   given level replicate to the next higher level of RTRs.  The number
   of RTRs at each level are engineered to control the fan-out or
   replication factor, so a trade-off between the width of the level
   versus the number of levels can be selected.

   ASM: Any-Source Multicast as defined in [<a href="./rfc3569" title='"An Overview of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)"'>RFC3569</a>] where multicast
   distribution trees are built with a Rendezvous Point [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>].

   SSM: Source-Specific Multicast as defined in [<a href="./rfc3569" title='"An Overview of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)"'>RFC3569</a>] where
   multicast distribution trees are built and rooted at the multicast
   router(s) directly connected to the multicast source.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8378">RFC 8378</a>               Signal-Free LISP Multicast               May 2018</span>


   Map-Servers and Map-Resolvers are reachable in the RLOC space in the
   core; only one is shown for illustration purposes, but these can be
   many or even part of a distributed mapping system, such as a
   Delegated Database Tree (DDT).

   The procedures for interconnecting multicast trees over an overlay
   can be broken down into three functional areas:

   o  Receiver-site procedures

   o  Source-site procedures

   o  LISP notification procedures

   The receiver-site procedures will be common for most tree types and
   topologies.

   The procedures at the source site can vary depending on the type of
   trees being interconnected as well as the topological relation
   between sources and source-site xTRs.  For ASM trees, a special case
   of the source site is the RP site for which a variation of the
   source-site procedures MAY be necessary if ASM trees are to be
   supported in future specifications of LISP signal-free multicast.

   The LISP notification procedures between sites are normalized for the
   different possible scenarios.  Certain scenarios MAY benefit from a
   simplified notification mechanism or no notification requirement at
   all.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20General%20Procedures"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  General Procedures</span>

   The interconnection of multicast trees across different LISP sites
   involves the following procedures to build the necessary multicast
   distribution trees across sites.

   1.  The presence of multicast receiver endpoints is detected by the
       Receiver-ETRs at the receiver sites.

   2.  Receiver-ETRs register their RLOCs as part of the replication
       list for the multicast entry the detected receivers subscribe to.

   3.  The mapping system merges all Receiver-ETR or delivery-group
       RLOCs to build a comprehensive replication list inclusive of all
       receiver sites for each multicast entry.

   4.  LISP Map-Notify messages MUST be sent to the Source-ITR informing
       of any changes in the replication list.

   5.  Multicast tree building at the source site is initiated when the
       Source-ITR receives the LISP notification.

   Once the multicast distribution trees are built, the following
   forwarding procedures may take place:

   1.  The source sends multicast packets to the multicast group
       destination address.

   2.  Multicast traffic follows the multicast tree built at the source
       site and makes its way to the Source-ITRs.

   3.  The Source-ITR will issue a Map-Request to resolve the
       replication list for the multicast entry.

   4.  The mapping system responds to the Source-ITR with a Map-Reply
       containing the replication list for the multicast group
       requested.

   5.  The Source-ITR caches the replication list received in the
       map-reply for the multicast entry.

   6.  Multicast traffic is rep-encapsulated.  That is, the packet is
       replicated for each RLOC in the replication list and then
       encapsulated to each one.

   When the Receiver-ETRs are directly connected to the receivers (e.g.,
   Receiver-site-4 in Figure 1), the Receiver-ETRs will receive IGMP
   reports from the receivers indicating which group the receivers wish
   to subscribe to.  Based on these IGMP reports, the Receiver-ETR is
   made aware of the presence of receivers as well as which group they
   are interested in.

   When the Receiver-ETRs are several hops away from the receivers
   (e.g., Receiver-site-2 in Figure 1), the Receiver-ETRs will receive
   PIM join messages, which will allow the Receiver-ETR to know that
   there are multicast receivers at the site and also to learn which
   multicast group the receivers are for.

   Once the Receiver-ETRs detect the presence of receivers at the
   receiver site, the Receiver-ETRs MUST issue Map-Register messages to
   include the Receiver-ETR RLOCs in the replication list for the
   multicast entry the receivers joined.

   The Map-Register message MUST use the multicast entry (Source, Group)
   tuple as its Endpoint ID (EID) record type with the Receiver-ETR
   RLOCs conforming the locator set.

   The EID in the Map-Register message MUST be encoded using the
   Multicast Info LCAF Type defined in [<a href="./rfc8060" title='"LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF)"'>RFC8060</a>].

   The RLOC in the Map-Register message MUST be encoded using the RLE
   LCAF Type defined in [<a href="./rfc8060" title='"LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF)"'>RFC8060</a>] with the Level Value fields for all
   entries set to 128 (decimal).

   The encoding described above MUST be used consistently for Map-
   Register messages, entries in the mapping system, Map-Reply messages,
   as well as the map-cache at the Source-ITRs.

   The Map-Register messages [<a href="./rfc6830" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)"'>RFC6830</a>] sent by the Receiver-ETRs MUST
   have the following bits set as specified here:

   1.  merge-request bit set to 1.  The Map-Register messages are sent
       with "Merge Semantics".  The Map-Server will receive
       registrations from a multitude of Receiver-ETRs.  The Map-Server
       will merge the registrations for common EIDs and maintain a
       consolidated replication list for each multicast entry.

   2.  want-map-notify bit (M) set to 0.  This tells the mapping system
       that the Receiver-ETR does not expect to receive Map-Notify
       messages as it does not need to be notified of all changes to the
       replication list.

   3.  proxy-reply bit (P) set to 1.  The merged replication list is
       kept in the Map-Servers.  By setting the proxy-reply bit, the
       Receiver-ETRs instruct the mapping system to proxy reply to Map-
       Requests issued for the multicast entries.

   Map-Register messages for a particular multicast entry MAY be sent
   for every receiver detected, even if previous receivers have been
   detected for the particular multicast entry.  This allows the
   replication list to remain up to date.

   Receiver-ETRs MUST be configured to know what Map-Servers Map-
   Register messages are sent to.  The configuration is likely to be
   associated with an S-prefix that multiple (S,G) entries match to and
   are more specific for.  Therefore, the S-prefix determines the Map-
   Server set in the least number of configuration statements.

   The Map-Server will receive registrations from a multitude of
   Receiver-ETRs.  The Map-Server will merge the registrations for
   common EIDs and consolidate a replication list for each multicast
   entry.

   When an ETR sends an RLE RLOC-record in a Map-Register and the RLE
   already exists in the Map-Server's RLE-merged list, the Map-Server
   will replace the single RLE with the information from the Map-
   Register RLOC-record.  The Map-Server MUST NOT merge duplicate RLOCs
   in the consolidated replication list.

   Source-ITRs MUST register the unicast EIDs of any sources or
   Rendezvous Points that may be present on the source site.  In other
   words, it is assumed that the sources and RPs are LISP EIDs.

   The registration of the unicast EIDs for the sources or Rendezvous
   Points allows the Map-Server to know where to send Map-Notify
   messages to.  Therefore, the Source-ITR MUST register the unicast
   S-prefix EID with the want-map-notify bit set in order to receive
   Map-Notify messages whenever there is a change in the replication
   list.

   When the source site receives the Map-Notify messages from the
   mapping system as described in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>, it will initiate the
   process of building a multicast distribution tree that will allow the
   multicast packets from the source to reach the Source-ITR.

   The Source-ITR MUST issue a PIM join for the multicast entry for
   which it received the Map-Notify message.  The join will be issued in
   the direction of the source or in the direction of the RP for the SSM
   and ASM cases, respectively.

   On reception of multicast packets, the Source-ITR obtains the
   replication list for the (S,G) addresses in the packets.

   In order to obtain the replication list, the Source-ITR MUST issue a
   Map-Request message in which the EID is the (S,G) multicast tuple,
   which is encoded using the Multicast Info LCAF Type defined in
   [<a href="./rfc8060" title='"LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF)"'>RFC8060</a>].

   The mapping system (most likely the Map-Server) will Map-Reply with
   the merged replication list maintained in the mapping system.  The
   Map-Reply message MUST follow the format defined in [<a href="./rfc6830" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)"'>RFC6830</a>]; its
   EID is encoded using the Multicast Info LCAF Type, and the
   corresponding RLOC-records are encoded using the RLE LCAF Type.  Both
   LCAF Types are defined in [<a href="./rfc8060" title='"LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF)"'>RFC8060</a>].

   The Map-Server will issue LISP Map-Notify messages to inform the
   source site of the presence of receivers for a particular multicast
   group over the overlay.

   Updated Map-Notify messages SHOULD be issued every time a new
   registration is received from a receiver site.  This guarantees that
   the source sites are aware of any potential changes in the multicast-
   distribution-list membership.

   The Map-Notify messages carry (S,G) multicast EIDs encoded using the
   Multicast Info LCAF Type defined in [<a href="./rfc8060" title='"LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF)"'>RFC8060</a>].

   Map-Notify messages will be sent by the Map-Server to the RLOCs with
   which the unicast S-prefix EID was registered.  In the case when
   sources are discovered dynamically [<a href="#ref-LISP-EID-MOBILITY">LISP-EID-MOBILITY</a>], xTRs MUST
   register sources explicitly with the want-map-notify bit set.  This
   is so the ITR in the site the source has moved to can get the most
   current replication list.

   When both the receiver sites and the source sites register to the
   same Map-Server, the Map-Server has all the necessary information to
   send the Map-Notify messages to the source site.

   When the Map-Servers are distributed (when using LISP-DDT [<a href="./rfc8111" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT)"'>RFC8111</a>]),
   the receiver sites MAY register to one Map-Server while the source
   site registers to a different Map-Server.  In this scenario, the Map-
   Server for the receiver sites MUST resolve the unicast S-prefix EID
   across a distributed mapping transport system, per standard LISP
   lookup procedures, and obtain the necessary information to send the

   Map-Notify messages to the source site.  The Map-Notify messages are
   sent with an authentication length of 0 as they would not be
   authenticated.

   When the Map-Servers are distributed, different receiver sites MAY
   register to different Map-Servers.  However, this is not supported
   with the currently defined mechanisms.

   The interconnection of SSM trees across sites will follow the general
   receiver-site procedures described in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> on the receiver
   sites.

   The source-site procedures will vary depending on the topological
   location of the source within the source site as described in
   Sections <a href="#section-6.1">6.1</a> and <a href="#section-6.2">6.2</a> .

   When the source is directly connected to the Source-ITR, it is not
   necessary to trigger signaling to build a local multicast tree at the
   source site.  Therefore Map-Notify messages are not required to
   initiate building of the multicast tree at the source site.

   Map-Notify messages are still required to ensure that any changes to
   the replication list are communicated to the source site so that the
   map-cache at the Source-ITRs is kept updated.

   The general LISP notification procedures described in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>

   signaling MUST be initiated at the source site per the general
   source-site procedures for multicast tree building described in
   <a href="#section-5.2.1">Section 5.2.1</a>.

   In the SSM case, the IP address of the source is known, and it is
   also registered with the LISP mapping system.  Thus, the mapping
   system MAY resolve the mapping for the source address in order to
   send Map-Notify messages to the correct Source-ITR.

   When multiple ITRs exist at a source multicast site, care MUST be
   taken that more than one ITR does not head-end replicate packets;
   otherwise, receiver multicast sites will receive duplicate packets.
   The following procedures will be used for each topology scenario:

   o  When more than one ITR is directly connected to the source host,
      either the PIM DR or the IGMP querier (when PIM is not enabled on
      the ITRs) is responsible for packet replication.  All other ITRs
      silently drop the packet.  In the IGMP querier case, one or more
      ITRs on the source LAN MUST be IGMP querier candidates.
      Therefore, it is required that they be configured as such.

   o  When more than one ITR is multiple hops away from the source host
      and one of the ITRs is the PIM Rendezvous Point, then the PIM RP
      is responsible for packet replication.

   o  When more than one ITR is multiple hops away from the source host
      and the PIM Rendezvous Point is not one of the ITRs, then one of
      the ITRs MUST join to the RP.  When a Map-Notify is received from
      the Map-Server by an ITR, only the highest RLOC addressed ITR will
      join toward the PIM RP or toward the source.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.2.%20%20Multiple%20ETRs%20at%20a%20Receiver%20Site"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" id="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Multiple ETRs at a Receiver Site</span>

   When multiple ETRs exist in a receiver multicast site and each one
   creates a multicast join state, each Map-Registers its RLOC address
   to the mapping system.  In this scenario, the replication happens on
   the overlay causing multiple ETR entry points to replicate to all
   receivers instead of a single ETR entry point replicating to all
   receivers.  If an ETR does not create join state, because it has not
   received PIM joins or IGMP reports, it will not Map-Register its RLOC
   addresses to the mapping system.  The same procedures in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>
   are followed.

   When multiple ETRs exist on the same LAN as a receiver host, then the
   PIM DR (when PIM is enabled) or the IGMP querier is responsible for
   sending a Map-Register for its RLOC.  In the IGMP case, one or more
   ETRs on a LAN MUST be IGMP querier candidates.  Therefore, it is
   required that they are configured as such.

   It MAY be desirable to have multiple underlay paths to an ETR for
   multicast packet delivery.  This can be done by having multiple RLOCs
   assigned to an ETR and having the ETR send Map-Registers for all its
   RLOCs.  By doing this, an ITR can choose a specific path based on
   underlay performance and/or RLOC reachability.

   It is recommended that an ETR send a Map-Register with a single RLOC-
   record that uses the Explicit Locator Path (ELP) LCAF Type [<a href="./rfc8060" title='"LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF)"'>RFC8060</a>]
   that is nested inside the RLE LCAF.  For example, say ETR1 has
   assigned RLOC1 and RLOC2 for a LISP receiver site.  Also, there is
   ETR2 in another LISP receiver site that has RLOC3.  The two receiver
   sites have the same (S,G) being joined.  Here is how the RLOC-record
   is encoded on each ETR:

   ETR1: EID-record: (S,G)
         RLOC-record: RLE[ ELP{ (RLOC1,s,p), (RLOC2,s,p) } ]

   ETR2: EID-record: (S,G)
         RLOC-record: RLE[ RLOC3 ]

   And here is how the entry is merged and stored on the Map-Server
   since the Map-Registers have an RLE-encoded RLOC-record:

   MS: EID-record: (S,G)
       RLOC-record: RLE[ RLOC3, ELP{ (RLOC1,s,p), (RLOC2,s,p) } ]

   When the ITR receives a packet from a multicast source S for group G,
   it uses the merged RLOC-record returned from the Map-Server.  The ITR
   replicates the packet to (RLOC3 and RLOC1) or (RLOC3 and RLOC2).
   Since it is required for the s-bit to be set for RLOC1, the ITR MUST
   replicate to RLOC1 if it is reachable.  When the required p-bit is
   also set, the RLOC-reachability mechanisms from [<a href="./rfc6830" title='"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)"'>RFC6830</a>] are
   followed.  If the ITR determines that RLOC1 is unreachable, it uses
   RLOC2, as long as RLOC2 is reachable.

   This specification is focused on underlays without multicast support,
   but it does not preclude the use of multicast RLOCs in RLEs.  ETRs
   MAY register multicast EID entries using multicast RLOCs.  In such
   cases, the ETRs will be joined to underlay multicast distribution
   trees by using IGMP as a multicast host using mechanisms in [<a href="./rfc2236" title='"Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2"'>RFC2236</a>]
   and [<a href="./rfc3376" title='"Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3"'>RFC3376</a>].

   LISP signal-free multicast can support ASM trees in limited but
   acceptable topologies.  It is suggested, for the simplification of
   building ASM trees across the LISP overlay, to have PIM-ASM run
   independently in each LISP site.  What this means is that a PIM RP is
   configured in each LISP site so PIM Register procedures and (*,G)
   state maintenance is contained within the LISP site.

   The following procedure will be used to support ASM in each LISP
   site:

   1.  In a receiver site, the RP is co-located with the ETR.  RPs for
       different groups can be spread across each ETR, but is not
       required.

   2.  When (*,G) state is created in an ETR, the procedures in
       <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a> are followed.  In addition, the ETR registers
       (S-prefix,G), where S-prefix is 0/0 (the respective unicast
       default route for the address-family) to the mapping system.

   3.  In a source site, the RP is co-located with the ITR.  RPs for
       different groups can be spread across each ITR, but is not
       required.

   4.  When a multicast source sends a packet, a PIM Register message is
       delivered to the ITR, and the procedures in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a> are
       followed.

   5.  When the ITR sends a Map-Request for (S,G) and no receiver site
       has registered for (S,G), the mapping system will return the
       (0/0,G) entry to the ITR so it has a replication list of all the
       ETRs that have received (*,G) state.

   6.  The ITR stores the replication list in its map-cache for (S,G).
       It replicates packets to all ETRs in the list.

   7.  ETRs decapsulate packets and forward based on (*,G) state in
       their site.

   8.  When last-hop PIM routers join the newly discovered (S,G), the
       ETR will store the state and follow the procedures in
       <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>.

   The mechanisms in this specification can be applied to the "LISP

   layered LISP-RE RTR hierarchy use signaling mechanisms, the RTRs can
   register their availability for multicast tree replication via the
   mapping database system.

   As stated in [<a href="#ref-LISP-RE" title='"LISP Replication Engineering"'>LISP-RE</a>], the RTR-layered hierarchy is used to avoid
   head-end replication in replicating nodes closest to a multicast
   source.  Rather than have multicast ITRs replicate to each ETR in an
   RLE of an (S,G) mapping database entry, it could replicate to one or
   more layer 0 RTRs in the LISP-RE hierarchy.

   This document specifies how the RTR hierarchy is determined but not
   the optimal layers of RTRs to be used.  Methods for determining
   optimal paths or RTR topological closeness are out of scope for this
   document.

   There are two formats an (S,G) mapping database entry could have.
   One format is a 'complete-format', and the other is a 'filtered-
   format'.  A 'complete-format' entails an (S,G) entry having multiple
   RLOC-records that contain both ETRs that have registered as well as
   the RTRs at the first level of the LISP-RE hierarchy for the ITR to
   replicate to.  When using 'complete-format', the ITR has the ability
   to select if it replicates to RTRs or to the registered ETRs at the
   receiver sites.  A 'filtered-format' (S,G) entry is one where the
   Map-Server returns the RLOC-records that it decides the ITR SHOULD
   use.  So replication policy is shifted from the ITRs to the mapping
   system.  The Map-Servers can also decide for a given ITR if it uses a
   different set of replication targets per (S,G) entry for which the
   ITR is replicating for.

   The procedure for the LISP-RE RTRs to make themselves available for
   replication can occur before or after any receivers join an (S,G)
   entry or any sources send for a particular (S,G) entry.  Therefore,
   newly configured RTR state will be used to create new (S,G) state and
   will be inherited into existing (S,G) state.  A set of RTRs can
   register themselves to the mapping system or a third party can do so
   on their behalf.  When RTR registration occurs, it is done with an
   (S-prefix, G-prefix) entry so it can advertise its replication
   services for a wide range of source/group combinations.

   When a Map-Server receives (S,G) registrations from ETRs and
   (S-prefix, G-prefix) registrations from RTRs, it has the option of
   merging the RTR RLOC-records for each (S,G) that is more specific for
   the (S-prefix, G-prefix) entry or keeping them separate.  When
   merging, a Map-Server is ready to return a 'complete-format' Map-

   Reply.  When keeping the entries separate, the Map-Server can decide
   what to include in a Map-Reply when a Map-Request is received.  It
   can include a combination of RLOC-records from each entry or decide
   to use one or the other depending on policy configured.

                     Figure 2: LISP-RE Reference Model

   Here is a specific example, illustrated in Figure 2, of (S,G) and
   (S-prefix, G-prefix) mapping database entries when a source S is
   behind an ITR, and there are receiver sites joined to (S,G) via ETR1,
   ETR2, and ETR3.  And there exists a LISP-RE hierarchy of RTR1 and
   RTR2 at level-0 and RTR3 and RTR4 at level-1:

       EID-record: (S,G)
          RLOC-record: RLE: (ETR1, ETR2, ETR3), p1
       EID-record: (S-prefix, G-prefix)
          RLOC-record: RLE: (RTR1(L0), RTR2(L0), RTR3(L1), RTR4(L1)), p1

   The above entries are in the form in which they were registered and
   are stored in a Map-Server.  When a Map-Server uses 'complete-
   format', the Map-Reply it originates has the mapping record encoded
   as:

          EID-record: (S,G)
              RLOC-record: RLE: (RTR1(L0), RTR3(L1)), p1
              RLOC-record: RLE: (ETR1, ETR2, ETR3), p1

   The above Map-Reply allows the ITR to decide if it replicates to the
   ETRs or if it SHOULD replicate only to level-0 RTR1.  This decision
   is left to the ITR since both RLOC-records have priority 1.  If the
   Map-Server wanted to force the ITR to replicate to RTR1, it would set
   the ETRs RLOC-record to a priority greater than 1.

   When a Map_server uses 'filtered-format', the Map-Reply it originates
   has the mapping record encoded as:

          EID-record: (S,G)
              RLOC-record: RLE: (RTR1(L0), RTR3(L1)), p1

   An (S,G) entry can contain alternate RTRs.  So rather than
   replicating to multiple RTRs, one RTR set MAY be used based on the
   RTR reachability status.  An ITR can test reachability status to any
   layer 0 RTR using RLOC-probing, so it can choose one RTR from a set
   to replicate to.  When this is done, the RTRs are encoded in
   different RLOC-records instead of together in one RLE RLOC-record.
   This moves the replication load off the ITRs at the source site to
   the RTRs inside the network infrastructure.  This mechanism can also
   be used by level-n RTRs to level-n+1 RTRs.

   The following mapping would be encoded in a Map-Reply sent by a Map-
   Server and stored in the ITR.  The ITR would use RTR1 until it went
   unreachable and then switch to use RTR2:

          EID-record: (S,G)
              RLOC-record: RTR1, p1
              RLOC-record: RTR2, p2

   [<a id="ref-LISP-SEC">LISP-SEC</a>] defines a set of security mechanisms that provide origin
   authentication, integrity, and anti-replay protection to LISP's EID-
   to-RLOC mapping data conveyed via the mapping lookup process.  LISP-
   SEC also enables verification of authorization on EID-prefix claims
   in Map-Reply messages.

   Additional security mechanisms to protect the LISP Map-Register
   messages are defined in [<a href="./rfc6833" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Map-Server Interface"'>RFC6833</a>].

   The security of the mapping system infrastructure depends on the
   particular mapping database used.  As an example, [<a href="./rfc8111" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT)"'>RFC8111</a>] defines a
   public-key-based mechanism that provides origin authentication and
   integrity protection to the LISP DDT protocol.

   Map-Replies received by the Source-ITR can be signed (by the Map-
   Server), so the ITR knows the replication list is from a legitimate
   source.

   Data-plane encryption can be used when doing unicast rep-
   encapsulation as described in [<a href="./rfc8061" title='"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Data-Plane Confidentiality"'>RFC8061</a>].
