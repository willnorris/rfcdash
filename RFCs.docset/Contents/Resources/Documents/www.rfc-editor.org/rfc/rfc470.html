Request for Comments: #470                                BBN - TENEX
NIC #14799                                                March 13, 1973

                 Change in Socket for TIP News Facility


The Socket which supports the TIP News Facility has been changed to
socket 367 (Octal) at BBN-TENEX.  TIP users should be uneffected by this
change since the TIP program has already been changed to ICP to the new
socket.  Because some user TELNET programs have been implemented a
"news" command, the old socket will be maintained until April 15, 1973
to give implementers time to change to the new socket.
