   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="./rfc3410#section-7">sectionÂ 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="./rfc3410" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

   The current TCP-MIB defined in this memo consists of two tables and a
   group of scalars:

      -  The tcp group of scalars includes two sets of objects:

         o  Parameters of a TCP protocol engine.  These include
            parameters such as the retransmission algorithm in use
            (e.g., vanj [<a href="#ref-VANJ" title='"Congestion Avoidance and Control"'>VANJ</a>]) and the retransmission timeout values.

         o  Statistics of a TCP protocol engine.  These include counters
            for the number of active/passive opens, input/output
            segments, and errors.  Discontinuities in the stats are
            identified identified via the sysUpTime object, defined in
            [<a href="./rfc3418" title='"Management Information Base (MIB) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC3418</a>].

      -  The tcpConnectionTable provides access to status information
         for all TCP connections handled by a TCP protocol engine.  In
         addition, the table reports identification of the operating
         system level processes that handle the TCP connections.

      -  The tcpListenerTable provides access to information about all
         TCP listening endpoints known by a TCP protocol engine.  And as
         with the connection table, the tcpListenerTable also reports
         the identification of the operating system level processes that
         handle this listening TCP endpoint.

   This section discusses the relationship of this TCP-MIB module to
   other MIB modules.




<span class="grey">Raghunarayan                Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4022">RFC 4022</a>                      MIB for TCP                     March 2005</span>


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.1.%20%20Relationship%20to%20RFC1213-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.1" id="section-2.1.1">2.1.1</a>.  Relationship to <a href="./rfc1213">RFC1213</a>-MIB</span>

   TCP related MIB objects were originally defined as part of the
   <a href="./rfc1213">RFC1213</a>-MIB defined in <a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a> [<a href="./rfc1213" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>RFC1213</a>].  The TCP related objects
   of the <a href="./rfc1213">RFC1213</a>-MIB were later copied into a separate MIB module and
   published in <a href="./rfc2012">RFC 2012</a> [<a href="./rfc2012" title='"SNMPv2 Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol using SMIv2"'>RFC2012</a>] in SMIv2 format.

   The previous versions of the TCP-MIB both defined the tcpConnTable,
   which has been deprecated basically for two reasons:

   (1) The tcpConnTable only supports IPv4.

       The current approach in the IETF is to write IP version neutral
       MIBs, based on the InetAddressType and InetAddress constructs
       defined in [<a href="./rfc4001" title='"Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses"'>RFC4001</a>], rather than to have different definitions
       for various version of IP.  This reduces the amount of overhead
       when new objects are introduced, as there is only one place to
       add them.  Hence, the approach taken in [<a href="./rfc2452" title='"IP Version 6 Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC2452</a>], of having
       separate tables, is not continued.

   (2) The tcpConnTable mixes listening endpoints with connections.

       It turns out that connections tend to have a different behaviour
       and management access pattern than listening endpoints.
       Therefore, splitting the original tcpConnTable into two tables
       allows for the addition of specific status and statistics objects
       for listening endpoints and connections.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.2.%20%20Relationship%20to%20IPV6-TCP-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.2" id="section-2.1.2">2.1.2</a>.  Relationship to IPV6-TCP-MIB</span>

   The IPV6-TCP-MIB defined in <a href="./rfc2452">RFC 2452</a> has been moved to Historic
   status because the approach of having separate IP version specific
   tables is not followed anymore.  Implementation of <a href="./rfc2452">RFC 2452</a> is no
   longer suggested.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.3.%20%20Relationship%20to%20HOST-RESOURCES-MIB%20and%20SYSAPPL-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.3" id="section-2.1.3">2.1.3</a>.  Relationship to HOST-RESOURCES-MIB and SYSAPPL-MIB</span>

   The tcpConnectionTable and the tcpListenerTable report the
   identification of the operating system level process that handles a
   connection or a listening endpoint.  The value is reported as an
   Unsigned32, which is expected to be the same as the hrSWRunIndex of
   the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB [<a href="./rfc2790" title='"Host Resources MIB"'>RFC2790</a>] (if the value is smaller than
   2147483647) or the sysApplElmtRunIndex of the SYSAPPL-MIB [<a href="./rfc2287" title='"Definitions of System-Level Managed Objects for Applications"'>RFC2287</a>].
   This allows management applications to identify the TCP connections
   that belong to an operating system level process, which has proven to
   be valuable in operational environments.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The tcpConnectionState and tcpConnState objects have a MAX-ACCESS
      clause of read-write, which allows termination of an arbitrary
      connection.  Unauthorized access could cause a denial of service.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to

   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The tcpConnectionTable and the tcpConnTable contain objects
      providing information about the active connections on the device,
      the status of these connections, and the associated processes.
      This information may be used by an attacker to launch attacks
      against known/unknown weakness in certain protocols/applications.
      In addition, access to the connection table could also have
      privacy implications, as it provides detailed information on
      active connections.

   o  The tcpListenerTable and the tcpConnTable contain objects
      providing information about listeners on an entity.  For example,
      the tcpListenerLocalPort and tcpConnLocalPort objects can be used
      to identify what ports are open on the machine and what attacks
      are likely to succeed, without the attacker having to run a port
      scanner.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="./rfc3410#section-8">[RFC3410], sectionÂ 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
