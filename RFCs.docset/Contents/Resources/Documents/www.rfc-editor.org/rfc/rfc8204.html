   <span class="h1">Benchmarking Virtual Switches in the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV)</span>

Abstract

   This memo describes the contributions of the Open Platform for NFV
   (OPNFV) project on Virtual Switch Performance (VSPERF), particularly
   in the areas of test setups and configuration parameters for the
   system under test.  This project has extended the current and
   completed work of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group in the
   IETF and references existing literature.  The Benchmarking
   Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory
   characterization of dedicated physical implementations of
   internetworking functions.  Therefore, this memo describes the
   additional considerations when virtual switches are implemented on
   general-purpose hardware.  The expanded tests and benchmarks are also
   influenced by the OPNFV mission to support virtualization of the
   "telco" infrastructure.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8204">RFC 8204</a>                 Benchmarking vSwitches           September 2017</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) has traditionally
   conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated physical
   implementations of internetworking functions.  The black-box
   benchmarks of throughput, latency, forwarding rates, and others have
   served our industry for many years.  Now, Network Function
   Virtualization (NFV) has the goal of transforming how internetwork
   functions are implemented and therefore has garnered much attention.

   A virtual switch (vSwitch) is an important aspect of the NFV
   infrastructure; it provides connectivity between and among physical
   network functions and virtual network functions.  As a result, there
   are many vSwitch benchmarking efforts but few specifications to guide
   the many new test design choices.  This is a complex problem and an
   industry-wide work in progress.  In the future, several of BMWG's
   fundamental specifications will likely be updated as more testing
   experience helps to form consensus around new methodologies, and BMWG
   should continue to collaborate with all organizations that share the
   same goal.

   This memo describes the contributions of the Open Platform for NFV
   (OPNFV) project on Virtual Switch Performance (VSPERF)
   characterization through the Danube 3.0 (fourth) release [<a href="#ref-DanubeRel">DanubeRel</a>]
   to the chartered work of the BMWG (with stable references to their
   test descriptions).  This project has extended the current and
   completed work of the BMWG IETF and references existing literature.
   For example, the most often referenced RFC is [<a href="./rfc2544" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>RFC2544</a>] (which
   depends on [<a href="./rfc1242" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices"'>RFC1242</a>]), so the foundation of the benchmarking work in
   OPNFV is common and strong.  The recommended extensions are
   specifically in the areas of test setups and configuration parameters
   for the system under test.

   See [<a href="#ref-VSPERFhome">VSPERFhome</a>] for more background and the OPNFV website for
   general information [<a href="#ref-OPNFV" title='"OPNFV"'>OPNFV</a>].

   The authors note that OPNFV distinguishes itself from other open
   source compute and networking projects through its emphasis on
   existing "telco" services as opposed to cloud computing.  There are
   many ways in which telco requirements have different emphasis on
   performance dimensions when compared to cloud computing: support for
   and transfer of isochronous media streams is one example.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8204">RFC 8204</a>                 Benchmarking vSwitches           September 2017</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Scope</span>

   The primary purpose and scope of the memo is to describe key aspects
   of vSwitch benchmarking, particularly in the areas of test setups and
   configuration parameters for the system under test, and extend the
   body of extensive BMWG literature and experience.  Initial feedback
   indicates that many of these extensions may be applicable beyond this
   memo's current scope (to hardware switches in the NFV infrastructure
   and to virtual routers, for example).  Additionally, this memo serves
   as a vehicle to include more detail and relevant commentary from BMWG
   and other open source communities under BMWG's chartered work to
   characterize the NFV infrastructure.

   The benchmarking covered in this memo should be applicable to many
   types of vSwitches and remain vSwitch agnostic to a great degree.
   There has been no attempt to track and test all features of any
   specific vSwitch implementation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Benchmarking%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Benchmarking Considerations</span>

   This section highlights some specific considerations (from [<a href="./rfc8172" title='"Considerations for Benchmarking Virtual Network Functions and Their Infrastructure"'>RFC8172</a>])
   related to benchmarks for virtual switches.  The OPNFV project is
   sharing its present view on these areas as they develop their
   specifications in the Level Test Design (LTD) document as defined by
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE829" title='"IEEE Standard for Software and System Test Documentation"'>IEEE829</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Comparison%20with%20Physical%20Network%20Functions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Comparison with Physical Network Functions</span>

   To compare the performance of virtual designs and implementations
   with their physical counterparts, identical benchmarks are needed.
   BMWG has developed specifications for many physical network
   functions.  The BMWG has recommended reusing existing benchmarks and
   methods in [<a href="./rfc8172" title='"Considerations for Benchmarking Virtual Network Functions and Their Infrastructure"'>RFC8172</a>], and the OPNFV LTD expands on them as described
   here.  A key configuration aspect for vSwitches is the number of
   parallel CPU cores required to achieve comparable performance with a
   given physical device or whether some limit of scale will be reached
   before the vSwitch can achieve the comparable performance level.

   It's unlikely that the virtual switch will be the only application
   running on the SUT, so CPU utilization, cache utilization, and memory
   footprint should also be recorded for the virtual implementations of
   internetworking functions.  However, internally measured metrics such
   as these are not benchmarks; they may be useful for the audience
   (e.g., operations) to know and may also be useful if there is a
   problem encountered during testing.

   Benchmark comparability between virtual and physical/hardware
   implementations of equivalent functions will likely place more
   detailed and exact requirements on the "testing systems" (in terms of
   stream generation, algorithms to search for maximum values, and their
   configurations).  This is another area for standards development to
   appreciate; however, this is a topic for a future document.

   External observations remain essential as the basis for benchmarks.
   Internal observations with a fixed specification and interpretation
   will be provided in parallel to assist the development of operations
   procedures when the technology is deployed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20New%20Configuration%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  New Configuration Parameters</span>

   A key consideration when conducting any sort of benchmark is trying
   to ensure the consistency and repeatability of test results.  When
   benchmarking the performance of a vSwitch, there are many factors
   that can affect the consistency of results; one key factor is
   matching the various hardware and software details of the SUT.  This
   section lists some of the many new parameters that this project
   believes are critical to report in order to achieve repeatability.

   It has been the goal of the project to produce repeatable results,
   and a large set of the parameters believed to be critical is provided
   so that the benchmarking community can better appreciate the increase
   in configuration complexity inherent in this work.  The parameter set
   below is assumed sufficient for the infrastructure in use by the
   VSPERF project to obtain repeatable results from test to test.

   Hardware details (platform, processor, memory, and network)
   including:

   o  BIOS version, release date, and any configurations that were
      modified

   Virtual switches group packets into flows by processing and matching
   particular packet or frame header information, or by matching packets
   based on the input ports.  Thus, a flow can be thought of as a
   sequence of packets that have the same set of header field values or
   have arrived on the same physical or logical port.  Performance
   results can vary based on the parameters the vSwitch uses to match
   for a flow.  The recommended flow classification parameters for any
   vSwitch performance tests are: the input port (physical or logical),
   the source MAC address, the destination MAC address, the source IP
   address, the destination IP address, and the Ethernet protocol type
   field (although classification may take place on other fields, such
   as source and destination transport port numbers).  It is essential
   to increase the flow timeout time on a vSwitch before conducting any
   performance tests that do not intend to measure the flow setup time
   (see <a href="./rfc2889#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC2889]</a>).  Normally, the first packet of a
   particular stream will install the flow in the virtual switch, which
   introduces additional latency; subsequent packets of the same flow
   are not subject to this latency if the flow is already installed on
   the vSwitch.

   This outline describes the measurement of baselines with isolated
   resources at a high level, which is the intended approach at this
   time.

   1.  Baselines:

       *  Optional: Benchmark platform forwarding capability without a
          vSwitch or VNF for at least 72 hours (serves as a means of
          platform validation and a means to obtain the base performance

       *  Benchmark VNF forwarding capability with direct connectivity
          (vSwitch bypass, e.g., SR/IOV) for at least 72 hours (serves
          as a means of VNF validation and a means to obtain the base
          performance for the VNF in terms of its maximum forwarding
          rate and latency).  The metrics gathered from this test will
          serve as a key comparison point for vSwitch bypass
          technologies performance and vSwitch performance.

   The overall specification in preparation is referred to as a Level
   Test Design (LTD) document, which will contain a suite of performance
   tests.  The base performance tests in the LTD are based on the
   pre-existing specifications developed by the BMWG to test the
   performance of physical switches.  These specifications include:

   o  Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices
      [<a href="./rfc2544" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>RFC2544</a>]

   o  Benchmarking Methodology for LAN Switching [<a href="./rfc2889" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for LAN Switching Devices"'>RFC2889</a>]

   o  Device Reset Characterization [<a href="./rfc6201" title='"Device Reset Characterization"'>RFC6201</a>]

   o  Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement [<a href="./rfc5481" title='"Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement"'>RFC5481</a>]

   The two most recent RFCs above ([<a href="./rfc6201" title='"Device Reset Characterization"'>RFC6201</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5481" title='"Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement"'>RFC5481</a>]) are being
   applied in benchmarking for the first time and represent a
   development challenge for test equipment developers.  Fortunately,
   many members of the testing system community have engaged on the
   VSPERF project, including an open source test system.

   In addition to this, the LTD also reuses the terminology defined by:

   o  Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices [<a href="./rfc2285" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>RFC2285</a>]

   It is recommended that these references be included in future
   benchmarking specifications:

   o  Methodology for IP Multicast Benchmarking [<a href="./rfc3918" title='"Methodology for IP Multicast Benchmarking"'>RFC3918</a>]

   o  Packet Reordering Metrics [<a href="./rfc4737" title='"Packet Reordering Metrics"'>RFC4737</a>]

   As one might expect, the most fundamental internetworking
   characteristics of throughput and latency remain important when the
   switch is virtualized, and these benchmarks figure prominently in the
   specification.

   When considering characteristics important to "telco" network
   functions, additional performance metrics are needed.  In this case,
   the project specifications have referenced metrics from the IETF IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) literature.  This means that the latency
   test described in [<a href="./rfc2544" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>RFC2544</a>] is replaced by measurement of a metric
   derived from IPPM's [<a href="./rfc7679" title='"A One-Way Delay Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)"'>RFC7679</a>], where a set of statistical summaries
   will be provided (mean, max, min, and percentiles).  Further metrics
   planned to be benchmarked include packet delay variation as defined
   by [<a href="./rfc5481" title='"Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement"'>RFC5481</a>], reordering, burst behaviour, DUT availability, DUT

   capacity, and packet loss in long-term testing at the throughput
   level, where some low level of background loss may be present and
   characterized.

   Tests have been designed to collect the metrics below:

   o  Throughput tests are designed to measure the maximum forwarding
      rate (in frames per second, fps) and bit rate (in Mbps) for a
      constant load (as defined by [<a href="./rfc1242" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices"'>RFC1242</a>]) without traffic loss.

   o  Packet and frame-delay distribution tests are designed to measure
      the average minimum and maximum packet (and/or frame) delay for
      constant loads.

   o  Packet delay tests are designed to understand latency distribution
      for different packet sizes and to uncover outliers over an
      extended test run.

   o  Scalability tests are designed to understand how the virtual
      switch performs with an increasing number of flows, number of
      active ports, configuration complexity of the forwarding logic,
      etc.

   o  Stream performance tests (with TCP or UDP) are designed to measure
      bulk data transfer performance, i.e., how fast systems can send
      and receive data through the switch.

   o  Control-path and data-path coupling tests are designed to
      understand how closely the data path and the control path are
      coupled, as well as the effect of this coupling on the performance
      of the DUT (for example, delay of the initial packet of a flow).

   o  CPU and memory consumption tests are designed to understand the
      virtual switch's footprint on the system and are conducted as
      auxiliary measurements with the benchmarks above.  They include
      CPU utilization, cache utilization, and memory footprint.

   o  The so-called "soak" tests, where the selected test is conducted
      over a long period of time (with an ideal duration of 24 hours but
      only long enough to determine that stability issues exist when
      found; there is no requirement to continue a test when a DUT
      exhibits instability over time).  The key performance
      characteristics and benchmarks for a DUT are determined (using
      short duration tests) prior to conducting soak tests.  The purpose
      of soak tests is to capture transient changes in performance,
      which may occur due to infrequent processes, memory leaks, or the
      low-probability coincidence of two or more processes.  The
      stability of the DUT is the paramount consideration, so

      performance must be evaluated periodically during continuous
      testing, and this results in use of frame rate metrics [<a href="./rfc2889" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for LAN Switching Devices"'>RFC2889</a>]
      instead of throughput [<a href="./rfc2544" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>RFC2544</a>] (which requires stopping traffic
      to allow time for all traffic to exit internal queues), for
      example.

   Additional test specification development should include:

   o  Request/response performance tests (with TCP or UDP), which
      measure the transaction rate through the switch.

   o  Noisy neighbor tests, in order to understand the effects of
      resource sharing on the performance of a virtual switch.

   o  Tests derived from examination of ETSI NFV Draft GS IFA003
      requirements [<a href="#ref-IFA003" title='"Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV); Acceleration Technologies; vSwitch Benchmarking and Acceleration Specification"'>IFA003</a>] on characterization of acceleration
      technologies applied to vSwitches.

   The flexibility of deployment of a virtual switch within a network
   means that it is necessary to characterize the performance of a
   vSwitch in various deployment scenarios.  The deployment scenarios
   under consideration are shown in the following figures:

   This section organizes the many existing test specifications into the
   "3x3" matrix (introduced in [<a href="./rfc8172" title='"Considerations for Benchmarking Virtual Network Functions and Their Infrastructure"'>RFC8172</a>]).  Because the LTD
   specification ID names are quite long, this section is organized into
   lists for each occupied cell of the matrix (not all are occupied;
   also, the matrix has grown to 3x4 to accommodate scale metrics when
   displaying the coverage of many metrics/benchmarks).  The current
   version of the LTD specification is available; see [<a href="#ref-LTD" title='"VSPERF Level Test Design (LTD)"'>LTD</a>].

   The tests listed below assess the activation of paths in the data
   plane rather than the control plane.

   A complete list of tests with short summaries is available on the
   VSPERF "LTD Test Spec Overview" wiki page [<a href="#ref-LTDoverV" title='"LTD Test Spec Overview"'>LTDoverV</a>].

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization of a Device Under Test/System Under Test
   (DUT/SUT) using controlled stimuli in a laboratory environment with
   dedicated address space and the constraints specified in the sections
   above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis and relies
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.
