Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing ethernet-like objects.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module corrects minor
   errors in the earlier versions of this MIB: <a href="./rfc1623">RFC 1623</a> [<a href="#ref-20" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>20</a>], and <a href="./rfc1398">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc1398">1398</a> [<a href="#ref-15" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>15</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a>                   Ethernet-Like MIB                   July 1994</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20The%20SNMP%20Network%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  The SNMP Network Management Framework</span>

   The SNMP Network Management Framework consists of three major
   components.  They are:

      o    STD 16/RFC 1155 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>3</a>] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms
           used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of
           management.  STD 16/RFC 1212 [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>13</a>] defines a more concise
           description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with
           the SMI.

      o    <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>4</a>] which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed
           objects for the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC
           1213 [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>6</a>] defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on
           implementation experience and new operational
           requirements.

      o    STD 15/RFC 1157 [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>5</a>] which defines the SNMP, the protocol
           used for network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Object%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Object Definitions</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-7" title=" International Organization for Standardization">7</a>]
   defined in the SMI [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Structure of Management Information for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>16</a>].  In particular, each object object type is
   named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
   The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Change%20Log"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Change Log</span>

   This section enumerates changes made to <a href="./rfc1398">RFC 1398</a> to produce this
   document.

    (1)   A section describing the applicability of various parts
          of <a href="./rfc1573">RFC 1573</a> to ethernet-like interfaces has been added.

    (2)   A minor error in the description of the TDR test was
          fixed.

    (3)   A loopback test was defined to replace the standard
          loopback test that was defined in <a href="./rfc1229">RFC 1229</a>.



<span class="grey">Kastenholz                                                      [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a>                   Ethernet-Like MIB                   July 1994</span>


    (4)   The description of dot3CollFrequencies was made a bit
          clearer.

    (5)   A new object, EtherChipset, has been added. This object
          replaces the ifExtnsChipSet object, which has been
          removed per the Interface MIB Evolution effort.

    (6)   Several minor editorial changes, spelling corrections,
          grammar and punctuation corrections, and so forth, were
          made.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface
   to an ethernet-like communications medium.  At present, ethernet-like
   media are identified by three values of the ifType object in the
   Internet-standard MIB:

         ethernet-csmacd(6)
         iso88023-csmacd(7)
         starLan(11)

   For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the
   MIB-II [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>6</a>] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

      dot3    OBJECT IDENTIFER ::= { transmission 7 }

   The definitions presented here are based on the IEEE 802.3 Layer
   Management Specification [<a href="#ref-9" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management"'>9</a>], as originally interpreted by Frank
   Kastenholz then of Interlan in [<a href="#ref-10" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks"'>10</a>].  Implementors of these MIB
   objects should note that the IEEE document explicitly describes (in
   the form of Pascal pseudocode) when, where, and how various MAC
   attributes are measured.  The IEEE document also describes the
   effects of MAC actions that may be invoked by manipulating instances
   of the MIB objects defined here.

   To the extent that some of the attributes defined in [<a href="#ref-9" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management"'>9</a>] are
   represented by previously defined objects in the Internet-standard
   MIB or in the Generic Interface Extensions MIB [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB"'>11</a>], such attributes
   are not redundantly represented by objects defined in this memo.
   Among the attributes represented by objects defined in other memos
   are the number of octets transmitted or received on a particular
   interface, the number of frames transmitted or received on a
   particular interface, the promiscuous status of an interface, the MAC
   address of an interface, and multicast information associated with an
   interface.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a>                   Ethernet-Like MIB                   July 1994</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Relation%20to%20RFC%201213"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Relation to <a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a></span>

   This section applies only when this MIB is used in conjunction with
   the "old" (i.e., pre-RFC 1573) interface group.

   The relationship between an ethernet-like interface and an interface
   in the context of the Internet-standard MIB is one-to-one.  As such,
   the value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to
   identify corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Relation%20to%20RFC%201573"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Relation to <a href="./rfc1573">RFC 1573</a></span>

   <a href="./rfc1573">RFC 1573</a>, the Interface MIB Evolution, requires that any MIB which is
   an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific areas within the
   Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left vague in <a href="./rfc1573">RFC 1573</a>
   to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of
   certain media-types.

   <a href="./rfc1573#section-3.3">Section 3.3 of RFC 1573</a> enumerates several areas which a media-
   specific MIB must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in a
   following subsection.  The implementor is referred to <a href="./rfc1573">RFC 1573</a> in
   order to understand the general intent of these areas.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.1.%20%20Layering%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1" id="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Layering Model</span>

   This MIB does not provide for layering.  There are no sublayers.

   EDITOR'S NOTE:

      I could forsee the development of an 802.2 and enet-transceiver
      MIB.  They could be higher and lower sublayers, respectively.  All
      that THIS document should do is allude to the possibilities and
      urge the implementor to be aware of the possibility and that they
      may have requirements which supersede the requirements in this
      document.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.2.%20%20Virtual%20Circuits"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.2" id="section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  Virtual Circuits</span>

   This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not
   applicable to this MIB.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.3.%20%20ifTestTable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.3" id="section-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>.  ifTestTable</span>

   This MIB defines two tests for media which are instumented with this
   MIB; TDR and Loopback.  Implementation of these tests is not
   required.  Many common interface chips do not support one or both of
   these tests.




<span class="grey">Kastenholz                                                      [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a>                   Ethernet-Like MIB                   July 1994</span>


   These two tests are provided as a convenience, allowing a common
   method to invoke the test.

   Standard MIBs do not include objects in which to return the results
   of the TDR test.  Any needed objects MUST be provided in the vendor
   specific MIB.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.4.%20%20ifRcvAddressTable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.4" id="section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  ifRcvAddressTable</span>

   This table contains all IEEE 802.3 addresses, unicast, multicast, and
   broadcast, for which this interface will receive packets and forward
   them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.  The format
   of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for
   ifPhysAddress.

   In the event that the interface is part of a MAC bridge, this table
   does not include unicast addresses which are accepted for possible
   forwarding out some other port.  This table is explicitly not
   intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.5.%20%20ifPhysAddress"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.5" id="section-3.2.5">3.2.5</a>.  ifPhysAddress</span>

   This object contains the IEEE 802.3 address which is placed in the
   source-address field of any Ethernet, Starlan, or IEEE 802.3 frames
   that originate at this interface.  Usually this will be kept in ROM
   on the interface hardware.  Some systems may set this address via
   software.

   In a system where there are several such addresses the designer has a
   tougher choice.  The address chosen should be the one most likely to
   be of use to network management (e.g.  the address placed in ARP
   responses for systems which are primarily IP systems).

   If the designer truly can not chose, use of the factory- provided ROM
   address is suggested.

   If the address can not be determined, an octet string of zero length
   should be returned.

   The address is stored in binary in this object.  The address is
   stored in "canonical" bit order, that is, the Group Bit is positioned
   as the low-order bit of the first octet.  Thus, the first byte of a
   multicast address would have the bit 0x01 set.

   This MIB applies to interfaces which have any of the following three
   ifType values:

         ethernet-csmacd(6)
         iso88023-csmacd(7)
         starLan(11)

   Interfaces with any of these ifType values map to the EtherLike-MIB
   in the same manner.  The EtherLike-MIB applies equally to all three
   types; there are no implementation differences.

   This document was produced by the Ethernet MIB Working Group.

   This document is based on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB, <a href="./rfc1284">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc1284">1284</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Ethernet- Like Interface Types"'>14</a>], of which Jihn Cook of Chipcom was the editor.  The
   Ethernet MIB Working Group gathered implementation experience of the
   variables specified in <a href="./rfc1284">RFC 1284</a> and used that information to develop
   this revised MIB.

   <a href="./rfc1284">RFC 1284</a>, in turn, is based on a document written by Frank Kastenholz

   of Interlan entitled IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft M compatible
   MIB for TCP/IP Networks [<a href="#ref-10" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks"'>10</a>].  This document has been modestly
   reworked, initially by the SNMP Working Group, and then by the
   Transmission Working Group, to reflect the current conventions for
   defining objects for MIB interfaces.  James Davin, of the MIT
   Laboratory for Computer Science, and Keith McCloghrie of Hughes LAN
   Systems, contributed to later drafts of this memo. Marshall Rose of
   Performance Systems International, Inc. converted the document into
   its current concise format. Anil Rijsinghani of DEC contributed text
   that more adequately describes the TDR test.  Thanks to Frank
   Kastenholz of Interlan and Louis Steinberg of IBM for their
   experimentation.
