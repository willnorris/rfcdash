In recent years the ARPA Network Research Program has had as one concern
the interconnection of networks.  In the course of this research a
family of protocols suitable for an internetwork environment has
emerged.  Much of this work is documented in a series of project memos
called Internet Experiment Notes or IENs.  A few of these IENs document
protocols in the internet protocol family.  Most of the major internet
protocol documents have also been issued as RFCs.

The situation has evolved to the point that it is appropriate for the
internet family of protocols to replace the old ARPANET protocols.  To
this end an Internet Protocol Handbook will be prepared by the Network
Information Center.  This Handbook is tentatively planned to be
available at the end of 1980.  This Internet Protocol Handbook will
closely parallel the old ARPANET Protocol Handbook, and will primarily
be a collection of existing RFCs and IENs.

Attached is the current draft table of contents for the Internet
Protocol Handbook.  Any suggestions for additions should be sent to Jon
Postel (Postel@ISIF).

RFCs and IENs are public access document files and may be copied from
the Network Information Center online Library at SRI-KL via FTP using
the FTP user name ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.  The IENs have pathnames
of the form "&lt;NETINFO&gt;IEN-nnn.TXT", and the RFCs have pathnames of the
form "&lt;NETINFO&gt;RFCnnn.TXT", where "nnn" is replaced by the document
number.  [Note the inconsistency: IENs have a hyphen in the pathname,
RFCs don't.]
