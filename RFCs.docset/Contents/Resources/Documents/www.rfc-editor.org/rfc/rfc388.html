Network Measurement Note #8

                             NCP Statistics

   After a lapse of 5 months since RFC #323 was issued (23 March), I am
   pleased to announce that UCLA-NMC is prepared to gather your NCP
   statistics automatically on a daily basis.  The results will be
   published monthly as Network Measurement notes and as RFC's.  We will
   periodically open a connection on your local socket @241 (decimal),
   expecting you to send the following data in the format shown:

                   &lt;duplicate pages 3-5 of <a href="./rfc323">RFC 323</a> here&gt;

      a. Total bits sent to HOST
      b. Total bits received from HOST
      c. Total messages sent to HOST
      d. Total messages received from HOST and optionally
      e. Average Round Trip delay on send connections to HOST

   The information above should be collected only for standard open
   connections (i.e. those using standard NCP protocol) and not
   measurement links or experimental NCP links, and in particular, not
   traffic on link 0).

   Another optional measurement would be to gather the distribution of
   message types over link 0 over all HOSTS (i.e. not broken down by
   HOST). This will reveal the relative utilization of control messages
   (ALLOC should be very prevalent).

   The data collected for the last 24 hour sample period should be
   available from a process listening on local socket number 241 (10).

   On completion of transmission of the last message, and after you
   receive the RFNM for this last message, close the connection.

   In the original specification, we said that the data gathering
   program would ICP to some well-known socket.  We believe this to be
   an unnecessary complication and instead, we will merely open a
   connection on your 241 (decimal), expecting you to send data as soon
   as our Allocate command is received by your NCP.  Please let me know
   if this cannot be done (i.e. you need the ICP).

   If you connect to UCLA-NMC socket 241, we will send you our own 24
   hour data.  Anyone interested in capturing these statistics is
   welcome to do so.

   Please note that these summarized statistics are for standard local
   24 hour period (e.g. local midnight to local midnight).  They are not
   for a sliding 24 hour period ending with the time at which statistics
   were requested.  Also, the data is to be collected only for open
   connections on links 0, 2-71.

   The following are participating (others) are heartily invited):
   UCLA-NMC, DMCG, LL-67.
