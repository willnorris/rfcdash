What We Hope Is An Official List of Host Names   Richard W. Watson

   The enclosed is what we hope will be accepted as a list of
   official formal host names and nicknames.  As no other subject
   worked on by the NWG has generated so much comment, it is
   worthwhile to review briefly how this list came into being.

   The need for some standard set of names recognized by NCP's and
   Telnets and usable on hardcopy to designate a persons affiliation
   had been recognized for some time and several sets of names were
   in use.

   Peggy Karp issued the first formal proposal of a set of standard
   names in <a href="./rfc226">RFC 226</a>, NIC 7625.  This proposal was answered by a
   number of counter proposals and culminated in <a href="./rfc247">RFC 247</a>, NIC 7688.
   People still were not happy with this proposal as names normally
   associated with hosts or projects were not used.

   At the last NWG meeting a number of people discussed the name
   problem and agreed that the only reasonable compromise solution
   was to have both formal names and nicknames and to let the people
   at the hosts choose their own names within the guideline which the
   previous dialog had seemed to agree on.

   The guidelines were summarized in <a href="./rfc273">RFC 273</a>, NIC 7837 and the NIC
   agreed to collect and publish the names that the people at each
   host indicated they desired.  A number of names were received and
   a tentative list was published as <a href="./rfc280">RFC 280</a>, NIC 8060.  More people
   responded with their desired names or changed the ones in the
   above list.

   Almost all sites have since responded and the following list
   resulted.

   I think people should feel free to change their host name when
   ever the situation warrants.
