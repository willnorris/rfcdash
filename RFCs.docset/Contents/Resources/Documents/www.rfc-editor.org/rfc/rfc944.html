STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This memo is an official status report on the protocols used in the
   ARPA-Internet community.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

INTRODUCTION

   This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols
   used in the Internet.  Comments indicate any revisions or changes
   planned.

   To first order, the official protocols are those in the "Internet
   Protocol Transition Workbook" (IPTW) dated March 1982.  There are
   several protocols in use that are not in the IPTW.  A few of the
   protocols in the IPTW have been revised.  Notably, the mail protocols
   have been revised and issued as a volume titled "Internet Mail
   Protocols" dated November 1982.  Telnet and the most useful Telnet
   options have been revised and issued as a volume titled "Internet
   Telnet Protocol and Options" (ITP) dated June 1983.  Some protocols
   have not been revised for many years, these are found in the old
   "ARPANET Protocol Handbook" (APH) dated January 1978.  There is also
   a volume of protocol related information called the "Internet
   Protocol Implementers Guide" (IPIG) dated August 1982.

   This document is organized as a sketchy outline.  The entries are
   protocols (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol).  In each entry there
   are notes on status, specification, comments, other references,
   dependencies, and contact.

      The STATUS is one of: required, recommended, elective, or
      experimental.

      The SPECIFICATION identifies the protocol defining documents.

      The COMMENTS describe any differences from the specification or
      problems with the protocol.

      The OTHER REFERENCES identify documents that comment on or expand
      on the protocol.

      The DEPENDENCIES indicate what other protocols are called upon by
      this protocol.

      The CONTACT indicates a person who can answer questions about the
      protocol.

      In particular, the status may be:

         required

            - all hosts must implement the required protocol,

         recommended

            - all hosts are encouraged to implement the recommended
            protocol,

         elective

            - hosts may implement or not the elective protocol,

         experimental

            - hosts should not implement the experimental protocol
            unless they are participating in the experiment and have
            coordinated their use of this protocol with the contact
            person, and

         none

            - this is not a protocol.

NETWORK LEVEL

   Internet Protocol  --------------------------------------------- (IP)

      STATUS:  Required

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc791">RFC 791</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         This is the universal protocol of the Internet.  This datagram
         protocol provides the universal addressing of hosts in the
         Internet.

         A few minor problems have been noted in this document.

         The most serious is a bit of confusion in the route options.
         The route options have a pointer that indicates which octet of
         the route is the next to be used.  The confusion is between the
         phrases "the pointer is relative to this option" and "the
         smallest legal value for the pointer is 4".  If you are
         confused, forget about the relative part, the pointer begins
         at 4.

         Another important point is the alternate reassembly procedure
         suggested in <a href="./rfc815">RFC 815</a>.

         Some changes are in the works for the security option.

         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You
         have not completed an implementation of IP if it does not
         include ICMP.

   Internet Control Message Protocol  --------------------------- (ICMP)

      STATUS:  Required

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc792">RFC 792</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         The control messages and error reports that go with the
         Internet Protocol.

         A few minor errors in the document have been noted.
         Suggestions have been made for additional types of redirect
         message and additional destination unreachable messages.

         A proposal for two additional ICMP message types is made in
         <a href="./rfc917">RFC 917</a> "Internet Subnets", Address Format Request (A1=17), and
         Address Format Reply (A2=18).  The details of these ICMP types
         are subject to change.  Use of these ICMP types is
         experimental.

         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You
         have not completed an implementation of IP if it does not
         include ICMP.

HOST LEVEL

   User Datagram Protocol  --------------------------------------- (UDP)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc768">RFC 768</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides a datagram service to applications.  Adds port
         addressing to the IP services.

         The only change noted for the UDP specification is a minor
         clarification that if in computing the checksum a padding octet
         is used for the computation it is not transmitted or counted in
         the length.

   Transmission Control Protocol  -------------------------------- (TCP)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides reliable end-to-end data stream service.

         Many comments and corrections have been received for the TCP
         specification document.  These are primarily document bugs
         rather than protocol bugs.

         Event Processing Section:  There are many minor corrections and
         clarifications needed in this section.

         Push:  There are still some phrases in the document that give a
         "record mark" flavor to the push.  These should be further
         clarified.  The push is not a record mark.

         Urgent:  Page 17 is wrong.  The urgent pointer points to the
         last octet of urgent data (not to the first octet of non-ungent
         data).

<span class="grey">Official ARPA-Internet Protocols                                 <a href="./rfc944">RFC 944</a></span>


         Listening Servers:  Several comments have been received on
         difficulties with contacting listening servers.  There should
         be some discussion of implementation issues for servers, and
         some notes on alternative models of system and process
         organization for servers.

         Maximum Segment Size:  The maximum segment size option should
         be generalized and clarified.  It can be used to either
         increase or decrease the maximum segment size from the default.
         The TCP Maximum Segment Size is the IP Maximum Datagram Size
         minus forty.  The default IP Maximum Datagram Size if 576.  The
         default TCP Maximum Segment Size is 536.  For further
         discussion, see <a href="./rfc879">RFC 879</a>.

         Idle Connections:  There have been questions about
         automatically closing idle connections.  Idle connections are
         ok, and should not be closed.  There are several cases where
         idle connections arise, for example, in Telnet when a user is
         thinking for a long time following a message from the server
         computer before his next input.  There is no TCP "probe"
         mechanism, and none is needed.

         Queued Receive Data on Closing:  There are several points where
         it is not clear from the description what to do about data
         received by the TCP but not yet passed to the user,
         particularly when the connection is being closed.  In general,
         the data is to be kept to give to the user if he does a RECV
         call.

         Out of Order Segments:  The description says that segments that
         arrive out of order, that is, are not exactly the next segment
         to be processed, may be kept on hand.  It should also point out
         that there is a very large performance penalty for not doing
         so.

         User Time Out:  This is the time out started on an open or send
         call.  If this user time out occurs the user should be
         notified, but the connection should not be closed or the TCB
         deleted.  The user should explicitly ABORT the connection if he
         wants to give up.

      STATUS:  Experimental

      SPECIFICATION:  IEN 90

      COMMENTS:

         Defines a capability to combine several segments from different
         higher level protocols in one IP datagram.

         No current experiment in progress.  There is some question as
         to the extent to which the sharing this protocol envisions can
         actually take place.  Also, there are some issues about the
         information captured in the multiplexing header being (a)
         insufficient, or (b) over specific.

      COMMENTS:

         This protocol is designed to efficiently support the bulk
         transfer of data for such host monitoring and control
         applications as loading/dumping and remote debugging.  The
         protocol is intended to be simple to implement but still be
         efficient in environments where there may be long transmission
         delays and loss or non-sequential delivery of message segments.

         designed for an internet environment.  While the issues
         discussed may not be directly relevant to the research problems
         of the DARPA community, they may be interesting to a number of
         researchers and implementors.

   File Transfer Protocol  --------------------------------------- (FTP)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc765">RFC 765</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         The protocol for moving files between Internet hosts.  Provides
         for access control and negotiation of file parameters.

         There are a number of minor corrections to be made.  A major
         change is the deletion of the mail commands, and a major
         clarification is needed in the discussion of the management of
         the data connection.  Also, a suggestion has been made to
         include some directory manipulation commands (<a href="./rfc775">RFC 775</a>).

         Even though the MAIL features are defined in this document,
         they are not to be used.  The SMTP protocol is to be used for
         all mail service in the Internet.

         Data Connection Management:

            a.  Default Data Connection Ports:  All FTP implementations
            must support use of the default data connection ports, and
            only the User-PI may initiate the use of non-default ports.

            b.  Negotiating Non-Default Data Ports:   The User-PI may


<span class="grey">Reynolds &amp; Postel                                              [Page 15]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-16"></span>
<span class="grey">Official ARPA-Internet Protocols                                 <a href="./rfc944">RFC 944</a></span>


            specify a non-default user side data port with the PORT
            command.  The User-PI may request the server side to
            identify a non-default server side data port with the PASV
            command.  Since a connection is defined by the pair of
            addresses, either of these actions is enough to get a
            different data connection, still it is permitted to do both
            commands to use new ports on both ends of the data
            connection.

            c.  Reuse of the Data Connection:  When using the stream
            mode of data transfer the end of the file must be indicated
            by closing the connection.  This causes a problem if
            multiple files are to be transfered in the session, due to
            need for TCP to hold the connection record for a time out
            period to guarantee the reliable communication.  Thus the
            connection can not be reopened at once.

               There are two solutions to this problem.  The first is to
               negotiate a non-default port (as in (b) above).  The
               second is to use another transfer mode.

               A comment on transfer modes.  The stream transfer mode is
               inherently unreliable, since one can not determine if the
               connection closed prematurely or not.  The other transfer
               modes (Block, Compressed) do not close the connection to
               indicate the end of file.  They have enough FTP encoding
               that the data connection can be parsed to determine the
               end of the file.  Thus using these modes one can leave
               the data connection open for multiple file transfers.

               Why this was not a problem with the old NCP FTP:

                  The NCP was designed with only the ARPANET in mind.
                  The ARPANET provides very reliable service, and the
                  NCP counted on it.  If any packet of data from an NCP
                  connection were lost or damaged by the network the NCP
                  could not recover.  It is a tribute to the ARPANET
                  designers that the NCP FTP worked so well.

                  The TCP is designed to provide reliable connections
                  over many different types of networks and
                  interconnections of networks.  TCP must cope with a
                  set of networks that can not promise to work as well
                  as the ARPANET.  TCP must make its own provisions for
                  end-to-end recovery from lost or damaged packets.
                  This leads to the need for the connection phase-down
                  time-out.  The NCP never had to deal with
                  acknowledgements or retransmissions or many other



<span class="grey">Reynolds &amp; Postel                                              [Page 16]</span></pre>

                  things the TCP must do to make connection reliable in
                  a more complex world.

         LIST and NLST:

            There is some confusion about the LIST an NLST commands, and
            what is appropriate to return.  Some clarification and
            motivation for these commands should be added to the
            specification.

         Multiple 1xx Replies:

            There is some difference of opinion about the use of
            multiple 1xx responses during command processing.  This
            issue comes up particularly in processing the RETR and STOR
            commands.  The two opinions are summarized below.

            For Exactly One 1xx Response:

               When a RETR or SEND command is started, the server is
               supposed to give an "intermediate reply" of 1xx when it
               is opening the data connection.  Currently, some FTP
               servers give two 1xx messages.  This causes problems for
               single-thread FTP user implementations.  After reading
               the first intermediate reply, they go off to do the
               transfer.  The second 1xx message is not seen until the
               end of the transfer.  The RFC gives a state diagram of
               the form:

                  ---------&gt;Wait---------&gt;
                          /      \
                          ^      |
                          |      V
                          \      /
                           &lt;-----

               This implies any number of 1xx's (including 0).  There is
               a suspicion that this is just sloppy diagraming, and that
               the intent is clear from other parts of the RFC.

               The FTP specification states that the reason for
               intermediate replies is to allow implementations that
               can't do any better to know when to stop listening to the
               control channel and switch their attention to the data
               channel.  Given this intent, it seems clear that there
               should be exactly one 1xx reply at the start of the
               transfer.

               The FTP specification is ambiguous in this regard.  The


<span class="grey">Reynolds &amp; Postel                                              [Page 17]</span></pre>

<span class="grey">Official ARPA-Internet Protocols                                 <a href="./rfc944">RFC 944</a></span>


               state diagrams appear to sanction any number of
               responses.  But the charts before them do not.  And from
               the intent, it seems obvious that exactly one is the
               right thing.

               Consider an implementation on a PC.  It is fairly hard to
               do parallel processing there.  It should be possible for
               a PC implementation to stop paying attention to the
               control channel and start reading the file from the data
               channel when he sees the 1xx response.  The only way this
               can work is if there is only one 1xx response.

               Of course, one could make it a requirement that every FTP
               implementation must be based on good enough interrupt
               technology so that it can field extra responses during
               the transfer.  But what would such a constraint buy?
               Just the ability to have both a 125 and a 150 response.
               It doesn't seem worth the price.  You could just as well
               combine the information in those responses into a single
               one.

            For Multiple 1xx Responses:

               The multiple 1xx messages arose because the new TCP
               specification omitted the 050 spontaneous reply code.  A
               solution was to change an 050 informational message to a
               1xx message, creating both a 125 and a 150.

               The state diagrams clearly allow this, and the
               "Command-Reply Sequences" section does not contradict it.
               A multiple 1xx implementation is in accord with the
               formal reply specifications.

               A multiple 1xx implementation works with the TOPS-20
               FTP's and with a number of different UNIX
               implementations, and the LOCUS system.  So, a lot of
               implementors must follow state diagrams in preference to
               prose.

               However, the observation is certainly correct that
               page 34 of the specification suggests that 1xx replies
               can be used by single-thread user implementations to
               switch attention to the data connection.  This would
               allow only a single 1xx message, in contradiction to the
               state diagrams.  It seems a bit strong, however, to call
               the one sentence on page 34 "the intent" of the
               specification, since it is contradicted by the format
               specification of replies.

               A side discussion favoring more status information:

                  One view has always assumed a two-thread
                  implementation.  In this view, most user
                  implementations are deficient because they do not
                  allow the user to enter a STATUS command during data
                  transfer.  A cynic might say that is because the
                  Computer Scientists who did these implementations only
                  do "Toy" file transfers, and often use "Toy" operating
                  systems.

                  There has been some complaints from the Toy systems
                  crowd recently that FTP is too complicated.  Well, it
                  may be too complicated for Toy systems, but in fact it
                  is too simple for many Real file systems.  For
                  example, it has no way to encode a "library" (i.e., a
                  named collection of subfiles).  It is (barely)
                  adequate for shipping around files of text, but not
                  much more.

                  With the notable exception of Multics and UNIX, many
                  operating systems support complex file structures of
                  which the user must be aware.  One is not doing the
                  user a favor by hiding details that may reach out and
                  bite him.  That is the reason some FTPs put out a
                  large informative message at the beginning of the
                  transfer, specifying the file baroqueness that is
                  involved.  As a Computer Scientist, you may find that
                  message annoying, but if you had to use MVS very much,
                  you would find it helpful, informative, and maybe even
                  reassuring.  Some believe that as DARPA technology
                  moves into the production environment of DDN, there
                  will be user requirements for such informative
                  messages for a variety of vendor operating systems.

               To provide important information to the user the
               specification should either allow multiple 1xx messages,
               or restore the old spontaneous reply category.  In fact,
               the latter is preferable; this information should be
               displayed to the user, but a user FTP might swallow 1xx
               messages without displaying their text.

            The Answer:

               Following the Robustness Principle (a protocol
               implementation ought to inflict minimal pain and accept
               maximal pain) there should be only one 1xx response.
               That is, those FTP servers that now issue two 1xx
               responses should combine them.

   Trivial File Transfer Protocol  ------------------------------ (TFTP)

      STATUS:  Elective

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc783">RFC 783</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         A very simple file moving protocol, no access control is
         provided.

         This is in use in several local networks.

         Ambiguities in the interpretation of several of the transfer
         modes should be  clarified, and additional transfer modes could
         be defined.  Additional error codes could be defined to more
         clearly identify problems.

   Simple File Transfer Protocol  ------------------------------- (SFTP)

      STATUS:  Experimental

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc913">RFC 913</a>

      COMMENTS:

         SFTP is a simple file transfer protocol.  It fills the need of
         people wanting a protocol that is more useful than TFTP but
         easier to implement (and less powerful) than FTP.  SFTP
         supports user access control, file transfers, directory
         listing, directory changing, file renaming and deleting.

         SFTP can be implemented with any reliable 8-bit byte stream

         oriented protocol, this document describes its TCP
         specification.  SFTP uses only one TCP connection; whereas TFTP
         implements a connection over UDP, and FTP uses two TCP
         connections (one using the TELNET protocol).

         Please discuss any plans for implementation or use of this
         protocol with the contact.

         This specification has significant problems:  1) The name
         syntax is out of date.  2) The protocol details are ambiguous,
         in particular, the length octet either does or doesn't include
         itself and the op code.  3) The extensions are not supported by
         any known implementation.

         This protocol is now abandon in favor of the DOMAIN protocol.

   Reliable Asynchronous Transfer Protocol  --------------------- (RATP)

      STATUS:  Experimental

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc916">RFC 916</a>

      COMMENTS:

         This paper specifies a protocol which allows two programs to
         reliably communicate over a communication link.  It ensures
         that the data entering one end of the link if received arrives
         at the other end intact and unaltered.  This proposed protocol
         is designed to operate over a full duplex point-to-point
         connection.  It contains some features which tailor it to the
         RS-232 links now in current use.

         Please discuss any plans for implementation or use of this
         protocol with the contact.

      COMMENTS:

         This paper discusses a Thinwire Protocol for connecting
         personal computers to the ARPA-Internet.  It primarily focuses
         on the particular problems in the ARPA-Internet of low speed
         network interconnection with personal computers, and possible
         methods of solution.
