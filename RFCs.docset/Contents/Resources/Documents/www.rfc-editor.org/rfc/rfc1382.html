Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing the Packet Layer of
   X.25.  The objects defined here, along with the objects in the "SNMP
   MIB Extension for LAPB" [<a href="#ref-9" title='"SNMP MIB extension for LAPB"'>9</a>] and the "Definitions of Managed Objects
   for RS-232-like Hardware Devices" [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232- like Hardware Devices"'>8</a>], combine to allow management of
   an X.25 protocol stack.

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  These components give the rules for defining objects,
   the definitions of objects, and the protocol for manipulating
   objects.

   The network management framework structures objects in an abstract
   information tree. The branches of the tree name objects and the
   leaves of the tree contain the values manipulated to effect
   management. This tree is called the Management Information Base or
   MIB. The concepts of this tree are given in STD 16/RFC 1155, "The
   Structure of Management Information" or SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>]. The SMI defines the
   trunk of the tree and the types of objects used when defining the
   leaves. STD 16/RFC 1212, "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>4</a>],
   defines a more concise description mechanism that preserves all the
   principals of the SMI.

   The core MIB definitions for the Internet suite of protocols can be
   found in <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title="and M. Rose">2</a>] "Management Information Base for Network
   Management of TCP/IP-based internets". STD 17/RFC 1213 [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>] defines
   MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I with changes to incorporate
   implementation experience and new operational requirements.

   STD 15/RFC 1157 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>3</a>] defines the SNMP protocol itself. The protocol
   defines how to manipulate the objects in a remote MIB.

   The tree structure of the MIB allows new objects to be defined for
   the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Objects</span>

   The definition of an object in the MIB requires an object name and
   type.  Object names and types are defined using the subset of
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-6" title=" International Organization for Standardization">6</a>] defined in the SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>].
   Objects are named using ASN.1 object identifiers, administratively
   assigned names, to specify object types.  The object name, together
   with an optional object instance, uniquely identifies a specific
   instance of an object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
   string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to objects.

   Objects also have a syntax that defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language [<a href="#ref-6" title=" International Organization for Standardization">6</a>] provides
   the primitives used for this purpose.  The SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>] purposely

   restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used for simplicity and
   ease of implementation.  The encoding of an object type simply
   describes how to represent an object using ASN.1 encoding rules [<a href="#ref-7" title=" International Standard 8825">7</a>],
   for purposes of dealing with the SNMP protocol.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> contains the specification of all object types defined in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in
   "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>4</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Informal%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Informal Overview</span>

   This section describes how the objects defined below relate with
   other MIBs.  This section is only informational to help understand
   how the pieces fit together.

   The objects defined below are used in conjunction with MIB-II and
   other MIBs such as the LAPB MIB [<a href="#ref-9" title='"SNMP MIB extension for LAPB"'>9</a>].  A system with a complete X.25
   stack running over a synchronous line will have at least two
   interfaces in the ifTable defined in MIB-II.  There will be an
   interface for LAPB and another interface for the packet layer of
   X.25. There will also be objects defined in the RS-232-like MIB for
   the physical sync line.

   Each software interface identifies the layer below it used to send
   and receive packets. The X.25 MIB object, defined below,
   x25OperDataLinkId, specifies an instance of lapbAdmnIndex for the
   LAPB interface under that X.25. The LAPB object, lapbOperPortId,
   identifies an instance of the rs232PortIndex for the the Sync line
   used by LAPB.

   For X.25 running over LAPB over Ethernet, the lapbOperPortId would
   identify the instance of ifIndex for the Ethernet interface.

   Each X.25 subnetwork will have separate entries in the ifTable.  Thus
   a system with two X.25 lines would have two ifTable entries for the
   two X.25 packet layers and two other entries for the two LAPB
   interfaces. Each X.25 Packet Layer MIB would identify the instance of
   the LAPB MIB for the interface below it. Each LAPB MIB would identify
   the Sync line below it. The system would also have two entries in the
   rs232PortTable and rs232SyncPortTable for the two physical lines.

   Since the ifTable as defined in MIB-II is device independent, it
   doesn't have anything specific for any type of interface.  The

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1382">RFC 1382</a>                 X.25 Packet Layer MIB             November 1992</span>


   objects below define the X.25 packet layer specific information for
   an interface of type X.25. Different X.25 interfaces can also be
   differentiated by matching the values of ifIndex with x25AdmnIndex.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Textual%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Textual Conventions</span>

   This MIB introduces a new data type as a textual convention for use
   with X.25.  This textual convention enhances the readability of the
   specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if
   appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of such
   textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  These conventions are merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
   are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit
   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

   This MIB introduces the data type of:

                       X121Address

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Structure%20of%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Structure of MIB</span>

   Instances of the objects defined below represent attributes of an
   X.25 Packet Layer interface.  At present these interfaces are
   identified by an ifType object in the Internet-standard MIB-II [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>]
   of:

                 ddn-x25(4), and
                 <a href="./rfc887">rfc887</a>-x25(5).

   For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the
   MIB-II [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

                 x25    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { transmission 5 }

   The objects defined below are similar to those defined in a draft ISO
   document for X.25 management [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Information Technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Elements of Management Information Related to OSI network Layer Standards"'>11</a>]. Some object definitions also
   reference the ISO specification for X.25 [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Information technology - - Data communication - X.25 Packet layer Protocol for Data Terminal Equipment"'>10</a>] to specify  the section
   that will give the reader additional information about the object.
   Access to those documents maybe useful (but isn't essential) to
   understand the names and semantics of some objects.  The similarity
   of these objects with the ISO objects minimizes the instrumentation
   required by those systems that support both OSI and TCP/IP management
   protocols.

   Since the objects defined here are extensions to the Internet
   Standard MIB [<a href="#ref-2" title="and M. Rose">2</a>] and thus also an extension of the second version,
   MIB-II [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>], the objects defined here explicitly do not duplicate
   objects defined in existing standards.  In some instances
   clarification of how to apply those objects has been given.

   The relationship between an X.25 Packet Layer interface and an
   interface in the context of the Internet-standard MIB [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>] is one-to-
   one. As such, the value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly
   used to identify corresponding instances of the objects defined
   below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Tables"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Tables</span>

   The objects below form several tables.  These tables are:

                               x25AdmnTable
                               x25OperTable
                               x25StatTable
                               x25ChannelTable
                               x25CircuitTable
                               x25ClearedCircuitTable
                               x25CallParmTable

   The x25AdmnTable defines objects for the parameters of an X.25
   interface which the administrator can read and set.  These objects
   are used at interface initialization time to start the interface.
   Once the interface has started, changes to the objects in the
   Administration table may not take affect until the interface is re-
   initialized.

   The x25OperTable defines objects that report the current parameters
   used by a running interface.  These objects are read-only.

   The x25StatTable defines objects that report operational statistics
   for an X.25 interface.  These are read-only counters of events that
   occurred at the interface.

   The x25ChannelTable defines objects to allow the administrator to
   manage the division of channel numbers.

   The x25CircuitTable defines objects that return information about
   existing X.25 circuits.  These entries result from calls placed or
   answered by the PLE or from PVCs.

   The x25ClearedCircuitTable contains objects for recording the
   termination information from circuits that cleared abnormally.




<span class="grey">Throop                                                          [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1382">RFC 1382</a>                 X.25 Packet Layer MIB             November 1992</span>


   The x25CallParmTable defines the call parameters used to call other
   systems.  This table contains call parameter entries which are
   referenced by other tables.  For example, the x25AdmnTable has one
   object that identifies the entry in the table for the default PLE
   parameters.  The x25CircuitTable has one object that identifies the
   entry in the x25CallParmTable for the parameters in use by that
   circuit.  Other MIBs may also reference entries to identify call
   parameters to use to make X.25 calls.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.5.%20%20Table%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" id="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Table Usage</span>

   Different tables provide different functions.  The administrator sets
   the starting X.25 parameters in the x25AdmnTable for the X.25 PLE;
   these objects include a reference to the x25CallParmTable entry to
   identify the default call parameters for the PLE.  Once all the
   parameters are set, the administrator initializes the interface.  As
   part of initializing the interface, the operating parameters are
   copied into the interface from the x25AdmnTable; these parameters are
   viewable by getting the objects in the x25OperTable.  (The interface
   maybe started by setting the value of ifAdminStatus to up.)  If any
   PVCs are configured, their parameters can be set in the the
   x25CircuitTable before initializing the interface; this should be
   done in conjunction with configuring higher layer entities to use the
   PVCs via the MIBs for those entities.

   Once the PLE completes initialization, it makes additional entries in
   the x25circuitTable for calls placed or answered.  When a circuit is
   cleared, the status of the entry for the circuit is set to closed
   and, if the clear is abnormal, an entry will also be made in the
   x25ClearedCircuitTable.  An entry in the x25CircuitTable with a
   status of closed maybe deleted by the agent at its convenience.  A
   closed entry will always be reused at the time the PLE re-allocates
   the channel number of the entry for another call.  The call
   parameters used for a circuit can be found by looking in the
   x25CircuitTable and following the x25CircuitCallParamId pointer to
   the entry in the x25CallParmTable that contains the parameters.

   There are no mechanisms in the X.25 MIB for telling the PLE to place
   an X.25 call. Such mechanisms belong in the MIBs for the higher layer
   entities that use the X.25 circuits.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.6.%20%20Conformance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6" id="section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Conformance</span>

   All the objects defined here are mandatory. To claim conformance with
   this MIB an implementation must support all objects.  However some
   objects pertain to features that are optional.  There are values
   defined for those objects that indicate the implementation does not
   support the optional feature.  The agent for such an implementation



<span class="grey">Throop                                                          [Page 6]</span></pre>

   must support reading the object and return the value that indicates
   the optional feature isn't supported and reject set requests to
   change the object.

   Some optional features have more than one object that pertain to it
   (window rotation has a timer, a count, and a counter for timer
   runouts).  In such case, any object which indicates the optional
   feature isn't supported is sufficient to indicate the feature isn't
   supported and the values of the other objects relative to that
   feature are undefined.

                          set configuration parameters for an X.25
                          Packet Level Entity (PLE).

                         Most of the objects in this table have
                          corresponding objects in the x25OperTable.
                          This table contains the values as last set
                          by the administrator.  The x25OperTable
                          contains the values actually in use by an
                          X.25 PLE.

                          Changing an administrative value may or may
                          not change a current operating value.  The
                          operating value may not change until the
                          interface is restarted.  Some
                          implementations may change the values
                          immediately upon changing the administrative
                          table.  All implementations are required to
                          load the values from the administrative
                          table when initializing a PLE."

                          "This object reports the current status of
                          the circuit.

                          An existing instance of this object can only
                          be set to startClear, startPvcResetting, or
                          invalid.  An instance with the value calling
                          or open can only be set to startClear and
                          that action will start clearing the circuit.
                          An instance with the value PVC can only be
                          set to startPvcResetting or invalid and that
                          action resets the PVC or deletes the circuit
                          respectively.  The values startClear or
                          startPvcResetting will never be returned by
                          an agent.  An attempt to set the status of
                          an existing instance to a value other than
                          one of these values will result in an error.

                          A non-existing instance can be set to PVC to
                          create a PVC if the implementation supports
                          dynamic creation of PVCs.  Some
                          implementations may only allow creation and
                          deletion of PVCs if the interface is down.
                          Since the instance identifier will supply
                          the PLE index and the channel number,
                          setting this object alone supplies
                          sufficient information to create the
                          instance.  All the DEFVAL clauses for the
                          other objects of this table are appropriate
                          for creating a PVC; PLEs creating entries
                          for placed or accepted calls will use values
                          appropriate for the call rather than the
                          value of the DEFVAL clause.  Two managers
                          trying to create the same PVC can determine
                          from the return code which manager succeeded
                          and which failed (the failing manager fails
                          because it can not set a value of PVC for an
                          existing object).

                          referenced from other objects which identify
                          call parameters.

                          It is impossible to know which other objects
                          in the MIB reference entries in the table by
                          looking at this table.  Because of this,
                          changes to parameters must be accomplished
                          by creating a new entry in this table and
                          then changing the referencing table to
                          identify the new entry.

                          Note that an agent will only use the values
                          in this table when another table is changed

                          reference count will affect the writability
                          of the objects as explained above.

                          Entries in this table which have a reference

                          create a reference to newly created entries.

          July 30 1992

          The July, 1992 release (Editor's Internal Reference Number
          2.14) made the following changes:

               The syntax of the index objects for tables that are
               congruent with the MIB-II ifTable were changed to
               ifIndexType.

               The x25CallParmRefCount object was added to the
               x25CallParmTable.

               The description of the x25CallParmTable and
               x25CallParmIndex objects were changed to only allow
               writing an entry with a zero reference count.

               A requirement for conformance was added after the
               definition of x25 in the ASN.1 definition.

          June 26 1992

          The June 29, 1992 release (Editor's Internal Reference Number
          2.12) made the following changes:

               The range of x25ChannelLIC was changed from (0..4096) to
               (0..4095).

               The range of x25ChannelHIC was changed from (0..4096) to
               (0..4095).

               The range of x25ChannelLTC was changed from (0..4096) to
               (0..4095).

               The range of x25ChannelHTC was changed from (0..4096) to
               (0..4095).

               The range of x25ChannelLOC was changed from (0..4096) to

               (1..4096) to (0..4095).

          June 1992

          The June 92 release (Editor's Internal Reference Number 2.11)
          made the following changes:

               A value of dxe was defined for x25AdmnInterfaceMode and
               x25OperInterfaceMode.

               The objects in the x25ChannelTable can now have a value
               of zero to indicate no channels configured in the range.

               The length of an X121Address was extended to 17 to
               accommodate the 1988 CCITT X.25 standard.

               Some object descriptions have been expanded and
               simplified, these include:  all the channel table objects
               except the index, x25AdmnDataRxmtCount,
               x25AdmnRejectCount, x25AdmnRegistrationRequestCount,

               x25CallParmCug, x25CallParmCugoa, x25CallParmBcug,

               x25StatInCallRefusals and x25CallParmOutPacketSize.

               The x25StatNumberPvcs object was deleted and
               x25AdmnNumberPVCs and x25OperNumberPVCs objects added.

               The object x25StatOutDataPackets was added.

               The object x25AdmnProtocolVersionSupported as added.

               The x25CircuitRemoteDteAddress was deleted.

               Some ASN.1 errors were corrected.

          April 1992

          The April release (Editor's Internal Reference Number 2.8)
          made many changes to incorporate the comments of the working
          group meeting in March 1992.



<span class="grey">Throop                                                         [Page 63]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1382">RFC 1382</a>                 X.25 Packet Layer MIB             November 1992</span>


               All reference comments were changed to reference fields.

               The type PositiveInteger was imported from the <a href="./rfc1381">RFC1381</a>-
               MIB and used for all index and timer values.

               The x25PleTable was split into the x25AdmnTable,
               x25OperTable, and x25StatTable.

               The timer and counter objects from the x25CircuitTable
               were moved to the x25AdmnTable and replicated in the
               x25OperTable

               The objects in the x25CircuitTable were reordered to put
               the non-integer objects at the end of the table for
               easier implementation.

               The called and calling extension character set was
               extended to include a-f, and A-F.

               Additional states were added to the x25CircuitStatus
               object.

               Additional values were added to x25CircuitDirection
               x25CircuitCallParamId, and the addresses in the Circuit
               Table for PVCs.

               The length of the X25Address was changed to 0..15.

               The objects x25ClearedCircuitTimeEstablished,
               x25ClearedCircuitInPdus, and x25ClearedCircuitOutPdus
               were added to the x25ClearedCircuitTable.

               The name of the x25CircuitName was changed to
               x25CircuitDescr and the description was expanded.

               The access of the x25CircuitCallParamId was changed to
               read-only.

               The x25ClearedCircuitCodes object was split into the
               x25ClearedCircuitClearingCause and
               x25ClearedCircuitDiagnosticCode objects.

               The semantics of the x25ClearedCircuitIndex was
               redefined.

               Some of the description clauses were changed in an
               attempt to add clarity.




<span class="grey">Throop                                                         [Page 64]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1382">RFC 1382</a>                 X.25 Packet Layer MIB             November 1992</span>


               DEFVAL clauses were added to most objects in the
               x25CallParmTable.

               Additional text was added to the description section to
               provide an overview of the tables of the MIB.

               The minimum allowable value for maximum active circuits
               was changed from one to zero.

          February 1992

          The February release (Editor's Internal Reference Number 1.14)
          made many changes.

               Many of the tables were combined.  For example, the
               x25InfoTable, x25PktStatTable, and x25TmrStatTable were
               combined into the x25PleTable.  The x25ConInfoTable,
               x25ConStatTable, and x25ConTimrTable were combined into
               the x25CircuitTable.

               The objects for call parameters were drastically
               reworked.  All call parameters were combined in the
               x25CallParmTable.  Any table, such as the  x25PleTable or
               x25CircuitTable, that needs to reference call parameters
               identifies an entry in the new table.  As part of this
               the x25ConDefTable was deleted and replaced with the
               x25PleDefCallParamId.

               The x25PvcTable was deleted; the x25CircuitStatus object
               provides similar information about PVCs.

               The x25ClearedCircuitTable was added to record the status
               code of cleared circuits.

               Many object definitions were restructured. For example,
               the time units for timers was changed from 1/100ths of a
               second to milliseconds.  Some indexes into tables were
               replaced with object identifiers.

               Much of the introductory text was changed and the
               references were changed to match.

          October 1991

          The October release (Editor Internal Reference Number 1.10)
          made the following changes:

               Changed x25ConInfoStatus to clarify the description and



<span class="grey">Throop                                                         [Page 65]</span></pre>

               the pvcResetting(5) value was changed to pvcResetting(6)
               to avoid a conflict with a previous use of the number 5.

               The name of the counter object
               x25TmrStatRetryCountsExceeded was changed to
               x25TmrStatRetryCountExceededs.

               The name of the counter object
               x25TmrStatClearCountsExceeded was changed to
               x25TmrStatClearCountExceededs.

               All occurrence of Guage was changed to Gauge.

               Added the x25CallFcltyTable, x25CallFcltyCcittTable, and
               x25CallParamTable.

          June 1991

          The June release corrected some syntax errors and cleaned up
          some other minor things.

          April 1991

          The April 26 release of this document was the first release.
          That version was derived from the ISO work on network layer
          management as presented in ISO/IEC 10733 [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Information Technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Elements of Management Information Related to OSI network Layer Standards"'>11</a>]
