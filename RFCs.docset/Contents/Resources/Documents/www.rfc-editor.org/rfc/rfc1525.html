<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing source routing and
   source routing transparent bridges.  These bridges are also required
   to implement relevant groups in the Bridge MIB [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>6</a>].

   This MIB supersedes the dot1dSr group of objects published in an
   earlier version of the Bridge MIB, <a href="./rfc1286">RFC 1286</a>.  Changes have primarily
   been made to track changes in the IEEE 802.5M SRT Addendum to the
   IEEE 802.1D Standard for MAC Bridges.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20Network%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The Network Management Framework</span>

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      o    STD 16, <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
           describing and naming objects for the purpose of
           management.  STD 16, <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a> defines a more concise description
           mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

      o    STD 17, <a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a> defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
           for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o    STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
           network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Object%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Object Definitions</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

   layer.  There are two major modes defined for this bridging;
   transparent and source route.  The transparent method of bridging is
   defined in the IEEE 802.1d MAC Bridge specification [<a href="#ref-11" title="(March 8">11</a>].  Source
   route bridging has been defined by I.B.M. and is described in the
   Token Ring Architecture Reference [<a href="#ref-12">12</a>], as well as the IEEE 802.5M
   SRT Bridge Operations Addendum [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Source Routing Transparent Bridge Operation"'>14</a>] to 802.1d.  This memo defines
   objects needed for management of a source routing bridge, and is an
   extension to the SNMP Bridge MIB [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>6</a>].

   An explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB as simple as possible.
   This was accomplished by applying the following criteria to objects
   proposed for inclusion:

      (1)  Start with a small set of essential objects and add only
           as further objects are needed.

      (2)  Require objects be essential for either fault or
           configuration management.

      (3)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

      (4)  Limit the total of objects.

      (5)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
           this or other MIBs.

      (6)  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily
           instrumented.  The guideline that was followed is one
           counter per critical section per layer.

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.  Where
   appropriate, the corresponding management object name found in IEEE
   802.1d [<a href="#ref-11" title="(March 8">11</a>] and IEEE 802.5M [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Source Routing Transparent Bridge Operation"'>14</a>] is also included.

   This group contains the objects that describe the entity's state with

   supported, this group will not be implemented.  This group is

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1525">RFC 1525</a>               Source Routing Bridge MIB          September 1993</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Relationship%20to%20Other%20MIBs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Relationship to Other MIBs</span>

   As described above, some IEEE 802.1d management objects have not been
   included in this MIB because they overlap with objects in other MIBs
   applicable to a bridge implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is
   assumed that a bridge implementing this MIB will also implement (at
   least) the Bridge MIB and the 'system' group and the 'interfaces'
   group defined in MIB-II [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>4</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.1.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20Bridge%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1" id="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Relationship to the Bridge MIB</span>

   The Bridge MIB [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>6</a>] must be implemented by all bridges, including
   transparent, SR and SRT bridges.  The SR bridge MIB is an extension
   to the Bridge MIB.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.2.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20%27system%27%20group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.2" id="section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  Relationship to the 'system' group</span>

   In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
   object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to the
   entity as a whole irrespective of whether the entity's sole
   functionality is bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of
   the entity's functionality.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.3.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20%27interfaces%27%20group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.3" id="section-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>.  Relationship to the 'interfaces' group</span>

   In MIB-II, the 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for
   all systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces, where
   each interface is thought of as being attached to a `subnetwork'.
   (Note that this term is not to be confused with `subnet' which refers
   to an addressing partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of
   protocols.)  The term 'segment' is used in this memo to refer to such
   a subnetwork.

   Implicit in this MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each of
   these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces'
   group, and in most situations, each port is associated with a
   different interface. However, there are situations in which multiple
   ports are associated with the same interface.  An example of such a
   situation would be several ports, each corresponding one-to-one with
   several X.25 virtual circuits, but all on the same interface.

   Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port number has
   no mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the simple
   case, a port number will have the same value as the corresponding
   interface's interface number.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1525">RFC 1525</a>               Source Routing Bridge MIB          September 1993</span>


   Some entities provide other services in addition to bridging with
   respect to the data sent and received by their interfaces.  In such
   situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an interface
   is within the domain of the entity's bridging functionality.  This
   subset is considered to be delineated according to a set of
   protocols, with some protocols being bridged, and other protocols not
   being bridged.  For example, in an entity which exclusively performed
   bridging, all protocols would be considered as being bridged, whereas
   in an entity which performed IP routing on IP datagrams and only
   bridged other protocols, only the non-IP data would be considered as
   being bridged.

   Thus, this MIB (and in particular, its counters) are applicable only
   to that subset of the data on an entity's interfaces which is
   sent/received for a protocol being bridged.  All such data is
   sent/received via the ports of the bridge.

   In addition to being separated from the Bridge MIB into a separate
   document, the following changes were implemented as a result of
   feedback from IEEE 802.5M:

          (1)  Changed syntax of dot1dSrPortLargestFrame to INTEGER in
               order to allow for having 64 possible values as described
               in draft 7 of the SR Addendum.  Listed all legal values
               in description.

          (2)  Updated syntax of dot1dSrPort, used to index into
               dot1dSrPortTable, to use the range (1..65535).

          (3)  Added a counter to dot1dSrPortTable to count occurrences
               of duplicate LAN IDs or Tree errors.

          (4)  Added a counter to dot1dSrPortTable to count LAN ID
               mismatches.

          (5)  Added text to dot1dSrPortSpecInFrames and
               dot1dSrPortSpecOutFrames clarifying that they are also
               referred to as Source Routed Frames.

          (6)  Added text to dot1dSrPortApeInFrames and
               dot1dSrPortApeOutFrames clarifying that they are also
               referred to as All Routes Explorer frames.

          (7)  Added a scalar variable to the dot1dSr group to indicate
               whether the bridge uses 3 bit or 6 bit length negotiation
               fields.

              STATUS  mandatory
              DESCRIPTION
                      "Determines how this port behaves when presented
                      with a Spanning Tree Explorer frame.  The value
                      'disabled(2)' indicates that the port will not
                      accept or send Spanning Tree Explorer packets; any
                      STE packets received will be silently discarded.
                      The value 'forced(3)' indicates the port will
                      always accept and propagate Spanning Tree Explorer
                      frames.  This allows a manually configured
                      Spanning Tree for this class of packet to be
                      configured.  Note that unlike transparent
                      bridging, this is not catastrophic to the network
                      if there are loops.  The value 'auto-span(1)' can
                      only be returned by a bridge that both implements
                      the Spanning Tree Protocol and has use of the
                      protocol enabled on this port. The behavior of the
                      port for Spanning Tree Explorer frames is
                      determined by the state of dot1dStpPortState.  If
                      the port is in the 'forwarding' state, the frame
                      will be accepted or propagated.  Otherwise, it
