<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document defines an IMAP [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>] extension to facilitate
   moving messages from one mailbox to another.  This is accomplished by
   defining a new MOVE command and extending the UID command to allow
   UID MOVE.

   A move function is not provided in the base IMAP specification, so
   clients have instead had to use a combination of the COPY, STORE, and
   EXPUNGE commands to perform this very common operation.

   Implementors have long pointed out some shortcomings with this
   approach.  Because the moving of a message is not an atomic process,
   interruptions can leave messages in intermediate states.  Because
   multiple clients can be accessing the mailboxes at the same time,
   clients can see messages in intermediate states even without
   interruptions.  If the source mailbox contains other messages that
   are flagged for deletion, the third step can have the side effect of
   expunging more than just the set of moved messages.  Additionally,
   servers with certain types of back-end message stores might have
   efficient ways of moving messages, which don't involve the actual
   copying of data.  Such efficiencies are often not available to the
   COPY/STORE/EXPUNGE process.

   The MOVE extension is present in any IMAP implementation that returns
   "MOVE" as one of the supported capabilities to the CAPABILITY
   command.

   Arguments: sequence set
              mailbox name

   Responses: no specific responses for this command

   Result: OK - move completed

           NO - move error: can't move those messages or to that name

           BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20UID%20MOVE%20Command"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  UID MOVE Command</span>

   This extends the first form of the UID command (see <a href="./rfc3501#section-6.4.8">[RFC3501],
   Section 6.4.8</a>) to add the MOVE command defined above as a valid
   argument.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Semantics%20of%20MOVE%20and%20UID%20MOVE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Semantics of MOVE and UID MOVE</span>

   The MOVE command takes two arguments: a message set (sequence numbers
   for MOVE, UIDs for UID MOVE) and a named mailbox.  Each message
   included in the set is moved, rather than copied, from the selected
   (source) mailbox to the named (target) mailbox.

   This means that a new message is created in the target mailbox with a
   new UID, the original message is removed from the source mailbox, and
   it appears to the client as a single action.  This has the same
   effect for each message as this sequence:

   1.  [UID] COPY

   2.  [UID] STORE +FLAGS.SILENT \DELETED

   3.  UID EXPUNGE

   Although the effect of the MOVE is the same as the preceding steps,
   the semantics are not identical: The intermediate states produced by
   those steps do not occur, and the response codes are different.  In
   particular, though the COPY and EXPUNGE response codes will be
   returned, response codes for a STORE MUST NOT be generated and the
   \DELETED flag MUST NOT be set for any message.






<span class="grey">Gulbrandsen &amp; Freed          Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6851">RFC 6851</a>                  IMAP - MOVE Extension             January 2013</span>


   Because a MOVE applies to a set of messages, it might fail partway
   through the set.  Regardless of whether the command is successful in
   moving the entire set, each individual message SHOULD either be moved
   or unaffected.  The server MUST leave each message in a state where
   it is in at least one of the source or target mailboxes (no message
   can be lost or orphaned).  The server SHOULD NOT leave any message in
   both mailboxes (it would be bad for a partial failure to result in a
   bunch of duplicate messages).  This is true even if the server
   returns a tagged NO response to the command.

   Because of the similarity of MOVE to COPY, extensions that affect
   COPY affect MOVE in the same way.  Response codes such as TRYCREATE
   (see <a href="./rfc3501#section-6.4.7">[RFC3501], Section 6.4.7</a>), as well as those defined by
   extensions, are sent as appropriate.  See <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for more
   information about how MOVE interacts with other IMAP extensions.

   An example:

       C: a UID MOVE 42:69 foo
       S: * OK [COPYUID 432432 42:69 1202:1229]
       S: * 22 EXPUNGE
       S: (more expunges)
       S: a OK Done

   Note that the server may send unrelated EXPUNGE responses as well, if
   any happen to have been expunged at the same time; this is normal
   IMAP operation.

   Implementers will need to read [<a href="./rfc4315" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - UIDPLUS extension"'>RFC4315</a>] to understand what UID
   EXPUNGE does, though full implementation of [<a href="./rfc4315" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - UIDPLUS extension"'>RFC4315</a>] is not
   necessary.

   Note that moving a message to the currently selected mailbox (that
   is, where the source and target mailboxes are the same) is allowed
   when copying the message to the currently selected mailbox is
   allowed.

   The server may send EXPUNGE (or VANISHED) responses before the tagged
   response, so the client cannot safely send more commands with message
   sequence number arguments while the server is processing MOVE or UID
   MOVE.

   Both MOVE and UID MOVE can be pipelined with other commands, but care
   has to be taken.  Both commands modify sequence numbers and also
   allow unrelated EXPUNGE responses.  The renumbering of other messages
   in the source mailbox following any EXPUNGE response can be
   surprising and makes it unsafe to pipeline any command that relies on
   message sequence numbers after a MOVE or UID MOVE.  Similarly, MOVE

   cannot be pipelined with a command that might cause message
   renumbering.  See <a href="./rfc3501#section-5.5">[RFC3501], Section 5.5</a>, for more information about
   ambiguities as well as handling requirements for both clients and
   servers.

   This section describes how MOVE interacts with some other IMAP
   extensions.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20RFC%202087%2C%20QUOTA"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  <a href="./rfc2087">RFC 2087</a>, QUOTA</span>

   The QUOTA extension (defined by [<a href="./rfc2087" title='"IMAP4 QUOTA extension"'>RFC2087</a>]) may interact with MOVE on
   some servers, in the sense that a MOVE command may succeed where COPY
   would cause a quota overrun.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20RFC%204314%2C%20Access%20Control%20List%20%28ACL%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  <a href="./rfc4314">RFC 4314</a>, Access Control List (ACL)</span>

   The ACL rights [<a href="./rfc4314" title='"IMAP4 Access Control List (ACL) Extension"'>RFC4314</a>] required for MOVE and UID MOVE are the union
   of the ACL rights required for UID STORE, UID COPY, and UID EXPUNGE.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20RFC%204315%2C%20UIDPLUS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  <a href="./rfc4315">RFC 4315</a>, UIDPLUS</span>

   Servers supporting UIDPLUS [<a href="./rfc4315" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - UIDPLUS extension"'>RFC4315</a>] SHOULD send COPYUID in response
   to a UID MOVE command.  For additional information see <a href="./rfc4315#section-3">Section 3 of
   [RFC4315]</a>.

   Servers implementing UIDPLUS are also advised to send the COPYUID
   response code in an untagged OK before sending EXPUNGE or moved
   responses.  (Sending COPYUID in the tagged OK, as described in the
   UIDPLUS specification, means that clients first receive an EXPUNGE
   for a message and afterwards COPYUID for the same message.  It can be
   unnecessarily difficult to process that sequence usefully.)

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.4.%20%20RFC%205162%2C%20QRESYNC"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" id="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  <a href="./rfc5162">RFC 5162</a>, QRESYNC</span>

   The QRESYNC extension [<a href="./rfc5162" title='"IMAP4 Extensions for Quick Mailbox Resynchronization"'>RFC5162</a>] states that the server SHOULD send
   VANISHED rather than EXPUNGE in response to the UID EXPUNGE command.
   The same requirement applies to MOVE, and a QRESYNC-enabled client
   needs to handle both VANISHED and EXPUNGE responses to a UID MOVE
   command.

   If the server is capable of storing modification sequences for the
   selected mailbox, it MUST increment the per-mailbox mod-sequence if
   at least one message was permanently moved due to the execution of
   the MOVE/UID MOVE command.  For each permanently removed message, the
   server MUST remember the incremented mod-sequence and corresponding
   UID.  If at least one message was moved, the server MUST send the

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6851">RFC 6851</a>                  IMAP - MOVE Extension             January 2013</span>


   updated per-mailbox modification sequence using the HIGHESTMODSEQ
   response code (defined in [<a href="./rfc4551" title='"IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE Operation or Quick Flag Changes Resynchronization"'>RFC4551</a>]) in the tagged or untagged OK
   response.

   When one or more messages are moved to a target mailbox, if the
   server is capable of storing modification sequences for the mailbox,
   the server MUST generate and assign new modification sequence numbers
   to the moved messages that are higher than the highest modification
   sequence of the messages originally in the mailbox.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.5.%20%20IMAP%20Events%20in%20Sieve"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" id="section-4.5">4.5</a>.  IMAP Events in Sieve</span>

   MOVE applies to IMAP events in Sieve [<a href="./rfc6785" title='"Support for Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Events in Sieve"'>RFC6785</a>] in the same way as
   COPY does.  Therefore, MOVE can cause a Sieve script to be invoked
   with the imap.cause set to "COPY".  Because MOVE does not cause flags
   to be changed, a MOVE command will not result in a script invocation
   with the imap.cause set to "FLAG".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Formal%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Formal Syntax</span>

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].  [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>] defines
   the non-terminals "capability", "command-select", "sequence-set", and
   "mailbox".

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

   capability     =/ "MOVE"

   command-select =/ move
   move           = "MOVE" SP sequence-set SP mailbox
   uid            = "UID" SP (copy / fetch / search / store / move)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   MOVE does not introduce any new capabilities to IMAP, and this limits
   the security impact.  However, the transactional semantics of MOVE
   may interact with specific implementations in ways that could have
   unexpected consequences.  For example, moving messages between
   mailboxes under the quota root may require temporary suspension of
   quota checking.

   An additional area of concern is interaction with antispam,
   antivirus, and other security scanning and auditing mechanisms.
   Different mailboxes may have different security policies that could

   interact with MOVE in complex ways.  Scanning with updated rules may
   also be required when messages are moved even when the underlying
   policy has not changed.

   MOVE does relieve a problem with the base specification, since client
   authors currently have to devise and implement complicated algorithms
   to handle partial failures of the STORE/COPY/EXPUNGE trio.
   Incomplete or improper implementation of these algorithms can lead to
   mail loss.
