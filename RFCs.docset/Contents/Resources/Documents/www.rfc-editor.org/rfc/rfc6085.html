         <span class="h1">Address Mapping of IPv6 Multicast Packets on Ethernet</span>

Abstract

   When transmitting an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination
   address, the IPv6 destination address is mapped to an Ethernet link-
   layer multicast address.  This document clarifies that a mapping of
   an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address may in some
   circumstances map to an Ethernet link-layer unicast address.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks" (<a href="./rfc2464#section-7">[RFC2464],
   Section 7</a>) specifies how an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination
   address is mapped into an Ethernet link-layer address.  This document
   extends this mapping to explicitly allow for a mapping of an IPv6
   packet with a multicast destination address into an Ethernet link-
   layer unicast address, when it is clear that only one address is
   relevant.

   This mapping does not replace the mapping described in <a href="./rfc2464#section-7">[RFC2464],
   Section 7</a>.  The determination of the unicast Ethernet link-layer
   address and the construction of the outgoing IPv6 packet are out of
   scope for this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Conventions</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Receiving%20IPv6%20Multicast%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Receiving IPv6 Multicast Packets</span>

   An IPv6 node receiving an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination
   address and an Ethernet link-layer unicast address MUST NOT drop the
   packet as a result of the use of this form of address mapping.
