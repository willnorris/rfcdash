<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document specifies an extension to the Host Identity Protocol
   (HIP) [<a href="./rfc7401" title='"Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)"'>RFC7401</a>].  The extension provides a generic means for a host
   to register with a service.  The service may, for example, be a HIP
   rendezvous server [<a href="./rfc8004" title='"Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Rendezvous Extension"'>RFC8004</a>] or a middlebox [<a href="./rfc3234" title='"Middleboxes: Taxonomy and Issues"'>RFC3234</a>].

   This document makes no further assumptions about the exact type of
   service.  Likewise, this document does not specify any mechanisms to
   discover the presence of specific services or means to interact with
   them after registration.  Future documents may describe those
   operations.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   In addition to the terminology defined in the HIP Architecture
   [<a href="#ref-HIP-ARCH">HIP-ARCH</a>], the HIP specification [<a href="./rfc7401" title='"Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)"'>RFC7401</a>], and the HIP Rendezvous
   Extension [<a href="./rfc8004" title='"Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Rendezvous Extension"'>RFC8004</a>], this document defines and uses the following
   terms:

   Requester:
      a HIP node registering with a HIP registrar to request
      registration for a service.

   Registrar:
      a HIP node offering registration for one or more services.

   Service:
      a facility that provides requesters with new capabilities or
      functionalities operating at the HIP layer.  Examples include
      firewalls that support HIP traversal or HIP rendezvous servers.

   Registration:
      shared state stored by a requester and a registrar, allowing the
      requester to benefit from one or more HIP services offered by the
      registrar.  Each registration has an associated finite lifetime.
      Requesters can extend established registrations through
      re-registration (i.e., perform a refresh).

   Registration Type:
      an 8-bit identifier for a given service in the registration
      protocol.  For example, the rendezvous service is identified by a
      specific registration type.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20HIP%20Registration%20Extension%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  HIP Registration Extension Overview</span>

   This document does not specify the means by which a requester
   discovers the availability of a service or how a requester locates a
   registrar.  After a requester has discovered a registrar, it either
   initiates HIP base exchange or uses an existing HIP association with
   the registrar.  In both cases, registrars use additional parameters,
   which the remainder of this document defines, to announce their
   quality and grant or refuse registration.  Requesters use
   corresponding parameters to register with the service.  Both the
   registrar and the requester MAY also include in the messages
   exchanged additional HIP parameters specific to the registration type
   requested.  Other documents will define parameters and how they shall
   be used.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8003">RFC 8003</a>               HIP Registration Extension           October 2016</span>


   The HIP base exchange, including the definition of the HIP I1, R1,
   I2, and R2 packets, is defined in [<a href="./rfc7401" title='"Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)"'>RFC7401</a>].  The following sections
   describe the differences between this registration handshake and the
   standard HIP base exchange [<a href="./rfc7401" title='"Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)"'>RFC7401</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Registrar%20Announcing%20Its%20Ability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Registrar Announcing Its Ability</span>

   A host that is capable and willing to act as a registrar vis-a-vis a
   specific requester SHOULD include a REG_INFO parameter in the R1
   packets it sends during all base exchanges with that requester.  If
   it is currently unable to provide services due to transient
   conditions, it SHOULD include an empty REG_INFO, i.e., one with no
   services listed.  If services can be provided later, it SHOULD send
   UPDATE packets indicating the current set of services available in a
   new REG_INFO parameter to all hosts it is associated with.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Requester%20Requesting%20Registration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Requester Requesting Registration</span>

   To request registration with a service, a requester constructs and
   includes a corresponding REG_REQUEST parameter in an I2 or UPDATE
   packet it sends to the registrar.

   If the requester has no HIP association established with the
   registrar, it SHOULD send the REG_REQUEST at the earliest
   possibility, i.e., in the I2 packet.  This minimizes the number of
   packets that need to be exchanged with the registrar.  A registrar
   MAY end a HIP association that does not carry a REG_REQUEST by
   including a NOTIFY with the type REG_REQUIRED in the R2.  In this
   case, no HIP association is created between the hosts.  The
   REG_REQUIRED notification error type is 51.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Registrar%20Granting%20or%20Refusing%20Service%28s%29%20Registration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Registrar Granting or Refusing Service(s) Registration</span>

   Once registration has been requested, the registrar is able to
   authenticate the requester based on the host identity included in I2.

   If the registrar knows the Host Identities (HIs) of all the hosts
   that are allowed to register for service(s), it SHOULD reject
   registrations from unknown hosts.  However, since it may be
   infeasible to preconfigure the registrar with all the HIs, the
   registrar SHOULD also support HIP certificates [<a href="./rfc8002" title='"Host Identity Protocol Certificates"'>RFC8002</a>] to allow for
   certificate-based authentication.

   When a requester wants to register with a registrar, it SHOULD check
   if it has a suitable certificate for authenticating with the
   registrar.  How the suitability is determined and how the
   certificates are obtained is out of scope for this document.  If the
   requester has one or more suitable certificates, the host SHOULD

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8003">RFC 8003</a>               HIP Registration Extension           October 2016</span>


   include them (or just the most suitable one) in a CERT parameter to
   the HIP packet along with the REG_REQUEST parameter.  If the
   requester does not have any suitable certificates, it SHOULD send the
   registration request without the CERT parameter to test whether the
   registrar accepts the request based on the host's identity.

   When a registrar receives a HIP packet with a REG_REQUEST parameter,
   and it requires authentication for at least one of the registration
   types listed in the REG_REQUEST parameter, it MUST first check
   whether the HI of the requester is in the allowed list for all the
   registration types in the REG_REQUEST parameter.  If the requester is
   in the allowed list (or the registrar does not require any
   authentication), the registrar MUST proceed with the registration.

   If the requester was not in the allowed list and the registrar
   requires the requester to authenticate, the registrar MUST check
   whether the packet also contains a CERT parameter.  If the packet
   does not contain a CERT parameter, the registrar MUST reject the
   registrations requiring authentication with Failure Type 0 (zero)
   (registration requires additional credentials).  If the certificate
   is valid and accepted (issued for the requester and signed by a
   trusted issuer), the registrar MUST proceed with the registration.
   If the certificate in the parameter is not accepted, the registrar
   MUST reject the corresponding registrations with the appropriate
   Failure Type:

   4  (Bad certificate): The certificate is corrupt, contains invalid
      signatures, etc.

   5  (Unsupported certificate): The certificate is of an unsupported
      type.

   6  (Certificate expired): The certificate is no longer valid.

   7  (Certificate other): The certificate could not be validated for
      some unspecified reason.

   8  (Unknown CA): The issuing certification authority (CA) certificate
      could not be located or is not trusted.

   After successful authorization, the registrar includes a REG_RESPONSE
   parameter in its response, which contains the service type(s) for
   which it has authorized registration, and zero or more REG_FAILED
   parameters containing the service type(s) for which it has not
   authorized registration or registration has failed for other reasons.
   This response can be either an R2 or an UPDATE message, respectively,
   depending on whether the registration was requested during the base

   exchange or using an existing association.  In particular, REG_FAILED
   with a Failure Type of zero indicates the service type(s) that
   requires further credentials for registration.

   If the registrar requires further authorization and the requester has
   additional credentials available, the requester SHOULD try to
   register again with the service after the HIP association has been
   established.

   Successful processing of a REG_RESPONSE parameter creates
   registration state at the requester.  In a similar manner, successful
   processing of a REG_REQUEST parameter creates registration state at
   the registrar and possibly at the service.  Both the requester and
   registrar can cancel a registration before it expires, if the
   services afforded by a registration are no longer needed by the
   requester or cannot be provided any longer by the registrar (for
   instance, because its configuration has changed).

   This section describes the format and processing of the new
   parameters introduced by the HIP Registration Extension.  The
   encoding of these new parameters conforms to the HIPv2 TLV format
   described in <a href="./rfc7401#section-5.2.1">Section 5.2.1 of RFC7401</a> [<a href="./rfc7401" title='"Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)"'>RFC7401</a>].

   The HIP registration uses an exponential encoding of registration
   lifetimes.

   The special value 0 (zero) of the lifetime field MUST be interpreted
   as representing a special lifetime duration of 0 (zero) seconds and
   is used to request and grant cancellation of a registration.

   The non-zero values of the lifetime field used throughout this
   document MUST be interpreted as an exponent value representing a
   lifetime duration of 2^((lifetime - 64)/8) seconds.

   This allows a compact encoding of 255 different lifetime durations
   (in addition to the special lifetime duration of zero seconds)
   ranging from 2^(63/8) seconds (i.e., ~4 ms) to 2^(191/8) seconds
   (i.e., ~178 days) into an 8-bit integer field.

   Registrars include the parameter in R1 packets in order to announce
   their registration capabilities.  The registrar SHOULD include the
   parameter in UPDATE packets when its service offering has changed.
   HIP_SIGNATURE_2 protects the parameter within the R1 packets.

   The registrar indicates the minimum and maximum registration lifetime

   A requester includes the REG_REQUEST parameter in I2 or UPDATE
   packets to register with a registrar's service(s).  If the
   REG_REQUEST parameter is in an UPDATE packet, the registrar MUST NOT
   modify the registrations of registration types that are not listed in
   the parameter.  Moreover, the requester MUST NOT include the
   parameter unless the registrar's R1 packet or latest received UPDATE
   packet has contained a REG_INFO parameter with the requested
   registration types.

   The requester MUST NOT include more than one REG_REQUEST parameter in
   its I2 or UPDATE packets, while the registrar MUST be able to process
   one or more REG_REQUEST parameters in received I2 or UPDATE packets.

   Failure Type 0 (zero) indicates that the registrar requires
   additional credentials to authorize a requester to register with the
   registration types listed in the parameter.  Failure Type 1 (one)
   indicates that the requested service type is unavailable at the
   registrar.  Failure Type 2 indicates that the registrar does not
   currently have enough resources to register the requester for the
   service(s); when that is the case, the requester MUST NOT reattempt
   immediately to register for the same service(s) and MAY attempt to
   contact another registrar to register for the service(s).  Failure
   Type 3 indicates that the registrar could not validate the
   certificate provided by the requester to register for the service(s);
   when that is the case, the requester MUST NOT reattempt to register
   for the same set of services while providing the same certificate and
   MAY attempt to register for the same set of services with a different
   certificate, or with a different set of services with the same
   certificate.

   The registrar SHOULD include a REG_FAILED parameter in its R2 or
   UPDATE packet, if registration with the registration types listed has
   not completed successfully, and a requester is asked to try again
   with additional credentials.

   HIP_SIGNATURE protects the parameter within the R2 and UPDATE
   packets.

   Establishing and/or maintaining a registration may require additional
   information not available in the transmitted REG_REQUEST or
   REG_RESPONSE parameters.  Therefore, registration type definitions
   MAY define dependencies for HIP parameters that are not defined in
   this document.  Their semantics are subject to the specific
   registration type specifications.

   The minimum lifetime both registrars and requesters MUST support is
   10 seconds, while they SHOULD support a maximum lifetime of 120
   seconds, at least.  These values define a baseline for the
   specification of services based on the registration system.  They
   were chosen to be neither too short nor too long, and to accommodate
   for existing timeouts of state established in middleboxes (e.g., NATs
   and firewalls.)

   A zero lifetime is reserved for canceling purposes.  Requesting a
   zero lifetime for a registration type is equal to canceling the
   registration of that type.  A requester MAY cancel a registration
   before it expires by sending a REG_REQ to the registrar with a zero
   lifetime.  A registrar SHOULD respond and grant a registration with a
   zero lifetime.  A registrar (and an attached service) MAY cancel a
   registration before it expires, at its own discretion.  However, if
   it does so, it SHOULD send a REG_RESPONSE with a zero lifetime to all
   registered requesters.

   This section discusses the threats on the HIP registration protocol
   and their implications on the overall security of HIP.  In
   particular, it argues that the extensions described in this document
   do not introduce additional threats to HIP.

   The extensions described in this document rely on the HIP base
   exchange and do not modify its security characteristics, e.g.,
   digital signatures or Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC).
   Hence, the only threat introduced by these extensions is related to
   the creation of soft registration state at the registrar.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8003">RFC 8003</a>               HIP Registration Extension           October 2016</span>


   Registrars act on a voluntary basis and are willing to accept being a
   Responder and then to create HIP associations with a number of
   potentially unknown hosts.  Because they have to store HIP
   association state anyway, adding a certain amount of time-limited HIP
   registration states should not introduce any serious additional
   threats, especially because HIP registrars may cancel registrations
   at any time at their own discretion, e.g., because of resource
   constraints during an attack.
