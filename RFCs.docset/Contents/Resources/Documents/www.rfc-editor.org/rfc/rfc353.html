NIC #10595                                                  12 June 1972

                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

   This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from May 22 to
   June 2.

   No testing was done on Memorial Day, which Massachusetts celebrated
   on May 29.  No testing was done on May 31 and June 1 due to an
   attempt to install the new IMP system.

   Three new terminal IMPs were installed during this interval.  On June
   1, Terminal IMP #155 was installed at Fort Belvoir in Fairfax,
   Virginia; on June 3, Terminal IMP #154 was installed at SAAC (Seismic
   Array Analysis Center) in Alexandria, Virginia; and on June 5,
   Terminal IMP #153 was installed at NOAA (National Oceanic Analysis
   Agency) in Boulder, Colorado.

   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These
   Hosts fall into two categories:

    1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as
       servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis
       for at least two weeks.  The only Host in this category is the
       PDP-10 at Case (Network address 13).

      2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included
       here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network
       (AMES, MITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, BELVOIR, and
       BBN*).  This category also includes the Network Control Center





   ___________
   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as
   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used
   to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

   statistics from the Network.  Finally, included among these Hosts are
   the following:

   period.
