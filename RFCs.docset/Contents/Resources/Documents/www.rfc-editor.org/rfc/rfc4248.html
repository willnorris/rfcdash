Abstract

   This document specifies the telnet Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme that was originally specified in <a href="./rfc1738">RFC 1738</a>.  The purpose of
   this document is to allow <a href="./rfc1738">RFC 1738</a> to be made obsolete while keeping
   the information about the scheme on standards track.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   URIs were previously defined in [<a href="./rfc2396" title='"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC2396</a>], which was updated by
   [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].  Those documents also specify how to define schemes for
   URIs.

   The first definition for many URI schemes appeared in [<a href="./rfc1738" title='"Uniform Resource Locators (URL)"'>RFC1738</a>].
   Because that document has been made obsolete, this document copies
   the telnet URI scheme from it to allow that material to remain on
   standards track.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Scheme%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Scheme Definition</span>

   The Telnet URL scheme is used to designate interactive services that
   may be accessed by the Telnet protocol [<a href="#ref-STD8" title='"Telnet Protocol Specification"'>STD8</a>].

   A telnet URL takes the form:

   telnet://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4248">RFC 4248</a>                 The telnet URI Scheme              October 2005</span>


   The final "/" character may be omitted.  If :&lt;port&gt; is omitted, the
   port defaults to 23.  The :&lt;password&gt; can be omitted, as well as the
   whole &lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt; part.  Few implementations handle the user
   name and password very well, if at all.

   This URL does not designate a data object, but rather an interactive
   service.  Remote interactive services vary widely in the means by
   which they allow remote logins; in practice, the &lt;user&gt; and
   &lt;password&gt; supplied are advisory only: clients accessing a telnet URL
   merely advise the user of the suggested username and password.

   Many RFCs have added various services to the Telnet protocol for
   better authentication, encryption of traffic, or both.  Those RFCs
   have not specified new URI schemes for Telnet to invoke those
   services (along the lines of "https" being a different URI scheme
   from "http").  Some modern telnet clients attempt to invoke those
   more-secure versions of Telnet when resolving a "telnet" URL.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
   [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].

   The Telnet protocol normally uses passwords in the clear for
   authentication, and normally offers no privacy.  In normal telnet,
   both the user's identity and their password are exposed without any
   protection; after that, the contents of the entire Telnet session is
   exposed without any protection.

   Many extensions have been made to Telnet to make it more secure in
   different ways.  In particular, [<a href="./rfc2941" title='"Telnet Authentication Option"'>RFC2941</a>] gives a framework based on
   a telnet option that many other security extensions have leveraged
   off of.  These extensions are certainly worthwhile methods for
   reducing the obvious problems with exposing the user's name,
   password, and plaintext of the session in the clear.

   Although some modern telnet clients attempt to invoke those more-
   secure versions of Telnet when resolving a "telnet" URL, other telnet
   clients do not, so a user cannot rely on this type of security unless
   it is explicitly enabled and the results of the security negotiation
   are checked.
