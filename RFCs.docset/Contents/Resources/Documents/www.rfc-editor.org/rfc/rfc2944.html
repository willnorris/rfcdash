Abstract

   This document specifies an authentication scheme for the Telnet
   protocol under the framework described in [<a href="./rfc2941" title='"Telnet Authentication Option"'>RFC2941</a>], using the Secure
   Remote Password Protocol (SRP) authentication mechanism.  The
   specific mechanism, SRP-SHA1, is described in [<a href="./rfc2945" title='"The SRP Authentication and Key Exchange System"'>RFC2945</a>].

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS &lt;authentication-type-pair&gt; AUTH IAC SE

      This command indicates that the client has supplied the
      username and is ready to receive that user's field parameters.
      There is no authentication information to be sent to the remote
      side of the connection yet.  This should only be sent after the
      IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME command has been issued.  If the
      modifier byte (second byte of the authentication-type-pair)
      has any bits other than AUTH_WHO_MASK or AUTH_HOW_MASK set,
      both bytes are included in the session key hash described later.
      This ensures that the authentication type pair was correctly
      negotiated, while maintaining backward-compatibility with existing
      software.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY &lt;authentication-type-pair&gt; PARAMS &lt;values
   of modulus, generator, and salt&gt; IAC SE

      This command is used to pass the three parameter values used
      in the exponentiation to the client.  These values are often
      called n, g, and s.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS &lt;authentication-type-pair&gt; EXP &lt;client's
   exponential residue&gt; IAC SE

      This command is used to pass the client's exponential residue,
      otherwise known as A, computed against the parameters exchanged
      earlier.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY &lt;authentication-type-pair&gt; CHALLENGE
   &lt;server's exponential residue&gt; IAC SE

      This command is used to pass the server's exponential residue,
      computed against the same parameters.  This quantity is actually
      the sum of two residues, i.e. g^x + g^b.  For details see [<a href="#ref-SRP" title='"The Secure Remote Password Protocol"'>SRP</a>]
      and [<a href="./rfc2945" title='"The SRP Authentication and Key Exchange System"'>RFC2945</a>].

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS &lt;authentication-type-pair&gt; RESPONSE
   &lt;response from client&gt; IAC SE

      This command gives the server proof of the client's authenticity
      with a 160-bit (20 byte) response.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2944">RFC 2944</a>               Telnet Authentication: SRP         September 2000</span>


   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY &lt;authentication-type-pair&gt; ACCEPT
   &lt;server's response&gt; IAC SE

      This command indicates that the authentication was successful.
      The server will construct its own proof of authenticity and
      include it as sub-option data.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY &lt;authentication-type-pair&gt; REJECT
   &lt;optional reason for rejection&gt; IAC SE

      This command indicates that the authentication was not successful,
      and if there is any more data in the sub-option, it is an ASCII
      text message of the reason for the rejection.

   For the PARAMS command, since three pieces of data are being
   transmitted, each parameter is preceded by a 16-bit (two byte) length
   specifier in network byte order.  The EXP commands do not have a
   count in front of the data because there is only one piece of data in
   that suboption.  The CHALLENGE, RESPONSE, and ACCEPT data also do not
   have a count because they are all fixed in size.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Implementation%20Rules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Implementation Rules</span>

   Currently, only AUTH_CLIENT_TO_SERVER mode is supported.  Although
   the SRP protocol effectively performs implicit mutual authentication
   as a result of the two-way proofs, only the AUTH_HOW_ONE_WAY
   authentication mode is currently defined.  The AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL
   setting is being reserved for an explicit mutual-authentication
   variant of the SRP protocol to be defined in future specifications.

   All large number data sent in the arguments of the PARAMS and EXP
   commands must be in network byte order, i.e. most significant byte
   first.  No padding is used.

   The SRP-SHA1 mechanism, as described in [<a href="./rfc2945" title='"The SRP Authentication and Key Exchange System"'>RFC2945</a>] generates a 40-byte
   session key, which allows implementations to use different keys for
   incoming and outgoing traffic, increasing the security of the
   encrypted session.  It is recommended that the Telnet ENCRYPT method,
   if it is used, be able to take advantage of the longer session keys.

   User "tjw" may wish to log in on machine "foo".  The client would
   send IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME "tjw" IAC SE IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS
   SRP AUTH IAC SE.  The server would look up the field and salt
   parameters for "tjw" from its password file and send them back to the
   client.  Client and server would then exchange exponential residues
   and calculate their session keys (after the client prompted "tjw" for

   his password).  Then, the client would send the server its proof that
   it knows the session key.  The server would either send back an
   ACCEPT or a REJECT.  If the server accepts authentication, it also
   sends its own proof that it knows the session key to the client.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   The ability to negotiate a common authentication mechanism between
   client and server is a feature of the authentication option that
   should be used with caution.  When the negotiation is performed, no
   authentication has yet occurred.  Therefore, each system has no way
   of knowing whether or not it is talking to the system it intends.  An
   intruder could attempt to negotiate the use of an authentication
   system which is either weak, or already compromised by the intruder.

   Since SRP relies on the security of the underlying public-key
   cryptosystem, the modulus "n" should be large enough to resist
   brute-force attack.  A length of at least 1024 bits is recommended,
   and implementations should reject attempts to use moduli that are
   shorter than 512 bits, or attempts to use invalid moduli and
   generator parameters (non-safe-prime "n" or non-primitive "g").

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>. IANA Considerations</span>

   The authentication type SRP and its associated suboption values are
   registered with IANA.  Any suboption values used to extend the
   protocol as described in this document must be registered with IANA
   before use.  IANA is instructed not to issue new suboption values
   without submission of documentation of their use.
