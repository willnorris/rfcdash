Abstract

   Although the use of the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Reason
   header field in responses is considered in general in <a href="./rfc3326">RFC 3326</a>, its
   use is not specified for any particular response code.  Nonetheless,
   existing deployments have been using Reason header fields to carry
   failure-related Q.850 cause codes in SIP responses to INVITE requests
   that have been gatewayed to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
   systems.  This document normatively describes the use of the Reason
   header field in carrying Q.850 cause codes in SIP responses.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6432">RFC 6432</a>                   Reason Header Field             November 2011</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Applicability</span>

   This document allows SIP responses to carry Reason header fields as
   follows:

      Any SIP Response message, with the exception of a 100 (Trying),
      MAY contain a Reason header field with a Q.850 [<a href="#ref-Q.850" title='"Usage of cause and location in the Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1 and the Signalling System No. 7 ISDN User Part"'>Q.850</a>] cause code.

      The Reason header field is not needed in the 100 (Trying)
      responses, since they are transmitted hop by hop, not end to end.
      SIP responses with Reason header fields carrying values other than
      Q.850 [<a href="#ref-Q.850" title='"Usage of cause and location in the Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1 and the Signalling System No. 7 ISDN User Part"'>Q.850</a>] cause codes are outside of the scope of this
      document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This specification allows the presence of the Reason header field
   containing Q.850 [<a href="#ref-Q.850" title='"Usage of cause and location in the Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1 and the Signalling System No. 7 ISDN User Part"'>Q.850</a>] cause codes in responses.  The presence of
   the Reason header field in a response does not affect the treatment
   of the response.  Nevertheless, there could be situations where a
   wrong Q.850 [<a href="#ref-Q.850" title='"Usage of cause and location in the Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1 and the Signalling System No. 7 ISDN User Part"'>Q.850</a>] cause code could, for example, cause an
   announcement system to play the wrong information.  To avoid such
   situations, it is RECOMMENDED that this header field be protected by
   a suitable integrity mechanism.  The use of transport- or network-
   layer hop-by-hop security mechanisms, such as Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) or IPsec with appropriate cipher suites, can satisfy
   this requirement.
