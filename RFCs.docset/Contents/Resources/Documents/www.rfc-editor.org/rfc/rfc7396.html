   This specification defines the JSON merge patch document format,
   processing rules, and associated MIME media type identifier.  The
   merge patch format is primarily intended for use with the HTTP PATCH
   method [<a href="./rfc5789" title='"PATCH Method for HTTP"'>RFC5789</a>] as a means of describing a set of modifications to a
   target resource's content.

   A JSON merge patch document describes changes to be made to a target
   JSON document using a syntax that closely mimics the document being
   modified.  Recipients of a merge patch document determine the exact
   set of changes being requested by comparing the content of the
   provided patch against the current content of the target document.
   If the provided merge patch contains members that do not appear
   within the target, those members are added.  If the target does
   contain the member, the value is replaced.  Null values in the merge
   patch are given special meaning to indicate the removal of existing
   values in the target.

   For example, given the following original JSON document:

   {
     "a": "b",
     "c": {
       "d": "e",
       "f": "g"
     }
   }

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7396">RFC 7396</a>                    JSON Merge Patch                October 2014</span>


   Changing the value of "a" and removing "f" can be achieved by
   sending:

   PATCH /target HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json

   {
     "a":"z",
     "c": {
       "f": null
     }
   }

   When applied to the target resource, the value of the "a" member is
   replaced with "z" and "f" is removed, leaving the remaining content
   untouched.

   This design means that merge patch documents are suitable for
   describing modifications to JSON documents that primarily use objects
   for their structure and do not make use of explicit null values.  The
   merge patch format is not appropriate for all JSON syntaxes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Processing%20Merge%20Patch%20Documents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Processing Merge Patch Documents</span>

   JSON merge patch documents describe, by example, a set of changes
   that are to be made to a target resource.  Recipients of merge patch
   documents are responsible for comparing the merge patch with the
   current content of the target resource to determine the specific set
   of change operations to be applied to the target.

   To apply the merge patch document to a target resource, the system
   realizes the effect of the following function, described in
   pseudocode.  For this description, the function is called MergePatch,
   and it takes two arguments: the target resource document and the
   merge patch document.  The Target argument can be any JSON value or
   undefined.  The Patch argument can be any JSON value.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7396">RFC 7396</a>                    JSON Merge Patch                October 2014</span>


   define MergePatch(Target, Patch):
     if Patch is an Object:
       if Target is not an Object:
         Target = {} # Ignore the contents and set it to an empty Object
       for each Name/Value pair in Patch:
         if Value is null:
           if Name exists in Target:
             remove the Name/Value pair from Target
         else:
           Target[Name] = MergePatch(Target[Name], Value)
       return Target
     else:
       return Patch

   There are a few things to note about the function.  If the patch is
   anything other than an object, the result will always be to replace
   the entire target with the entire patch.  Also, it is not possible to
   patch part of a target that is not an object, such as to replace just
   some of the values in an array.

   The MergePatch operation is defined to operate at the level of data
   items, not at the level of textual representation.  There is no
   expectation that the MergePatch operation will preserve features at
   the textual-representation level such as white space, member
   ordering, number precision beyond what is available in the target's
   implementation, and so forth.  In addition, even if the target
   implementation allows multiple name/value pairs with the same name,
   the result of the MergePatch operation on such objects is not
   defined.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Example</span>

   Given the following example JSON document:

   {
     "title": "Goodbye!",
     "author" : {
       "givenName" : "John",
       "familyName" : "Doe"
     },
     "tags":[ "example", "sample" ],
     "content": "This will be unchanged"
   }








<span class="grey">Hoffman &amp; Snell              Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>

   A user agent wishing to change the value of the "title" member from
   "Goodbye!" to the value "Hello!", add a new "phoneNumber" member,
   remove the "familyName" member from the "author" object, and replace
   the "tags" array so that it doesn't include the word "sample" would
   send the following request:

   PATCH /my/resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json

   {
     "title": "Hello!",
     "phoneNumber": "+01-123-456-7890",
     "author": {
       "familyName": null
     },
     "tags": [ "example" ]
   }

   The resulting JSON document would be:

   {
     "title": "Hello!",
     "author" : {
       "givenName" : "John"
     },
     "tags": [ "example" ],
     "content": "This will be unchanged",
     "phoneNumber": "+01-123-456-7890"
   }

   This specification registers the following additional MIME media
   types:

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: merge-patch+json

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: None

      Encoding considerations: Resources that use the "application/
      merge-patch+json" media type are required to conform to the
      "application/json" media type and are therefore subject to the
      same encoding considerations specified in <a href="./rfc7159#section-8">Section 8 of [RFC7159]</a>.

   The "application/merge-patch+json" media type allows user agents to
   indicate their intention for the server to determine the specific set
   of change operations to be applied to a target resource.  As such, it
   is the server's responsibility to determine the appropriateness of
   any given change as well as the user agent's authorization to request
   such changes.  How such determinations are made is considered out of
   the scope of this specification.

   All of the security considerations discussed in <a href="./rfc5789#section-5">Section 5 of
   [RFC5789]</a> apply to all uses of the HTTP PATCH method with the
   "application/merge-patch+json" media type.
