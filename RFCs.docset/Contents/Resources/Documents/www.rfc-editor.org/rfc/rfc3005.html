Abstract

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology
   through discussion of technical issues, and hosts discussions of IETF
   direction, policy, meetings, and procedures.  As this is the most
   general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed.
   Advertising, whether to solicit business or promote employment
   opportunities, falls well outside the range of acceptable topics, as
   do discussions of a personal nature.

Charter for the IETF Discussion List

   The IETF discussion list, ietf@ietf.org, serves two purposes.  It
   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology
   through discussion of technical issues.  It also hosts discussions of
   IETF direction, policy, meetings, and procedures.  As this is the
   most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed.
   Advertising, whether to solicit business or promote employment
   opportunities, falls well outside the range of acceptable topics, as
   do discussions of a personal nature.

   This list is meant for initial discussion only.  Discussions that
   fall within the area of any working group or well established list
   should be moved to such more specific forum as soon as this is
   pointed out, unless the issue is one for which the working group
   needs wider input or direction.

   In addition to the topics noted above, appropriate postings include:

    - Last Call discussions of proposed protocol actions
    - Discussion of technical issues that are candidates for IETF work,
      but do not yet have an appropriate e-mail venue
    - Discussion of IETF administrative policies
    - Questions and clarifications concerning IETF meetings
    - Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF.

   Inappropriate postings include:

    - Unsolicited bulk e-mail
    - Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,
      activities, or technical concerns
    - Unprofessional commentary, regardless of the general subject
    - Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF.

   The IETF Chair, the IETF Executive Director, or a sergeant-at-arms
   appointed by the Chair is empowered to restrict posting by a person,
   or of a thread, when the content is inappropriate and represents a
   pattern of abuse.  They are encouraged to take into account the
   overall nature of the postings by an individual and whether
   particular postings are an aberration or typical.  Complaints
   regarding their decisions should be referred to the IAB.
