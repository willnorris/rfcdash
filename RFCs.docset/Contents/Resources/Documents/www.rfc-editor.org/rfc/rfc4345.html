Abstract

   This document specifies methods of using the Arcfour cipher in the
   Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that mitigate the weakness of the
   cipher's key-scheduling algorithm.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Secure Shell (SSH) [<a href="./rfc4251" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>] is a secure remote-login protocol.  It
   allows for the use of an extensible variety of symmetric cipher
   algorithms to provide confidentiality for data in transit.  One of
   the algorithms specified in the base protocol is "arcfour", which
   specifies the use of Arcfour (also known as RC4), a fast stream
   cipher.  As [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] says, though, "Arcfour (and RC4) has problems
   with weak keys, and should be used with caution."  These problems are
   described in more detail in [<a href="#ref-MANTIN01" title='"Analysis of the Stream Cipher RC4"'>MANTIN01</a>], along with a recommendation
   to discard the first 1536 bytes of keystream so as to ensure that the
   cipher's internal state is thoroughly mixed.  This document specifies
   new cipher algorithms for SSH that follow this recommendation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Applicability%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Applicability Statement</span>

   Implementations of Arcfour are typically slightly faster and much
   smaller than those of any other encryption algorithm currently
   defined for SSH.  This must be balanced, though, against the known
   security problems with Arcfour described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  In most
   cases, where speed and code size are not critical issues, the
   algorithms specified by [<a href="./rfc4344" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Encryption Modes"'>RFC4344</a>] should be used instead.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Algorithm%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Algorithm Definitions</span>

   The "arcfour128" algorithm is the RC4 cipher, as described in
   [<a href="#ref-SCHNEIER" title='"Applied Cryptography Second Edition: protocols algorithms and source in code in C"'>SCHNEIER</a>], using a 128-bit key.  The first 1536 bytes of keystream
   generated by the cipher MUST be discarded, and the first byte of the
   first encrypted packet MUST be encrypted using the 1537th byte of
   keystream.

   The "arcfour256" algorithm is the same, but uses a 256-bit key.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations in [<a href="./rfc4251" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>] apply.

   The discarded bytes of keystream MUST be kept secret and MUST NOT be
   transmitted over the network.  The contents of these bytes could
   reveal information about the key.

   There are two classes of attack on Arcfour described in [<a href="#ref-MIRONOV" title='"(Not So) Random Shuffles of RC4"'>MIRONOV</a>].
   Strong distinguishers distinguish an Arcfour keystream from
   randomness at the start of the stream and are defended against by the
   algorithm defined in this document.  Weak distinguishers can operate
   on any part of the keystream, and the best ones, described in [<a href="#ref-FMcG" title='"Statistical Analysis of the Alleged RC4 Keystream Generator"'>FMcG</a>]
   and [<a href="#ref-MANTIN05" title='"Predicting and Distinguishing Attacks on RC4 Keystream Generator"'>MANTIN05</a>], can use data from multiple, different keystreams.  A
   consequence of this is that encrypting the same data (for instance, a
   password) sufficiently many times in separate Arcfour keystreams can
   be sufficient to leak information about it to an adversary.  It is
   thus RECOMMENDED that Arcfour (either in the form described here or
   that described in [<a href="./rfc4251" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>]) not be used for high-volume password-
   authenticated connections.

   The IANA has assigned the Encryption Algorithm Names "arcfour128" and
   "arcfour256" in accordance with [<a href="./rfc4250" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Assigned Numbers"'>RFC4250</a>].
