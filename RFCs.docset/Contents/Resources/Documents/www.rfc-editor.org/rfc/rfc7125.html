Abstract

   This document revises the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) Information Element as originally defined in <a href="./rfc5102">RFC 5102</a> to
   reflect changes to the TCP Flags header field since <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a>.

   Octets 12 and 13 (counting from zero) of the TCP header encode the
   data offset (header length) in 4 bits, as well as 12 bits of flags.
   The least significant 6 bits of these were defined in [<a href="./rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>] as
   URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN for TCP control.  Subsequently,
   [<a href="./rfc3168" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>RFC3168</a>] defined the CWR and ECE flags for Explicit Congestion
   Notification (ECN) negotiation and signaling; [<a href="./rfc3540" title='"Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signaling with Nonces"'>RFC3540</a>] additionally
   defined the NS flag for the ECN Nonce Sum.

   As defined in the IANA IPFIX Information Element Registry
   [<a href="#ref-IANA-IPFIX">IANA-IPFIX</a>], taken from [<a href="./rfc5102" title='"Information Model for IP Flow Information Export"'>RFC5102</a>], the tcpControlBits Information
   Element for IPFIX [<a href="./rfc7011" title='"Specification of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol for the Exchange of Flow Information"'>RFC7011</a>] only covers the original 6 bits from
   [<a href="./rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>].  To allow IPFIX to be used to measure the use of ECN, and
   to bring the IPFIX Information Element definition in line with the
   current definition of the TCP Flags header field, it is necessary to
   revise this definition.

   The revised definition of the Information Element in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> was
   developed and approved through the IE-DOCTORS process [<a href="./rfc7013" title='"Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers of IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Information Elements"'>RFC7013</a>] in
   August 2013.  <a href="./rfc7013#section-5.1">Section 5.1 of [RFC7013]</a> states "This process should
   not in any way be construed as allowing the IE-DOCTORS to overrule
   IETF consensus.  Specifically, Information Elements in the IANA
   Information Element registry that were added with IETF consensus
   require IETF consensus for revision or deprecation".  Since the
   tcpControlBits Information Element was originally defined in
   [<a href="./rfc5102" title='"Information Model for IP Flow Information Export"'>RFC5102</a>], an IETF Proposed Standard, any revision of this
   Information Element definition requires IETF Consensus.  The
   publication of this document fulfills that requirement.

   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> defines the revised tcpControlBits Information Element as
   in <a href="./rfc7013#section-9.1">Section 9.1 of [RFC7013]</a>.

   Description:  TCP control bits observed for the packets of this Flow.
      This information is encoded as a bit field; for each TCP control
      bit, there is a bit in this set.  The bit is set to 1 if any
      observed packet of this Flow has the corresponding TCP control bit
      set to 1.  The bit is cleared to 0 otherwise.

      The values of each bit are shown below, per the definition of the
      bits in the TCP header [<a href="./rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>] [<a href="./rfc3168" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>RFC3168</a>] [<a href="./rfc3540" title='"Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signaling with Nonces"'>RFC3540</a>]:

      As the most significant 4 bits of octets 12 and 13 (counting from
      zero) of the TCP header [<a href="./rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>] are used to encode the TCP data
      offset (header length), the corresponding bits in this Information
      Element MUST be exported as zero and MUST be ignored by the
      collector.  Use the tcpHeaderLength Information Element to encode
      this value.

      Each of the 3 bits (0x800, 0x400, and 0x200), which are reserved
      for future use in [<a href="./rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>], SHOULD be exported as observed in the
      TCP headers of the packets of this Flow.

      If exported as a single octet with reduced-size encoding, this
      Information Element covers the low-order octet of this field (i.e,
      bits 0x80 to 0x01), omitting the ECN Nonce Sum and the three
      Future Use bits.  A collector receiving this Information Element
      with reduced-size encoding must not assume anything about the
      content of these four bits.

      Exporting Processes exporting this Information Element on behalf
      of a Metering Process that is not capable of observing any of the
      ECN Nonce Sum or Future Use bits SHOULD use reduced-size encoding,
      and only export the least significant 8 bits of this Information
      Element.

      Note that previous revisions of this Information Element's
      definition specified that the CWR and ECE bits must be exported as
      zero, even if observed.  Collectors should therefore not assume
      that a value of zero for these bits in this Information Element
      indicates the bits were never set in the observed traffic,
      especially if these bits are zero in every Flow Record sent by a
      given exporter.

   IANA has updated the definition of the tcpControlBits Information
   Element in the IANA IPFIX Information Element Registry [<a href="#ref-IANA-IPFIX">IANA-IPFIX</a>]
   to reflect the changes in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> above, setting the revision to 1
   as noted, and the revision date to the date of publication of this
   document.

   This document changes the data type (and therefore the native size)
   of the tcpControlBits Information Element, from unsigned8 (1 octet)
   to unsigned16 (2 octets).  As Exporting and Collecting Processes use
   the Information Element Length field in Templates, Options Templates,
   and specifications for reduced-size encoding where appropriate, as
   opposed to abstract data type sizes, for encoding and decoding Data
   Records, it is not expected that this will have any impact on buffer
   sizing during encoding and decoding.  Otherwise, note that the
   security considerations for IPFIX [<a href="./rfc7011" title='"Specification of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol for the Exchange of Flow Information"'>RFC7011</a>] apply.
