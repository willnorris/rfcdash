           <span class="h1">Procedures for Maintaining the Time Zone Database</span>

Abstract

   Time zone information serves as a basic protocol element in
   protocols, such as the calendaring suite and DHCP.  The Time Zone
   (TZ) Database specifies the indices used in various protocols, as
   well as their semantic meanings, for all localities throughout the
   world.  This database has been meticulously maintained and
   distributed free of charge by a group of volunteers, coordinated by a
   single volunteer who is now planning to retire.  This memo specifies
   procedures involved with maintenance of the TZ database and
   associated code, including how to submit proposed updates, how
   decisions for inclusion of those updates are made, and the selection
   of a designated expert by and for the time zone community.  The
   intent of this memo is, to the extent possible, to document existing
   practice and provide a means to ease succession of the database
   maintainers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IETF has specified several standards that make use of time zone
   information.  Time zone names are used in DHCP to configure devices
   with correct local time [<a href="./rfc4833" title='"Timezone Options for DHCP"'>RFC4833</a>].  Time zone names can appear in the
   TZID field of calendaring VEVENTs [<a href="./rfc5545" title='"Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar)"'>RFC5545</a>].  The normative reference
   for these values is the TZ Database [<a href="#ref-TZDB" title='"Sources for Time Zone and Daylight Saving Time Data"'>TZDB</a>].  From the early 1980s
   through 2011, that database, which has been in use on nearly all UNIX
   systems, Java systems, and other sorts of systems, was hosted at the
   U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The database consists of
   both historic and current entries for geographies throughout the
   world.  Associated with the database is a reference implementation of
   ISO/IEC 9899 C [<a href="#ref-ISO9899C" title='"Information technology -- Programming languages -- C"'>ISO9899C</a>] and IEEE 1003.1 [<a href="#ref-IEEE1003.1" title='"Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) - Base Definitions"'>IEEE1003.1</a>] POSIX time
   functions that can be used to convert time values.

   The database was previously maintained by volunteers who participated
   in the &lt;tz@elsie.nci.nih.gov&gt; mailing list that was also hosted at
   the NIH.  The database itself is updated approximately twenty times
   per year, depending on the year, based on information these experts
   provide to the maintainer.  Arthur David Olson has maintained the
   database, coordinated the mailing list, and provided a release
   platform since the database's inception.  With his retirement now
   approaching, it is necessary to provide a means for this good work to
   continue.

   The time zone community has requested that the IETF adopt the ongoing
   maintenance of the Time Zone Database.  The time zone community would
   like the IETF to maintain it in a consistent fashion to its
   administration of the Internet protocol parameters and values.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority):  For purposes of this
      RFC, IANA is a role, not an organization.  The IANA Considerations
      defined in this RFC will be provided by the Internet Corporation
      for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in accordance with the
      IETF-ICANN "Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Technical Work
      of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority", which was signed and
      ratified in March of 2000[RFC2860].

   TZ Database:  The Time Zone Database, sometimes referred to as the
      "Olson Database".  This database consists of information about
      offsets from UTC for different localities, including daylight
      saving time (DST) transition information.

   TZ Coordinator:  The person or people who maintain and manage release
      of the TZ Database.  The TZ Coordinator also has responsibility
      for managing the TZ mailing list.  The TZ Coordinator is an IANA
      Designated Expert, as defined in <a href="./rfc5226#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of [RFC5226]</a>, except
      as regards to appeals, as discussed in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> of this document.
      Roughly speaking, this means that the IESG will choose one or more
      experts to manage the TZ database, code, and mailing list.  The TZ
      Coordinator will also lead work to develop appropriate service
      metrics.  There SHALL be a single lead individual and at least one
      backup individual for this function.

   TZ mailing list:  The forum where matters relating to the TZ database
      and supporting code are discussed.

   The rest of this document specifies the following:

   1.  Transferring and maintenance of the TZ mailing list;

   2.  Procedures for selecting a technical expert who will play the
       role of TZ Coordinator and release manager for the TZ database;

   3.  Procedures for updating the TZ database;

   4.  Maintenance and ownership of reference code; and

   5.  Ownership of the database.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20TZ%20Mailing%20List"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The TZ Mailing List</span>

   For many years, the TZ mailing list has been the forum where
   discussion of changes to the TZ database and support files would take
   place.  In addition, the TZ mailing list is used to announce releases
   of the database.  Currently, the TZ mailing list is administered by
   the TZ Coordinator.

   This list membership, formerly at the NIH, has been transitioned to
   the IANA mail server.  Its address, moving forward, is &lt;tz@iana.org&gt;.
   Subscriptions are processed at
   &lt;<a href="https://mm.icann.org/mailman/listinfo/tz/">https://mm.icann.org/mailman/listinfo/tz/</a>&gt;.  The TZ Coordinator will
   continue to manage the list.  While the TZ Coordinator may establish
   other rules of governance for the list, members of that list will be
   informed that a condition of participating on the list is that all
   contributions to the list are released to the public domain, and that
   by placing their contribution in the public domain, contributors
   waive forever any intellectual property claims.

   The list will be used just as it has been: to learn of, discuss, and
   confirm TZ definition changes, as well as to serve as an announcement
   list for new versions of the database.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Making%20Updates%20to%20the%20TZ%20Database"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Making Updates to the TZ Database</span>

   Updates to the TZ database are made by the TZ Coordinator in
   consultation with the TZ mailing list.  The TZ Coordinator is
   empowered to decide, as the designated expert, appropriate changes,
   but SHOULD take into account views expressed on the mailing list.

   The TZ Coordinator will also decide the timing of database releases.
   Today, the release itself consists of several archive files that are
   downloaded from a well-known location.

   Moving forward, the TZ database, supporting code, and any appropriate
   supporting information SHOULD be cryptographically signed prior to
   release using well known public keys, along with any appropriate
   supporting information and distributed from
   &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">http://www.iana.org/time-zones</a>&gt;.

   The criteria for updates to the database include the following:

   1.  New TZ names (e.g., locations) are only to be created when the
       scope of the region a name was envisioned to cover is no longer
       accurate.






<span class="grey">Lear &amp; Eggert             Best Current Practice                 [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6557">RFC 6557</a>           Maintaining the Time Zone Database      February 2012</span>


   2.  In order to correct historical inaccuracies, a new TZ name MAY be
       added when it is necessary to indicate what was the consensus
       view at a given time and location.  Such TZ names are usually not
       added when the inaccuracy was prior to 1970.

   3.  Changes to existing entries SHALL reflect the consensus on the
       ground in the region covered by that entry.

   To be clear, the TZ Coordinator SHALL NOT set time zone policy for a
   region but use judgment and whatever available sources exist to
   assess what the average person on street would think the time
   actually is, or in case of historical corrections, was.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Selecting%20or%20Replacing%20a%20TZ%20Coordinator"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Selecting or Replacing a TZ Coordinator</span>

   From time to time it will be necessary to appoint a new TZ
   Coordinator.  This could occur for a number of reasons:

   o  The TZ Coordinator is retiring (as Arthur David Olson is) or has
      announced that he or she will be unable to continue to perform the
      function;

   o  The TZ Coordinator is missing, has become incapacitated, or has
      died; or

   o  The TZ Coordinator is not performing the function in accordance
      with community wishes.

   In any of these cases, members of the community should raise the
   issue on the TZ mailing list and attempt to reach consensus on a new
   candidate to fulfill the role of TZ Coordinator.  If rough consensus
   cannot be reached easily, the Area Directors of the IETF Applications
   Area should attempt to guide the members of the community to rough
   consensus.  The candidate that is agreed upon by the community
   through rough consensus shall be presented to the IESG for
   confirmation.  If rough consensus cannot be reached, even with
   guidance from the Applications Area Directors, the IESG shall use
   whatever means it has at its disposal to choose a candidate who in
   its best judgment will be able to fulfill the role of TZ Coordinator.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Appealing%20Database%20Decisions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Appealing Database Decisions</span>

   The TZ Coordinator makes decisions based on expertise, as well as
   with guidance from the TZ mailing list.  If a member of the community
   has a concern with an individual decision made by the TZ Coordinator
   with regard to the TZ database, the individual shall proceed as
   follows:




<span class="grey">Lear &amp; Eggert             Best Current Practice                 [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6557">RFC 6557</a>           Maintaining the Time Zone Database      February 2012</span>


   1.  Attempt to resolve the concern directly with the TZ Coordinator.

   2.  If a resolution cannot be reached directly with the TZ
       Coordinator, express the concern to the community and attempt to
       achieve rough consensus regarding a resolution on the TZ mailing
       list.  The Area Directors of the IETF Applications Area may at
       their discretion attempt to guide the members of the community to
       rough consensus.

   3.  As a last resort, if a resolution cannot be reached on the TZ
       mailing list, appeal to the IESG for a resolution.  The appellant
       must show that the decision made by the TZ Coordinator (a) was
       materially in error and (b) has caused material harm.  In its
       deliberations regarding an appeal, the IESG shall weigh all the
       evidence presented to it and use its best judgment in determining
       a resolution.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Maintenance%20and%20Distribution%20of%20Reference%20Code"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Maintenance and Distribution of Reference Code</span>

   Currently, the maintainer of the TZ database also maintains reference
   code, most of which is public domain.  The reference implementation
   shall be distributed along with an associated cryptographic signature
   verifiable by a public key.  Several files from this software are
   currently distributed under license.  Where they exist, licenses
   SHALL NOT be changed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Database%20Ownership"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Database Ownership</span>

   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [<a href="./rfc5378" title='"Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust"'>RFC5378</a>] and 79 [<a href="./rfc3979" title='"Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology"'>RFC3979</a>] do not apply
   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.
   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
   contribution or in the TZ Database.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   This section documents the following IANA actions:

   o  Assistance on request of the IESG in selection of the TZ
      Coordinator, based on the procedures set forth above.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6557">RFC 6557</a>           Maintaining the Time Zone Database      February 2012</span>


   o  Maintenance of a repository for the TZ database and associated
      reference code.  The TZ Coordinator SHALL be named by the IESG as
      described above, and will act as the maintainer of the database
      and code, as described above.

   o  Creation of appropriate access for the TZ Coordinator to maintain
      the database, as well as necessary tooling that may be required,
      so long as no direct software costs are incurred.

   o  Establishment of security of the system upon which the database
      resides.  Both current and historical versions of the database
      will be stored and distributed via HTTP/HTTPS.

   o  Maintenance of a cryptographic private key that is used to sign
      the database and that will survive a change of TZ Coordinator.

   The distribution of the database is currently not secured.  This memo
   states that the TZ database SHOULD be distributed with a valid
   cryptographic signature moving forward.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.%20%20Acknowledgments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" id="section-10">10</a>.  Acknowledgments</span>
