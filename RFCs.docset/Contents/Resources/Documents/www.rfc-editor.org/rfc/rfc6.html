                        <span class="h1">CONVERSATION WITH BOB KAHN</span>





I talked with Bob Kahn at BB&amp;N yesterday.  We talked about code conversion
in the IMP's, IMP-HOST communication, and HOST software.

BB&amp;N is prepared to convert 6, 7, 8, or 9 bit character codes into 8-bit
ASCII for transmission and convert again upon assembly at the destination
IMP.  BB&amp;N plans a one for one conversion scheme with tables unique to the
HOST.  I suggested that places with 6-bit codes may also want case shifting.
Bob said this may result in overflow if too many case shifts are necessary.
I suggested that this is rare and we could probably live with an overflow
indication instead of a guarantee.

With respect to HOST-IMP communication, we now have a five bit link field
and a bit to indicate conversion.  Also possible is a 2-bit conversion
indicator, one for converting before sending and one for converting after.
This would allow another handle for checking or controlling the system.

The HOST can send messages or portions of a message to its IMP specifying

        1.  Tracing
        2.  Conversion
        3.  Whether message is for destination IMP or HOST
        4.  Send RFNM
        5.  HOST up or down
        6.  Synchronization
        7.  Format Error Messages
        8.  Master Link Clear
        9.  Status Requested

The IMP can send to its HOST information on

        1.  Conversion
        2.  REFNM Arrived
        3.  IMP up or down
        4.  Synchornization
        5.  Called HOST not Responding
        6.  Format Error
        7.  Status in IMP

I also summarized for Bob the contents of Network Notes l, 2, and 3.
