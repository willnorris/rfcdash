   This document defines a Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)
   extension whereby an SMTP client may indicate an authentication
   mechanism to the server, perform an authentication protocol exchange,
   optionally negotiate a security layer for subsequent protocol
   interactions during this session and, during a mail transaction,
   optionally specify a mailbox associated with the identity that
   submitted the message to the mail delivery system.

   This extension includes a profile of the Simple Authentication and
   Security Layer (SASL) for SMTP.

   When compared to <a href="./rfc2554">RFC 2554</a>, this document deprecates use of the 538
   response code, adds a new Enhanced Status Code, adds a requirement to
   support SASLprep profile for preparing authorization identities,
   recommends use of <a href="./rfc3848">RFC 3848</a> transmission types in the Received trace
   header field, and clarifies interaction with SMTP PIPELINING
   [<a href="#ref-PIPELINING" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Command Pipelining"'>PIPELINING</a>] extension.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORDS</a>].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server, respectively.

   1.  The name of this [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>] service extension is "Authentication".

   2.  The EHLO keyword value associated with this extension is "AUTH".

   3.  The AUTH EHLO keyword contains as a parameter a space-separated
       list of the names of available [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] mechanisms.  The list of
       available mechanisms MAY change after a successful STARTTLS
       command [<a href="#ref-SMTP-TLS" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security"'>SMTP-TLS</a>].

   4.  A new [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>] verb "AUTH" is defined.

   5.  An optional parameter using the keyword "AUTH" is added to the
       MAIL FROM command, and extends the maximum line length of the
       MAIL FROM command by 500 characters.

   6.  This extension is appropriate for the submission protocol
       [<a href="#ref-SUBMIT" title='"Message Submission for Mail"'>SUBMIT</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20AUTH%20Command"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The AUTH Command</span>

   AUTH mechanism [initial-response]

      Arguments:
          mechanism: A string identifying a [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] authentication
          mechanism.

          initial-response: An optional initial client response.  If
          present, this response MUST be encoded as described in <a href="#section-4">Section</a>
          <a href="#section-4">4</a> of [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>] or contain a single character "=".

      Restrictions:
          After an AUTH command has been successfully completed, no more
          AUTH commands may be issued in the same session.  After a
          successful AUTH command completes, a server MUST reject any
          further AUTH commands with a 503 reply.

          The AUTH command is not permitted during a mail transaction.
          An AUTH command issued during a mail transaction MUST be
          rejected with a 503 reply.

      Discussion:
          The AUTH command initiates a [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] authentication exchange
          between the client and the server.  The client identifies the
          SASL mechanism to use with the first parameter of the AUTH
          command.  If the server supports the requested authentication
          mechanism, it performs the SASL exchange to authenticate the

          user.  Optionally, it also negotiates a security layer for
          subsequent protocol interactions during this session.  If the
          requested authentication mechanism is invalid (e.g., is not
          supported or requires an encryption layer), the server rejects
          the AUTH command with a 504 reply.  If the server supports the
          [<a href="#ref-ESMTP-CODES" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes"'>ESMTP-CODES</a>] extension, it SHOULD return a 5.5.4 enhanced
          response code.

          The SASL authentication exchange consists of a series of
          server challenges and client responses that are specific to
          the chosen [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] mechanism.

          A server challenge is sent as a 334 reply with the text part
          containing the [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>] encoded string supplied by the SASL
          mechanism.  This challenge MUST NOT contain any text other
          than the BASE64 encoded challenge.

          A client response consists of a line containing a [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>]
          encoded string.  If the client wishes to cancel the
          authentication exchange, it issues a line with a single "*".
          If the server receives such a response, it MUST reject the
          AUTH command by sending a 501 reply.

          The optional initial response argument to the AUTH command is
          used to save a round-trip when using authentication mechanisms
          that support an initial client response.  If the initial
          response argument is omitted and the chosen mechanism requires
          an initial client response, the server MUST proceed as defined
          in Section 5.1 of [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>].  In SMTP, a server challenge that
          contains no data is defined as a 334 reply with no text part.
          Note that there is still a space following the reply code, so
          the complete response line is "334 ".

          Note that the AUTH command is still subject to the line length
          limitations defined in [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>].  If use of the initial response
          argument would cause the AUTH command to exceed this length,
          the client MUST NOT use the initial response parameter (and
          instead proceed as defined in Section 5.1 of [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>]).

          If the client is transmitting an initial response of zero
          length, it MUST instead transmit the response as a single
          equals sign ("=").  This indicates that the response is
          present, but contains no data.

          If the client uses an initial-response argument to the AUTH
          command with a SASL mechanism in which the client does not
          begin the authentication exchange, the server MUST reject the

          AUTH command with a 501 reply.  Servers using the enhanced
          status codes extension [<a href="#ref-ESMTP-CODES" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes"'>ESMTP-CODES</a>] SHOULD return an enhanced
          status code of 5.7.0 in this case.

          If the server cannot [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>] decode any client response, it
          MUST reject the AUTH command with a 501 reply (and an enhanced
          status code of 5.5.2).  If the client cannot BASE64 decode any
          of the server's challenges, it MUST cancel the authentication
          using the "*" response.  In particular, servers and clients
          MUST reject (and not ignore) any character not explicitly
          allowed by the BASE64 alphabet, and MUST reject any sequence
          of BASE64 characters that contains the pad character ('=')
          anywhere other than the end of the string (e.g., "=AAA" and
          "AAA=BBB" are not allowed).

          Note that these [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>] strings can be much longer than
          normal SMTP commands.  Clients and servers MUST be able to
          handle the maximum encoded size of challenges and responses
          generated by their supported authentication mechanisms.  This
          requirement is independent of any line length limitations the
          client or server may have in other parts of its protocol
          implementation.  (At the time of writing of this document,
          12288 octets is considered to be a sufficient line length
          limit for handling of deployed authentication mechanisms.)
          If, during an authentication exchange, the server receives a
          line that is longer than the server's authentication buffer,
          the server fails the AUTH command with the 500 reply.  Servers
          using the enhanced status codes extension [<a href="#ref-ESMTP-CODES" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes"'>ESMTP-CODES</a>] SHOULD
          return an enhanced status code of 5.5.6 in this case.

          The authorization identity generated by this [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] exchange
          is a "simple username" (in the sense defined in [<a href="#ref-SASLprep" title='"SASLprep: Stringprep Profile for User Names and Passwords"'>SASLprep</a>]),
          and both client and server SHOULD (*) use the [<a href="#ref-SASLprep" title='"SASLprep: Stringprep Profile for User Names and Passwords"'>SASLprep</a>]
          profile of the [<a href="#ref-StringPrep" title='"Preparation of Internationalized Strings ("'>StringPrep</a>] algorithm to prepare these names
          for transmission or comparison.  If preparation of the
          authorization identity fails or results in an empty string
          (unless it was transmitted as the empty string), the server
          MUST fail the authentication.

      (*) Note: Future revision of this specification may change this
      requirement to MUST.  Currently, the SHOULD is used in order to
      avoid breaking the majority of existing implementations.

   If the server is unable to authenticate the client, it SHOULD reject
   the AUTH command with a 535 reply unless a more specific error code
   is appropriate.  Should the client successfully complete the
   exchange, the SMTP server issues a 235 reply.  (Note that the SMTP
   protocol doesn't support the SASL feature of returning additional



<span class="grey">Siemborski &amp; Melnikov       Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4954">RFC 4954</a>       SMTP Service Extension for Authentication       July 2007</span>


   data with a successful outcome.)  These status codes, along with
   others defined by this extension, are discussed in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> of this
   document.

   If a security layer is negotiated during the SASL exchange, it takes
   effect for the client on the octet immediately following the CRLF
   that concludes the last response generated by the client.  For the
   server, it takes effect immediately following the CRLF of its success
   reply.

   When a security layer takes effect, the SMTP protocol is reset to the
   initial state (the state in SMTP after a server issues a 220 service
   ready greeting).  The server MUST discard any knowledge obtained from
   the client, such as the EHLO argument, which was not obtained from
   the SASL negotiation itself.  Likewise, the client MUST discard any
   knowledge obtained from the server, such as the list of SMTP service
   extensions, which was not obtained from the SASL negotiation itself.
   (Note that a client MAY compare the advertised SASL mechanisms before
   and after authentication in order to detect an active down-
   negotiation attack).

   The client SHOULD send an EHLO command as the first command after a
   successful SASL negotiation that results in the enabling of a
   security layer.

   When an entity (whether it is the client or the server end) is
   sending data, and both [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>TLS</a>] and SASL security layers are in effect,
   the TLS encoding MUST be applied after the SASL encoding, regardless
   of the order in which the layers were negotiated.

   The service name specified by this protocol's profile of SASL is
   "smtp".  This service name is also to be used for the [<a href="#ref-SUBMIT" title='"Message Submission for Mail"'>SUBMIT</a>]
   protocol.

   If an AUTH command fails, the client MAY proceed without
   authentication.  Alternatively, the client MAY try another
   authentication mechanism or present different credentials by issuing
   another AUTH

   Note: A server implementation MUST implement a configuration in which
   it does NOT permit any plaintext password mechanisms, unless either
   the STARTTLS [<a href="#ref-SMTP-TLS" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security"'>SMTP-TLS</a>] command has been negotiated or some other
   mechanism that protects the session from password snooping has been
   provided.  Server sites SHOULD NOT use any configuration which
   permits a plaintext password mechanism without such a protection
   mechanism against password snooping.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4954">RFC 4954</a>       SMTP Service Extension for Authentication       July 2007</span>


   To ensure interoperability, client and server implementations of this
   extension MUST implement the [<a href="#ref-PLAIN" title='"The PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"'>PLAIN</a>] SASL mechanism running over TLS
   [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>TLS</a>] [<a href="#ref-SMTP-TLS" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security"'>SMTP-TLS</a>].  See also <a href="#section-15">Section 15</a> for additional requirements on
   implementations of [<a href="#ref-PLAIN" title='"The PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"'>PLAIN</a>] over [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>TLS</a>].

   Note that many existing client and server implementations implement
   CRAM-MD5 [<a href="#ref-CRAM-MD5" title='"IMAP/POP AUTHorize Extension for Simple Challenge/Response"'>CRAM-MD5</a>] SASL mechanism.  In order to ensure
   interoperability with deployed software, new implementations MAY
   implement it; however, implementations should be aware that this SASL
   mechanism doesn't provide any server authentication.  Note that at
   the time of writing of this document the SASL Working Group is
   working on several replacement SASL mechanisms that provide server
   authentication and other features.

   When the AUTH command is used together with the [<a href="#ref-PIPELINING" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Command Pipelining"'>PIPELINING</a>]
   extension, it MUST be the last command in a pipelined group of
   commands.  The only exception to this rule is when the AUTH command
   contains an initial response for a SASL mechanism that allows the
   client to send data first, the SASL mechanism is known to complete in
   one round-trip, and a security layer is not negotiated by the client.
   Two examples of such SASL mechanisms are PLAIN [<a href="#ref-PLAIN" title='"The PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"'>PLAIN</a>] and EXTERNAL
   [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>. Examples</span>

   Here is an example of a client attempting AUTH using the [<a href="#ref-PLAIN" title='"The PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"'>PLAIN</a>] SASL
   mechanism under a TLS layer, and making use of the initial client
   response:

   S: 220-smtp.example.com ESMTP Server

   S: 250 AUTH GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5 PLAIN
   C: AUTH PLAIN dGVzdAB0ZXN0ADEyMzQ=
   S: 235 2.7.0 Authentication successful

   Here is another client that is attempting AUTH PLAIN under a TLS
   layer, this time without the initial response.  Parts of the
   negotiation before the TLS layer was established have been omitted:

   the client does not begin the authentication exchange, and includes a

   Here is an example of a client attempting AUTH EXTERNAL under TLS,

   client response).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20The%20AUTH%20Parameter%20to%20the%20MAIL%20FROM%20command"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  The AUTH Parameter to the MAIL FROM command</span>

   AUTH=mailbox

   Arguments:
        A &lt;mailbox&gt; (see Section 4.1.2 of [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>]) that is associated
        with the identity that submitted the message to the delivery
        system, or the two character sequence "&lt;&gt;" indicating such an
        identity is unknown or insufficiently authenticated.  To comply
        with restrictions imposed on ESMTP parameters, the &lt;mailbox&gt; is
        encoded inside an xtext.  The syntax of an xtext is described in
        Section 4 of [<a href="#ref-ESMTP-DSN" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"'>ESMTP-DSN</a>].

   Note:
        For the purposes of this discussion, "authenticated identity"
        refers to the identity (if any) derived from the authorization
        identity of previous AUTH command, while the terms "authorized
        identity" and "supplied &lt;mailbox&gt;" refer to the sender identity
        that is being associated with a particular message.  Note that
        one authenticated identity may be able to identify messages as
        being sent by any number of authorized identities within a
        single session.  For example, this may be the case when an SMTP
        server (one authenticated identity) is processing its queue
        (many messages with distinct authorized identities).

   Discussion:
        The optional AUTH parameter to the MAIL FROM command allows
        cooperating agents in a trusted environment to communicate the
        authorization identity associated with individual messages.

        If the server trusts the authenticated identity of the client to
        assert that the message was originally submitted by the supplied
        &lt;mailbox&gt;, then the server SHOULD supply the same &lt;mailbox&gt; in
        an AUTH parameter when relaying the message to any other server
        which supports the AUTH extension.

        For this reason, servers that advertise support for this
        extension MUST support the AUTH parameter to the MAIL FROM
        command even when the client has not authenticated itself to the
        server.

        A MAIL FROM parameter of AUTH=&lt;&gt; indicates that the original
        submitter of the message is not known.  The server MUST NOT
        treat the message as having been originally submitted by the
        authenticated identity that resulted from the AUTH command.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4954">RFC 4954</a>       SMTP Service Extension for Authentication       July 2007</span>


        If the AUTH parameter to the MAIL FROM command is not supplied,
        the client has authenticated, and the server believes the
        message is an original submission, the server MAY generate a
        &lt;mailbox&gt; from the user's authenticated identity for use in an
        AUTH parameter when relaying the message to any server which
        supports the AUTH extension.  The generated &lt;mailbox&gt; is
        implementation specific, but it MUST conform to the syntax of
        [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>].  If the implementation cannot generate a valid
        &lt;mailbox&gt;, it MUST transmit AUTH=&lt;&gt; when relaying this message.

        If the server does not sufficiently trust the authenticated
        identity of the client, or if the client is not authenticated,
        then the server MUST behave as if the AUTH=&lt;&gt; parameter was
        supplied.  The server MAY, however, write the value of any
        supplied AUTH parameter to a log file.

        If an AUTH=&lt;&gt; parameter was supplied, either explicitly or due
        to the requirement in the previous paragraph, then the server
        MUST supply the AUTH=&lt;&gt; parameter when relaying the message to
        any server which it has authenticated to using the AUTH
        extension.

        A server MAY treat expansion of a mailing list as a new
        submission, setting the AUTH parameter to the mailing list
        address or mailing list administration address when relaying the
        message to list subscribers.

        Note that an implementation which is hard-coded to treat all
        clients as being insufficiently trusted is compliant with this
        specification.  In that case, the implementation does nothing
        more than parse and discard syntactically valid AUTH parameters
        to the MAIL FROM command, and supply AUTH=&lt;&gt; parameters to any
        servers that it authenticates to.

   The following error codes may be used to indicate various success or
   failure conditions.  Servers that return enhanced status codes
   [<a href="#ref-ESMTP-CODES" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes"'>ESMTP-CODES</a>] SHOULD use the enhanced codes suggested here.

   235 2.7.0  Authentication Succeeded

   This response to the AUTH command indicates that the authentication
   was successful.

   432 4.7.12  A password transition is needed

   This response to the AUTH command indicates that the user needs to
   transition to the selected authentication mechanism.  This is
   typically done by authenticating once using the [<a href="#ref-PLAIN" title='"The PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"'>PLAIN</a>]
   authentication mechanism.  The selected mechanism SHOULD then work
   for authentications in subsequent sessions.

   454 4.7.0  Temporary authentication failure

   This response to the AUTH command indicates that the authentication
   failed due to a temporary server failure.  The client SHOULD NOT
   prompt the user for another password in this case, and should instead
   notify the user of server failure.

   534 5.7.9  Authentication mechanism is too weak

   This response to the AUTH command indicates that the selected
   authentication mechanism is weaker than server policy permits for
   that user.  The client SHOULD retry with a new authentication
   mechanism.

   535 5.7.8  Authentication credentials invalid

   This response to the AUTH command indicates that the authentication
   failed due to invalid or insufficient authentication credentials.  In
   this case, the client SHOULD ask the user to supply new credentials
   (such as by presenting a password dialog box).

   500 5.5.6  Authentication Exchange line is too long

   This response to the AUTH command indicates that the authentication
   failed due to the client sending a [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>] response that is longer
   than the maximum buffer size available for the currently selected
   SASL mechanism.

   530 5.7.0  Authentication required

   This response SHOULD be returned by any command other than AUTH,
   EHLO, HELO, NOOP, RSET, or QUIT when server policy requires
   authentication in order to perform the requested action and
   authentication is not currently in force.

   538 5.7.11  Encryption required for requested authentication
               mechanism

   This response to the AUTH command indicates that the selected
   authentication mechanism may only be used when the underlying SMTP
   connection is encrypted.  Note that this response code is documented
   here for historical purposes only.  Modern implementations SHOULD NOT
   advertise mechanisms that are not permitted due to lack of
   encryption, unless an encryption layer of sufficient strength is
   currently being employed.

   This document adds several new enhanced status codes to the list
   defined in [<a href="#ref-ENHANCED" title='"Enhanced Mail System Status Codes"'>ENHANCED</a>]:

   The following 3 Enhanced Status Codes were defined above:

       5.7.8 Authentication credentials invalid
       5.7.9 Authentication mechanism is too weak
       5.7.11 Encryption required for requested authentication mechanism

   X.5.6     Authentication Exchange line is too long

   This enhanced status code SHOULD be returned when the server fails
   the AUTH command due to the client sending a [<a href="#ref-BASE64" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>BASE64</a>] response which
   is longer than the maximum buffer size available for the currently
   selected SASL mechanism.  This is useful for both permanent and
   persistent transient errors.

   As described in Section 4.4 of [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>], an SMTP server that receives a
   message for delivery or further processing MUST insert the
   "Received:" header field at the beginning of the message content.
   This document places additional requirements on the content of a
   generated "Received:" header field.  Upon successful authentication,
   a server SHOULD use the "ESMTPA" or the "ESMTPSA" [<a href="#ref-SMTP-TT" title='"ESMTP and LMTP Transmission Types Registration"'>SMTP-TT</a>] (when
   appropriate) keyword in the "with" clause of the Received header
   field.

   Security issues are discussed throughout this memo.

   If a client uses this extension to get an encrypted tunnel through an
   insecure network to a cooperating server, it needs to be configured
   to never send mail to that server when the connection is not mutually
   authenticated and encrypted.  Otherwise, an attacker could steal the
   client's mail by hijacking the [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>] connection and either
   pretending the server does not support the Authentication extension
   or causing all AUTH commands to fail.

   Before the [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] negotiation has begun, any protocol interactions
   are performed in the clear and may be modified by an active attacker.
   For this reason, clients and servers MUST discard any knowledge
   obtained prior to the start of the SASL negotiation upon the
   establishment of a security layer.

   This mechanism does not protect the TCP port, so an active attacker
   may redirect a relay connection attempt (i.e., a connection between
   two Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs)) to the submission port [<a href="#ref-SUBMIT" title='"Message Submission for Mail"'>SUBMIT</a>].
   The AUTH=&lt;&gt; parameter prevents such an attack from causing a relayed
   message and, in the absence of other envelope authentication, from
   picking up the authentication of the relay client.

   A message submission client may require the user to authenticate
   whenever a suitable [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] mechanism is advertised.  Therefore, it
   may not be desirable for a submission server [<a href="#ref-SUBMIT" title='"Message Submission for Mail"'>SUBMIT</a>] to advertise a
   SASL mechanism when use of that mechanism grants the clients no
   benefits over anonymous submission.

   Servers MAY implement a policy whereby the connection is dropped
   after a number of failed authentication attempts.  If they do so,
   they SHOULD NOT drop the connection until at least 3 attempts to
   authenticate have failed.

   If an implementation supports SASL mechanisms that are vulnerable to
   passive eavesdropping attacks (such as [<a href="#ref-PLAIN" title='"The PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"'>PLAIN</a>]), then the
   implementation MUST support at least one configuration where these
   SASL mechanisms are not advertised or used without the presence of an
   external security layer such as [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>TLS</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4954">RFC 4954</a>       SMTP Service Extension for Authentication       July 2007</span>


   This extension is not intended to replace or be used instead of end-
   to-end message signature and encryption systems such as [S/MIME] or
   [<a href="#ref-PGP" title='"MIME Security with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)"'>PGP</a>].  This extension addresses a different problem than end-to-end
   systems; it has the following key differences:

   1.  It is generally useful only within a trusted enclave.

   2.  It protects the entire envelope of a message, not just the
       message's body.

   3.  It authenticates the message submission, not authorship of the
       message content.

   4.  When mutual authentication is used along with a security layer,
       it can give the sender some assurance that the message was
       successfully delivered to the next hop.

   Additional security considerations are mentioned in the [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>]

   This section is normative for SMTP implementations that support SASL
   [<a href="#ref-PLAIN" title='"The PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"'>PLAIN</a>] over [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>TLS</a>].

   If an SMTP client is willing to use SASL PLAIN over TLS to
   authenticate to the SMTP server, the client verifies the server
   certificate according to the rules of [<a href="#ref-X509" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>X509</a>].  If the server has not
   provided any certificate, or if the certificate verification fails,
   the client MUST NOT attempt to authenticate using the SASL PLAIN
   mechanism.

   After a successful [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>TLS</a>] negotiation, the client MUST check its
   understanding of the server hostname against the server's identity as
   presented in the server Certificate message, in order to prevent
   man-in-the-middle attacks.  If the match fails, the client MUST NOT
   attempt to authenticate using the SASL PLAIN mechanism.  Matching is
   performed according to the following rules:

        The client MUST use the server hostname it used to open the
        connection as the value to compare against the server name as
        expressed in the server certificate.  The client MUST NOT use

        any form of the server hostname derived from an insecure remote
        source (e.g., insecure DNS lookup).  CNAME canonicalization is
        not done.

        If a subjectAltName extension of type dNSName is present in the
        certificate, it SHOULD be used as the source of the server's
        identity.

        Matching is case-insensitive.

        A "*" wildcard character MAY be used as the leftmost name
        component in the certificate.  For example, *.example.com would
        match a.example.com, foo.example.com, etc., but would not match
        example.com.

        If the certificate contains multiple names (e.g., more than one
        dNSName field), then a match with any one of the fields is
        considered acceptable.

   1.  Clarified that servers MUST support the use of the AUTH=mailbox
       parameter to MAIL FROM, even when the client is not
       authenticated.

   2.  Clarified the initial-client-send requirements, and give
       additional examples.

   3.  Updated references to newer versions of various specifications.

   4.  Required SASL PLAIN (over TLS) as mandatory-to-implement.

   5.  Clarified that the mechanism list can change.

   6.  Deprecated the use of the 538 response code.

   7.  Added the use of the SASLprep profile for preparing authorization
       identities.

   8.  Substantial cleanup of response codes and indicated suggested
       enhanced response codes.  Also indicated what response codes
       should result in a client prompting the user for new credentials.

   9.  Updated ABNF section to use <a href="./rfc4234">RFC 4234</a>.

   10. Clarified interaction with SMTP PIPELINING extension.

   11. Added a reference to <a href="./rfc3848">RFC 3848</a>.
