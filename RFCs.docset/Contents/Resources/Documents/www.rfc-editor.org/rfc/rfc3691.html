        <span class="h1">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) UNSELECT command</span>

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document defines an UNSELECT command that can be used to close
   the current mailbox in an Internet Message Access Protocol - version
   4 (IMAP4) session without expunging it.  Certain types of IMAP
   clients need to release resources associated with the selected
   mailbox without selecting a different mailbox.  While IMAP4 provides
   this functionality (via a SELECT command with a nonexistent mailbox
   name or reselecting the same mailbox with EXAMINE command), a more
   clean solution is desirable.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3691">RFC 3691</a>                 IMAP UNSELECT command             February 2004</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Certain types of IMAP clients need to release resources associated
   with the selected mailbox without selecting a different mailbox.
   While [<a href="#ref-IMAP4" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol - Version 4rev1"'>IMAP4</a>] provides this functionality (via a SELECT command with
   a nonexistent mailbox name or reselecting the same mailbox with
   EXAMINE command), a more clean solution is desirable.

   [<a id="ref-IMAP4">IMAP4</a>] defines the CLOSE command that closes the selected mailbox as
   well as permanently removes all messages with the \Deleted flag set.

   However [<a href="#ref-IMAP4" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol - Version 4rev1"'>IMAP4</a>] lacks a command that simply closes the mailbox
   without expunging it.  This document defines the UNSELECT command for
   this purpose.

   A server which supports this extension indicates this with a
   capability name of "UNSELECT".

   "C:" and "S:" in examples show lines sent by the client and server
   respectively.

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in
   this document when typed in uppercase are to be interpreted as
   defined in "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"
   [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORDS</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20UNSELECT%20Command"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  UNSELECT Command</span>

   Arguments:  none

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command

   Result:     OK - unselect completed, now in authenticated state
               BAD - no mailbox selected, or argument supplied but
                     none permitted

      The UNSELECT command frees server's resources associated with the
      selected mailbox and returns the server to the authenticated
      state.  This command performs the same actions as CLOSE, except
      that no messages are permanently removed from the currently
      selected mailbox.

   Example:    C: A341 UNSELECT
               S: A341 OK Unselect completed

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   It is believed that this extension doesn't raise any additional
   security concerns not already discussed in [<a href="#ref-IMAP4" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol - Version 4rev1"'>IMAP4</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Formal%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Formal Syntax</span>

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [<a href="#ref-ABNF" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>ABNF</a>].  Non-terminals
   referenced but not defined below are as defined by [<a href="#ref-IMAP4" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol - Version 4rev1"'>IMAP4</a>].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

   command-select  /= "UNSELECT"

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   at:

      <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities">http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities</a>

   This document defines the UNSELECT IMAP capabilities.  IANA has added
   this capability to the registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Acknowledgments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Acknowledgments</span>

   UNSELECT command was originally implemented by Tim Showalter in Cyrus
   IMAP server.

   Also, the author of the document would like to thank Vladimir Butenko
   and Mark Crispin for reminding that UNSELECT has to be documented.
   Also thanks to Simon Josefsson for pointing out that there are
   multiple ways to implement UNSELECT.
