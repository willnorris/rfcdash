   "Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules" [<a href="./rfc5575" title='"Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules"'>RFC5575</a>], commonly known
   as BGP Flowspec, provided for a BGP Extended Community [<a href="./rfc4360" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>] that
   served to redirect traffic to a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)
   instance that matched the flow specification's Network Layer
   Reachability Information (NLRI).  In <a href="./rfc5575">RFC 5575</a>, the Redirect Extended
   Community was documented as follows:

   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   : | type   | extended community | encoding                 |
   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   : | 0x8008 | redirect           | 6-byte Route Target      |
   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   :
   : [...]
   :
   : Redirect:  The redirect extended community allows the traffic to be
   : redirected to a VRF routing instance that lists the specified
   : route-target in its import policy.  If several local instances
   : match this criteria, the choice between them is a local matter
   : (for example, the instance with the lowest Route Distinguisher
   : value can be elected).  This extended community uses the same
   : encoding as the Route Target extended community [<a href="./rfc4360" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>].
   : [...]
   :
   : 11. IANA Considerations
   : [...]
   :
   : The following traffic filtering flow specification rules have been
   : allocated by IANA from the "BGP Extended Communities Type -
   : Experimental Use" registry as follows:
   : [...]
   :
   : 0x8008 - Flow spec redirect

   The IANA registry of BGP Extended Communities clearly identifies
   communities of specific formats.  For example, "Two-octet AS Specific
   Extended Community" [<a href="./rfc4360" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>], "Four-octet AS Specific Extended
   Community" [<a href="./rfc5668" title='"4-Octet AS Specific BGP Extended Community"'>RFC5668</a>], and "IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community"
   [<a href="./rfc4360" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>].  Route Targets [<a href="./rfc4360" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>] identify this format in the high-
   order (Type) octet of the Extended Community and set the value of the
   low-order (Sub-Type) octet to 0x02.  The Value field of the Route
   Target Extended Community is intended to be interpreted in the
   context of its format.






<span class="grey">Haas                         Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7674">RFC 7674</a>          Flowspec Redirect Extended Community      October 2015</span>


   Since the Redirect Extended Community only registered a single
   codepoint in IANA's BGP Extended Community registry, a common
   interpretation of the Redirect Extended Community's "6-byte Route
   Target" has been to look, at a receiving router, for a Route Target
   value that matches the Route Target value in the received Redirect
   Extended Community and import the advertised route to the
   corresponding VRF instance subject to the rules defined in [<a href="./rfc5575" title='"Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules"'>RFC5575</a>].
   However, because the Route Target format in the Redirect Extended
   Community is not clearly defined, the wrong match may occur.

   This "value wildcard" matching behavior, which does not take into
   account the format of the Route Target defined for a local VRF and
   may result in the wrong matching decision, does not match deployed
   implementations of BGP Flowspec.  Deployed implementations of BGP
   Flowspec solve this problem by defining different Redirect Extended
   Communities that are specific to the format of the Route Target
   value.  This document defines the following Redirect Extended
   Communities:

   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+
   | type   | extended community | encoding                            |
   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+
   | 0x8008 | redirect AS-2byte  | 2-octet AS, 4-octet Value           |
   | 0x8108 | redirect IPv4      | 4-octet IPv4 Address, 2-octet Value |
   | 0x8208 | redirect AS-4byte  | 4-octet AS, 2-octet Value           |
   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+

   It should be noted that the low-order nibble of the Redirect's Type
   field corresponds to the Route Target Extended Community format field
   (Type).  (See Sections <a href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>, <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>, and <a href="#section-4">4</a> of [<a href="./rfc4360" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>] plus <a href="./rfc5668#section-2">Section 2 of
   [RFC5668]</a>.)  The low-order octet (Sub-Type) of the Redirect Extended
   Community remains 0x08, in contrast to 0x02 for Route Targets.

   The IANA registries for the BGP Extended Communities document
   [<a href="./rfc7153" title='"IANA Registries for BGP Extended Communities"'>RFC7153</a>] was written to update the previously mentioned IANA
   registries to better document BGP Extended Community formats.  The
   IANA Considerations section below further amends those registry
   updates in order to properly document the Flowspec redirect
   communities.

   IANA has updated the "BGP Transitive Extended Community Types"
   registry as follows:

   0x81 -  Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community Part 2
           (Sub-Types are defined in the "Generic Transitive
           Experimental Extended Community Part 2 Sub-Types" Registry)

   the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Extended Communities" registry and
   contains the following note:

      This registry contains values of the second octet (the "Sub-Type"
      field) of an extended community when the value of the first octet
      (the "Type" field) is 0x81.

   This document introduces no additional security considerations than
   those already covered in [<a href="./rfc5575" title='"Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules"'>RFC5575</a>].  It should be noted that if the
   wildcard behavior were actually implemented, this ambiguity may lead
   to the installation of Flowspec rules in an incorrect VRF and may
   lead to traffic to be incorrectly delivered.
