Abstract

   Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite), defined in <a href="./rfc6333">RFC 6333</a>, directs IANA to
   reserve 192.0.0.0/29 for the Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) element.
   Per this memo, IANA has generalized that reservation to include other
   cases where a non-routed IPv4 interface must be numbered as part of
   an IPv6 transition solution.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   DS-Lite [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>] directs IANA to reserve 192.0.0.0/29 for the Basic
   Bridging BroadBand (B4) element.  This memo generalizes that IANA
   reservation to include other cases where a non-routed IPv4 interface
   must be numbered in an IPv6 transition solution.  IANA has listed the
   address block 192.0.0.0/29 reserved for IPv4 Service Continuity
   Prefix.  The result is that 192.0.0.0/29 may be used in any system
   that requires IPv4 addresses for backward compatibility with IPv4
   communications in an IPv6-only network but does not emit IPv4 packets
   "on the wire".

   This generalization does not impact the use of the IPv4 Service
   Continuity Prefix in a DS-Lite context.

   464XLAT [<a href="./rfc6877" title='"464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation"'>RFC6877</a>] describes an architecture for providing IPv4
   communication over an IPv6-only access network.  One of the methods
   described in [<a href="./rfc6877" title='"464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation"'>RFC6877</a>] is for the customer-side translator (CLAT) to
   be embedded in the host, such as a smartphone or a CPE (Customer
   Premises Equipment).  In such scenarios, the host must have an IPv4
   address configured to present to the host network stack and for
   applications to bind IPv4 sockets.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Choosing%20192.0.0.0%2F29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Choosing 192.0.0.0/29</span>

   To avoid conflicts with any other network that may communicate with
   the CLAT or other IPv6 transition solution, a locally unique IPv4
   address must be assigned.

   IANA has defined a well-known range, 192.0.0.0/29, in [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>],
   which is dedicated for DS-Lite.  As defined in [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>], this subnet
   is only present between the B4 and the Address Family Transition
   Router (AFTR) and never emits packets from this prefix "on the wire".
   464XLAT has the same need for a non-routed IPv4 prefix, and this same
   need may be common for other similar solutions.  It is most prudent
   and effective to generalize 192.0.0.0/29 for the use of supporting
   IPv4 interfaces in IPv6 transition technologies rather than reserving
   a prefix for every possible solution.

   With this memo, 192.0.0.0/29 is now generalized across multiple IPv4
   continuity solutions such as 464XLAT and DS-Lite.  A host MUST NOT
   enable two active IPv4 continuity solutions simultaneously in a way
   that would cause a node to have overlapping 192.0.0.0/29 address
   space.

   There are no new security considerations beyond what is described
   [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>] and [<a href="./rfc6877" title='"464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation"'>RFC6877</a>].

   IANA has updated the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry available
