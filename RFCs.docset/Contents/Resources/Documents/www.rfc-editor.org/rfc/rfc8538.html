         <span class="h1">Notification Message Support for BGP Graceful Restart</span>

Abstract

   The BGP Graceful Restart mechanism defined in <a href="./rfc4724">RFC 4724</a> limits the
   usage of BGP Graceful Restart to BGP messages other than BGP
   NOTIFICATION messages.  This document updates <a href="./rfc4724">RFC 4724</a> by defining an
   extension that permits the Graceful Restart procedures to be
   performed when the BGP speaker receives a BGP NOTIFICATION message or
   the Hold Time expires.  This document also defines a new subcode for
   BGP Cease NOTIFICATION messages; this new subcode requests a full
   session restart instead of a Graceful Restart.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8538">RFC 8538</a>             Notification Support for BGP GR          March 2019</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   For many classes of errors, BGP must send a NOTIFICATION message and
   reset the peering session to handle the error condition.  The BGP
   Graceful Restart mechanism defined in [<a href="./rfc4724" title='"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"'>RFC4724</a>] requires that normal
   BGP procedures defined in [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] be followed when a NOTIFICATION
   message is sent or received.  This document defines an extension to
   BGP Graceful Restart that permits the Graceful Restart procedures to
   be performed when the BGP speaker receives a NOTIFICATION message or
   the Hold Time expires.  This permits the BGP speaker to avoid
   flapping reachability and continue forwarding while the BGP speaker
   restarts the session to handle errors detected in BGP.

   At a high level, this document can be summed up as follows.  When a
   BGP session is reset, both speakers operate as "Receiving Speakers"
   according to [<a href="./rfc4724" title='"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"'>RFC4724</a>], meaning they retain each other's routes.
   This is also true for HOLDTIME expiration.  The functionality can be
   defeated by sending a BGP Cease NOTIFICATION message with the Hard
   Reset subcode.  If a Hard Reset is used, a full session reset is
   performed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Requirements%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Requirements Language</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Modifications%20to%20BGP%20Graceful%20Restart%20Capability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Modifications to BGP Graceful Restart Capability</span>

   The BGP Graceful Restart Capability is augmented to signal the
   Graceful Restart support for BGP NOTIFICATION messages.  The Restart
   Flags field is augmented as follows (following the diagram in
   <a href="./rfc4724#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC4724]</a>).

   Restart Flags:

         This field contains bit flags relating to restart.

                0 1 2 3
               +-+-+-+-+
               |R|N|   |
               +-+-+-+-+

   The most significant bit is defined in [<a href="./rfc4724" title='"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"'>RFC4724</a>] as the Restart State
   ("R") bit.




<span class="grey">Patel, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8538">RFC 8538</a>             Notification Support for BGP GR          March 2019</span>


   The second most significant bit is defined in this document as the
   Graceful Notification ("N") bit.  It is used to indicate Graceful
   Restart support for BGP NOTIFICATION messages.  A BGP speaker
   indicates support for the procedures in this document by advertising
   a Graceful Restart Capability with its "N" bit set (value 1).

   If a BGP speaker that previously advertised a given set of Graceful
   Restart parameters opens a new session with a different set of
   parameters, these new parameters apply once the session has
   transitioned into ESTABLISHED state.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20BGP%20Hard%20Reset%20Subcode"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  BGP Hard Reset Subcode</span>

   This document defines a new subcode for BGP Cease NOTIFICATION
   messages, called the Hard Reset subcode.  The value of this subcode
   is discussed in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.  In this document, a BGP Cease
   NOTIFICATION message with the Hard Reset subcode is referred to as a
   "Hard Reset message" or simply as a "Hard Reset".

   When the "N" bit has been exchanged by two peers, NOTIFICATION
   messages other than Hard Reset messages are referred to as
   "Graceful", since such messages invoke Graceful Restart semantics.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Sending%20a%20Hard%20Reset"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Sending a Hard Reset</span>

   When the "N" bit has been exchanged, a Hard Reset message is used to
   indicate to the peer that the session is to be fully terminated.

   When sending a Hard Reset, the data portion of the NOTIFICATION
   message is encoded as follows:

       +--------+--------+--------
       | ErrCode| Subcode| Data
       +--------+--------+--------

   ErrCode is a BGP Error Code (as documented in the IANA "BGP Error
   (Notification) Codes" registry) that indicates the reason for the
   Hard Reset.  Subcode is a BGP Error Subcode (as documented in the
   IANA "BGP Error Subcodes" registry) as appropriate for the ErrCode.
   Similarly, Data is as appropriate for the ErrCode and Subcode.  In
   short, the Hard Reset encapsulates another NOTIFICATION message in
   its data portion.

   Whenever a BGP speaker receives a Hard Reset, the speaker MUST
   terminate the BGP session following the standard procedures in
   [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Operation</span>

   A BGP speaker that is willing to receive and send BGP NOTIFICATION
   messages according to the procedures of this document MUST advertise
   the "N" bit using the Graceful Restart Capability as defined in
   [<a href="./rfc4724" title='"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"'>RFC4724</a>].

   When such a BGP speaker has received the "N" bit from its peer, and
   receives from that peer a BGP NOTIFICATION message other than a Hard
   Reset, it MUST follow the rules for the Receiving Speaker mentioned
   in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.  The BGP speaker generating the BGP NOTIFICATION
   message MUST also follow the rules for the Receiving Speaker.

   When a BGP speaker resets its session due to a HOLDTIME expiry, it
   should generate the relevant BGP NOTIFICATION message as mentioned in
   [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] but subsequently MUST follow the rules for the Receiving
   Speaker mentioned in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   A BGP speaker SHOULD NOT send a Hard Reset to a peer from which it
   has not received the "N" bit.  We note, however, that if it did so,
   the effect would be as desired in any case because, according to
   [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4724" title='"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"'>RFC4724</a>], any NOTIFICATION message, whether recognized
   or not, results in a session reset.  Thus, the only negative effect
   to be expected from sending the Hard Reset to a peer that hasn't
   advertised compliance to this specification would be that the peer
   would be unable to properly log the associated information.

   Once the session is re-established, both BGP speakers SHOULD set
   their Forwarding State bit to 1.  If the Forwarding State bit is not
   set, then, according to the procedures in <a href="./rfc4724#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of [RFC4724]</a>,
   the relevant routes will be flushed, defeating the goals of this
   specification.

   <a href="./rfc4724#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of [RFC4724]</a> defines rules for the Receiving Speaker.
   This document modifies those rules as follows:

   The sentence "To deal with possible consecutive restarts, a route
   (from the peer) previously marked as stale MUST be deleted" only
   applies when the "N" bit has not been exchanged with the peer:

   OLD: When the Receiving Speaker detects termination of the TCP
        session for a BGP session with a peer that has advertised the
        Graceful Restart Capability, it MUST retain the routes received
        from the peer for all the address families that were previously
        received in the Graceful Restart Capability and MUST mark them
        as stale routing information.  To deal with possible consecutive
        restarts, a route (from the peer) previously marked as stale
        MUST be deleted.  The router MUST NOT differentiate between
        stale and other routing information during forwarding.

   NEW: When the Receiving Speaker detects termination of the TCP
        session for a BGP session with a peer that has advertised the
        Graceful Restart Capability, it MUST retain the routes received
        from the peer for all the address families that were previously
        received in the Graceful Restart Capability and MUST mark them
        as stale routing information.  The router MUST NOT differentiate
        between stale and other routing information during forwarding.
        If the "N" bit has not been exchanged with the peer, then to
        deal with possible consecutive restarts, a route (from the peer)
        previously marked as stale MUST be deleted.

   The stale timer is given a formal name and made mandatory:

   OLD: To put an upper bound on the amount of time a router retains the
        stale routes, an implementation MAY support a (configurable)
        timer that imposes this upper bound.

   NEW: To put an upper bound on the amount of time a router retains the
        stale routes, an implementation MUST support a (configurable)
        timer, called the "stale timer", that imposes this upper bound.
        A suggested default value for the stale timer is 180 seconds.
        An implementation MAY provide the option to disable the timer
        (i.e., to provide an infinite retention time) but MUST NOT do so
        by default.

   Although when to send a Hard Reset is an implementation-specific
   decision, we offer some advice.  Many Cease NOTIFICATION subcodes
   represent permanent or long-term, rather than transient, session
   termination.  Because of this, it's appropriate to use Hard Reset
   with them.  As of publication of this document, subcodes 1-9 have
   been defined for Cease.  The following table lists each of these
   subcodes along with suggested behavior.

   +-------+------------------------------------+----------------------+
   | Value |                Name                |  Suggested Behavior  |
   +-------+------------------------------------+----------------------+
   |   1   | Maximum Number of Prefixes Reached |      Hard Reset      |
   |   2   |      Administrative Shutdown       |      Hard Reset      |
   |   3   |         Peer De-configured         |      Hard Reset      |
   |   4   |        Administrative Reset        | Provide user control |
   |   5   |        Connection Rejected         |    Graceful Cease    |
   |   6   |     Other Configuration Change     |    Graceful Cease    |
   |   7   |  Connection Collision Resolution   |    Graceful Cease    |
   |   8   |          Out of Resources          |    Graceful Cease    |
   |   9   |             Hard Reset             |      Hard Reset      |
   +-------+------------------------------------+----------------------+

   These suggestions are only that -- suggestions, not requirements.
   It's the nature of BGP implementations that the mapping of internal
   states to BGP NOTIFICATION codes and subcodes is not always perfect.
   The guiding principle for the implementor should be that if there is
   no realistic hope that forwarding can continue or that the session
   will be re-established within the deadline, Hard Reset should be
   used.

   For all NOTIFICATION codes other than Cease, use of Hard Reset does
   not appear to be indicated.

   "BGP Administrative Shutdown Communication" [<a href="./rfc8203" title='"BGP Administrative Shutdown Communication"'>RFC8203</a>] specifies use
   of the data portion of the Administrative Shutdown or Administrative
   Reset subcodes to convey a short message.  When [<a href="./rfc8203" title='"BGP Administrative Shutdown Communication"'>RFC8203</a>] is used in
   conjunction with Hard Reset, the subcode of the outermost Cease MUST
   be Hard Reset, with the Administrative Shutdown or Administrative
   Reset subcodes encapsulated within.  The encapsulated message MUST
   subsequently be processed according to [<a href="./rfc8203" title='"BGP Administrative Shutdown Communication"'>RFC8203</a>].

   When reporting a Hard Reset to network management, the error code and

   in the Data portion SHOULD be reported as well.

   This specification doesn't change the basic security model inherent
   in [<a href="./rfc4724" title='"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"'>RFC4724</a>], with the exception that the protection against repeated
   resets is relaxed.  To mitigate the consequent risk that an attacker
   could use repeated session resets to prevent stale routes from ever
   being deleted, we make the stale timer mandatory (in practice, it is
   already ubiquitous).  To the extent [<a href="./rfc4724" title='"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"'>RFC4724</a>] might be said to help
   defend against denials of service by making the control plane more
   resilient, this extension may modestly increase that resilience;
   however, there are enough confounding and deployment-specific factors
   that no general claims can be made.
