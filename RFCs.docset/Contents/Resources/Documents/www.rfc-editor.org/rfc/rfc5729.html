Abstract

   This specification defines the behavior required of Diameter agents
   to route requests when the User-Name Attribute Value Pair contains a
   Network Access Identifier formatted with multiple realms.  These
   multi-realm, or "Decorated", Network Access Identifiers are used in
   order to force the routing of request messages through a predefined
   list of mediating realms.

   This specification defines the behavior required of Diameter agents
   to route requests when the User-Name Attribute Value Pair (AVP)
   contains a Network Access Identifier (NAI) formatted with multiple
   realms (hereafter referred to as a Decorated NAI).  Decorated NAIs
   are used in order to force the routing of request messages through a
   predefined list of mediating realms.  This specification does not
   define a new Diameter application but instead defines behaviour that
   would be common across all new Diameter applications that require
   request routing based on Decorated NAI.

   The Diameter Base Protocol [<a href="./rfc3588" title='"Diameter Base Protocol"'>RFC3588</a>] NAI usage is originally based on
   [<a href="./rfc2486" title='"The Network Access Identifier"'>RFC2486</a>], which has since been revised to [<a href="./rfc4282" title='"The Network Access Identifier"'>RFC4282</a>].  While the use
   of multiple realms is generally discouraged, <a href="./rfc4282">RFC 4282</a> does allow
   multiple realms.  The use of this facility appears in, for instance,
   [<a href="./rfc4284" title='"Identity Selection Hints for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)"'>RFC4284</a>].  However, <a href="./rfc4282">RFC 4282</a> does not define how the Decorated NAIs
   should be handled by Diameter agents, so this specification was
   written to capture those requirements.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   Network Access Identifier (NAI):

      The user identity submitted by the client during access
      authentication.  In roaming, the purpose of the NAI is to identify
      the user as well as to assist in the routing of the authentication
      request.

   Decorated NAI:

      An NAI containing multiple realms used to specify a source route
      and formatted according to <a href="./rfc4282#section-2.7">Section 2.7 in RFC 4282</a>.

   Network Access Provider (NAP):

      A business entity that provides network access infrastructure to
      one or more realms.  A NAP infrastructure comprises one or more
      network access servers.

   Network Access Server (NAS):

      The device to which peers connect in order to obtain access to the
      network.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Problem%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Problem Overview</span>

   <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> of "The Diameter Base Protocol" (<a href="./rfc3588">RFC 3588</a>) defines the
   request routing in detail.  That specification concerns only the
   cases where a Destination-Realm AVP is included in a Diameter request
   message.  As described in <a href="./rfc3588#section-6.1">RFC 3588 Section 6.1</a>, a Diameter peer
   originating a request message MAY retrieve the realm information from
   the User-Name AVP and use that realm to populate the Destination-
   Realm AVP.  In that case, the User-Name AVP is in form of an NAI
   including the realm part.

   Decorated NAIs are used to force routing of messages through a
   predefined list of realms and, in that way, force certain inter-realm
   roaming arrangements; see <a href="./rfc4282#section-2.7">Section 2.7 of RFC 4282</a>.  For example, a
   terminal (e.g., a mobile host) may learn, based on some application-
   or implementation-specific manner, that its network access
   authentication signaling must traverse certain realms in order to
   reach the home realm.  In this case, the terminal would decorate its
   NAI during the network access authentication with the list of
   intermediating realms and the home realm.  As a result, the network
   access server (NAS) and intermediating Diameter agents would make
   sure that all Diameter request messages traverse through the desired
   realms as long as the request messages contain the User-Name AVP with
   a Decorated NAI.

   NAI decoration has previously been used in RADIUS-based [<a href="./rfc2865" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>]
   roaming networks, using <a href="./rfc2486">RFC 2486</a> NAIs in a proprietary manner.  There
   is a need to replicate the same NAI-based routing enforcement
   functionality in Diameter-based roaming networks.  Moreover, there
   are publicly available specifications (e.g., see [<a href="#ref-3GPP.23.234" title='"3GPP system to Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interworking; System description"'>3GPP.23.234</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-3GPP.24.234" title='"3GPP system to Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interworking; WLAN User Equipment (WLAN UE) to network protocols; Stage 3"'>3GPP.24.234</a>], [<a href="#ref-3GPP.23.003" title='"Numbering, addressing and identification"'>3GPP.23.003</a>], [<a href="#ref-3GPP.29.273" title='"Evolved Packet System (EPS); 3GPP EPS AAA interfaces"'>3GPP.29.273</a>], and [<a href="#ref-WiMAX" title='"WiMAX Forum Network Architecture (Stage 2: Architecture Tenets, Reference Model and Reference Points)"'>WiMAX</a>]) that assume
   NAI-decoration-based request routing enforcement is fully supported

   by <a href="./rfc3588">RFC 3588</a>.  The same assumption is carried over to Network Server
   Application Requirements (NASREQ) [<a href="./rfc4005" title='"Diameter Network Access Server Application"'>RFC4005</a>] and Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP) [<a href="./rfc4072" title='"Diameter Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Application"'>RFC4072</a>] Diameter applications.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example deployment scenario where Decorated
   NAIs would be used to force a certain route through desired realms.
   A roaming terminal (e.g., a mobile host) discovers a number of
   Network Access Providers (NAP): NAP A and NAP B.  None of the NAPs
   are able to provide direct connectivity to the roaming terminal's
   home realm (i.e., h.example.com).  However, the roaming terminal
   learns, somehow, that NAP B is able to provide connectivity to
   h.example.com through x.example.com (i.e., the visited realm from the
   roaming terminal point of view).  During the network access
   authentication, the roaming terminal would decorate its NAI as
   h.example.com!username@x.example.com.  The roaming terminal has also
   an alternative route to its home realm through NAP A: z.example.com
   and x.example.com.  If the roaming terminal were to choose to use NAP
   A, then it would decorate its NAI as
   x.example.com!h.example.com!username@z.example.com.  Diameter agents
   would now be able to route the request message through desired realms
   using the Decorated NAI originally found in the User-Name AVP.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5729">RFC 5729</a>         Diameter Realm Routing Clarifications     December 2009</span>


   NAI decoration is not limited to the network access authentication
   and authorization procedures.  It can be used with any Diameter
   application whose commands are proxiable and include the User-Name
   AVP with an NAI.  Generally, the NAI decoration can be used to force
   a certain route for all Diameter request messages at a realm
   granularity.

   As a problem summary, we have two main issues:

   o  Updating both Destination-Realm and User-Name AVPs based on the
      Decorated NAI extracted from the User-Name AVP.  The update would
      be done by intermediating Diameter agents that participate in
      realm-based request routing.  Specifically, this would concern
      Diameter proxies.

   o  How Diameter agents could implement the handling of the NAI-
      decoration-based routing enforcement in a way that is still
      backwards compatible with <a href="./rfc3588">RFC 3588</a>.

   <a href="./rfc5113#section-2.3">Section 2.3 of [RFC5113]</a> also discusses NAI-decoration-related issues
   with EAP [<a href="./rfc3748" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)"'>RFC3748</a>] in general.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Solution%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Solution Overview</span>

   This specification defines a solution for Diameter realm-based
   request routing with routing enforcement using the User-Name AVP NAI
   decoration.  Diameter proxy agent implementations can claim
   compliance using the solution described in this specification.  The
   Diameter answer processing is left unmodified and follows the
   procedures described in <a href="./rfc3588#section-6.2">Section 6.2 of RFC 3588</a>.

   Implementations compliant to this specification MUST have a uniform
   way of interpreting decorated NAIs.  That is, in the case of
   decoration, the character '!' (hexadecimal 0x21) is used to separate
   realms in the list of decorated realms in the NAI (as shown in
   examples in [<a href="./rfc4282" title='"The Network Access Identifier"'>RFC4282</a>]).

   <a href="./rfc3588#section-1.3">RFC 3588, Section 1.3</a> states that NAI realm names are required to be
   unique and are piggybacked on the administration of the Domain Name
   System (DNS) ([<a href="./rfc1034" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>RFC1034</a>], [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>]) namespace.  However, an NAI, with
   or without decoration, may contain international characters as
   allowed by <a href="./rfc4282">RFC 4282</a>.  This causes problems, as international
   characters as such are not supported by <a href="./rfc1034">RFC 1034</a> and <a href="./rfc1035">RFC 1035</a>.  The

   conversion of International Domain Names (IDN), which in this
   document's scope are NAI realms, are discussed in [<a href="./rfc3490" title='"Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)"'>RFC3490</a>] and are
   further to be revised in [<a href="#ref-IDNA" title='"Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA): Protocol"'>IDNA</a>].

   The general guidance for handling NAI realms with international
   characters is described in <a href="./rfc4282#section-2.4">Section 2.4 of RFC 4282</a> and discussed more
   in [<a href="#ref-NAI" title='"The Network Access Identifier"'>NAI</a>] based on recent operational experiences.  This specification
   does not attempt to fix the issue with the internationalization of
   NAIs, as the problem space is large and concerns much more than just
   NAI realms and NAI decoration.  However, this specification has the
   following assumptions:

   o  The conversion from a realm name that includes international
      characters to ASCII-compatible encoding should only take place
      when DNS infrastructure needs to be queried and not, for example,
      during the realm-placement processing of Decorated NAIs.  The
      conversion is normally handled by a DNS resolver library on the
      local Diameter agent or, when not available in the resolver
      library, by the Diameter agent.  In both cases, the realm in the
      NAI remains unchanged.

   o  It is the responsibility of the operators administrating their
      realm and domain name spaces to ensure that the DNS is provisioned
      properly for all realms that may appear in Decorated NAIs.  This
      implicitly requires that the conversion from any realm with
      international characters to a domain name cannot fail (i.e., the
      realms conform to the preconditions for internationalized domain
      names).

   From the above discussion, it can be concluded that avoiding
   international characters in realms contained in NAIs is the best way
   to avoid problems with internationalized domain names and Decorated
   NAI handling in general.

   The handling of the NAI-decoration-based routing enforcement as
   described in this specification will be supported by any new Diameter
   application.  Therefore, backwards compatibility with existing
   Diameter implementations, applications, and deployments will be
   guaranteed.  Existing Diameter agents not compliant with this
   specification will not advertise support for these new applications
   that implement the enhanced routing solution based on Decorated NAIs,
   and will therefore be bypassed.

   When a Diameter client originates a request message, the
   Destination-Realm AVP is populated with the realm part of the NAI
   available in the User-Name AVP (the realm given after the '@'
   character of the NAI).  The NAI in the User-Name AVP may or may not
   be decorated.

   When a Diameter agent receives a request message containing the
   Destination-Realm AVP with a realm that the agent is configured to
   process locally (and, in the case of proxies, the Diameter
   application is locally supported), it MUST do the following further
   processing before handling the message locally:

   o  If the User-Name AVP is available in the request message, then the
      Diameter agent MUST inspect whether the User-Name AVP contains a
      Decorated NAI.  If the NAI is not decorated, then the Diameter
      agent proceeds with a normal <a href="./rfc3588">RFC 3588</a> message processing.

   o  If the User-Name AVP contains a Decorated NAI, then the Diameter
      agent MUST process the NAI as defined in <a href="./rfc4282">RFC 4282</a> and update the
      value of the User-Name AVP accordingly.  Furthermore, the Diameter
      agent MUST update the Destination-Realm AVP to match the new realm
      in the User-Name AVP.

   o  The request message is then sent to the next hop using the normal
      request routing rules as defined in <a href="./rfc3588">RFC 3588</a>.

   Figure 2 illustrates an example of a roaming terminal that originates
   signaling with the home realm (h.example.com), through a NAP and two
   intermediating realms (z.example.com, x.example.com) before reaching
   the home realm (h.example.com).  The example shows how the User-Name
   AVP and the Destination-Realm AVP change at each realm before
   reaching the final destination.  If the signaling were originated
   from the NAS/NAP only, then step 1 can be omitted.

   A malicious node initiating (or indirectly causing initiation of) a
   Diameter request may purposely create a malformed list of realms in
   the NAI.  This may cause the routing of requests through realms that
   would normally have nothing to do with the initiated Diameter message
   exchange.  Furthermore, a malformed list of realms may contain non-
   existing realms, causing the routing of Diameter messages that cannot
   ultimately be routed anywhere.  However, the request message might
   get routed several hops before such non-existent realms are
   discovered, thus creating unnecessary overhead to the routing system
   in general.

   The NAI decoration is used in Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting (AAA) infrastructures where the Diameter messages are
   transported between the NAS and the Diameter server via one or more
   AAA brokers or Diameter proxies.  In this case, the NAS to Diameter
   server AAA communication relies on the security properties of the
   intermediate AAA brokers and Diameter proxies.
