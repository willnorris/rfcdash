Abstract

   This document describes the usage of the Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) protocol, as defined in <a href="./rfc2246">RFC 2246</a>, over the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in <a href="./rfc2960">RFC 2960</a> and <a href="./rfc3309">RFC 3309</a>.

   The user of TLS can take advantage of the features provided by SCTP,
   namely the support of multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking
   and the support of multi-homing to provide network level fault
   tolerance.

   Additionally, discussions of extensions of SCTP are also supported,
   meaning especially the support of dynamic reconfiguration of IP-
   addresses.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Overview</span>

   This document describes the usage of the Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) protocol, as defined in [<a href="./rfc2246" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>RFC2246</a>], over the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in [<a href="./rfc2960" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol"'>RFC2960</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3309" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Checksum Change"'>RFC3309</a>].

   TLS is designed to run on top of a byte-stream oriented transport
   protocol providing a reliable, in-sequence delivery.  Thus, TLS is
   currently mainly being used on top of the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP), as defined in [<a href="./rfc793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC793</a>].

   Comparing TCP and SCTP, the latter provides additional features and
   this document shows how TLS should be used with SCTP to provide some
   of these additional features to the TLS user.

   This document defines:

   -   how to use the multiple streams feature of SCTP.

   -   how to handle the message oriented nature of SCTP.

   It should be noted that the TLS user can take advantage of the multi-
   homing support of SCTP.  The dynamic reconfiguration of IP-addresses,
   as currently being discussed, can also be used with the described
   solution.

   The method described in this document does not require any changes of
   TLS or SCTP.  It is only required that SCTP implementations support
   the optional feature of fragmentation of SCTP user messages.

   An association between the endpoints A and Z provides n streams from
   A to Z and m streams from Z to A.

   A pair consisting of two streams with the same stream identifier is
   considered and used as one bi-directional stream.

   Thus an SCTP association can be considered as a set of min(n,m) bi-
   directional streams and (max(n,m) - min(n,m)) uni-directional
   streams.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Fragmentation%20of%20User%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Fragmentation of User Messages</span>

   To avoid the knowledge and handling of the MTU inside TLS, SCTP MUST
   provide fragmentation of user messages, which is an optional feature
   of [<a href="./rfc2960" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol"'>RFC2960</a>].  Since SCTP is a message oriented protocol, it must be
   able to transmit all TLS records as SCTP user messages.  Thus the
   supported maximum length of SCTP user messages MUST be at least 2^14
   + 2048 + 5 = 18437 bytes, which is the maximum length of a
   TLSCiphertext, as defined in [<a href="./rfc2246" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>RFC2246</a>].

   Please note that an SCTP implementation might need to support the
   partial delivery API to be able to support the transport of user
   messages of this size.

   Therefore, SCTP takes care of fragmenting and reassembling the TLS
   records in order to avoid IP-fragmentation.

   A TLS implementation for TLS over SCTP MUST support at least the
   ciphersuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA as defined in [<a href="./rfc3268" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC3268</a>].

   TLS makes use of a bi-directional stream by establishing a connection
   over it.  This means that the number of connections for an
   association is limited by the number of bi-directional streams.

   The TLS handshake protocol is used on each bi-directional stream
   separately.  Each handshake can be:

   -  a full handshake or

   -  an abbreviated handshake that resumes a TLS session with a session
      id from another connection (on the same or another association).

   After completing the handshake for a connection, the bi-directional
   stream can be used for TLS-based user data transmission.  It should
   also be noted that the handshakes for the different connections are
   independent and can be delayed until the bi-directional stream is
   used for user data transmission.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Usage%20of%20bi-directional%20streams"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Usage of bi-directional streams</span>

   It is not required that all bi-directional streams are used for TLS-
   based user data transmission.  If TLS is not used, it is called SCTP-
   based user data transmission.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20SCTP-based%20user%20data%20transmission"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  SCTP-based user data transmission</span>

   If a bi-directional stream is not used for TLS-based communication
   there are no restrictions on the features provided by SCTP for SCTP-
   based user data transmission.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20TLS-based%20user%20data%20transmission"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  TLS-based user data transmission</span>

   In general, the bi-directional stream will be used for TLS-based user
   data transmission and it SHOULD NOT be used for SCTP-based user data
   transmission.  The exception to this rule is for protocols which
   contain upgrade-to-TLS mechanisms, such as those of HTTP upgrade
   [<a href="./rfc2817" title='"Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2817</a>] and SMTP over TLS [<a href="./rfc3207" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS"'>RFC3207</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3436">RFC 3436</a>                     TLS over SCTP                December 2002</span>


   TLS requires that the underlying transport delivers TLS records in
   strict sequence.  Thus, the 'unordered delivery' feature of SCTP MUST
   NOT be used on streams which are used for TLS based user data
   transmission.  For the same reason, TLS records delivered to SCTP for
   transmission MUST NOT have limited lifetimes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Usage%20of%20uni-directional%20streams"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Usage of uni-directional streams</span>

   The uni-directional streams can not be used for TLS-based user data
   transmission.  Nevertheless, they can be used without any
   restrictions for SCTP-based communication.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Examples</span>

   In these examples we consider the case of an association with two
   bi-directional streams.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.1.%20%20Two%20Bi-directional%20Streams%20with%20Full%20Handshake"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" id="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Two Bi-directional Streams with Full Handshake</span>

   Just after the association has been established, the client sends two
   ClientHello messages on the bi-directional streams 0 and 1.  After a
   full handshake has been completed on each bi-directional stream,
   TLS-based user data transmission can take place on that stream.  It
   is possible that on the bi-directional stream 0, the handshake has
   been completed, and user data transmission is ongoing, while on the
   bi-directional stream 1, the handshake has not been completed, or
   vice versa.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.2.%20%20Two%20Bi-directional%20Streams%20with%20an%20Abbreviated%20Handshake"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" id="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Two Bi-directional Streams with an Abbreviated Handshake</span>

   After establishing the association, the client starts a full
   handshake on the bi-directional stream 0.  The server provides a
   session identifier which allows session resumption.  After the full
   handshake has been completed, the client initiates an abbreviated
   handshake on the bi-directional stream 1, using the session
   identifier from the handshake on the bi-directional stream 0.  User
   data can be transmitted on the bi-directional stream 0, but not on
   the bi-directional stream stream 1 in that state.  After completion
   of the abbreviated handshake on the bi-directional stream 1, user
   data can be transmitted on both streams.

   Whether or not to use abbreviated handshakes during the setup phase
   of a TLS connection over an SCTP association depends on several
   factors:

   -  the complexity and duration of the initial handshake processing
      (also determined by the number of connections),




<span class="grey">Jungmaier, et al.           Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3436">RFC 3436</a>                     TLS over SCTP                December 2002</span>


   -  the network performance (round-trip times, bandwidth).

   Abbreviated handshakes can reduce computational complexity of the
   handshake considerably, in case this is a limiting resource.  If a
   large number of connections need to be established, it may be
   advantageous to use the TLS session resumption feature.  On the other
   hand, before an abbreviated handshake can take place, a full
   handshake needs to have been completed.  In networks with large
   round-trip time delays, it may be favorable to perform a number of
   full handshakes in parallel. Therefore, both possibilities are
   allowed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.3.%20%20Two%20Bi-directional%20Streams%20with%20a%20Delayed%20Abbreviated%20Handshake"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.3" id="section-8.3">8.3</a>.  Two Bi-directional Streams with a Delayed Abbreviated Handshake</span>

   This example resembles the last one, but after the completion of the
   full handshake on the bi-directional stream 0, the abbreviated
   handshake on the bi-directional stream 1 is not started immediately.
   The bi-directional stream 0 can be used for user data transmission.
   It is only when the user also wants to transmit data on the bi-
   directional stream 1 that the abbreviated handshake for the bi-
   directional stream 1 is initiated.

   This allows the user of TLS to request a large number of bi-
   directional streams without having to provide all the resources at
   association start-up if not all bi-directional streams are used right
   from the beginning.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.4.%20%20Two%20Bi-directional%20Streams%20without%20Full%20Handshakes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.4" id="section-8.4">8.4</a>.  Two Bi-directional Streams without Full Handshakes</span>

   This example is like the second and third one, but an abbreviated
   handshake is used for both bi-directional streams.  This requires the
   existence of a valid session identifier from connections handled by
   another association.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Using TLS on top of SCTP does not provide any new security issues
   beside the ones discussed in [<a href="./rfc2246" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>RFC2246</a>] and [<a href="./rfc2960" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol"'>RFC2960</a>].

   It is possible to authenticate TLS endpoints based on IP-addresses in
   certificates.  Unlike TCP, SCTP associations can use multiple
   addresses per SCTP endpoint.  Therefore it is possible that TLS
   records will be sent from a different IP-address than that originally
   authenticated.  This is not a problem provided that no security
   decisions are made based on that IP-address.  This is a special case
   of a general rule:  all decisions should be based on the peer's
   authenticated identity, not on its transport layer identity.
