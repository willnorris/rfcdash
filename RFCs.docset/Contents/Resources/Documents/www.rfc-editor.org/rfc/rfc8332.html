<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Overview%20and%20Rationale"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Overview and Rationale</span>

   Secure Shell (SSH) is a common protocol for secure communication on
   the Internet.  In [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>], SSH originally defined the public key
   algorithms "ssh-rsa" for server and client authentication using RSA
   with SHA-1, and "ssh-dss" using 1024-bit DSA and SHA-1.  These
   algorithms are now considered deficient.  For US government use, NIST
   has disallowed 1024-bit RSA and DSA, and use of SHA-1 for signing
   [<a href="#ref-NIST.800-131A">NIST.800-131A</a>].

   This memo updates RFCs 4252 and 4253 to define new public key
   algorithms allowing for interoperable use of existing and new RSA
   keys with SHA-256 and SHA-512.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   capitals, as shown here.

   The wire encoding types in this document -- "boolean", "byte",
   "string", "mpint" -- have meanings as described in [<a href="./rfc4251" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Public%20Key%20Format%20vs.%20Public%20Key%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Public Key Format vs. Public Key Algorithm</span>

   In [<a href="./rfc4252" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol"'>RFC4252</a>], the concept "public key algorithm" is used to establish
   a relationship between one algorithm name, and:

   A.  procedures used to generate and validate a private/public
       keypair;
   B.  a format used to encode a public key; and
   C.  procedures used to calculate, encode, and verify a signature.

   This document uses the term "public key format" to identify only A
   and B in isolation.  The term "public key algorithm" continues to
   identify all three aspects -- A, B, and C.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8332">RFC 8332</a>        Use of RSA Keys with SHA-256 and SHA-512      March 2018</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20New%20RSA%20Public%20Key%20Algorithms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  New RSA Public Key Algorithms</span>

   This memo adopts the style and conventions of [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] in specifying
   how use of a public key algorithm is indicated in SSH.

   The following new public key algorithms are defined:

     rsa-sha2-256        RECOMMENDED    sign    Raw RSA key
     rsa-sha2-512        OPTIONAL       sign    Raw RSA key

   These algorithms are suitable for use both in the SSH transport layer
   [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] for server authentication and in the authentication layer
   [<a href="./rfc4252" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol"'>RFC4252</a>] for client authentication.

   Since RSA keys are not dependent on the choice of hash function, the
   new public key algorithms reuse the "ssh-rsa" public key format as
   defined in [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>]:

   string    "ssh-rsa"
   mpint     e
   mpint     n

   All aspects of the "ssh-rsa" format are kept, including the encoded
   string "ssh-rsa".  This allows existing RSA keys to be used with the
   new public key algorithms, without requiring re-encoding or affecting
   already trusted key fingerprints.

   Signing and verifying using these algorithms is performed according
   to the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 scheme in [<a href="./rfc8017" title='"PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.2"'>RFC8017</a>] using SHA-2 [<a href="#ref-SHS" title='"Secure Hash Standard (SHS)"'>SHS</a>] as
   hash.

   For the algorithm "rsa-sha2-256", the hash used is SHA-256.
   For the algorithm "rsa-sha2-512", the hash used is SHA-512.

   The resulting signature is encoded as follows:

   string   "rsa-sha2-256" / "rsa-sha2-512"
   string    rsa_signature_blob

   The value for 'rsa_signature_blob' is encoded as a string that
   contains an octet string S (which is the output of RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5)
   and that has the same length (in octets) as the RSA modulus.  When S
   contains leading zeros, there exist signers that will send a shorter
   encoding of S that omits them.  A verifier MAY accept shorter
   encodings of S with one or more leading zeros omitted.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Use%20for%20Server%20Authentication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Use for Server Authentication</span>

   To express support and preference for one or both of these algorithms
   for server authentication, the SSH client or server includes one or
   both algorithm names, "rsa-sha2-256" and/or "rsa-sha2-512", in the
   name-list field "server_host_key_algorithms" in the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT
   packet [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>].  If one of the two host key algorithms is
   negotiated, the server sends an "ssh-rsa" public key as part of the
   negotiated key exchange method (e.g., in SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY) and
   encodes a signature with the appropriate signature algorithm name --
   either "rsa-sha2-256" or "rsa-sha2-512".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Use%20for%20Client%20Authentication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Use for Client Authentication</span>

   To use this algorithm for client authentication, the SSH client sends
   an SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message [<a href="./rfc4252" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol"'>RFC4252</a>] encoding the
   "publickey" method and encoding the string field "public key
   algorithm name" with the value "rsa-sha2-256" or "rsa-sha2-512".  The
   "public key blob" field encodes the RSA public key using the
   "ssh-rsa" public key format.

   For example, as defined in [<a href="./rfc4252" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol"'>RFC4252</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>], an SSH
   "publickey" authentication request using an "rsa-sha2-512" signature
   would be properly encoded as follows:

     byte      SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
     string    user name
     string    service name
     string    "publickey"
     boolean   TRUE
     string    "rsa-sha2-512"
     string    public key blob:
         string    "ssh-rsa"
         mpint     e
         mpint     n
     string    signature:
         string    "rsa-sha2-512"
         string    rsa_signature_blob

   If the client includes the signature field, the client MUST encode
   the same algorithm name in the signature as in
   SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST -- either "rsa-sha2-256" or "rsa-sha2-512".
   If a server receives a mismatching request, it MAY apply arbitrary
   authentication penalties, including but not limited to authentication
   failure or disconnect.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8332">RFC 8332</a>        Use of RSA Keys with SHA-256 and SHA-512      March 2018</span>


   OpenSSH 7.2 (but not 7.2p2) incorrectly encodes the algorithm in the
   signature as "ssh-rsa" when the algorithm in SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
   is "rsa-sha2-256" or "rsa-sha2-512".  In this case, the signature
   does actually use either SHA-256 or SHA-512.  A server MAY, but is
   not required to, accept this variant or another variant that
   corresponds to a good-faith implementation and is considered safe to
   accept.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Discovery%20of%20Public%20Key%20Algorithms%20Supported%20by%20Servers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Discovery of Public Key Algorithms Supported by Servers</span>

   Implementation experience has shown that there are servers that apply
   authentication penalties to clients attempting public key algorithms
   that the SSH server does not support.

   Servers that accept rsa-sha2-* signatures for client authentication
   SHOULD implement the extension negotiation mechanism defined in
   [<a href="./rfc8308" title='"Extension Negotiation in the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol"'>RFC8308</a>], including especially the "server-sig-algs" extension.

   When authenticating with an RSA key against a server that does not
   implement the "server-sig-algs" extension, clients MAY default to an
   "ssh-rsa" signature to avoid authentication penalties.  When the new
   rsa-sha2-* algorithms have been sufficiently widely adopted to
   warrant disabling "ssh-rsa", clients MAY default to one of the new
   algorithms.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has updated the "Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Parameters"
   registry, established with [<a href="./rfc4250" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Assigned Numbers"'>RFC4250</a>], to extend the table "Public Key
   Algorithm Names" [<a href="#ref-IANA-PKA">IANA-PKA</a>] as follows.

   -  To the immediate right of the column "Public Key Algorithm Name",
      a new column has been added, titled "Public Key Format".  For
      existing entries, the column "Public Key Format" has been assigned
      the same value as under "Public Key Algorithm Name".

   -  Immediately following the existing entry for "ssh-rsa", two
      sibling entries have been added:

      P. K. Alg. Name    P. K. Format      Reference   Note

   The security considerations of [<a href="./rfc4251" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>] apply to this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Key%20Size%20and%20Signature%20Hash"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Key Size and Signature Hash</span>

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special
   Publication 800-131A, Revision 1 [<a href="#ref-NIST.800-131A">NIST.800-131A</a>] disallows RSA and
   DSA keys shorter than 2048 bits for US government use.  The same
   document disallows the SHA-1 hash function for digital signature
   generation, except under NIST's protocol-specific guidance.

   It is prudent to follow this advice also outside of US government
   use.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Transition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Transition</span>

   This document is based on the premise that RSA is used in
   environments where a gradual, compatible transition to improved
   algorithms will be better received than one that is abrupt and
   incompatible.  It advises that SSH implementations add support for
   new RSA public key algorithms along with SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO and the
   "server-sig-algs" extension to allow coexistence of new deployments
   with older versions that support only "ssh-rsa".  Nevertheless,
   implementations SHOULD start to disable "ssh-rsa" in their default
   configurations as soon as the implementers believe that new RSA
   signature algorithms have been widely adopted.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.%20%20PKCS%20%231%20v1.5%20Padding%20and%20Signature%20Verification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  PKCS #1 v1.5 Padding and Signature Verification</span>

   This document prescribes RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature padding because:

   (1)  RSASSA-PSS is not universally available to all implementations;
   (2)  PKCS #1 v1.5 is widely supported in existing SSH
        implementations;
   (3)  PKCS #1 v1.5 is not known to be insecure for use in this scheme.

   Implementers are advised that a signature with RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5
   padding MUST NOT be verified by applying the RSA key to the
   signature, and then parsing the output to extract the hash.  This may
   give an attacker opportunities to exploit flaws in the parsing and
   vary the encoding.  Verifiers MUST instead apply RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5
   padding to the expected hash, then compare the encoded bytes with the
   output of the RSA operation.
