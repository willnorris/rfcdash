<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document specifies the payload format for packetization of KLV
   (Key-Length-Value) Encoded Data, as defined by the Society of Motion
   Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) in [<a href="#ref-SMPTE-ST336" title='"SMPTE ST 336:2007 Data Encoding Protocol Using Key- Length-Value"'>SMPTE-ST336</a>], into the
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].

   The payload format is defined in such a way that arbitrary KLV data
   can be carried.  No restrictions are placed on which KLV data keys
   can be used.

   A brief description of SMPTE ST 336, "Data Encoding Protocol Using
   Key-Length-Value", is given.  The payload format itself, including
   use of the RTP header fields, is specified in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  The media
   type and IANA considerations are also described.  This document
   concludes with security considerations relevant to this payload
   format.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Conventions%2C%20Definitions%2C%20and%20Acronyms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Conventions, Definitions, and Acronyms</span>

   The term "Universal Label Key" is used in this document to refer to a
   fixed-length, 16-byte SMPTE-administered Universal Label (see
   [<a href="#ref-SMPTE-ST298" title='"SMPTE ST 298:2009 Universal Labels for Unique Identification of Digital Data"'>SMPTE-ST298</a>]) that is used as an identifying key in a KLV item.

   The term "KLV item" is used in this document to refer to one single
   Universal Label Key, length, and value triplet encoded as described
   in [<a href="#ref-SMPTE-ST336" title='"SMPTE ST 336:2007 Data Encoding Protocol Using Key- Length-Value"'>SMPTE-ST336</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Media%20Format%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Media Format Background</span>

   [<a href="#ref-SMPTE-ST336" title='"SMPTE ST 336:2007 Data Encoding Protocol Using Key- Length-Value"'>SMPTE-ST336</a>], "Data Encoding Protocol Using Key-Length-Value",
   defines a byte-level data encoding protocol for representing data
   items and data groups.  This encoding protocol definition is
   independent of the application or transportation method used.

   SMPTE ST 336 data encoding can be applied to a wide variety of binary
   data.  This encoding has been used to provide diverse and rich
   metadata sets that describe or enhance associated video
   presentations.  Use of SMPTE ST 336 encoded metadata in conjunction
   with video has enabled improvements in multimedia presentations,
   content management and distribution, archival and retrieval, and
   production workflow.

   The SMPTE ST 336 standard defines a KLV triplet as a data interchange
   protocol for data items or data groups where the Key identifies the
   data, the Length specifies the length of the data, and the Value is
   the data itself.  The KLV protocol provides a common interchange
   point for all compliant applications irrespective of the method of
   implementation or transport.

   The Key of a KLV triplet (a Universal Label Key) is coded using a
   fixed-length 16-byte SMPTE-administered Universal Label.
   [<a href="#ref-SMPTE-ST298" title='"SMPTE ST 298:2009 Universal Labels for Unique Identification of Digital Data"'>SMPTE-ST298</a>] further details the structure of 16-byte SMPTE-
   administered Universal Labels.  Universal Label Keys are maintained
   in registries published by SMPTE (see, for example, [<a href="#ref-SMPTE-ST335" title='"SMPTE ST 335:2012 Metadata Element Dictionary Structure"'>SMPTE-ST335</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-SMPTE-RP210" title='"SMPTE RP 210v12:2010 Data Element Dictionary"'>SMPTE-RP210</a>]).

   The standard also provides methods for combining associated KLV
   triplets in data sets where the set of KLV triplets is itself coded
   with the KLV data coding protocol.  Such sets can be coded in either
   full form (Universal Sets) or one of four increasingly bit-efficient
   forms (Global Sets, Local Sets, Variable Length Packs, and Defined
   Length Packs).  The standard provides a definition of each of these
   data constructs.

   Additionally, the standard defines the use of KLV coding to provide a
   means to carry information that is registered with a non-SMPTE
   external agency.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Payload%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Payload Format</span>

   The main goal of the payload format design for SMPTE ST 336 data is
   to provide carriage of SMPTE ST 336 data over RTP in a simple, yet
   robust manner.  All forms of SMPTE ST 336 data can be carried by the
   payload format.  The payload format maintains simplicity by using
   only the standard RTP headers and not defining any payload headers.

   SMPTE ST 336 KLV data is broken into KLVunits.  A KLVunit is simply a
   logical grouping of otherwise unframed KLV data, grouped based on
   source data timing (see <a href="#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1</a>).  Each KLVunit is then placed
   into one or more RTP packet payloads.  The RTP header marker bit is
   used to assist receivers in locating the boundaries of KLVunits.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20RTP%20Header%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  RTP Header Usage</span>

   This payload format uses the RTP packet header fields as described in
   the table below:

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Field     | Usage                                                 |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Timestamp | The RTP Timestamp encodes the instant along a         |
   |           | presentation timeline that the entire KLVunit encoded |
   |           | in the packet payload is to be presented.  When one   |
   |           | KLVunit is placed in multiple RTP packets, the RTP    |
   |           | timestamp of all packets comprising that KLVunit MUST |
   |           | be the same.  The timestamp clock frequency is        |
   |           | defined as a parameter to the payload format          |
   |           | (<a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>).                                          |
   |           |                                                       |
   | M-bit     | The RTP header marker bit (M) is used to demarcate    |
   |           | KLVunits.  Senders MUST set the marker bit to '1' for |
   |           | any RTP packet that contains the final byte of a      |
   |           | KLVunit.  For all other packets, senders MUST set the |
   |           | RTP header marker bit to '0'.  This allows receivers  |
   |           | to pass a KLVunit for parsing/decoding immediately    |
   |           | upon receipt of the last RTP packet comprising the    |
   |           | KLVunit.  Without this, a receiver would need to wait |
   |           | for the next RTP packet with a different timestamp to |
   |           | arrive, thus signaling the end of one KLVunit and the |
   |           | start of another.                                     |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

   The remaining RTP header fields are used as specified in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].

   A KLVunit is a logical collection of all KLV items that are to be
   presented at a specific time.  A KLVunit is comprised of one or more
   KLV items.  Compound items (sets, packs) are allowed as per
   [<a href="#ref-SMPTE-ST336" title='"SMPTE ST 336:2007 Data Encoding Protocol Using Key- Length-Value"'>SMPTE-ST336</a>], but the contents of a compound item MUST NOT be split
   across two KLVunits.  Multiple KLV items in a KLVunit occur one after
   another with no padding or stuffing between items.

   An RTP packet payload SHALL contain one, and only one, KLVunit or a
   fragment thereof.  KLVunits small enough to fit into a single RTP
   packet (RTP packet size is up to the implementation but should
   consider underlying transport/network factors such as MTU
   limitations) are placed directly into the payload of the RTP packet,
   with the first byte of the KLVunit (which is the first byte of a KLV
   Universal Label Key) being the first byte of the RTP packet payload.

   KLVunits too large to fit into a single RTP packet payload MAY span
   multiple RTP packet payloads.  When this is done, the KLVunit data
   MUST be sent in sequential byte order, such that when all RTP packets
   comprising the KLVunit are arranged in sequence number order,
   concatenating the payload data together exactly reproduces the
   original KLVunit.

   Additionally, when a KLVunit is fragmented across multiple RTP
   packets, all RTP packets transporting the fragments of a KLVunit MUST
   have the same timestamp.

   KLVunits are bounded with changes in RTP packet timestamps.  The
   marker (M) bit in the RTP packet headers marks the last RTP packet
   comprising a KLVunit (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20Implementation%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Implementation Considerations</span>

   RTP is generally deployed in network environments where packet loss
   might occur.  RTP header fields enable detection of lost packets, as
   described in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  When transmitting payload data described by
   this payload format, packet loss can cause the loss of whole KLVunits
   or portions thereof.

   A damaged KLVunit is any KLVunit that was carried in one or more RTP
   packets that have been lost.  When a lost packet is detected (through
   use of the sequence number header field), the receiver

   o  MUST consider the KLVunit partially received before a lost packet
      as damaged.  This damaged KLVunit includes all packets prior to
      the lost one (in sequence number order) back to, but not
      including, the most recent packet in which the M-bit in the RTP
      header was set to '1'.

   o  MUST consider the first KLVunit received after a lost packet as
      damaged.  This damaged KLVunit includes the first packet after the
      lost one (in sequence number order) and, if the first packet has
      its M-bit in the RTP header set to '0', all subsequent packets up
      to and including the next one with the M-bit in the RTP header set
      to '1'.

   The above applies, regardless of the M-bit value in the RTP header of
   the lost packet itself.  This enables very basic receivers to look
   solely at the M-bit to determine the outer boundaries of damaged
   KLVunits.  For example, when a packet with the M-bit set to '1' is
   lost, the KLVunit that the lost packet would have terminated is
   considered damaged, as is the KLVunit comprised of packets received
   subsequent to the lost packet (up to and including the next received
   packet with the M-bit set to '1').

               for time 55

   In this example, the packets with sequence numbers 7 and 8 contain
   portions of a KLVunit with a timestamp of 45.  This KLVunit is
   considered "damaged" due to the missing RTP packet with sequence
   number 6, which might have been part of this KLVunit.  The KLVunit
   for timestamp 30 (ended in packet with sequence number 5) is
   unaffected by the missing packet.  The KLVunit for timestamp 55,
   carried in the packet with sequence number 9, is also unaffected by
   the missing packet and is considered complete and intact.

   SMPTE ST 336 KLV data streams are built in such a way that it is
   possible to partially recover from errors or missing data in a
   stream.  Exact specifics of how damaged KLVunits are handled are left
   to each implementation, as different implementations can have
   differing capabilities and robustness in their downstream KLV payload
   processing.  Because some implementations can be particularly limited
   in their capacity to handle damaged KLVunits, receivers MAY drop
   damaged KLVunits entirely.

   The general congestion control considerations for transporting RTP
   data apply; see RTP [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and any applicable RTP profile, like
   AVP [<a href="./rfc3551" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>].

   Further, SMPTE ST 336 data can be encoded in different schemes that
   reduce the overhead associated with individual data items within the
   overall stream.  SMPTE ST 336 grouping constructs, such as local sets
   and data packs, provide a mechanism to reduce bandwidth requirements.

   This RTP payload format is identified using the application/smpte336m
   media type, which is registered in accordance with [<a href="./rfc4855" title='"Media Type Registration of RTP Payload Formats"'>RFC4855</a>], and
   using the template of [<a href="./rfc4288" title='"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"'>RFC4288</a>].

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: smpte336m

   Required parameters:

      rate: RTP timestamp clock rate.  Typically chosen based on
         sampling rate of metadata being transmitted, but other rates
         can be specified.

   Optional parameters: None

   Encoding considerations: This media type is framed and binary; see
      <a href="./rfc4288#section-4.8">Section 4.8 of [RFC4288]</a>.

   Security considerations: See <a href="./rfc6597#section-8">Section 8 of RFC 6597</a>.

   Interoperability considerations: Data items in smpte336m can be very
      diverse.  Receivers might only be capable of interpreting a subset
      of the possible data items; unrecognized items are skipped.
      Agreement on data items to be used out of band, via application
      profile or similar, is typical.

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: This media type depends on RTP framing, and
      hence is only defined for transfer via RTP ([<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>]).  Transport
      within other framing protocols is not defined at this time.

   IANA has registered application/smpte336m as specified in
   <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.  The media type has been added to the IANA registry for
   "RTP Payload Format media types"

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], and in any applicable RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity, and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of
   the RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a
   suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Cryptographic
   systems may also allow the authentication of the source of the
   payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload format
   should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and at least
   source authentication capable of determining whether or not an RTP
   packet is from a member of the RTP session.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the
   application, the transport, and the signaling protocol employed.
   Therefore, a single mechanism is not sufficient, although if suitable
   the usage of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [<a href="./rfc3711" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>]
   is recommended.  Other mechanisms that may be used are IPsec
   [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>] and Transport Layer Security (TLS) [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>] (RTP over
   TCP), but other alternatives may exist as well.

   This RTP payload format presents the possibility for significant
   non-uniformity in the receiver-side computational complexity during
   processing of SMPTE ST 336 payload data.  Because the length of SMPTE
   ST 336 encoded data items is essentially unbounded, receivers must
   take care when allocating resources used in processing.  It is easy
   to construct pathological data that would cause a naive decoder to
   allocate large amounts of resources, resulting in denial-of-service
   threats.  Receivers SHOULD place limits on resource allocation that
   are within the bounds set forth by any application profile in use.

   This RTP payload format does not contain any inherently active
   content.  However, individual SMPTE ST 336 KLV items could be defined
   to convey active content in a particular application.  Therefore,
   receivers capable of decoding and interpreting such data items should
   use appropriate caution and security practices.  In particular,
   accepting active content from streams that lack authenticity or

   integrity protection mechanisms places a receiver at risk of attacks
   using spoofed packets.  Receivers not capable of decoding such data
   items are not at risk; unknown data items are skipped over and
   discarded according to SMPTE ST 336 processing rules.
