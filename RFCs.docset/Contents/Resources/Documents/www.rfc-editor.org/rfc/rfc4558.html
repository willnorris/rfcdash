Abstract

   Use of Node-ID based Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Hello
   messages is implied in a number of cases, e.g., when data and control
   planes are separated, when TE links are unnumbered.  Furthermore,
   when link level failure detection is performed by some means other
   than exchanging RSVP Hello messages, use of a Node-ID based Hello
   session is optimal for detecting signaling adjacency failure for
   Resource reSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).
   Nonetheless, this implied behavior is unclear, and this document
   formalizes use of the Node-ID based RSVP Hello session in some
   scenarios.  The procedure described in this document applies to both
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   capable nodes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The RSVP Hello message exchange was introduced in [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>].  The
   usage of RSVP Hello has been extended in [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] to support RSVP
   Graceful Restart (GR) procedures.

   More specifically, [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] specifies the use of the RSVP Hello
   messages for GR procedures for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS).  GMPLS
   introduces the notion of control plane and data plane separation.  In
   other words, in GMPLS networks, the control plane information is
   carried over a control network whose end-points are IP capable and
   that may be physically or logically disjoint from the data bearer
   links it controls.  One of the consequences of separation of data
   bearer links from control channels is that RSVP Hello messages are
   not terminated on data bearer links' interfaces even if (some of)
   those are numbered.  Instead, RSVP Hello messages are terminated at
   the control channel (IP-capable) end-points.  The latter MAY be
   identified by the value assigned to the node hosting these control
   channels, i.e., Node-ID.  Consequently, the use of RSVP Hello
   messages for GR applications introduces a need for clarifying the
   behavior and usage of Node-ID based Hello sessions.

   Even in the case of packet switching capable interfaces, when link
   failure detection is performed by some means other than RSVP Hello
   messages (e.g., [<a href="#ref-BFD" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection"'>BFD</a>]), the use of Node-ID based Hello sessions is
   also optimal for detection of signaling adjacency failures for
   GMPLS-RSVP-TE and RSVP-TE when there is more than one link between a
   pair of nodes.  Similarly, when all TE links between neighbor nodes
   are unnumbered, it is implied that the nodes will exchange Node-ID
   based Hello messages for detection of signaling adjacency failures.
   This document also clarifies the use of Node-ID based Hello message
   exchanges when all or a sub-set of TE links are unnumbered.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Node-ID%20Based%20RSVP%20Hello%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Node-ID Based RSVP Hello Messages</span>

   A Node-ID based Hello session is established through the exchange of
   RSVP Hello messages such that local and remote Node-IDs are
   respectively used in the source and destination fields of Hello
   packets.  Here, for IPv4, Node-ID refers to the TE router-id as
   defined in the Router Address TLV for OSPF [<a href="#ref-OSPF-TE" title='"Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2"'>OSPF-TE</a>] and the Traffic
   Engineering router ID TLV for ISIS [<a href="#ref-ISIS-TE" title='"Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Extensions for Traffic Engineering (TE)"'>ISIS-TE</a>].  For IPv6, the Node-ID
   refers to the Router_IPv6_Address for OSPFv3 [<a href="#ref-OSPFv3-TE" title='"Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF version 3"'>OSPFv3-TE</a>] and the IPv6
   TE Router_ID for IS-IS [<a href="#ref-IS-ISv6-TE" title='"IPv6 Traffic Engineering in IS- IS"'>IS-ISv6-TE</a>].  This section formalizes a
   procedure for establishing Node-ID based Hello sessions.

   If a node wishes to establish a Node-ID based RSVP Hello session with
   its neighbor, it sends a Hello message with its Node-ID in the source
   IP address field of the Hello packet.  Furthermore, the node also
   puts the neighbor's Node-ID in the destination address field of the
   IP packet.

   When a node receives a Hello packet where the destination IP address
   is its local Node-ID as advertised in the IGP-TE topology, the node
   MUST use its Node-ID in replying to the Hello message.  In other
   words, nodes MUST ensure that the Node-IDs used in RSVP Hello
   messages are those derived/contained in the IGP-TE topology.
   Furthermore, a node can only run one Node-ID based RSVP Hello session
   per IGP instance (i.e., per Node-ID pair) with its neighbor.

   Even in the case of packet switching capable interfaces, when link
   failure detection is performed by some means other than exchanging
   RSVP Hello messages, use of Node-ID based Hello sessions is also
   optimal in detecting signaling adjacency failures for GMPLS-RSVP-TE
   and RSVP-TE when there is more than one link between a pair of nodes.
   Similarly, if all interfaces between a pair of nodes are unnumbered,
   the optimal way to use RSVP to detect signaling adjacency failure is
   to run Node-ID based Hello sessions.  Furthermore, in the case of an
   optical network with single or multiple numbered or unnumbered
   control channels, use of Node-ID based Hello messages for detecting
   signaling adjacency failure is also optimal.  Therefore, when link
   failure detection is performed by some means other than exchanging
   RSVP Hello messages, or if all interfaces between a pair of nodes are
   unnumbered, or in a GMPLS network with data and control plane
   separation, a node MUST run Node-ID based Hello sessions for
   detection of signaling adjacency failure for RSVP-TE.  Nonetheless,

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4558">RFC 4558</a>                Node-ID Based RSVP Hello               June 2006</span>


   if it is desirable to distinguish between signaling adjacency and
   link failures, Node-ID based Hello sessions can co-exist with the
   exchange of interface bound Hellos messages.  Similarly, if a pair of
   nodes share numbered and unnumbered TE links, Node-ID and interface
   based Hello sessions can co-exist.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Backward%20Compatibility%20Note"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Backward Compatibility Note</span>

   The procedure presented in this document is backward compatible with
   both [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>].

   Per [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>], the Hello mechanism is intended for use between
   immediate neighbors, and Hello messages are by default sent between
   direct RSVP neighbors.  This document does not modify this behavior,
   as it uses as "local node_id" the IPv4/IPv6 source address of the
   sending node and as "remote node_id" the IPv4/IPv6 destination
   address of the neighbor node.  TTL/Hop Limit setting and processing
   are also left unchanged.

   Moreover, this document does not modify the use of Hello Processing
   for State Recovery as defined in <a href="./rfc3473#section-9.3">Section 9.3 of [RFC3473]</a> (including
   definition and processing of the RESTART_CAP object).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   As this document does not modify or extend the RSVP Hello messages
   exchange between immediate RSVP neighbors, it does not introduce new
   security considerations.

   The security considerations pertaining to the original [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>]
   remain relevant.  RSVP message security is described in [<a href="./rfc2747" title='"RSVP Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC2747</a>] and
   provides Hello message integrity and authentication of the Node-ID
   ownership.
