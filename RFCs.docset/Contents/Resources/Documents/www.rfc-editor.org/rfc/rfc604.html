                         <span class="h1">Assigned Link Numbers</span>

This announcement modifies the official host-to-host protocol, and
updates the defining documents [NIC 8246, NIC 9347].  Please note that
the information on page 28 of "Host/Host Protocol for the ARPA Network"
about link number assignments is updated by this note, and that a
previous update [RFC 317, NIC 9347] is completely replaced.  The
modification is minor and should have no effect on existing network
programs or usage.  Four of the reserved link numbers are hereby
assigned for experimental use in the testing of an internetworking
protocol defined by Kahn and Cerf.

Description:

    Control Link

        Link 0 is assigned for use as the host-to-host protocol control
        link.

    Data Links

        Links 2-71 are available for use in connections as provided by
        the host-to-host protocol.

    Internetworking Protocol

        Links 155-158 are to be used for experiments with the
        Internetworking Protocol.

    Measurements

        Links 159-191 are assigned for use in measurements under the
        direction of the Network Measurement Center at UCLA.

    Message Switching

        Links 192-195 are to be used for experiments with the Message
        Switching Protocol.

    Private Experiments

        Links 196-255 are available for private experimental use.
