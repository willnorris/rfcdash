Abstract

   This document defines new options to discover the Broadcast and
   Multicast Service (BCMCS) controller in an IP network.  BCMCS is
   being developed for Third generation (3G) cellular telephone
   networks.  Users of the service interact with a controller in the
   network via the Mobile Node (MN) to derive information required to
   receive Broadcast and Multicast Service.  Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol can be used to configure the MN to access a particular
   controller.  This document defines the related options and option
   codes.

   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>] can be
   used to configure various non-IP address type of parameters.  These
   parameters are required for normal operation of various services that
   are offered over an IP network.

   Broadcast and Multicast Service (BCMCS) is one such service that is
   being standardized in various mobile wireless standard bodies such as
   Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), Open Mobile Alliance
   (OMA), and 3GPP.  A description of the BCMCS as defined in 3GPP2 can
   be found in [<a href="#ref-BCMCS" title='"X.S0022, Broadcast and Multicast Service in cdma2000 Wireless IP Network."'>BCMCS</a>].

   While DHCP already defines many options for device configuration, no
   option exists for configuring a mobile device to use BCMCS.  This
   memo defines extensions for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 so that DHCP can
   be used to provide necessary configuration information to a mobile
   device about the BCMCS controllers.

   DHCP is being used in 3GPP2, to assist Mobile Nodes (MNs) with the
   discovery of the BCMCS Controller in a mobile operator's IP network.
   The BCMCS includes a controller component that is responsible for
   managing the service via interaction with the MN and other network
   entities.  In this document, we will call this a BCMCS controller.

   An overview of the 3GPP2 BCMCS architecture is given in the next
   section.  It provides enough information to understand the basics of
   the 3GPP2 BCMCS operation.  Readers are encouraged to find a more
   detailed description in [<a href="#ref-BCMCS" title='"X.S0022, Broadcast and Multicast Service in cdma2000 Wireless IP Network."'>BCMCS</a>].

   As described in [<a href="#ref-BCMCS" title='"X.S0022, Broadcast and Multicast Service in cdma2000 Wireless IP Network."'>BCMCS</a>], the MNs are required to know the IPv4 or the
   IPv6 address of the BCMCS controller entity so that they can download
   all the necessary information about a desired broadcast and/or a
   multicast program.  In a roaming environment, static configuration of
   the BCMCS controller's IP address becomes unrealistic.  Therefore,
   DHCP is considered to be a method to dynamically configure the MNs
   with the IP address or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the
   BCMCS controller in the 3G cellular telephone networks.

   In order to allow the MNs to discover the BCMCS controllers, the MNs
   request the appropriate option codes from the DHCP server.  The DHCP
   servers need to return the corresponding configuration options that
   carry either BCMCS controller's IP address or FQDN based on
   configuration.  This document defines the necessary options and
   option codes.

   The Broadcast and Multicast Service architecture in a 3G cellular
   telephone network such as 3GPP2 has the following model:

                              +------------+   +--------+
                              |   BCMCS    |   |        |

                              |            |   | Server |
                              +------------+   +--------+
                                     ^

                                 Info|
                                     |
                                     |
                                     V
   +----+        +------------+    +------------+
   |    |        |            |    |            |

   Note that this figure is shown here for a basic understanding of how
   Broadcast and Multicast Service works in a 3G cellular telephone
   network.  The network elements except MN/user and the DHCP server are
   not relevant to the text in this document.

   The MN interacts with the BCMCS Controller to request broadcast/
   multicast program information from the network (e.g., scheduled time,
   multicast IP address, port numbers).  The MN may also be
   authenticated by the BCMCS Controller while downloading the relevant
   program-security-related information (such as encryption key).  These
   interactions may happen via HTTP and XML as defined in [<a href="#ref-BCMCS" title='"X.S0022, Broadcast and Multicast Service in cdma2000 Wireless IP Network."'>BCMCS</a>].
   There may be more than one BCMCS controller in the network.  The MN
   should discover the appropriate BCMCS controller to request the
   relevant program information.  For details of Broadcast and Multicast
   Service operation in 3GPP2, see [<a href="#ref-BCMCS" title='"X.S0022, Broadcast and Multicast Service in cdma2000 Wireless IP Network."'>BCMCS</a>].

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   This section defines the configuration option for the BCMCS
   controller of the Broadcast and Multicast Service.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Broadcast%20and%20Multicast%20Service%20Controller%20Domain%20Name%20List%20for"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Broadcast and Multicast Service Controller Domain Name List for</span>
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/DHCPv4"></a>      DHCPv4</span>

   The general format of the BCMCS Controller Domain list option for
   DHCPv4 is as follows:

           Code  Len  FQDN(s) of BCMCS Controller
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
         | 88  |  n  |  s1 |  s2 |  s3 |  s4 | s5  |  ...
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

   The option MAY contain multiple domain names, but these domain names
   SHOULD be used to construct Service Record (SRV) lookups as specified
   in [<a href="#ref-BCMCS" title='"X.S0022, Broadcast and Multicast Service in cdma2000 Wireless IP Network."'>BCMCS</a>], rather than querying for different A records.  The client
   can try any or ALL of the domain names to construct the SRV lookups.
   The list of domain names MAY contain the domain name of the access
   provider and its partner networks that also offer Broadcast and
   Multicast Service.

   As an example, the access provider may have one or more partners or
   resellers often termed as MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators)
   for Broadcast and Multicast Service.  In this case, the access
   provider should be able to use the same DHCP option to send multiple
   of those domain names (MVNOs).  To illustrate this further, let's
   assume that the access provider (operator) has a reseller agreement
   with two MVNOs: mvno1 and mvno2.  Therefore, the Broadcast and

   Multicast Service Controller Domain Name list for the DHCPv4 option
   will contain three domain names: operator.com, mvno1.com, and
   mvno2.com.  Upon receiving this option, the BCMCS client may choose
   to use one of the domain names to fetch the appropriate BCMCS
   controller address (based on user's preference or configuration).  If
   no preferred domain name is found in the received list, the client
   should use a default setting, e.g., use the first one in the list.

   If the length of the domain list exceeds the maximum permissible
   length within a single option (254 octets), then the domain list MUST
   be represented in the DHCPv4 message as specified in [<a href="./rfc3396" title='"Encoding Long Options in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4)"'>RFC3396</a>].  An
   example case when two controller domain names, example.com and
   example.net, are returned will be:

   The semantics and content of the DHCPv6 encoding of this option are
   exactly the same as the encoding described in the previous section,
   other than necessary differences between the way options are encoded
   in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.

   Specifically, the DHCPv6 option for the BCMCS Control Server Domain

   For DHCPv4, the client MAY request either or both of the BCMCS
   Controller Domain Name List and the IPv4 Address options in the
   Parameter Request List option (code 55) as defined in [<a href="./rfc2132" title='"DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions"'>RFC2132</a>].

   If the client receives both the BCMCS Controller Domain Name List and
   IPv6 or IPv4 Address options, it SHOULD use the Domain Name List
   option.  In this case, the client SHOULD NOT use the BCMCS Controller
   IPv6 or IPv4 Address option unless the server(s) in the BCMCS

   If a client requests both the options and the server is configured
   with both types of information, the server MAY send the client only
   one of the options if it is configured to do so.  In this case, the
   server SHOULD send the BCMCS Controller Domain Name List option.

   A server configured with the BCMCS Controller IPv6 or IPv4 Address
   information MUST send a client the BCMCS Controller IPv6 or IPv4
   Address option if that client requested only the BCMCS Controller
   IPv6 or IPv4 Address option and not the BCMCS Controller Domain Name
   List option in the ORO or Parameter Request List option.

   If a client requests for the BCMCS Controller IPv6 or IPv4 Address
   option and the server is configured only with the domain name(s), the
   server MUST return the Domain Name List and vice versa.

   The domain names MUST be concatenated and encoded using the technique
   described in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> of "Domain Names - Implementation and
   Specification" [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>].  DNS name compression MUST NOT be used.

   This document does not introduce any new security concerns beyond
   those specified in the basic DHCP [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>] and DHCPv6 [<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>]
   specifications.  In the absence of message integrity protection for
   these options, an attacker could modify the option values to divert
   requests for broadcast service.

   The following option codes for Broadcast and Multicast Service
   Controller option have been assigned by IANA:

   1.  The BCMCS Controller Domain Name list (<a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>) has been
   assigned a value of 88 from the DHCPv4 option space.

   2.  The BCMCS Controller Domain Name list (<a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>) has been
   assigned a value of 33 from the DHCPv6 option space, and a name of
   OPTION_BCMCS_SERVER_D.

   3.  The BCMCS Controller IPv4 Address option (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>) has been
   assigned a value of 89 from the DHCPv4 option space.

   4.  The BCMCS Controller IPv6 Address option (<a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>) has been
   assigned a value of 34 from the DHCPv6 option space, and a name of
   OPTION_BCMCS_SERVER_A.
