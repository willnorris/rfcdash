Abstract

   This document provides a model of information needed by the Routing
   and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) process in Wavelength Switched
   Optical Networks (WSONs).  The purpose of the information described
   in this model is to facilitate constrained optical path computation
   in WSONs.  This model takes into account compatibility constraints
   between WSON signal attributes and network elements but does not
   include constraints due to optical impairments.  Aspects of this
   information that may be of use to other technologies utilizing a
   GMPLS control plane are discussed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The purpose of the WSON information model described in this document
   is to facilitate constrained optical path computation, and as such it
   is not a general-purpose network management information model.  This
   constraint is frequently referred to as the "wavelength continuity"
   constraint, and the corresponding constrained optical path
   computation is known as the Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA)
   problem.  Hence, the information model must provide sufficient
   topology and wavelength restriction and availability information to
   support this computation.  More details on the RWA process and WSON
   subsystems and their properties can be found in [<a href="./rfc6163" title='"Framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element (PCE) Control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs)"'>RFC6163</a>].  The model
   defined here includes constraints between WSON signal attributes and
   network elements but does not include optical impairments.

   In addition to presenting an information model suitable for path
   computation in WSON, this document also highlights model aspects that
   may have general applicability to other technologies utilizing a
   GMPLS control plane.  The portion of the information model applicable
   to technologies beyond WSON is referred to as "general" to
   distinguish it from the "WSON-specific" portion that is applicable
   only to WSON technology.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   Refer to [<a href="./rfc6163" title='"Framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element (PCE) Control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs)"'>RFC6163</a>] for definitions of Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop
   Multiplexer (ROADM), RWA, Wavelength Conversion, Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (WDM), WSON, and other related terminology used in this
   document.

   The WSON RWA information model in this document comprises four
   categories of information.  The categories are independent of whether
   the information comes from a switching subsystem or from a line
   subsystem -- a switching subsystem refers to WSON nodes such as a
   ROADM or an Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer (OADM), and a line subsystem
   refers to devices such as WDM or Optical Amplifier.  The categories
   are these:

   o  Node Information

   o  Link Information

   o  Dynamic Node Information

   o  Dynamic Link Information




<span class="grey">Lee, et al.                   Informational                     [Page 3]</span></pre>

   Note that this is roughly the categorization used in Section 7 of
   [<a href="#ref-G.7715" title='"Architecture and requirements for routing in the automatically switched optical networks"'>G.7715</a>].

   In the following, where applicable, the Reduced Backus-Naur Form
   (RBNF) syntax of [<a href="#ref-RBNF" title='"Routing Backus-Naur Form (RBNF): A Syntax Used to Form Encoding Rules in Various Routing Protocol Specifications"'>RBNF</a>] is used to aid in defining the RWA
   information model.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Dynamic%20and%20Relatively%20Static%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Dynamic and Relatively Static Information</span>

   All the RWA information of concern in a WSON network is subject to
   change over time.  Equipment can be upgraded; links may be placed in
   or out of service and the like.  However, from the point of view of
   RWA computations, there is a difference between information that can
   change with each successive connection establishment in the network
   and information that is relatively static and independent of
   connection establishment.  A key example of the former is link
   wavelength usage since this can change with connection setup/teardown
   and this information is a key input to the RWA process.  Examples of
   relatively static information are the potential port connectivity of
   a WDM ROADM, and the channel spacing on a WDM link.

   This document separates, where possible, dynamic and static
   information so that these can be kept separate in possible encodings.
   This allows for separate updates of these two types of information,
   thereby reducing processing and traffic load caused by the timely
   distribution of the more dynamic RWA WSON information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Node%20Information%20%28General%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Node Information (General)</span>

   The node information described here contains the relatively static
   information related to a WSON node.  This includes connectivity
   constraints amongst ports and wavelengths since WSON switches can
   exhibit asymmetric switching properties.  Additional information
   could include properties of wavelength converters in the node, if any
   are present.  In [<a href="#ref-Switch" title='"Modeling WDM Wavelength Switching Systems for Use in GMPLS and Automated Path Computation"'>Switch</a>] it was shown that the wavelength
   connectivity constraints for a large class of practical WSON devices
   can be modeled via switched and fixed connectivity matrices along
   with corresponding switched and fixed port constraints.  These
   connectivity matrices are included with the node information, while
   the switched and fixed port wavelength constraints are included with
   the link information.

   Formally,

   &lt;Node_Information&gt; ::= &lt;Node_ID&gt; [&lt;ConnectivityMatrix&gt;...]

   Where the Node_ID would be an appropriate identifier for the node
   within the WSON RWA context.



<span class="grey">Lee, et al.                   Informational                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

   Note that multiple connectivity matrices are allowed and hence can
   fully support the most-general cases enumerated in [<a href="#ref-Switch" title='"Modeling WDM Wavelength Switching Systems for Use in GMPLS and Automated Path Computation"'>Switch</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Connectivity%20Matrix"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Connectivity Matrix</span>

   The connectivity matrix (ConnectivityMatrix) represents either the
   potential connectivity matrix for asymmetric switches (e.g., ROADMs
   and such) or fixed connectivity for an asymmetric device such as a
   multiplexer.  Note that this matrix does not represent any particular
   internal blocking behavior but indicates which input ports and
   wavelengths could possibly be connected to a particular output port.
   For a switch or ROADM, representing blocking that is dependent on the
   internal state is beyond the scope of this document.  Due to its
   highly implementation-dependent nature, it would most likely not be
   subject to standardization in the future.  The connectivity matrix is
   a conceptual M by N matrix representing the potential switched or
   fixed connectivity, where M represents the number of input ports and
   N the number of output ports.  This is a "conceptual" matrix since
   the matrix tends to exhibit structure that allows for very compact
   representations that are useful for both transmission and path
   computation.

   Note that the connectivity matrix information element can be useful
   in any technology context where asymmetric switches are utilized.

   &lt;ConnectivityMatrix&gt; ::= &lt;MatrixID&gt;

                            &lt;ConnType&gt;

                            &lt;Matrix&gt;

   Where

   &lt;MatrixID&gt; is a unique identifier for the matrix.

   &lt;ConnType&gt; can be either 0 or 1 depending upon whether the
   connectivity is either fixed or switched.

   &lt;Matrix&gt; represents the fixed or switched connectivity in that
   Matrix(i, j) = 0 or 1 depending on whether input port i can connect
   to output port j for one or more wavelengths.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Node%20Information%20%28WSON%20Specific%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Node Information (WSON Specific)</span>

   As discussed in [<a href="./rfc6163" title='"Framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element (PCE) Control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs)"'>RFC6163</a>], a WSON node may contain electro-optical
   subsystems such as regenerators, wavelength converters or entire
   switching subsystems.  The model present here can be used in
   characterizing the accessibility and availability of limited

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7446">RFC 7446</a>                 WSON Information Model            February 2015</span>


   resources such as regenerators or wavelength converters as well as
   WSON signal attribute constraints of electro-optical subsystems.  As
   such, this information element is fairly specific to WSON
   technologies.

   In this document, the term "resource" is used to refer to a physical
   component of a WSON node such as a regenerator or a wavelength
   converter.  Multiple instances of such components are often present
   within a single WSON node.  This term is not to be confused with the
   concept of forwarding or switching resources such as bandwidth or
   lambdas.

   A WSON node may include regenerators or wavelength converters
   arranged in a shared pool.  As discussed in [<a href="./rfc6163" title='"Framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element (PCE) Control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs)"'>RFC6163</a>], a WSON node
   can also include WDM switches that use optical-electronic-optical
   (OEO) processing.  There are a number of different approaches used in
   the design of WDM switches containing regenerator or converter pools.
   However, from the point of view of path computation, the following
   need to be known:

   1.  The nodes that support regeneration or wavelength conversion.

   2.  The accessibility and availability of a wavelength converter to
       convert from a given input wavelength on a particular input port
       to a desired output wavelength on a particular output port.

   3.  Limitations on the types of signals that can be converted and the
       conversions that can be performed.

   Since resources tend to be packaged together in blocks of similar
   devices, e.g., on line cards or other types of modules, the
   fundamental unit of identifiable resource in this document is the
   "resource block".

   A resource block is a collection of resources from the same WSON node
   that are grouped together for administrative reasons and for ease of
   encoding in the protocols.  All resources in the same resource block
   behave in the same way and have similar characteristics relevant to
   the optical system, e.g., processing properties, accessibility, etc.

   A resource pool is a collection of resource blocks for the purpose of
   representing throughput or cross-connect capabilities in a WSON node.
   A resource pool associates input ports or links on the node with
   output ports or links and is used to indicate how signals may be
   passed from an input port or link to an output port or link by way of
   a resource block (in other words, by way of a resource).  A resource
   pool may, therefore, be modeled as a matrix.




<span class="grey">Lee, et al.                   Informational                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7446">RFC 7446</a>                 WSON Information Model            February 2015</span>


   A resource block may be present in multiple resource pools.

   This leads to the following formal high-level model:

   &lt;Node_Information&gt; ::= &lt;Node_ID&gt;

                          [&lt;ConnectivityMatrix&gt;...]

                          [&lt;ResourcePool&gt;]

   Where

   &lt;ResourcePool&gt; ::= &lt;ResourceBlockInfo&gt;...

                     [&lt;ResourceAccessibility&gt;...]

                     [&lt;ResourceWaveConstraints&gt;...]

                     [&lt;RBPoolState&gt;]

   First, the accessibility of resource blocks is addressed; then, their
   properties are discussed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Resource%20Accessibility%2FAvailability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Resource Accessibility/Availability</span>

   A similar technique as used to model ROADMs, and optical switches can
   be used to model regenerator/converter accessibility.  This technique
   was generally discussed in [<a href="./rfc6163" title='"Framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element (PCE) Control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs)"'>RFC6163</a>] and consisted of a matrix to
   indicate possible connectivity along with wavelength constraints for
   links/ports.  Since regenerators or wavelength converters may be
   considered a scarce resource, it is desirable that the model include,
   if desired, the usage state (availability) of individual regenerators
   or converters in the pool.  Models that incorporate more state to
   further reveal blocking conditions on input or output to particular
   converters are for further study and not included here.

   The three-stage model is shown schematically in Figures 1 and 2.  The
   difference between the two figures is that in Figure 1 it's assumed
   that each signal that can get to a resource block may do so, while in
   Figure 2 the access to sets of resource blocks is via a shared fiber
   that imposes its own wavelength collision constraint.  Figure 1 shows
   that there can be more than one input to each resource block since
   each input represents a single wavelength signal, while Figure 2
   shows a single WDM input or output, e.g., a fiber, to/from each set
   of blocks.






<span class="grey">Lee, et al.                   Informational                     [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-8"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7446">RFC 7446</a>                 WSON Information Model            February 2015</span>


   This model assumes N input ports (fibers), P resource blocks
   containing one or more identical resources (e.g., wavelength
   converters), and M output ports (fibers).  Since not all input ports
   can necessarily reach each resource block, the model starts with a
   resource pool input matrix RI(i,p) = {0,1} depending on whether input
   port i can potentially reach resource block p.

   Since not all wavelengths can necessarily reach all the resources or
   the resources may have limited input wavelength range, the model has
   a set of relatively static input port constraints for each resource.
   In addition, if the access to a set of resource blocks is via a
   shared fiber (Figure 2), this would impose a dynamic wavelength
   availability constraint on that shared fiber.  The resource block
   input port constraint is modeled via a static wavelength set
   mechanism, and the case of shared access to a set of blocks is
   modeled via a dynamic wavelength set mechanism.

   Next, a state vector RA(j) = {0,...,k} is used to track the number of
   resources in resource block j in use.  This is the only state kept in
   the resource pool model.  This state is not necessary for modeling
   "fixed" transponder system or full OEO switches with WDM interfaces,
   i.e., systems where there is no sharing.

   After that, a set of static resource output wavelength constraints
   and possibly dynamic shared output fiber constraints maybe used.  The
   static constraints indicate what wavelengths a particular resource
   block can generate or is restricted to generating, e.g., a fixed
   regenerator would be limited to a single lambda.  The dynamic
   constraints would be used in the case where a single shared fiber is
   used to output the resource block (Figure 2).

   Finally, to complete the model, a resource pool output matrix RE(p,k)
   = {0,1} depending on whether the output from resource block p can
   reach output port k, may be used.

   Formally, the model can be specified as:

                               &lt;PoolOutputMatrix&gt;

                        [&lt;RBPoolState&gt;]

   Note that, except for &lt;RBPoolState&gt;, all the components of
   &lt;ResourcePool&gt; are relatively static.  Also, the
   &lt;InAvailableWavelengths&gt; and &lt;OutAvailableWavelengths&gt; are only used
   in the cases of shared input or output access to the particular
   block.  See the resource block information in the next section for
   how this is specified.

   The wavelength conversion abilities of a resource (e.g., regenerator,
   wavelength converter) were modeled in the &lt;OutputWaveConstraints&gt;
   previously discussed.  As discussed in [<a href="./rfc6163" title='"Framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element (PCE) Control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs)"'>RFC6163</a>], the constraints on
   an electro-optical resource can be modeled in terms of input
   constraints, processing capabilities, and output constraints:

   &lt;ResourceBlockInfo&gt; ::= &lt;ResourceBlockSet&gt;

                           [&lt;InputConstraints&gt;]

                           [&lt;ProcessingCapabilities&gt;]

                           [&lt;OutputConstraints&gt;]

   Where  &lt;ResourceBlockSet&gt; is a list of resource block identifiers
   with the same characteristics.  If this set is missing, the
   constraints are applied to the entire network element.

   The &lt;InputConstraints&gt; are constraints are based on signal
   compatibility and/or shared access constraint indication.  The
   details of these constraints are defined in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>.

   &lt;InputConstraints&gt; ::= &lt;SharedInput&gt;

                          [&lt;OpticalInterfaceClassList&gt;]

                          [&lt;ClientSignalList&gt;]

   The &lt;ProcessingCapabilities&gt; are important operations that the
   resource (or network element) can perform on the signal.  The details
   of these capabilities are defined in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>.



<span class="grey">Lee, et al.                   Informational                    [Page 11]</span></pre>

   &lt;ProcessingCapabilities&gt; ::= [&lt;NumResources&gt;]

                                [&lt;RegenerationCapabilities&gt;]

                                [&lt;FaultPerfMon&gt;]

                                [&lt;VendorSpecific&gt;]

   The &lt;OutputConstraints&gt; are either restrictions on the properties of
   the signal leaving the block, options concerning the signal
   properties when leaving the resource, or shared fiber output
   constraint indication.

   &lt;OutputConstraints&gt; := &lt;SharedOutput&gt;

                          [&lt;OpticalInterfaceClassList&gt;]

                          [&lt;ClientSignalList&gt;]

   As discussed in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a> and shown in Figure 2, the input or
   output access to a resource block may be via a shared fiber.  The
   &lt;SharedInput&gt; and &lt;SharedOutput&gt; elements are indicators for this
   condition with respect to the block being described.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.2.%20%20Optical%20Interface%20Class%20List"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.2" id="section-5.3.2">5.3.2</a>.  Optical Interface Class List</span>

      &lt;OpticalInterfaceClassList&gt; ::= &lt;OpticalInterfaceClass&gt; ...

   The Optical Interface Class is a unique number that identifies all
   information related to optical characteristics of a physical
   interface.  The class may include other optical parameters related to
   other interface properties.  A class always includes signal
   compatibility information.

   The content of each class is out of the scope of this document and
   can be defined by other entities (e.g., the ITU, optical equipment
   vendors, etc.).

   Since even current implementation of physical interfaces may support
   different optical characteristics, a single interface may support
   multiple interface classes.  Which optical interface class is used
   among all the ones available for an interface is out of the scope of
   this document but is an output of the RWA process.

   The list is simply:

   Where the Generalized Protocol Identifiers (G-PID) object represents
   one of the IETF-standardized G-PID values as defined in [<a href="./rfc3471" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Functional Description"'>RFC3471</a>] and

   The ProcessingCapabilities are defined in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>.

   The processing capability list sub-TLV is a list of processing
   functions that the WSON network element (NE) can perform on the
   signal including:

      1.  number of resources within the block

      2.  regeneration capability

      3.  fault and performance monitoring

      4.  vendor-specific capability

   Note that the code points for fault and performance monitoring and
   vendor-specific capability are subject to further study.

   [<a href="./rfc4203" title='"OSPF Extensions in Support of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)"'>RFC4203</a>] and IS-IS [<a href="./rfc5307" title='"IS-IS Extensions in Support of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)"'>RFC5307</a>] provide the bulk of the relatively
   static link information needed by the RWA process.  However, WSONs
   bring in additional link-related constraints.  These stem from
   characterizing WDM line systems, restricting laser transmitter
   tuning, and switching subsystem port wavelength constraints, e.g.,
   "colored" ROADM drop ports.

   The following syntax summarizes both information from existing GMPLS
   routing protocols and new information that may be needed by the RWA
   process.

   allows for the identification of a data-channel link metric value for
   traffic engineering that is separate from the metric used for path
   cost computation of the control plane.

   Note that multiple "link metric values" could find use in optical
   networks; however, it would be more useful to the RWA process to
   assign these specific meanings such as "link mile" metric,
   "probability of failure" metric, etc.

   Port label restrictions could be applied generally to any label types
   in GMPLS by adding new kinds of restrictions.  Wavelength is a type
   of label.

   Port label (wavelength) restrictions (PortLabelRestriction) model the
   label (wavelength) restrictions that the link and various optical
   devices, such as Optical Cross-Connects (OXCs), ROADMs, and waveband
   multiplexers, may impose on a port.  These restrictions tell us what
   wavelength may or may not be used on a link and are relatively
   static.  This plays an important role in fully characterizing a WSON
   switching device [<a href="#ref-Switch" title='"Modeling WDM Wavelength Switching Systems for Use in GMPLS and Automated Path Computation"'>Switch</a>].  Port wavelength restrictions are
   specified relative to the port in general or to a specific
   connectivity matrix (<a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).  [<a href="#ref-Switch" title='"Modeling WDM Wavelength Switching Systems for Use in GMPLS and Automated Path Computation"'>Switch</a>] gives an example where
   both switch and fixed connectivity matrices are used and both types

   Where

   MatrixID is the ID of the corresponding connectivity matrix (<a href="#section-4.1">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>).

   The RestrictionType parameter is used to specify general port
   restrictions and matrix-specific restrictions.  It can take the
   following values and meanings:

      SIMPLE_LABEL:   Simple label (wavelength) set restriction; the
         LabelSet parameter is required.

      CHANNEL_COUNT: The number of channels is restricted to be less
         than or equal to the MaxNumChannels parameter (which is
         required).

      LABEL_RANGE:  Used to indicate a restriction on a range of labels
         that can be switched.  For example, a waveband device with a
         tunable center frequency and passband.  This constraint is
         characterized by the MaxLabelRange parameter, which indicates
         the maximum range of the labels, e.g., which may represent a
         waveband in terms of channels.  Note that an additional
         parameter can be used to indicate the overall tuning range.
         Specific center frequency tuning information can be obtained
         from information about the dynamic channel in use.  It is
         assumed that both center frequency and bandwidth (Q) tuning can
         be done without causing faults in existing signals.

      SIMPLE LABEL and CHANNEL COUNT: In this case, the accompanying
         label set and MaxNumChannels indicate labels permitted on the
         port and the maximum number of labels that can be
         simultaneously used on the port.

      LINK LABEL_EXCLUSIVITY: A label (wavelength) can be used at most
         once among a given set of ports.  The set of ports is specified
         as a parameter to this constraint.

   Restriction-specific parameters are used with one or more of the
   previously listed restriction types.  The currently defined
   parameters are:

      LabelSet is a conceptual set of labels (wavelengths).

      MaxNumChannels is the maximum number of channels that can be
         simultaneously used (relative to either a port or a matrix).

      LinkSet is a conceptual set of ports.

   MaxLabelRange indicates the maximum range of the labels.  For
   example, if the port is a "colored" drop port of a ROADM, then there
   are two restrictions: (a) CHANNEL_COUNT, with MaxNumChannels = 1, and
   (b) SIMPLE_WAVELENGTH, with the wavelength set consisting of a single
   member corresponding to the frequency of the permitted wavelength.
   See [<a href="#ref-Switch" title='"Modeling WDM Wavelength Switching Systems for Use in GMPLS and Automated Path Computation"'>Switch</a>] for a complete waveband example.

   This information model for port wavelength (label) restrictions is
   fairly general in that it can be applied to ports that have label
   restrictions only or to ports that are part of an asymmetric switch
   and have label restrictions.  In addition, the types of label
   restrictions that can be supported are extensible.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.6.1.%20%20Port-Wavelength%20Exclusivity%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.6.1" id="section-6.6.1">6.6.1</a>.  Port-Wavelength Exclusivity Example</span>

   Although there can be many different ROADM or switch architectures
   that can lead to the constraint where a lambda (label) maybe used at
   most once on a set of ports, Figure 3 shows a ROADM architecture
   based on components known as Wavelength Selective Switches (WSSes)
   [<a href="#ref-OFC08" title='"Evolution to Colorless and Directionless ROADM Architectures"'>OFC08</a>].  This ROADM is composed of splitters, combiners, and WSSes.
   This ROADM has 11 output ports, which are numbered in the diagram.
   Output ports 1-8 are known as drop ports and are intended to support
   a single wavelength.  Drop ports 1-4 output from WSS 2, which is fed
   from WSS 1 via a single fiber.  Due to this internal structure, a
   constraint is placed on the output ports 1-4 that a lambda can be
   used only once over the group of ports (assuming unicast and not
   multicast operation).  The output ports 5-8 have a similar constraint
   due to the internal structure.

   In the previously presented information model, there are a limited
   number of information elements that are dynamic, i.e., subject to
   change with subsequent establishment and teardown of connections.
   Depending on the protocol used to convey this overall information
   model, it may be possible to send this dynamic information separately
   from the relatively larger amount of static information needed to
   characterize WSONs and their network elements.

   For WSON links, the wavelength availability and which wavelengths are
   in use for shared backup purposes can be considered dynamic
   information and hence are grouped with the dynamic information in the
   following set:

   &lt;DynamicLinkInfo&gt; ::=  &lt;LinkID&gt;

                          &lt;AvailableLabels&gt;

                          [&lt;SharedBackupLabels&gt;]

   AvailableLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths) currently available
   on the link.  Given this information and the port wavelength
   restrictions, one can also determine which wavelengths are currently
   in use.  This parameter could potentially be used with other
   technologies that GMPLS currently covers or may cover in the future.

   SharedBackupLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths) currently used
   for shared backup protection on the link.  An example usage of this
   information in a WSON setting is given in [<a href="#ref-Shared" title='"Shared Backup Mesh Protection in PCE-based WSON Networks"'>Shared</a>].  This parameter
   could potentially be used with other technologies that GMPLS
   currently covers or may cover in the future.

   Note that the above does not dictate a particular encoding or
   placement for available label information.  In some routing
   protocols, it may be advantageous or required to place this
   information within another information element such as the Interface
   Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD).  Consult the extensions that
   are specific to each routing protocol for details of placement of
   information elements.

   Currently the only node information that can be considered dynamic is
   the resource pool state, and it can be isolated into a dynamic node
   information element as follows:

   &lt;DynamicNodeInfo&gt; ::=  &lt;NodeID&gt; [&lt;ResourcePool&gt;]

   This document discusses an information model for RWA computation in
   WSONs.  From a security standpoint, such a model is very similar to
   the information that can be currently conveyed via GMPLS routing
   protocols.  Such information includes network topology, link state
   and current utilization, as well as the capabilities of switches and

   routers within the network.  As such, this information should be
   protected from disclosure to unintended recipients.  In addition, the
   intentional modification of this information can significantly affect
   network operations, particularly due to the large capacity of the
   optical infrastructure to be controlled.  A general discussion on
   security in GMPLS networks can be found in [<a href="./rfc5920" title='"Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS Networks"'>RFC5920</a>].
