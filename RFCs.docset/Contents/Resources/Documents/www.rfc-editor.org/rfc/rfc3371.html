   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet Community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing L2TP
   devices.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119">RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.0%20The%20SNMP%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.0" id="section-2.0">2.0</a> The SNMP Management Framework</span>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o An overall architecture, described in <a href="./rfc2571">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="./rfc2571" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].

   o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
     16, <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="./rfc1155" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>RFC1155</a>], STD 16, <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="./rfc1212" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>RFC1212</a>] and <a href="./rfc1215">RFC 1215</a>
     [<a href="./rfc1215" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>RFC1215</a>].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
     58, <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC</a>
     <a href="./rfc2580">2580</a> [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

   o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="./rfc1157" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>].  A second version of the
     SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="./rfc1901">RFC 1901</a> [<a href="./rfc1901" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>RFC1901</a>] and
     <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="./rfc1906" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>].  The third version of the message protocol is
     called SNMPv3 and described in <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="./rfc1906" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>], <a href="./rfc2572">RFC 2572</a>
     [<a href="./rfc2572" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2572</a>] and <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="./rfc2574" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2574</a>].

   o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
     described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="./rfc1157" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>].  A second set of protocol
     operations and associated PDU formats is described in <a href="./rfc1905">RFC 1905</a>
     [<a href="./rfc1905" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1905</a>].

   o A set of fundamental applications described in <a href="./rfc2573">RFC 2573</a> [<a href="./rfc2573" title='"SNMPv3 Applications"'>RFC2573</a>]
     and the view-based access control mechanism described in <a href="./rfc2575">RFC 2575</a>
     [<a href="./rfc2575" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in <a href="./rfc2570">RFC 2570</a> [<a href="./rfc2570" title='"Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC2570</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3371">RFC 3371</a>            L2TP Management Information Base         August 2002</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.0%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.0" id="section-3.0">3.0</a> Overview</span>

   The objects defined in this MIB are to be used when describing Layer
   Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) tunnels.  The L2TP protocol is defined
   in [<a href="./rfc2661" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - L2TP"'>RFC2661</a>].  This MIB consists of seven groups briefly described
   below:

   l2tpConfigGroup
   l2tpStatsGroup
      These two groups of objects provide information on the
      configuration, state and statistics of the L2TP protocol, its
      tunnels and sessions.  These groups are mandatory for implementors
      of this MIB.

   l2tpDomainGroup
      This optional group of objects provides configuration, state and
      statistical information for L2TP tunnel endpoint domains.  A L2TP
      tunnel endpoint domain is considered to be a collection of L2TP
      devices typically belonging to a common administrative domain or
      geographic location.

   l2tpMappingGroup
      This optional group contains mapping tables to assist management
      applications to map between protocol identifiers and table
      indices.

   l2tpIpUdpGroup
      This group provides the state and statistics information for L2TP
      tunnels which are being transported by UDP/IP.  This group is
      mandatory for L2TP implementations that support L2TP over UDP/IP.

   l2tpSecurityGroup
      This group is optional for SNMP agents which support both
      authentication and privacy of SNMP messages for the management of
      L2TP keys.

   l2tpTrapGroup
      This group contains the notifications that could be generated by a
      L2TP implementation.

   l2tpHCPacketGroup
         This group is optional for L2TP implementations that could
         potentially overflow the L2TP Domain tables 32-bit statistics
         counters in less than an hour.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1%20Relationship%20to%20the%20Interface%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a> Relationship to the Interface MIB</span>

   This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the Interfaces
   MIB [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>].  Several areas of correlation are addressed in the
   following subsections.  The implementor is referred to the Interfaces
   MIB document in order to understand the general intent of these
   areas.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.1%20%20Layering%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" id="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>  Layering Model</span>

   This MIB contains several tables which are extensions to the IP
   Tunnel MIB described in [<a href="./rfc2667" title='"IP Tunnel MIB"'>RFC2667</a>] which itself defines extensions to
   the Interface MIB [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>].  An L2TP tunnel is represented as a
   separate identifiable logical interface sub-layer.  The tunnel stack
   layering model is described in [<a href="./rfc2667" title='"IP Tunnel MIB"'>RFC2667</a>].

   In addition to that described in [<a href="./rfc2667" title='"IP Tunnel MIB"'>RFC2667</a>] an L2TP tunnel will not be
   at the top of the ifStack on a L2TP device that is acting as a L2TP
   Network Server (LNS).  In this case PPP interfaces will be layered on
   top of the tunnel interface.

   In the example diagram below, the interface layering is shown as it
   might appear at the LNS.

   The ifStackTable is used to describe the layering of the interface
   sub-layers.  For the example given above the ifTable and ifStackTable
   may appear as follows:

   The corresponding ifStack table entries would then be:

           ifStackTable Entries

           HigherLayer  LowerLayer
           0            5

           7            3
           7            4

   L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) tunnel interfaces on the other hand
   appear at the top of the interface layering stack.  In this case the
   layering model is as described in [<a href="./rfc2667" title='"IP Tunnel MIB"'>RFC2667</a>].

   However in order to support the tunneling of packets received from
   interfaces carrying framed PPP packets on the LAC to the LNS (and the
   propagation of decapsulated PPP packets to that interface) additional
   configuration is required.  This is further described in <a href="#section-3.4">section 3.4</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.2%20%20Interface%20MIB%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2" id="section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>  Interface MIB Objects</span>

   Except where noted in the tables below, all objects MUST be supported
   from the ifGeneralInformationGroup and one of the following three
   groups:

      o ifPacketGroup OR
      o ifHCPacketGroup OR
      o ifVHCPacketGroup

   depending on the particular implementation.

   The following tables describe how objects from the
   ifGeneralInformationGroup and ifPacketGroup (similar support should
   be provided for the high and very high capacity packet groups) are to
   be interpreted and supported for L2TP tunnel interfaces.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.2.1%20%20L2TP%20Tunnel%20Interfaces"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2.1" id="section-3.1.2.1">3.1.2.1</a>  L2TP Tunnel Interfaces</span>

   All Interface MIB objects not listed in the above groups for L2TP
   tunnel interfaces MUST be supported as described in [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>].

      Interface MIB Object    Support Description
      ====================    ========================================
      ifTable.ifDescr         Refer to the Interface MIB.

      ifTable.ifType          tunnel(131).

      ifTable.ifMtu           Dependent on the tunnel transport layer.
                              For UDP/IP transports the MTU should
                              be 65467 (65535-60(IP)-8(UDP)).

      ifTable.ifSpeed         Return zero.

      ifTable.ifPhyAddress    The assigned tunnel identifier.

      ifTable.ifAdminStatus   Setting ifAdminStatus to 'up' injects a
                              'Local Open' request into the tunnel FSM.
                              Setting ifAdminStatus to 'down' injects
                              a 'Tunnel Close' event into the tunnel
                              FSM.  Setting ifAdminStatus to 'testing'
                              is not currently defined but could be
                              used to test tunnel connectivity.

      ifTable.ifOperStatus    ifOperStatus values are to be interpreted

   The IP Tunnel MIB [<a href="./rfc2667" title='"IP Tunnel MIB"'>RFC2667</a>] describes tunnel interfaces that have an
   ifType of tunnel(131).  The IP Tunnel MIB is considered to contain a
   collection of objects common to all IP tunneling protocols, including
   L2TP.  In addition to the IP Tunnel MIB, tunnel encapsulation
   specific MIBs (like this MIB) extend the IP Tunnel MIB to further
   describe encapsulation specific information.  Implementation of the
   IP Tunnel MIB is required for L2TP tunnels over IP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3%20%20L2TP%20Tunnel%20Creation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>  L2TP Tunnel Creation</span>

   Tunnel creation is detailed for tunnels over IP in the IP Tunnel MIB.
   The creation of a tunnelIfEntry in [<a href="./rfc2667" title='"IP Tunnel MIB"'>RFC2667</a>] when the encapsulation
   method is "l2tp" will have the side effect of creating entries in the
   l2tpTunnelConfigTable, l2tpTunnelStatsTable and the
   l2tpUdpStatsTable's.

   The creation of L2TP tunnel interfaces over transports other than IP
   is expected to be defined in the MIB definition for that specific
   L2TP tunnel transport.

   The l2tpSessionMapTable table allows management applications to
   determine which session within a tunnel a particular interface
   (either a PPP or DS0 interface) is mapped to.  On the LAC it also
   provides a management application the ability to map a particular
   physical or virtual interface terminating a PPP link to a particular
   L2TP tunnel.  This is required since the interface stacking as
   performed (and instrumented by the ifStackTable) on the LNS cannot be
   applied at the LAC.

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to L2TP tunnel interfaces.  There are also a number of
   objects that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
   create, such as those which allow an administrator to dynamically
   configure tunnels.

   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause
   a denial of service, or could cause unauthorized creation and/or
   manipulation of tunnels.  Hence, the support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec [<a href="./rfc2401" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC2401</a>]), even
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   If the agent allows configuring keys (for example the
   l2tpDomainConfigSecret object) via SNMP, for use by L2TP, then the
   security of L2TP is at best only as secure as SNMP.  For this reason,
   all objects in the l2tpSecurityGroup MUST NOT be accessible via
   unencrypted messages.  It is also recommended that keys not be made
   visible through SNMP GET (or GET-NEXT or GET-BULK) messages, even if
   encryption is used.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="./rfc2574" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2574</a>] and the View-
   based Access Control Model <a href="./rfc2575">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="./rfc2575" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to access them.
