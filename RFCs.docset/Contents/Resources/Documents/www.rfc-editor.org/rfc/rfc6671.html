Status of This Memo

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes.

   This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF).  It represents the consensus of the IETF community.  It has
   received public review and has been approved for publication by the
   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).  Not all documents
   approved by the IESG are a candidate for any level of Internet
   Standard; see <a href="./rfc5741#section-2">SectionÂ 2 of RFC 5741</a>.

IESG Note

   The IESG notes that the IETF has developed a set of OAM tools for
   MPLS-TP that have been published as Standards Track RFCs.  A list of
   the relevant RFCs can be found in <a href="./rfc6669">RFC 6669</a>.  The approval of this
   document and the assignment of an ACh Type does not constitute
   endorsement by the IETF of the alternate MPLS-TP OAM documented in
   G.8113.1.  The IESG recommends instead that the RFCs noted above
   should be implemented.

   The Transport Profile of MPLS (MPLS-TP) defined in [<a href="./rfc5654" title='"Requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile"'>RFC5654</a>] is a
   profile of MPLS technology for use in packet transport networks.  The
   MPLS-TP profile includes a set of Operations, Administration, and
   Management (OAM) tools defined by the IETF [<a href="./rfc6669" title='"An Overview of the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tool Set for MPLS- Based Transport Networks"'>RFC6669</a>] that are used to
   meet the OAM functional requirements defined in [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>].

   ITU-T Recommendation [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>] documents MPLS-TP OAM.  This
   Recommendation builds upon Ethernet OAM as documented in [<a href="#ref-Y.1731" title='"OAM functions and mechanisms for Ethernet based networks"'>Y.1731</a>].
   The messages in [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>] are defined to be carried in a new Generic
   Associated Channel (G-ACh) Type in the MPLS Generic Associated
   Channel.  In order to carry these messages in an interoperable
   fashion, a Generic Associated Channel Type from the IANA maintained
   registry "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types" is to be used.

   To fulfill the request from ITU-T SG15 in [<a href="#ref-LS370" title='"Liaison Statement: LS370 - Current status of Recommendation ITU-T G.8113.1/Y.1372.1, Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>LS370</a>] and to allow
   deployment of the [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>] OAM solution without using an
   experimental G-ACh Type, IANA has assigned a G-ACh Type &lt;0x8902&gt; for
   use by the ITU-T for [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>].  This G-ACh Type is known as the
   "G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type".

   A number of experts in the IETF do not consider that the development
   or deployment of a second protocol solution within the same
   architectural problem space is necessary or advisable [<a href="./rfc6670" title='"The Reasons for Selecting a Single Solution for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)"'>RFC6670</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Scope%20of%20the%20G.8113.1%20OAM%20G-ACh%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Scope of the G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type</span>

   The G-ACh Type assigned by this document MUST only be used for OAM
   messages, as defined in the ITU-T Recommendation [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>], carried
   in the G-ACh.  The OAM messages and procedures carried behind this
   G-ACh Type are restricted to only those that address the OAM
   functional requirements defined in [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>].  Other message types
   MUST NOT be carried behind this G-ACh Type.

   All ITU-T Recommendations are subject to updates by errata,
   corrigenda, amendments, or complete revisions.  In any update of
   [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>], the G-ACh Type assigned by this document MUST NOT be used
   for any functions not identified as OAM functional requirements in
   [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>].  An update of [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>] may use the G-ACh Type assigned
   by this document to support the OAM functions identified in
   [<a href="./rfc5860" title='"Requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS Transport Networks"'>RFC5860</a>].  When an amendment or complete revision of G.8113.1 is
   approved, the reference to [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>], provided in this document,
   should be updated to show the approval date of the new version.

   The G-ACh Type assigned by this document may be used on any transport
   construct that uses the G-ACh, e.g., MPLS-TP Sections, MPLS-TP LSPs,
   or PWs as described in [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>].

   As noted in [<a href="./rfc5586" title='"MPLS Generic Associated Channel"'>RFC5586</a>], when new G-ACh Types are defined, the
   "security considerations MUST be described in the relevant associated
   channel type specification".  The IETF takes this opportunity to
   remind the ITU-T of the need to describe security considerations in
   [<a href="#ref-G.8113.1" title='"Operations, Administration and Maintenance mechanism for MPLS-TP in Packet Transport Network (PTN)"'>G.8113.1</a>].
