Abstract

   This document reorganizes the naming of already-allocated TLV (type-
   length-value) types and type extensions in the "Mobile Ad hoc NETwork
   (MANET) Parameters" registries defined by <a href="./rfc5444">RFC 5444</a> to use names
   appropriately.  It has no consequences in terms of any protocol
   implementation.

   This document also updates the Expert Review guidelines in <a href="./rfc5444">RFC 5444</a>,
   so as to establish a policy for consistent naming of future TLV type
   and type extension allocations.  It makes no other changes to
   <a href="./rfc5444">RFC 5444</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7631">RFC 7631</a>                       TLV Naming                 September 2015</span>

   This document reorganizes and rationalizes the naming of TLVs (type-
   length-value structures) defined by [<a href="./rfc5444" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>] and recorded by IANA in
   the following subregistries of the "Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET)
   Parameters" registry: "Packet TLV Types", "Message TLV Types", and
   "Address Block TLV Types".

   This document reorganizes the naming of already-allocated Packet,
   Message, and Address Block TLV types, and their corresponding type
   extensions.  It also updates the corresponding IANA registries.

   TLVs have a type (one octet) and a type extension (one octet) that
   together form a full type (of two octets).  A TLV may omit the type
   extension when it is zero.  However, that applies only to its
   representation; it still has a type extension of zero.  A TLV type
   defines an IANA registry of type extensions for that type.

   There have been two forms of TLV allocation.

   The first, but less common, form of allocation has been that
   allocation of the TLV type has defined (but not necessarily
   allocated) all the type extensions for that TLV type.  This applies,
   for example, to the Address Block TLV LINK_METRIC specified in
   [<a href="./rfc7181" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>].  The LINK_METRIC type extensions are all available for
   allocation for different definitions of link metric.  It is
   appropriate in this case to apply the name LINK_METRIC to the type,
   and also to all the full types corresponding to that type, as has
   been done.  Type extensions can then be individually named or can be
   simply referred to by their number.

   The second, more common, form of allocation has been that allocation
   of the TLV type has defined only type extension 0, and possibly type
   extension 1, for that TLV type.  An example is the Address Block TLV
   LINK_STATUS defined in [<a href="./rfc6130" title='"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)"'>RFC6130</a>], where only type extension 0 is
   allocated.  It is not reasonable to assume that the remaining 255
   type extensions will be allocated to forms of LINK_STATUS.  (Other
   forms of link status are already catered to by the introduction, in
   [<a href="./rfc7188" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2) and MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) Extension TLVs"'>RFC7188</a>], of a registry for values of the LINK_STATUS TLV.)  Thus,
   the name LINK_STATUS should be attached to the specific type
   extension for that type, i.e., to the full type and not to the TLV
   type when used with any other type extensions.  This was, however,
   not done as part of the initial registration of this TLV type.
   Effectively, this leaves, for the LINK_STATUS TLV type, the type
   extensions 1-255 either unavailable for allocation (if applying
   strictly the interpretation that they must relate to a LINK_STATUS)
   or counterintuitively named for their intended function.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7631">RFC 7631</a>                       TLV Naming                 September 2015</span>


   The purpose of this document is to change how names of the second
   form are applied and recorded in IANA registries, and to provide
   guidelines and instructions for future TLV type allocations.  This is
   to facilitate the addition of new TLVs using type extensions other
   than 0, but without them having inappropriate names attached.  So,
   for example, LINK_STATUS will become the name of the full type
   (composed of the TLV type 3 and the TLV type extension 0) and will
   cease being the name of the TLV type 3.  This leaves the question of
   how to name the type.  As it is not clear what other TLVs might be
   defined for other type extensions of the same type, the type is
   currently left unnamed and specified only by number.

   This document also updates the Expert Review guidelines from
   [<a href="./rfc5444" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>], so as to establish a policy for consistent naming of
   future TLV type and type extension allocations.

   For clarity, all currently allocated TLVs in [<a href="./rfc5497" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>], [<a href="./rfc6130" title='"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)"'>RFC6130</a>],
   [<a href="./rfc6621" title='"Simplified Multicast Forwarding"'>RFC6621</a>], [<a href="./rfc7181" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>], and [<a href="./rfc7182" title='"Integrity Check Value and Timestamp TLV Definitions for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC7182</a>] are listed in the IANA
   Considerations section of this document, each specifying the updates
   or indicating no change when that is appropriate (such as the
   LINK_METRIC TLV and both TLVs defined in [<a href="./rfc6621" title='"Simplified Multicast Forwarding"'>RFC6621</a>]).  The only
   changes are of naming.

   Note that nothing in this document changes the operation of any
   protocol.  This naming is already used, in effect, in [<a href="./rfc6130" title='"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)"'>RFC6130</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc7181" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>], currently the main users of allocated TLVs.  For example,
   the former indicates that all usage of LINK_STATUS refers to that TLV
   with type extension 0.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Expert%20Review%3A%20Evaluation%20Guidelines"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Expert Review: Evaluation Guidelines</span>

   For registration in the "Packet TLV Types", "Message TLV Types", and
   "Address Block TLV Types" registries, the following guidelines apply,
   in addition to those given in <a href="./rfc5444#section-6.1">SectionÂ 6.1 in [RFC5444]</a>:

   o  If the requested TLV type immediately defines (but not necessarily
      allocates) all the corresponding type extensions for versions of
      that type, then a common name SHOULD be assigned for the TLV type.

      This case is unchanged by this specification.  This currently
      includes TLV types named ICV, TIMESTAMP, and LINK_METRIC; it also
      includes the HELLO Message-Type-specific TLVs defined in
      [<a href="./rfc6621" title='"Simplified Multicast Forwarding"'>RFC6621</a>].

   o  Otherwise, if the requested TLV type does not immediately define
      all the corresponding type extensions for versions of that type,
      then a common name SHOULD NOT be assigned for that TLV type.
      Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that:

      *  The "description" for the allocated TLV type be "Defined by
         Type Extension".

      *  For Packet TLV Types, the type extension registry, created for
         the TLV type, be named "Type XX Packet TLV Type Extensions",
         with XX replaced by the numerical value of the TLV type.

      *  For Message TLV Types, the type extension registry, created for
         the TLV type, be named "Type XX Message TLV Type Extensions",
         with XX replaced by the numerical value of the TLV type.

      *  For Address Block TLV Types, the type extension registry,
         created for the TLV type, be named "Type XX Address Block TLV
         Type Extensions", with XX replaced by the numerical value of
         the TLV type.

      *  When a new type extension is required, unless there are reasons
         to the contrary, the next consecutive type extension is
         allocated and given a name.  (Reasons to the contrary MAY
         include maintaining a correspondence between corresponding
         Packet, Message, and Address Block TLVs, and reserving type
         extension zero if not yet allocated.)

Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Adrian Farrel for pointing out the
   need to reorganize and rationalize the naming of the TLVs defined by
   [<a href="./rfc5444" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>] and Tom Taylor and the RFC Editor for pointing out some
   omissions and errors.
