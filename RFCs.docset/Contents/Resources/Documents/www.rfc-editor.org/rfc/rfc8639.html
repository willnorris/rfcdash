   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanisms
   enabling subscriber-specific subscriptions to a publisher's event
   streams.  This effectively enables a "subscribe, then publish"
   capability where the customized information needs and access
   permissions of each target receiver are understood by the publisher
   before subscribed event records are marshaled and pushed.  The
   receiver then gets a continuous, customized feed of
   publisher-generated information.

   While the functionality defined in this document is transport
   agnostic, transports like the Network Configuration Protocol
   (NETCONF) [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>] or RESTCONF [<a href="./rfc8040" title='"RESTCONF Protocol"'>RFC8040</a>] can be used to configure or
   dynamically signal subscriptions.  Bindings for subscribed event
   record delivery for NETCONF and RESTCONF are defined in [<a href="./rfc8640" title='"Dynamic Subscription to YANG Events and Datastores over NETCONF"'>RFC8640</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-RESTCONF-Notif">RESTCONF-Notif</a>], respectively.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture defined in [<a href="./rfc8342" title='"Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)"'>RFC8342</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Motivation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Motivation</span>

   Various limitations to subscriptions as described in [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>] were
   alleviated to some extent by the requirements provided in [<a href="./rfc7923" title='"Requirements for Subscription to YANG Datastores"'>RFC7923</a>].
   Resolving any remaining issues is the primary motivation for this
   work.  Key capabilities supported by this document include:

   o  multiple subscriptions on a single transport session

   o  support for dynamic and configured subscriptions

   o  modification of an existing subscription in progress

   o  per-subscription operational counters

   o  negotiation of subscription parameters (through the use of hints
      returned as part of declined subscription requests)

   o  subscription state change notifications (e.g., publisher-driven
      suspension, parameter modification)

   o  independence from transport

   o  Configured subscription: A subscription installed via
      configuration into a configuration datastore.

   o  Dynamic subscription: A subscription created dynamically by a
      subscriber via a Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

   o  Event: An occurrence of something that may be of interest.
      Examples include a configuration change, a fault, a change in
      status, crossing a threshold, or an external input to the system.

   o  Event occurrence time: A timestamp matching the time an
      originating process identified as when an event happened.

   o  Event record: A set of information detailing an event.

   o  Event stream: A continuous, chronologically ordered set of events
      aggregated under some context.

   o  Event stream filter: Evaluation criteria that may be applied
      against event records in an event stream.  Event records pass the
      filter when specified criteria are met.

   o  Notification message: Information intended for a receiver
      indicating that one or more events have occurred.

   o  Publisher: An entity responsible for streaming notification
      messages per the terms of a subscription.

   o  Receiver: A target to which a publisher pushes subscribed event
      records.  For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber
      are the same entity.

   o  Subscriber: A client able to request and negotiate a contract for
      the generation and push of event records from a publisher.  For
      dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber are the same
      entity.

   o  Subscription: A contract with a publisher, stipulating the
      information that one or more receivers wish to have pushed from
      the publisher without the need for further solicitation.

   All YANG tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation
   defined in [<a href="./rfc8340" title='"YANG Tree Diagrams"'>RFC8340</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.3.%20%20Solution%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" id="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Solution Overview</span>

   This document describes a transport-agnostic mechanism for
   subscribing to and receiving content from an event stream in a
   publisher.  This mechanism operates through the use of a
   subscription.

   Two types of subscriptions are supported:

   1.  Dynamic subscriptions, where a subscriber initiates a
       subscription negotiation with a publisher via an RPC.  If the
       publisher is able to serve this request, it accepts it and then
       starts pushing notification messages back to the subscriber.  If
       the publisher is not able to serve it as requested, then an error
       response is returned.  This response MAY include hints for
       subscription parameters that, had they been present, may have
       enabled the dynamic subscription request to be accepted.

   2.  Configured subscriptions, which allow the management of
       subscriptions via a configuration so that a publisher can send
       notification messages to a receiver.  Support for configured
       subscriptions is optional, with its availability advertised via a
       YANG feature.

   Additional characteristics differentiating configured from dynamic
   subscriptions include the following:

   o  The lifetime of a dynamic subscription is bound by the transport
      session used to establish it.  For connection-oriented stateful
      transports like NETCONF, the loss of the transport session will
      result in the immediate termination of any associated dynamic
      subscriptions.  For connectionless or stateless transports like
      HTTP, a lack of receipt acknowledgment of a sequential set of
      notification messages and/or keep-alives can be used to trigger a
      termination of a dynamic subscription.  Contrast this to the
      lifetime of a configured subscription.  This lifetime is driven by
      relevant configuration being present in the publisher's applied
      configuration.  Being tied to configuration operations implies
      that (1) configured subscriptions can be configured to persist
      across reboots and (2) a configured subscription can persist even
      when its publisher is fully disconnected from any network.

   o  Configured subscriptions can be modified by any configuration
      client with write permission on the configuration of the
      subscription.  Dynamic subscriptions can only be modified via an
      RPC request made by the original subscriber or by a change to
      configuration data referenced by the subscription.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8639">RFC 8639</a>                Subscribed Notifications          September 2019</span>


   Note that there is no mixing and matching of dynamic and configured
   operations on a single subscription.  Specifically, a configured
   subscription cannot be modified or deleted using RPCs defined in this
   document.  Similarly, a dynamic subscription cannot be directly
   modified or deleted by configuration operations.  It is, however,
   possible to perform a configuration operation that indirectly impacts
   a dynamic subscription.  By changing the value of a preconfigured
   filter referenced by an existing dynamic subscription, the selected
   event records passed to a receiver might change.

   Also note that transport-specific specifications based on this
   specification MUST detail the lifecycle of dynamic subscriptions as
   well as the lifecycle of configured subscriptions (if supported).

   A publisher MAY terminate a dynamic subscription at any time.
   Similarly, it MAY decide to temporarily suspend the sending of
   notification messages for any dynamic subscription, or for one or
   more receivers of a configured subscription.  Such termination or
   suspension is driven by internal considerations of the publisher.

   This document is intended to provide a superset of the subscription
   capabilities initially defined in [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>].  It is important to
   understand what has been reused and what has been replaced,
   especially when extending an existing implementation that is based on
   [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>].  Key relationships between these two documents include the
   following:

   o  This document defines a transport-independent capability;
      [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>] is specific to NETCONF.

   o  For the new operations, the data model defined in this document is
      used instead of the data model defined in <a href="./rfc5277#section-3.4">SectionÂ 3.4 of
      [RFC5277]</a>.

   o  The RPC operations in this document replace the operation
      &lt;create-subscription&gt; as defined in <a href="./rfc5277#section-4">[RFC5277], SectionÂ 4</a>.

   o  The &lt;notification&gt; message of <a href="./rfc5277#section-4">[RFC5277], SectionÂ 4</a> is used.

   o  The included contents of the "NETCONF" event stream are identical
      between this document and [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>].

   o  A publisher MAY implement both the Notification Management Schema
      and RPCs defined in [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>] and this document concurrently.

   o  Unlike [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>], this document enables a single transport session
      to intermix notification messages and RPCs for different
      subscriptions.

   o  A subscription "stop-time" can be specified as part of a
      notification replay.  This supports a capability analogous to the
      &lt;stopTime&gt; parameter of [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>].  However, in this
      specification, a "stop-time" parameter can also be applied without
      replay.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Solution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Solution</span>

   Per the overview provided in <a href="#section-1.3">Section 1.3</a>, this section details the
   overall context, state machines, and subsystems that may be assembled
   to allow the subscription of events from a publisher.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Event%20Streams"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Event Streams</span>

   An event stream is a named entity on a publisher; this entity exposes
   a continuously updating set of YANG-defined event records.  An event
   record is an instantiation of a "notification" YANG statement.  If
   the "notification" is defined as a child to a data node, the
   instantiation includes the hierarchy of nodes that identifies the
   data node in the datastore (see <a href="./rfc7950#section-7.16.2">SectionÂ 7.16.2 of [RFC7950]</a>).  Each
   event stream is available for subscription.  Identifying a) how event
   streams are defined (other than the NETCONF stream), b) how event
   records are defined/generated, and c) how event records are assigned
   to event streams is out of scope for this document.

   There is only one reserved event stream name in this document:
   "NETCONF".  The "NETCONF" event stream contains all NETCONF event
   record information supported by the publisher, except where an event
   record has explicitly been excluded from the stream.  Beyond the
   "NETCONF" stream, implementations MAY define additional event
   streams.

   As YANG-defined event records are created by a system, they may be
   assigned to one or more streams.  The event record is distributed to
   a subscription's receiver(s) where (1) a subscription includes the
   identified stream and (2) subscription filtering does not exclude the
   event record from that receiver.

   Access control permissions may be used to silently exclude event
   records from an event stream for which the receiver has no read
   access.  See <a href="./rfc8341#section-3.4.6">[RFC8341], SectionÂ 3.4.6</a> for an example of how this
   might be accomplished.  Note that per <a href="#section-2.7">Section 2.7</a> of this document,
   subscription state change notifications are never filtered out.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8639">RFC 8639</a>                Subscribed Notifications          September 2019</span>


   If no access control permissions are in place for event records on an
   event stream, then a receiver MUST be allowed access to all the event
   records.  If subscriber permissions change during the lifecycle of a
   subscription and event stream access is no longer permitted, then the
   subscription MUST be terminated.

   Event records MUST NOT be delivered to a receiver in a different
   order than the order in which they were placed on an event stream.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Event%20Stream%20Filters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Event Stream Filters</span>

   This document defines an extensible filtering mechanism.  The filter
   itself is a boolean test that is placed on the content of an event
   record.  A "false" filtering result causes the event record to be
   excluded from delivery to a receiver.  A filter never results in
   information being stripped from an event record prior to that event
   record being encapsulated in a notification message.  The two
   optional event stream filtering syntaxes supported are [<a href="#ref-XPATH" title='"XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0"'>XPATH</a>] and

   If no event stream filter is provided in a subscription, all event
   records on an event stream are to be sent.

   This document provides for several Quality of Service (QoS)
   parameters.  These parameters indicate the treatment of a
   subscription relative to other traffic between publisher and
   receiver.  Included are:

   o  A "dscp" marking to differentiate prioritization of notification
      messages during network transit.

   o  A "weighting" so that bandwidth proportional to this weighting can
      be allocated to this subscription relative to other subscriptions.

   o  A "dependency" upon another subscription.

   If the publisher supports the "dscp" feature, then a subscription
   with a "dscp" leaf MUST result in a corresponding Differentiated
   Services Code Point (DSCP) marking [<a href="./rfc2474" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>RFC2474</a>] being placed in the IP
   header of any resulting notification messages and subscription state
   change notifications.  A publisher MUST respect the DSCP markings for
   subscription traffic egressing that publisher.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8639">RFC 8639</a>                Subscribed Notifications          September 2019</span>


   Different DSCP code points require different transport connections.
   As a result, where TCP is used, a publisher that supports the "dscp"
   feature must ensure that a subscription's notification messages are
   returned in a single TCP transport session where all traffic shares
   the subscription's "dscp" leaf value.  If this cannot be guaranteed,
   any "establish-subscription" RPC request SHOULD be rejected with a
   "dscp-unavailable" error.

   For the "weighting" parameter, when concurrently dequeuing
   notification messages from multiple subscriptions to a receiver, the
   publisher MUST allocate bandwidth to each subscription proportional
   to the weights assigned to those subscriptions.  "Weighting" is an
   optional capability of the publisher; support for it is identified
   via the "qos" feature.

   If a subscription has the "dependency" parameter set, then any
   buffered notification messages containing event records selected by
   the parent subscription MUST be dequeued prior to the notification
   messages of the dependent subscription.  If notification messages
   have dependencies on each other, the notification message queued the
   longest MUST go first.  If a "dependency" included in an RPC
   references a subscription that does not exist or is no longer
   accessible to that subscriber, that "dependency" MUST be silently
   removed.  "Dependency" is an optional capability of the publisher;
   support for it is identified via the "qos" feature.

   "Dependency" and "weighting" parameters will only be respected and
   enforced between subscriptions that share the same "dscp" leaf value.

   There are additional types of publisher capacity overload that this
   specification does not address, as they are out of scope.  For
   example, the prioritization of which subscriptions have precedence
   when the publisher CPU is overloaded is not discussed.  As a result,
   implementation choices will need to be made to address such
   considerations.

   Dynamic subscriptions are managed via protocol operations (in the
   form of RPCs, per <a href="./rfc7950#section-7.14">[RFC7950], SectionÂ 7.14</a>) made against targets
   located in the publisher.  These RPCs have been designed extensibly
   so that they may be augmented for subscription targets beyond event
   streams.  For examples of such augmentations, see the RPC
   augmentations in the YANG data model provided in [<a href="./rfc8641" title='"Subscription to YANG Notifications for Datastore Updates"'>RFC8641</a>].

   Below is the publisher's state machine for a dynamic subscription.
   Each state is shown in its own box.  It is important to note that
   such a subscription doesn't exist at the publisher until an
   "establish-subscription" RPC is accepted.  The mere request by a
   subscriber to establish a subscription is not sufficient for that
   subscription to be externally visible.  Start and end states are
   depicted to reflect subscription creation and deletion events.

      Figure 1: Publisher's State Machine for a Dynamic Subscription

   Of interest in this state machine are the following:

   o  Successful "establish-subscription" or "modify-subscription" RPCs
      move the subscription to the "active" state.

   o  Failed "modify-subscription" RPCs will leave the subscription in
      its previous state, with no visible change to any streaming
      updates.

   o  A "delete-subscription" or "kill-subscription" RPC will end the
      subscription, as will reaching a "stop-time".

   o  A publisher may choose to suspend a subscription when there is not
      sufficient CPU or bandwidth available to service the subscription.
      This is announced to the subscriber via the "subscription-
      suspended" subscription state change notification.

   o  A suspended subscription may be modified by the subscriber (for
      example, in an attempt to use fewer resources).  Successful
      modification returns the subscription to the "active" state.

   o  Even without a "modify-subscription" request, a publisher may
      return a subscription to the "active" state when sufficient
      resources are again available.  This is announced to the
      subscriber via the "subscription-resumed" subscription state
      change notification.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.2.%20%20Establishing%20a%20Dynamic%20Subscription"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.2" id="section-2.4.2">2.4.2</a>.  Establishing a Dynamic Subscription</span>

   The "establish-subscription" RPC allows a subscriber to request the
   creation of a subscription.

   The input parameters of the operation are:

   o  A "stream" name, which identifies the targeted event stream
      against which the subscription is applied.

   o  An event stream filter, which may reduce the set of event records
      pushed.

   o  If the transport used by the RPC supports multiple encodings, an
      optional "encoding" for the event records pushed.  If no
      "encoding" is included, the encoding of the RPC MUST be used.

   o  An optional "stop-time" for the subscription.  If no "stop-time"
      is present, notification messages will continue to be sent until
      the subscription is terminated.

   o  An optional "replay-start-time" for the subscription.  The
      "replay-start-time" MUST be in the past and indicates that the
      subscription is requesting a replay of previously generated
      information from the event stream.  For more on replay, see
      <a href="#section-2.4.2.1">Section 2.4.2.1</a>.  If there is no "replay-start-time", the
      subscription starts immediately.

   If the publisher can satisfy the "establish-subscription" request, it
   replies with an identifier for the subscription and then immediately
   starts streaming notification messages.

   Replay provides the ability to establish a subscription that is also
   capable of passing event records generated in the recent past.  In
   other words, as the subscription initializes itself, it sends any
   event records in the target event stream that meet the filter
   criteria that have an event time that is after the "replay-start-
   time" and also have an event time before the "stop-time" should this
   "stop-time" exist.  The end of these historical event records is
   identified via a "replay-completed" subscription state change
   notification.  Any event records generated since the subscription
   establishment may then follow.  For a particular subscription, all
   event records will be delivered in the order in which they are placed
   in the event stream.

   Replay is an optional feature that is dependent on an event stream
   supporting some form of logging.  This document puts no restrictions
   on the size or form of the log, where it resides in the publisher, or
   when event record entries in the log are purged.

   The inclusion of a "replay-start-time" in an "establish-subscription"
   RPC indicates a replay request.  If the "replay-start-time" contains
   a value that is earlier than what a publisher's retained history
   supports, then if the subscription is accepted, the actual
   publisher's revised start time MUST be set in the returned
   "replay-start-time-revision" object.

   A "stop-time" parameter may be included in a replay subscription.
   For a replay subscription, the "stop-time" MAY be earlier than the
   current time but MUST be later than the "replay-start-time".

   If the given "replay-start-time" is later than the time marked in any
   event records retained in the replay buffer, then the publisher MUST
   send a "replay-completed" notification immediately after a successful
   "establish-subscription" RPC response.

   If an event stream supports replay, the "replay-support" leaf is
   present in the "/streams/stream" list entry for the event stream.  An
   event stream that does support replay is not expected to have an
   unlimited supply of saved notifications available to accommodate any
   given replay request.  To assess the timeframe available for replay,
   subscribers can read the leafs "replay-log-creation-time" and
   "replay-log-aged-time".  See Figure 18 for the YANG tree and
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for the YANG module describing these elements.  The actual
   size of the replay log at any given time is a publisher-specific
   matter.  Control parameters for the replay log are outside the scope
   of this document.

   The "modify-subscription" operation permits changing the terms of an
   existing dynamic subscription.  Dynamic subscriptions can be modified
   any number of times.  Dynamic subscriptions can only be modified via
   this RPC using a transport session connecting to the subscriber.  If
   the publisher accepts the requested modifications, it acknowledges
   success to the subscriber, then immediately starts sending event
   records based on the new terms.

   Subscriptions created by configuration cannot be modified via this
   RPC.  However, configuration may be used to modify objects referenced
   by the subscription (such as a referenced filter).

   If the publisher accepts the requested modifications on a currently
   suspended subscription, the subscription will immediately be resumed
   (i.e., the modified subscription is returned to the "active" state).
   The publisher MAY immediately suspend this newly modified
   subscription through the "subscription-suspended" notification before
   any event records are sent.

   If the publisher rejects the RPC request, the subscription remains as
   it was prior to the request.  That is, the request has no impact
   whatsoever.  Rejection of the RPC for any reason is indicated via an
   RPC error as described in <a href="#section-2.4.6">Section 2.4.6</a>.  The contents of such a
   rejected RPC MAY include hints on inputs that (if considered) may
   result in a successfully modified subscription.  These hints MUST be
   transported in a yang-data "modify-subscription-stream-error-info"
   container inserted into the RPC error response.

   The "kill-subscription" operation permits an operator to end a
   dynamic subscription that is not associated with the transport
   session used for the RPC.  A publisher MUST terminate any dynamic
   subscription identified by the "id" parameter in the RPC request, if
   such a subscription exists.

   Configured subscriptions cannot be killed using this RPC.  Instead,
   configured subscriptions are deleted as part of regular configuration
   operations.  Publishers MUST reject any RPC attempt to kill a
   configured subscription.

   Whenever an RPC is unsuccessful, the publisher returns relevant
   information as part of the RPC error response.  Transport-level error
   processing MUST be done before the RPC error processing described in
   this section.  In all cases, RPC error information returned by the
   publisher will use existing transport-layer RPC structures, such as
   those seen with NETCONF (Appendix A of [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>]) or RESTCONF
   (<a href="./rfc8040#section-7.1">SectionÂ 7.1 of [RFC8040]</a>).  These structures MUST be able to encode
   subscription-specific errors identified below and defined in this
   document's YANG data model.

   As a result of this variety, how subscription errors are encoded in
   an RPC error response is transport dependent.  Valid errors that can
   occur for each RPC are as follows:

      establish-subscription         modify-subscription
      ----------------------         ----------------------
      dscp-unavailable               filter-unsupported
      encoding-unsupported           insufficient-resources
      filter-unsupported             no-such-subscription
      insufficient-resources
      replay-unsupported

      delete-subscription            kill-subscription
      ----------------------         ----------------------
      no-such-subscription           no-such-subscription

   To see a NETCONF-based example of an error response from the list
   above, see the "no-such-subscription" error response illustrated in
   [<a href="./rfc8640" title='"Dynamic Subscription to YANG Events and Datastores over NETCONF"'>RFC8640</a>], Figure 10.

   There is one final set of transport-independent RPC error elements
   included in the YANG data model defined in this document: three
   yang-data structures that enable the publisher to provide to the
   receiver any error information that does not fit into existing
   transport-layer RPC structures.  These structures are:

   1.  "establish-subscription-stream-error-info": This MUST be returned
       with the leaf "reason" populated if an RPC error reason has not
       been placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a failed
       "establish-subscription" RPC response.  This MUST be sent if
       hints on how to overcome the RPC error are included.

   2.  "modify-subscription-stream-error-info": This MUST be returned
       with the leaf "reason" populated if an RPC error reason has not
       been placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a failed
       "modify-subscription" RPC response.  This MUST be sent if hints
       on how to overcome the RPC error are included.

   3.  "delete-subscription-error-info": This MUST be returned with the
       leaf "reason" populated if an RPC error reason has not been
       placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a failed
       "delete-subscription" or "kill-subscription" RPC response.

   A configured subscription is a subscription installed via
   configuration.  Configured subscriptions may be modified by any
   configuration client with the proper permissions.  Subscriptions can
   be modified or terminated via configuration at any point during their
   lifetime.  Multiple configured subscriptions MUST be supportable over
   a single transport session.

   Configured subscriptions have several characteristics distinguishing
   them from dynamic subscriptions:

   o  persistence across publisher reboots,

   o  persistence even when transport is unavailable, and

   o  an ability to send notification messages to more than one
      receiver.  (Note that receivers are unaware of the existence of
      any other receivers.)

   On the publisher, support for configured subscriptions is optional
   and advertised using the "configured" feature.  On a receiver of a
   configured subscription, support for dynamic subscriptions is
   optional.  However, if replaying missed event records is required for




<span class="grey">Voit, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 19]</span></pre>

   a configured subscription, support for dynamic subscription is highly
   recommended.  In this case, a separate dynamic subscription can be
   established to retransmit the missing event records.

   In addition to the subscription parameters available to dynamic
   subscriptions as described in <a href="#section-2.4.2">Section 2.4.2</a>, the following additional
   parameters are also available to configured subscriptions:

   o  A "transport", which identifies the transport protocol to use to
      connect with all subscription receivers.

   o  One or more receivers, each intended as the destination for event
      records.  Note that each individual receiver is identifiable by
      its "name".

   o  Optional parameters to identify where traffic should egress a
      publisher:

      *  A "source-interface", which identifies the egress interface to
         use from the publisher.  Publisher support for this parameter
         is optional and advertised using the "interface-designation"
         feature.

      *  A "source-address" address, which identifies the IP address to
         stamp on notification messages destined for the receiver.

      *  A "source-vrf", which identifies the Virtual Routing and
         Forwarding (VRF) instance on which to reach receivers.  This
         VRF is a network instance as defined in [<a href="./rfc8529" title='"YANG Data Model for Network Instances"'>RFC8529</a>].  Publisher
         support for VRFs is optional and advertised using the
         "supports-vrf" feature.

      If none of the above parameters are set, notification messages
      MUST egress the publisher's default interface.

   A tree diagram that includes these parameters is provided in
   Figure 20 in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.  These parameters are described in the YANG
   module in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   Below is the state machine for a configured subscription on the
   publisher.  This state machine describes the three states ("valid",
   "invalid", and "concluded") as well as the transitions between these
   states.  Start and end states are depicted to reflect configured
   subscription creation and deletion events.  The creation or
   modification of a configured subscription initiates an evaluation by
   the publisher to determine if the subscription is in the

   "valid" state or the "invalid" state.  The publisher uses its own
   criteria in making this determination.  If in the "valid" state, the
   subscription becomes operational.  See (1) in the diagram below.

   A subscription in the "valid" state may move to the "invalid" state
   in one of two ways.  First, it may be modified in a way that fails a
   re-evaluation.  See (2) in the diagram.  Second, the publisher might
   determine that the subscription is no longer supportable.  This could
   be because of an unexpected but sustained increase in an event
   stream's event records, degraded CPU capacity, a more complex
   referenced filter, or other subscriptions that have usurped
   resources.  See (3) in the diagram.  No matter the case, a
   "subscription-terminated" notification is sent to any receivers in
   the "active" or "suspended" state.  A subscription in the
   "valid" state may also transition to the "concluded" state via (5) if
   a configured stop time has been reached.  In this case, a
   "subscription-concluded" notification is sent to any receivers in the
   "active" or "suspended" state.  Finally, a subscription may be
   deleted by configuration (4).

   When a subscription is in the "valid" state, a publisher will attempt
   to connect with all receivers of a configured subscription and
   deliver notification messages.  Below is the state machine for each
   receiver of a configured subscription.  This receiver state machine
   is fully contained in the state machine of the configured
   subscription and is only relevant when the configured subscription is

                              on a Publisher

   When a configured subscription first moves to the "valid" state, the
   "state" leaf of each receiver is initialized to the "connecting"
   state.  If transport connectivity is not available to any receivers
   and there are any notification messages to deliver, a transport
   session is established (e.g., per [<a href="./rfc8071" title='"NETCONF Call Home and RESTCONF Call Home"'>RFC8071</a>]).  Individual receivers
   are moved to the "active" state when a "subscription-started"
   subscription state change notification is successfully passed to that
   receiver (a).  Event records are only sent to active receivers.
   Receivers of a configured subscription remain active on the publisher
   if both (1) transport connectivity to the receiver is active and
   (2) event records are not being dropped due to a publisher's sending
   capacity being reached.  In addition, a configured subscription's
   receiver MUST be moved to the "connecting" state if the receiver is

   reset via the "reset" action (b), (c).  For more on the "reset"
   action, see <a href="#section-2.5.5">Section 2.5.5</a>.  If transport connectivity cannot be
   achieved while in the "connecting" state, the receiver MAY be moved
   to the "disconnected" state.

   A configured subscription's receiver MUST be moved to the "suspended"
   state if there is transport connectivity between the publisher and
   receiver but (1) delivery of notification messages is failing due to
   a publisher's buffer capacity being reached or (2) notification
   messages cannot be generated for that receiver due to insufficient
   CPU (d).  This is indicated to the receiver by the "subscription-
   suspended" subscription state change notification.

   A configured subscription's receiver MUST be returned to the "active"
   state from the "suspended" state when notification messages can be
   generated, bandwidth is sufficient to handle the notification
   messages, and a receiver has successfully been sent a "subscription-
   resumed" or "subscription-modified" subscription state change
   notification (e).  The choice as to which of these two subscription
   state change notifications is sent is determined by whether the
   subscription was modified during the period of suspension.

   Modification of a configured subscription is possible at any time.  A
   "subscription-modified" subscription state change notification will
   be sent to all active receivers, immediately followed by notification
   messages conforming to the new parameters.  Suspended receivers will
   also be informed of the modification.  However, this notification
   will await the end of the suspension for that receiver (e).

   The mechanisms described above are mirrored in the RPCs and
   notifications defined in this document.  It should be noted that
   these RPCs and notifications have been designed to be extensible and
   allow subscriptions into targets other than event streams.  For
   instance, the YANG module defined in <a href="./rfc8641#section-5">SectionÂ 5 of [RFC8641]</a> augments
   "/sn:modify-subscription/sn:input/sn:target".

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.2.%20%20Creating%20a%20Configured%20Subscription"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.2" id="section-2.5.2">2.5.2</a>.  Creating a Configured Subscription</span>

   Configured subscriptions are established using configuration
   operations against the top-level "subscriptions" subtree.

   Because there is no explicit association with an existing transport
   session, configuration operations MUST include additional parameters
   beyond those of dynamic subscriptions.  These parameters identify
   each receiver, how to connect with that receiver, and possibly
   whether the notification messages need to come from a specific egress





<span class="grey">Voit, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 23]</span></pre>

   interface on the publisher.  Receiver-specific transport connectivity
   parameters MUST be configured via transport-specific augmentations to
   this specification.  See <a href="#section-2.5.7">Section 2.5.7</a> for details.

   After a subscription is successfully established, the publisher
   immediately sends a "subscription-started" subscription state change
   notification to each receiver.  It is quite possible that upon
   configuration, reboot, or even steady-state operations, a transport
   session may not be currently available to the receiver.  In this
   case, when there is something to transport for an active
   subscription, transport-specific "call home" operations [<a href="./rfc8071" title='"NETCONF Call Home and RESTCONF Call Home"'>RFC8071</a>]
   will be used to establish the connection.  When transport
   connectivity is available, notification messages may then be pushed.

   With active configured subscriptions, it is allowable to buffer event
   records even after a "subscription-started" has been sent.  However,
   if events are lost (rather than just delayed) due to replay buffer
   capacity being reached, a new "subscription-started" must be sent.
   This new "subscription-started" indicates an event record
   discontinuity.

   To see an example of subscription creation using configuration
   operations over NETCONF, see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.3.%20%20Modifying%20a%20Configured%20Subscription"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.3" id="section-2.5.3">2.5.3</a>.  Modifying a Configured Subscription</span>

   Configured subscriptions can be modified using configuration
   operations against the top-level "subscriptions" subtree.

   If the modification involves adding receivers, added receivers are
   placed in the "connecting" state.  If a receiver is removed, the
   subscription state change notification "subscription-terminated" is
   sent to that receiver if that receiver is active or suspended.

   If the modification involves changing the policies for the
   subscription, the publisher sends to currently active receivers a
   "subscription-modified" notification.  For any suspended receivers, a
   "subscription-modified" notification will be delayed until the
   receiver's subscription has been resumed.  (Note: In this case, the
   "subscription-modified" notification informs the receiver that the
   subscription has been resumed, so no additional "subscription-
   resumed" need be sent.  Also note that if multiple modifications have
   occurred during the suspension, only the "subscription-modified"
   notification describing the latest one need be sent to the receiver.)

   Subscriptions can be deleted through configuration against the
   top-level "subscriptions" subtree.

   Immediately after a subscription is successfully deleted, the
   publisher sends to all receivers of that subscription a subscription
   state change notification stating that the subscription has ended
   (i.e., "subscription-terminated").

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.5.%20%20Resetting%20a%20Configured%20Subscription%27s%20Receiver"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.5" id="section-2.5.5">2.5.5</a>.  Resetting a Configured Subscription's Receiver</span>

   It is possible that a configured subscription to a receiver needs to
   be reset.  This is accomplished via the "reset" action in the YANG
   module at "/subscriptions/subscription/receivers/receiver/reset".
   This action may be useful in cases where a publisher has timed out
   trying to reach a receiver.  When such a reset occurs, a transport
   session will be initiated if necessary, and a new "subscription-
   started" notification will be sent.  This action does not have any
   effect on transport connectivity if the needed connectivity already
   exists.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.6.%20%20Replay%20for%20a%20Configured%20Subscription"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.6" id="section-2.5.6">2.5.6</a>.  Replay for a Configured Subscription</span>

   It is possible to do replay on a configured subscription.  This is
   supported via the configuration of the "configured-replay" object on
   the subscription.  The setting of this object enables the streaming
   of the buffered event records for the subscribed event stream.  All
   buffered event records that have been retained since the last
   publisher restart will be sent to each configured receiver.

   Replay of event records created since restart is useful.  It allows
   event records generated before transport connectivity establishment
   to be passed to a receiver.  Setting the restart time as the earliest
   configured replay time precludes the possibility of resending event
   records that were logged prior to publisher restart.  It also ensures
   that the same records will be sent to each configured receiver,
   regardless of the speed of transport connectivity establishment to
   each receiver.  Finally, by establishing restart as the earliest
   potential time for event records to be included in notification
   messages, a well-understood timeframe for replay is defined.

   As a result, when any configured subscription's receivers become
   active, buffered event records will be sent immediately after the
   "subscription-started" notification.  If the publisher knows the last

   leading event record will be the first event record meeting filtering
   criteria subsequent to the latest of three different times: the
   "replay-log-creation-time", the "replay-log-aged-time", or the most
   recent publisher boot time.  The "replay-log-creation-time" and
   "replay-log-aged-time" are discussed in <a href="#section-2.4.2.1">Section 2.4.2.1</a>.  The most
   recent publisher boot time ensures that duplicate event records are
   not replayed from a previous time the publisher was booted.

   It is quite possible that a receiver might want to retrieve event
   records from an event stream prior to the latest boot.  If such
   records exist where there is a configured replay, the publisher MUST
   send the time of the event record immediately preceding the
   "replay-start-time" in the "replay-previous-event-time" leaf.
   Through the existence of the "replay-previous-event-time", the
   receiver will know that earlier events prior to reboot exist.  In
   addition, if the subscriber was previously receiving event records
   with the same subscription "id", the receiver can determine if there
   was a time gap where records generated on the publisher were not
   successfully received.  And with this information, the receiver may
   choose to dynamically subscribe to retrieve any event records placed
   in the event stream before the most recent boot time.

   All other replay functionality remains the same as with dynamic
   subscriptions as described in <a href="#section-2.4.2.1">Section 2.4.2.1</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.7.%20%20Transport%20Connectivity%20for%20a%20Configured%20Subscription"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.7" id="section-2.5.7">2.5.7</a>.  Transport Connectivity for a Configured Subscription</span>

   This specification is transport independent.  However, supporting a
   configured subscription will often require the establishment of
   transport connectivity.  And the parameters used for this transport
   connectivity establishment are transport specific.  As a result, the
   YANG module defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> is not able to directly define and
   expose these transport parameters.

   It is necessary for an implementation to support the connection
   establishment process.  To support this function, the YANG data model
   defined in this document includes a node where transport-specific
   parameters for a particular receiver may be augmented.  This node is
   "/subscriptions/subscription/receivers/receiver".  By augmenting
   transport parameters from this node, system developers are able to
   incorporate the YANG objects necessary to support the transport
   connectivity establishment process.

   The result of this is the following requirement.  A publisher
   supporting the feature "configured" MUST also support at least one
   YANG data model that augments transport connectivity parameters on
   "/subscriptions/subscription/receivers/receiver".  For an example of
   such an augmentation, see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   Whether dynamic or configured, once a subscription has been set up,
   the publisher streams event records via notification messages per the
   terms of the subscription.  For dynamic subscriptions, notification
   messages are sent over the session used to establish the
   subscription.  For configured subscriptions, notification messages
   are sent over the connections specified by the transport and each
   receiver of a configured subscription.

   A notification message is sent to a receiver when an event record is
   not blocked by either the specified filter criteria or receiver
   permissions.  This notification message MUST include an &lt;eventTime&gt;
   object, as shown in <a href="./rfc5277#section-4">[RFC5277], SectionÂ 4</a>.  This &lt;eventTime&gt; MUST be
   at the top level of a YANG structured event record.

   The following example of XML [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-xml-20081126">W3C.REC-xml-20081126</a>], adapted from
   <a href="./rfc7950#section-4.2.10">SectionÂ 4.2.10 of [RFC7950]</a>, illustrates a compliant message:

      &lt;notification
             xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0"&gt;
          &lt;eventTime&gt;2007-09-01T10:00:00Z&lt;/eventTime&gt;

              &lt;if-oper-status&gt;down&lt;/if-oper-status&gt;
          &lt;/link-failure&gt;
      &lt;/notification&gt;

                Figure 10: Subscribed Notification Message

   <a href="./rfc5277#section-2.2.1">[RFC5277], SectionÂ 2.2.1</a> states that a notification message is to be
   sent to a subscriber that initiated a &lt;create-subscription&gt;.  With
   this document, this statement from [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>] should be more broadly
   interpreted to mean that notification messages can also be sent to a
   subscriber that initiated an "establish-subscription" or to a
   configured receiver that has been sent a "subscription-started".

   When a dynamic subscription has been started or modified with
   "establish-subscription" or "modify-subscription", respectively,
   event records matching the newly applied filter criteria MUST NOT be
   sent until after the RPC reply has been sent.

   When a configured subscription has been started or modified, event
   records matching the newly applied filter criteria MUST NOT be sent
   until after the "subscription-started" or "subscription-modified"
   notification has been sent, respectively.

   In addition to sending event records to receivers, a publisher MUST
   also send subscription state change notifications when events related
   to subscription management have occurred.

   Subscription state change notifications are unlike other
   notifications in that they are never included in any event stream.
   Instead, they are inserted (as defined in this section) into the
   sequence of notification messages sent to a particular receiver.
   Subscription state change notifications cannot be dropped or filtered
   out, they cannot be stored in replay buffers, and they are delivered
   only to impacted receivers of a subscription.  The identification of
   subscription state change notifications is easy to separate from
   other notification messages through the use of the YANG extension
   "subscription-state-notif".  This extension tags a notification as a
   subscription state change notification.

   The complete set of subscription state change notifications is
   described in the following subsections.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.7.1.%20%20%22subscription-started%22"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7.1" id="section-2.7.1">2.7.1</a>.  "subscription-started"</span>

   This notification indicates that a configured subscription has
   started, and event records may be sent.  Included in this
   subscription state change notification are all the parameters of the
   subscription, except for (1) transport connection information for one
   or more receivers and (2) origin information indicating where
   notification messages will egress the publisher.  Note that if a
   referenced filter from the "filters" container has been used in the
   subscription, the notification still provides the contents of that
   referenced filter under the "within-subscription" subtree.

   Note that for dynamic subscriptions, no "subscription-started"
   notifications are ever sent.

       Figure 12: "subscription-modified" Notification Tree Diagram

   A publisher most often sends this notification directly after the
   modification of any configuration parameters impacting a configured
   subscription.  But it may also be sent at two other times:

   1.  If a configured subscription has been modified during the
       suspension of a receiver, the notification will be delayed until
       the receiver's suspension is lifted.  In this situation, the
       notification indicates that the subscription has been both
       modified and resumed.

   2.  A "subscription-modified" subscription state change notification
       MUST be sent if the contents of the filter identified by the
       subscription's "stream-filter-ref" leaf have changed.  This state
       change notification is to be sent for a filter change impacting
       any active receivers of a configured or dynamic subscription.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.7.3.%20%20%22subscription-terminated%22"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7.3" id="section-2.7.3">2.7.3</a>.  "subscription-terminated"</span>

   This notification indicates that no further event records for this
   subscription should be expected from the publisher.  A publisher may
   terminate the sending of event records to a receiver for the
   following reasons:

   1.  Configuration that removes a configured subscription, or a
       "kill-subscription" RPC that ends a dynamic subscription.  These
       are identified via the reason "no-such-subscription".

   2.  A referenced filter is no longer accessible.  This reason is
       identified by the "filter-unavailable" identity.

   3.  The event stream referenced by a subscription is no longer
       accessible by the receiver.  This reason is identified by the
       "stream-unavailable" identity.

   4.  A suspended subscription has exceeded some timeout.  This reason
       is identified by the "suspension-timeout" identity.

   Each reason listed above derives from the "subscription-terminated-
   reason" base identity specified in the YANG data model in this
   document.

   Below is a tree diagram for "subscription-terminated".  All objects
   contained in this tree are described in the YANG module in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

      Figure 13: "subscription-terminated" Notification Tree Diagram

   Note: This subscription state change notification MUST be sent to a
   dynamic subscription's receiver when the subscription ends
   unexpectedly.  This might happen when a "kill-subscription" RPC is
   successful or when some other event, not including reaching the
   subscription's "stop-time", results in a publisher choosing to end
   the subscription.

   This notification indicates that a publisher has suspended the
   sending of event records to a receiver and also indicates the
   possible loss of events.  Suspension happens when capacity
   constraints stop a publisher from serving a valid subscription.  The
   two conditions where this is possible are:

   1.  "insufficient-resources", when a publisher is unable to produce
       the requested event stream of notification messages, and

   2.  "unsupportable-volume", when the bandwidth needed to get
       generated notification messages to a receiver exceeds a
       threshold.

   These conditions are encoded in the "reason" object.  No further
   notifications will be sent until the subscription resumes or is
   terminated.

   any notification messages containing an event record with a timestamp
   later than (1) the "stop-time" or (2) the subscription's start time.

   that has not been reached, then after the "replay-completed"

   (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>) allows the state of subscriptions and their
   connectivity to receivers to be monitored.

   Each subscription in the operational state datastore is represented
   as a list element.  Included in this list are event counters for each
   receiver, the state of each receiver, and the subscription parameters
   currently in effect.  The appearance of the leaf "configured-
   subscription-state" indicates that a particular subscription came

   into being via configuration.  This leaf also indicates whether the
   current state of that subscription is "valid", "invalid", or
   "concluded".

   To understand the flow of event records in a subscription, there are
   two counters available for each receiver.  The first counter is
   "sent-event-records", which shows the number of events identified for
   sending to a receiver.  The second counter is "excluded-event-
   records", which shows the number of event records not sent to a
   receiver.  "excluded-event-records" shows the combined results of
   both access control and per-subscription filtering.  For configured
   subscriptions, counters are reset whenever the subscription's state
   is evaluated as "valid" (see (1) in Figure 8).

   Dynamic subscriptions are removed from the operational state
   datastore once they expire (reaching "stop-time") or when they are
   terminated.  While many subscription objects are shown as
   configurable, dynamic subscriptions are only included in the
   operational state datastore and as a result are not configurable.

   A publisher maintains a list of available event streams as
   operational data.  This list contains both standardized and
   vendor-specific event streams.  This enables subscribers to discover
   what streams a publisher supports.

   The "filters" container maintains a list of all subscription filters
   that persist outside the lifecycle of a single subscription.  This
   enables predefined filters that may be referenced by more than one
   subscription.

   The "subscriptions" container maintains a list of all subscriptions
   on a publisher, both configured and dynamic.  It can be used to
   retrieve information about the subscriptions that a publisher is
   serving.

   To support deployments that include both configured and dynamic
   subscriptions, it is recommended that the subscription "id" domain be
   split into static and dynamic halves.  This will eliminate the
   possibility of collisions if the configured subscriptions attempt to
   set a "subscription-id" that might have already been dynamically
   allocated.  A best practice is to use the lower half of the "id"
   object's integer space when that "id" is assigned by an external
   entity (such as with a configured subscription).  This leaves the
   upper half of the subscription integer space available to be
   dynamically assigned by the publisher.

   If a subscription is unable to marshal a series of filtered event
   records into transmittable notification messages, the receiver should
   be suspended with the reason "unsupportable-volume".

   For configured subscriptions, operations are performed against the
   set of receivers using the subscription "id" as a handle for that
   set.  But for streaming updates, subscription state change
   notifications are local to a receiver.  In the case of this
   specification, receivers do not get any information from the
   publisher about the existence of other receivers.  But if a network
   operator wants to let the receivers correlate results, it is useful
   to use the subscription "id" across the receivers to allow that

   correlation.  Note that due to the possibility of different access
   control permissions per receiver, each receiver may actually get a
   different set of event records.

   For configured replay subscriptions, the receiver is protected from
   duplicated events being pushed after a publisher is rebooted.
   However, it is possible that a receiver might want to acquire event
   records that failed to be delivered just prior to the reboot.
   Delivering these event records can be accomplished by leveraging the
   &lt;eventTime&gt; [<a href="./rfc5277" title='"NETCONF Event Notifications"'>RFC5277</a>] from the last event record received prior to
   the receipt of a "subscription-started" subscription state change
   notification.  With this &lt;eventTime&gt; and the "replay-start-time" from
   the "subscription-started" notification, an independent dynamic
   subscription can be established that retrieves any event records that
   may have been generated but not sent to the receiver.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Transport%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Transport Requirements</span>

   This section provides requirements for any subscribed notification
   transport supporting the solution presented in this document.

   The transport selected by the subscriber to reach the publisher MUST
   be able to support multiple "establish-subscription" requests made in
   the same transport session.

   For both configured and dynamic subscriptions, the publisher MUST
   authenticate a receiver via some transport-level mechanism before
   sending any event records that the receiver is authorized to see.  In
   addition, the receiver MUST authenticate the publisher at the
   transport level.  The result is mutual authentication between
   the two.

   A secure transport is highly recommended.  Beyond this, the publisher
   MUST ensure that the receiver has sufficient authorization to perform
   the function it is requesting against the specific subset of content
   involved.

   A specification for a transport built upon this document may or may
   not choose to require the use of the same logical channel for the
   RPCs and the event records.  However, the event records and the
   subscription state change notifications MUST be sent on the same
   transport session to ensure properly ordered delivery.

   A specification for a transport MUST identify any encodings that are
   supported.  If a configured subscription's transport allows different
   encodings, the specification MUST identify the default encoding.

   A subscriber that includes a "dscp" leaf in an "establish-
   subscription" request will need to understand and consider what the
   corresponding DSCP value represents in the domain of the publisher.

   Additional transport requirements will be dictated by the choice of
   transport used with a subscription.  For an example of such
   requirements, see [<a href="./rfc8640" title='"Dynamic Subscription to YANG Events and Datastores over NETCONF"'>RFC8640</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>] or RESTCONF [<a href="./rfc8040" title='"RESTCONF Protocol"'>RFC8040</a>].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [<a href="./rfc6242" title='"Using the NETCONF Protocol over Secure Shell (SSH)"'>RFC6242</a>].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [<a href="./rfc8341" title='"Network Configuration Access Control Model"'>RFC8341</a>]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   With configured subscriptions, one or more publishers could be used
   to overwhelm a receiver.  To counter this, notification messages
   SHOULD NOT be sent to any receiver that does not support this
   specification.  Receivers that do not want notification messages need
   only terminate or refuse any transport sessions from the publisher.

   When a receiver of a configured subscription gets a new
   "subscription-started" message for a known subscription where it is
   already consuming events, it may indicate that an attacker has done
   something that has momentarily disrupted receiver connectivity.  To
   acquire events lost during this interval, the receiver SHOULD
   retrieve any event records generated since the last event record was
   received.  This can be accomplished by establishing a separate
   dynamic replay subscription with the same filtering criteria with the
   publisher, assuming that the publisher supports the "replay" feature.

   For dynamic subscriptions, implementations need to protect against
   malicious or buggy subscribers that may send a large number of
   "establish-subscription" requests and thereby use up system
   resources.  To cover this possibility, operators SHOULD monitor for
   such cases and, if discovered, take remedial action to limit the
   resources used, such as suspending or terminating a subset of the
   subscriptions or, if the underlying transport is session based,
   terminating the underlying transport session.

   The replay mechanisms described in Sections <a href="#section-2.4.2.1">2.4.2.1</a> and <a href="#section-2.5.6">2.5.6</a> provide
   access to historical event records.  By design, the access control
   model that protects these records could enable subscribers to view
   data to which they were not authorized at the time of collection.

   Using DNS names for configured subscription's receiver "name" lookups
   can cause situations where the name resolves differently than
   expected on the publisher, so the recipient would be different than
   expected.

   An attacker that can cause the publisher to use an incorrect time can
   induce message replay by setting the time in the past and can
   introduce a risk of message loss by setting the time in the future.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Container: "/filters"

   o  "stream-subtree-filter": Updating a filter could increase the
      computational complexity of all referencing subscriptions.

   o  "stream-xpath-filter": Updating a filter could increase the
      computational complexity of all referencing subscriptions.

   Container: "/subscriptions"

   The following considerations are only relevant for configuration
   operations made upon configured subscriptions:

   o  "configured-replay": Can be used to send a large number of event
      records to a receiver.

   o  "dependency": Can be used to force important traffic to be queued
      behind updates that are not as important.

   o  "dscp": If unvalidated, can result in the sending of traffic with
      a higher-priority marking than warranted.

   o  "id": Can overwrite an existing subscription, perhaps one
      configured by another entity.

   o  "name": Adding a new key entry can be used to attempt to send
      traffic to an unwilling receiver.

   o  "replay-start-time": Can be used to push very large logs, wasting
      resources.

   o  "source-address": The configured address might not be able to
      reach a desired receiver.

   o  "source-interface": The configured interface might not be able to
      reach a desired receiver.

   o  "source-vrf": Can place a subscription in a virtual network where
      receivers are not entitled to view the subscribed content.

   o  "stop-time": Could be used to terminate content at an inopportune
      time.

   o  "stream": Could set a subscription to an event stream that does
      not contain content permitted for the targeted receivers.

   o  "stream-filter-name": Could be set to a filter that is not
      relevant to the event stream.

   o  "stream-subtree-filter": A complex filter can increase the
      computational resources for this subscription.

   o  "stream-xpath-filter": A complex filter can increase the
      computational resources for this subscription.

   o  "weighting": Allocating a large weight can overwhelm the dequeuing
      of other subscriptions.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Container: "/streams"

   o  "name": If access control is not properly configured, can expose
      system internals to those who should not have access to this
      information.

   o  "replay-support": If access control is not properly configured,
      can expose logs to those who should not have access.

   Container: "/subscriptions"

   o  "excluded-event-records": This leaf can provide information about
      filtered event records.  A network operator should have the proper
      permissions to know about such filtering.  However, exposing the
      count of excluded events to a receiver could leak information
      about the presence of access control filters that might be in
      place for that receiver.

   o  "subscription": Different operational teams might have a desire to
      set varying subsets of subscriptions.  Access control should be
      designed to permit read access to just the allowed set.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   RPC: all

   o  If a malicious or buggy subscriber sends an unexpectedly large
      number of RPCs, the result might be an excessive use of system
      resources on the publisher just to determine that these
      subscriptions should be declined.  In such a situation,
      subscription interactions MAY be terminated by terminating the
      transport session.

   RPC: "delete-subscription"

   o  No special considerations.

   RPC: "establish-subscription"

   o  Subscriptions could overload a publisher's resources.  For this
      reason, publishers MUST ensure that they have sufficient resources
      to fulfill this request; otherwise, they MUST reject the request.

   RPC: "kill-subscription"

   o  The "kill-subscription" RPC MUST be secured so that only
      connections with administrative rights are able to invoke
      this RPC.

   RPC: "modify-subscription"

   o  Subscriptions could overload a publisher's resources.  For this
      reason, publishers MUST ensure that they have sufficient resources
      to fulfill this request; otherwise, they MUST reject the request.

   This appendix provides a non-normative example of how the YANG module
   defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> may be enhanced to incorporate the configuration
   parameters needed to support the transport connectivity process.
   This example is not intended to be a complete transport model.  In
   this example, connectivity via an imaginary transport type of "foo"
   is explored.  For more on the overall objectives behind configuring
   transport connectivity for a configured subscription, see
   <a href="#section-2.5.7">Section 2.5.7</a>.

   The YANG module example defined in this appendix contains two main
   elements.  First is a transport identity "foo".  This transport
   identity allows a configuration agent to define "foo" as the selected
   type of transport for a subscription.  Second is a YANG case
   augmentation "foo", which is made to the
   "/subscriptions/subscription/receivers/receiver" node of <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.
   In this augmentation are the transport configuration parameters
   "address" and "port", which are necessary to make the connection to
   the receiver.

                     for the Fictitious Protocol "foo"

   This example YANG module for transport "foo" will not be seen in a
   real-world deployment.  For a real-world deployment supporting an
   actual transport technology, a similar YANG module must be defined.
