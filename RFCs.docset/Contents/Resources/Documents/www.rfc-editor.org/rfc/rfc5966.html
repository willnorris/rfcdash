<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Most DNS [<a href="./rfc1034" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>RFC1034</a>] transactions take place over UDP [<a href="./rfc0768" title='"User Datagram Protocol"'>RFC0768</a>].  TCP
   [<a href="./rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>] is always used for zone transfers and is often used for
   messages whose sizes exceed the DNS protocol's original 512-byte
   limit.

   <a href="./rfc1123#section-6.1.3.2">Section 6.1.3.2 of [RFC1123]</a> states:

      DNS resolvers and recursive servers MUST support UDP, and SHOULD
      support TCP, for sending (non-zone-transfer) queries.

   However, some implementors have taken the text quoted above to mean
   that TCP support is an optional feature of the DNS protocol.

   The majority of DNS server operators already support TCP and the
   default configuration for most software implementations is to support
   TCP.  The primary audience for this document is those implementors
   whose failure to support TCP restricts interoperability and limits
   deployment of new DNS features.

   This document therefore updates the core DNS protocol specifications
   such that support for TCP is henceforth a REQUIRED part of a full DNS
   protocol implementation.

   Whilst this document makes no specific recommendations to operators
   of DNS servers, it should be noted that failure to support TCP (or
   the blocking of DNS over TCP at the network layer) may result in
   resolution failure and/or application-level timeouts.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology%20Used%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology Used in This Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Discussion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Discussion</span>

   In the absence of EDNS0 (Extension Mechanisms for DNS 0) (see below),
   the normal behaviour of any DNS server needing to send a UDP response
   that would exceed the 512-byte limit is for the server to truncate
   the response so that it fits within that limit and then set the TC
   flag in the response header.  When the client receives such a
   response, it takes the TC flag as an indication that it should retry
   over TCP instead.

   <a href="./rfc1123">RFC 1123</a> also says:

      ... it is also clear that some new DNS record types defined in the
      future will contain information exceeding the 512 byte limit that
      applies to UDP, and hence will require TCP.  Thus, resolvers and
      name servers should implement TCP services as a backup to UDP
      today, with the knowledge that they will require the TCP service
      in the future.

   Existing deployments of DNS Security (DNSSEC) [<a href="./rfc4033" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>] have shown
   that truncation at the 512-byte boundary is now commonplace.  For
   example, a Non-Existent Domain (NXDOMAIN) (RCODE == 3) response from
   a DNSSEC-signed zone using NextSECure 3 (NSEC3) [<a href="./rfc5155" title='"DNS Security (DNSSEC) Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence"'>RFC5155</a>] is almost
   invariably larger than 512 bytes.

   Since the original core specifications for DNS were written, the
   Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0 [<a href="./rfc2671" title='"Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)"'>RFC2671</a>]) have been introduced.
   These extensions can be used to indicate that the client is prepared
   to receive UDP responses larger than 512 bytes.  An EDNS0-compatible
   server receiving a request from an EDNS0-compatible client may send
   UDP packets up to that client's announced buffer size without
   truncation.

   However, transport of UDP packets that exceed the size of the path
   MTU causes IP packet fragmentation, which has been found to be
   unreliable in some circumstances.  Many firewalls routinely block
   fragmented IP packets, and some do not implement the algorithms
   necessary to reassemble fragmented packets.  Worse still, some
   network devices deliberately refuse to handle DNS packets containing
   EDNS0 options.  Other issues relating to UDP transport and packet
   size are discussed in [<a href="./rfc5625" title='"DNS Proxy Implementation Guidelines"'>RFC5625</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5966">RFC 5966</a>                      DNS over TCP                   August 2010</span>


   The MTU most commonly found in the core of the Internet is around
   1500 bytes, and even that limit is routinely exceeded by DNSSEC-
   signed responses.

   The future that was anticipated in <a href="./rfc1123">RFC 1123</a> has arrived, and the only
   standardised UDP-based mechanism that may have resolved the packet
   size issue has been found inadequate.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Transport%20Protocol%20Selection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Transport Protocol Selection</span>

   All general-purpose DNS implementations MUST support both UDP and TCP
   transport.

   o  Authoritative server implementations MUST support TCP so that they
      do not limit the size of responses to what fits in a single UDP
      packet.

   o  Recursive server (or forwarder) implementations MUST support TCP
      so that they do not prevent large responses from a TCP-capable
      server from reaching its TCP-capable clients.

   o  Stub resolver implementations (e.g., an operating system's DNS
      resolution library) MUST support TCP since to do otherwise would
      limit their interoperability with their own clients and with
      upstream servers.

   Stub resolver implementations MAY omit support for TCP when
   specifically designed for deployment in restricted environments where
   truncation can never occur or where truncated DNS responses are
   acceptable.

   Regarding the choice of when to use UDP or TCP, <a href="./rfc1123#section-6.1.3.2">Section 6.1.3.2 of
   RFC 1123</a> also says:

      ... a DNS resolver or server that is sending a non-zone-transfer
      query MUST send a UDP query first.

   That requirement is hereby relaxed.  A resolver SHOULD send a UDP
   query first, but MAY elect to send a TCP query instead if it has good
   reason to expect the response would be truncated if it were sent over
   UDP (with or without EDNS0) or for other operational reasons, in
   particular, if it already has an open TCP connection to the server.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Connection%20Handling"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Connection Handling</span>

   <a href="./rfc1035#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2 of [RFC1035]</a> says:

      If the server needs to close a dormant connection to reclaim
      resources, it should wait until the connection has been idle for a
      period on the order of two minutes.  In particular, the server
      should allow the SOA and AXFR request sequence (which begins a
      refresh operation) to be made on a single connection.  Since the
      server would be unable to answer queries anyway, a unilateral
      close or reset may be used instead of a graceful close.

   Other more modern protocols (e.g., HTTP [<a href="./rfc2616" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>]) have support for
   persistent TCP connections and operational experience has shown that
   long timeouts can easily cause resource exhaustion and poor response
   under heavy load.  Intentionally opening many connections and leaving
   them dormant can trivially create a "denial-of-service" attack.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the default application-level idle
   period should be of the order of seconds, but no particular value is
   specified.  In practise, the idle period may vary dynamically, and
   servers MAY allow dormant connections to remain open for longer
   periods as resources permit.

   To mitigate the risk of unintentional server overload, DNS clients
   MUST take care to minimize the number of concurrent TCP connections
   made to any individual server.  Similarly, servers MAY impose limits
   on the number of concurrent TCP connections being handled for any
   particular client.

   Further recommendations for the tuning of TCP stacks to allow higher
   throughput or improved resiliency against denial-of-service attacks
   are outside the scope of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Response%20Reordering"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Response Reordering</span>

   <a href="./rfc1035">RFC 1035</a> is ambiguous on the question of whether TCP queries may be
   reordered -- the only relevant text is in <a href="#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1</a>, which
   relates to UDP:

      Queries or their responses may be reordered by the network, or by
      processing in name servers, so resolvers should not depend on them
      being returned in order.

   For the avoidance of future doubt, this requirement is clarified.
   Client resolvers MUST be able to process responses that arrive in a
   different order to that in which the requests were sent, regardless
   of the transport protocol in use.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5966">RFC 5966</a>                      DNS over TCP                   August 2010</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Some DNS server operators have expressed concern that wider use of
   DNS over TCP will expose them to a higher risk of denial-of-service
   (DoS) attacks.

   Although there is a higher risk of such attacks against TCP-enabled
   servers, techniques for the mitigation of DoS attacks at the network
   level have improved substantially since DNS was first designed.

   At the time of writing, the vast majority of Top Level Domain (TLD)
   authority servers and all of the root name servers support TCP and
   the author knows of no evidence to suggest that TCP-based DoS attacks
   against existing DNS infrastructure are commonplace.

   That notwithstanding, readers are advised to familiarise themselves
   with [<a href="#ref-CPNI-TCP" title='"Security Assessment of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)"'>CPNI-TCP</a>].

   Operators of recursive servers should ensure that they only accept
   connections from expected clients, and do not accept them from
   unknown sources.  In the case of UDP traffic, this will help protect
   against reflector attacks [<a href="./rfc5358" title='"Preventing Use of Recursive Nameservers in Reflector Attacks"'>RFC5358</a>] and in the case of TCP traffic it
   will prevent an unknown client from exhausting the server's limits on
   the number of concurrent connections.
