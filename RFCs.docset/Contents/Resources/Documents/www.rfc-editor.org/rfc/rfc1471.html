Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Link Control Protocol and Link Quality Monitoring on subnetwork
   interfaces that use the family of Point-to-Point Protocols [8, 9, 10,
   11, &amp; 12].

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is
      wholly consistent with the SMI.

      STD 17/RFC 1213 which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Objects</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-3" title=" International Organization for Standardization">3</a>]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>5</a>,<a href="#ref-6" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>6</a>].

   To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practice,
   an explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB as simple as possible.
   This was accomplished by applying the following criteria to objects
   proposed for inclusion:

      (1)  Require objects be essential for either fault or
           configuration management.  In particular, objects for

           which the sole purpose was to debug implementations were
           explicitly excluded from the MIB.

      (2)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

      (3)  Limit the total number of objects.

      (4)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
           this or other MIBs.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Structure%20of%20the%20PPP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Structure of the PPP</span>

   This section describes the basic model of PPP used in developing the
   PPP MIB. This information should be useful to the implementor in
   understanding some of the basic design decisions of the MIB.

   The PPP is not one single protocol but a large family of protocols.
   Each of these is, in itself, a fairly complex protocol.  The PPP
   protocols may be divided into three rough categories:

   Control Protocols
      The Control Protocols are used to control the operation of the
      PPP. The Control Protocols include the Link Control Protocol
      (LCP), the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), the Link
      Quality Report (LQR), and the Challenge Handshake Authentication
      Protocol (CHAP).

   Network Protocols
      The Network Protocols are used to move the network traffic over
      the PPP interface.  A Network Protocol encapsulates the datagrams
      of a specific higher-layer protocol that is using the PPP as a
      data link.  Note that within the context of PPP, the term "Network
      Protocol" does not imply an OSI Layer-3 protocol; for instance,
      there is a Bridging network protocol.

   Network Control Protocols (NCPs)
      The NCPs are used to control the operation of the Network
      Protocols. Generally, each Network Protocol has its own Network
      Control Protocol; thus, the IP Network Protocol has its IP Control
      Protocol, the Bridging Network Protocol has its Bridging Network
      Control Protocol and so on.

   This document specifies the objects used in managing one of these
   protocols, namely the Link Control Protocol and Link Quality
   Monitoring Protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20MIB%20Groups"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  MIB Groups</span>

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into several MIB groups.  Each group
   is organized as a set of related objects.

   These groups are the basic unit of conformance: if the semantics of a
   group are applicable to an implementation then all objects in the
   group must be implemented.

   The PPP MIB is organized into several MIB Groups, including, but not
   limited to, the following groups:

          o The PPP Link Group
          o The PPP LQR Group
          o The PPP LQR Extensions Group
          o The PPP IP Group
          o The PPP Bridge Group
          o The PPP Security Group

   This document specifies the following groups:

   The PPP Link Group
      This group represents the lowest "level" of the PPP protocol.

      This group contains two tables, one containing status information
      and the other configuration information.  The configuration table
      is split off of the status so that it may be placed in a separate
      MIB View for security purposes.

      Implementation of this group is mandatory for all PPP
      implementations.

   The PPP LQR Group
      This group provides the basic MIB variables that apply to the PPP
      LQR Protocol.  This group provides MIB access to the information
      required for LQR processing. This group contains two tables, one
      containing status information and the other configuration
      information.  The configuration table is split off of the status
      so that it may be placed in a separate MIB View for security
      purposes.

      Implementation of the PPP LQR Group is mandatory for all PPP
      implementations that implement LQR.

   The PPP LQR Extensions Group
      The PPP LQR Extensions group contains the most recently received
      LQR packet, as well as the "save" fields that are "logically
      appended" [<a href="#ref-12" title='"PPP Link Quality Monitoring"'>12</a>] to received LQR packets.  This is done in order to



<span class="grey">Kastenholz                                                      [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1471">RFC 1471</a>                      PPP/LCP MIB                      June 1993</span>


      facilitate external implementations of the Link Quality Monitoring
      policies.

      It is not practical to examine the relevant MIB objects which are
      used to generate LQR packets since LQR policies may require
      synchronization of the values of all data used to determine Link
      Quality; i.e., the values of the relevant counters must all be
      taken at the same instant in time.  Thus, by recording the last
      received LQR packet, a synchronized record of the relevant data is
      available.

      As this information may not be efficiently maintained on all PPP
      implementations, implementation of this group is optional.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Groups"></a>      Groups</span>

   The PPP Mib is a medium-specific extension to the standard MIB-2
   interface group [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>2</a>] and to the Interface Extensions MIB [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB"'>7</a>].  This
   section discusses certain components of these groups when the
   interface is a PPP interface.

   The PPP interface represents a single interface in the sense used in
   [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>2</a>] and thus has a single entry in the ifTable.

   Furthermore, the PPP interface may be operating over a lower layer
   hardware interface (such as an RS-232 port).  It is important to
   capture the relationship between the PPP interface and the lower-
   layer interface over which it operates.  This MIB presumes that the
   lower-layer interface has an ifEntry associated with it.  The lower-
   layer ifEntry is identified via the pppLinkStatusPhysicalIndex
   object, which contains the value of ifIndex for the lower-layer
   ifEntry.

   For example, suppose that you run PPP over a RS-232 port.  This would
   use two entries in the ifTable.  Let's suppose that entry number 123
   is for the PPP "interface" and entry number 987 is for the RS-232
   port.  So, ifSpecific.123 would contain the ppp OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
   pppLinkStatusPhysicalIndex.123 would contain 987, and ifSpecific.987
   would contain the rs_232 OBJECT IDENTIFIER (or whatever it is).

   All PPP packets are defined in [<a href="#ref-8" title="W.">8</a>] as being broadcast packets.  Thus,
   the packets are counted as non-unicast packets in the ifTable
   (ifInNUcastPkts and ifOutNUCastPkts) and as broadcasts in the
   ifExtnsTable (ifExtnsBroadcastsReceivedOks and
   ifExtnsBroadcastsTransmittedOks).

   ifSpecific
      Contains the OBJECT IDENTIFIER ppp.

   ifAdminStatus
      Setting this object to up will inject an administrative open event
      into the LCP's finite state machine.  Setting this object to down
      will inject an administrative close event into the LCP's finite
      state machine.

      The use of the testing value is beyond the scope of this document.

   ifOperStatus
      Represents the state of the LCP Finite State Machine.  If the
      Finite State Machine is in the Opened state then the value of
      ifOperStatus is up, otherwise the value of ifOperStatus is down.

      The meaning of the testing value is beyond the scope of this
      document.

   Per the SNMP Protocol Specification [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>13</a>], the linkUp and linkDown
   traps apply to the PPP Protocol entity.  When the LCP's Finite State
   Machine attains the Opened state, a linkUp trap should be sent. When
   the Finite State Machine leaves the Opened state, a linkDown trap
   should be sent.

   Some tests for the link are defined in this document.  Execution of
   these tests does not place the link's ifOperStatus in the testing
   state as these tests do not prevent normal data transmission from
   occuring over the link.

                         not performed. In any event, the local node
                         will comply with any magic number negotiations

                         Setting this object to the value disabled(1)
                         has the effect of invalidating the
                         corresponding entry in the pppLqrConfigTable
                         object. It is an implementation-specific matter
                         as to whether the agent removes an invalidated
                         entry from the table. Accordingly, management
                         stations must be prepared to receive tabular
                         information from agents that corresponds to
                         entries not currently in use."

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The PPP MIB affords the network operator the ability to configure and
   control the PPP links of a particular system.  This represents a
   security risk.

   These risks are addressed in the following manners:

      (1)  All variables which represent a significant security risk
           are placed in separate, optional, MIB Groups. As the MIB
           Group is the quantum of implementation within a MIB, the
           implementor of the MIB may elect not to implement these
           groups.

      (2)  The implementor may choose to implement the variables
           which present a security risk so that they may not be
           written, i.e., the variables are READ-ONLY. This method
           still presents a security risk, and is not recommended,
           in that the variables, specifically the PPP
           Authentication Protocols' variables, may be easily read.

      (3)  Using SNMPv2, the operator can place the variables into
           MIB views which are protected in that the parties which
           have access to those MIB views use authentication and
           privacy protocols, or the operator may elect to make
           these views not accessible to any party.  In order to
           facilitate this placement, all security-related variables
           are placed in separate MIB Tables. This eases the
           identification of the necessary MIB View Subtree.
