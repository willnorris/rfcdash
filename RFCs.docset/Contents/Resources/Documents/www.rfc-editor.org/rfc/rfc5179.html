   This document describes the mapping of Generic Security Service
   Application Program Interface (GSS-API) domain-name-based service
   principal names onto Kerberos V principal names.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Domain-Based%20Names%20for%20the%20Kerberos%20V%20GSS-API%20Mechanism"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Domain-Based Names for the Kerberos V GSS-API Mechanism</span>

   In accordance with [<a href="./rfc5178" title='"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Internationalization and Domain-Based Service Names and Name Type"'>RFC5178</a>], this document provides the mechanism-
   specific details needed to implement GSS-API [<a href="./rfc2743" title='"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1"'>RFC2743</a>] domain-based
   service names with the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism [<a href="./rfc4121" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2"'>RFC4121</a>].

   GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE name SHOULD be mapped to Kerberos V
   principal names as follows:

   o  the &lt;service&gt; name becomes the first (0th) component of the
      Kerberos V principal name;

   o  the &lt;hostname&gt; becomes the second component of the Kerberos V
      principal name;

   o  the &lt;domain&gt; name becomes the third component of the Kerberos V
      principal name;

   o  the realm of the resulting principal name is that which
      corresponds to the domain name, treated as a hostname.

   The same name canonicalization considerations and methods as used
   elsewhere in the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism [<a href="./rfc4121" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2"'>RFC4121</a>] and Kerberos
   V [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] in general apply here.

   Implementations SHOULD use a Kerberos V name-type of
   NTT-SRVT-HST-DOMAIN (which has the value 12) but MAY use NT-UNKNOWN
   instead.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Internationalization%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Internationalization Considerations</span>

   It is unclear, at this time, how best to address internationalization
   of Kerberos V domain-based principal names.  This is because the
   Kerberos V core protocol internationalization project is incomplete.

   However, clearly the best way to interoperate when using Kerberos V
   domain-based principal names is to use ACE-encoded internationalized
   domain names [<a href="./rfc3490" title='"Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)"'>RFC3490</a>] for the hostname and domain name slots of a
   Kerberos V domain-based principal name.  Therefore Kerberos V GSS-API
   mechanism implementations MUST do just that.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Examples</span>

   o  The domain-based name, of generic form,
      "ldap@foo.example@ds1.foo.example" may map to a Kerberos V
      principal name like: "ldap/ds1.foo.example/
      foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE"

   o  The domain-based name, of generic form,
      "kadmin@foo.example@kdc1.foo.example" may map to a Kerberos V
      principal name like: "kadmin/kdc1.foo.example/
      foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE"

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   See [<a href="./rfc5178" title='"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Internationalization and Domain-Based Service Names and Name Type"'>RFC5178</a>].

   It is important for the security of protocols using the Kerberos V
   GSS-API mechanism and domain-based names, that the realm of domain-
   based principal names be derived from the hostname, rather than the
   domain name slots of the input domain-based name string.
