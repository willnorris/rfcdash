<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The "IS-IS TLV Codepoints" registry was created by [<a href="./rfc3563" title='"Cooperative Agreement Between the ISOC/IETF and ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1/Sub Committee 6 (JTC1/SC6) on IS-IS Routing Protocol Development"'>RFC3563</a>] and
   extended by [<a href="./rfc6233" title='"IS-IS Registry Extension for Purges"'>RFC6233</a>].  The assignment policy for the registry is
   "Expert Review" as defined in [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  As documents related to
   IS-IS are developed, the codepoints required for the protocol
   extensions are reviewed by the Designated Experts and added to the
   IANA-managed registry.  As these documents are published as RFCs, the
   registries are updated to reference the relevant RFC.

   In the case of TLVs supporting prefix advertisement, currently
   separate sub-TLV registries are maintained for each TLV.  These
   registries need to be combined into a common sub-TLV registry similar
   to what has been done for neighbor advertisement TLVs.

   In some cases, there is a need to allocate codepoints defined in
   Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) that seem likely to eventually gain Working
   Group approval, without waiting for those I-Ds to be published as
   RFCs.  This can be achieved using Expert Review, and this document
   sets out guidance for the Designated Experts to apply when reviewing
   allocations from the registry.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7370">RFC 7370</a>                  IS-IS TLV Codepoints            September 2014</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20IS%20Neighbor%20Sub-TLV%20Registry"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  IS Neighbor Sub-TLV Registry</span>

   There was an existing common sub-TLV registry named "Sub-TLVs for
   TLVs 22, 141, and 222".  [<a href="./rfc5311" title='"Simplified Extension of Link State PDU (LSP) Space for IS-IS"'>RFC5311</a>] defines the IS Neighbor Attribute
   TLV (23) and the MT IS Neighbor Attribute TLV (223).  The format of
   these TLVs is identical to TLVs 22 and 222, respectively.  The IS
   Neighbor sub-TLV registry has been extended to include these two
   TLVs.  Settings for inclusion of each sub-TLV are identical to the
   settings for TLVs 22 and 222, respectively.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Prefix%20Reachability%20Sub-TLV%20Registry"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV Registry</span>

   Previously, there existed separate sub-TLV registries for TLVs 135,
   235, 236, and 237.  As in the case of the IS Neighbor TLVs discussed
   in the previous section, assignment of sub-TLVs applicable to one or
   more of these TLVs is intended to be common.  Therefore, the existing
   separate sub-TLV registries have been combined into a single registry
   entitled "Sub-TLVs for TLVs 135, 235, 236, and 237".  As existing
   sub-TLV assignments are common to all the TLVs, this represents no
   change to the protocol -- only a clearer representation of the
   intended sub-TLV allocation strategy.  The format of the registry is
   as shown below:

   Type  Description                       135 235 236 237  Reference
   ----  ------------                      --- --- --- ---  ---------
   0     Unassigned
   1     32-bit Administrative Tag Sub-TLV  y   y   y   y   [<a href="./rfc5130" title='"A Policy Control Mechanism in IS-IS Using Administrative Tags"'>RFC5130</a>]
   2     64-bit Administrative Tag Sub-TLV  y   y   y   y   [<a href="./rfc5130" title='"A Policy Control Mechanism in IS-IS Using Administrative Tags"'>RFC5130</a>]

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Guidance%20for%20Designated%20Experts"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Guidance for Designated Experts</span>

   When new I-Ds are introduced requiring new codepoints, it is
   advantageous to be able to allocate codepoints without waiting for
   them to progress to RFC.  The reasons this is advantageous are
   described in [<a href="./rfc7120" title='"Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points"'>RFC7120</a>].  However, the procedures in [<a href="./rfc7120" title='"Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points"'>RFC7120</a>] for
   early allocation do not apply to registries, such as the "IS-IS TLV
   Codepoints" registry, that utilize the "Expert Review" allocation
   policy.  In such cases, what is required is that a request be made to
   the Designated Experts who MAY approve the assignments according to
   the guidance that has been established for the registry concerned.

   The following guidance applies specifically to the "IS-IS TLV
   Codepoints" registry.

   1.  Application for a codepoint allocation MAY be made to the
       Designated Experts at any time.




<span class="grey">Ginsberg                     Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>

   2.  The Designated Experts SHOULD only consider requests that arise
       from I-Ds that have already been accepted as Working Group
       documents or that are planned for progression as AD Sponsored
       documents in the absence of a suitably chartered Working Group.

   3.  In the case of Working Group documents, the Designated Experts
       SHOULD check with the Working Group chairs that there is
       consensus within the Working Group to make the allocation at this
       time.  In the case of AD Sponsored documents, the Designated
       Experts SHOULD check with the AD for approval to make the
       allocation at this time.

   4.  The Designated Experts SHOULD then review the assignment requests
       on their technical merit.  The Designated Experts SHOULD NOT seek
       to overrule IETF consensus, but they MAY raise issues for further
       consideration before the assignments are made.

   5.  Once the Designated Experts have granted approval, IANA will
       update the registry by marking the allocated codepoints with a
       reference to the associated document as normal.

   6.  In the event that the document fails to progress to RFC, the
       Expiry and deallocation process defined in [<a href="./rfc7120" title='"Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points"'>RFC7120</a>] MUST be
       followed for the relevant codepoints -- noting that the
       Designated Experts perform the role assigned to Working Group
       chairs.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   This document provides guidance to the Designated Experts appointed
   to manage allocation requests in the "IS-IS TLV Codepoints" registry.

   IANA has updated the registry that was specified as "Sub-TLVs for
   TLVs 22, 141, and 222" to be named "Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23, 141,
   222, and 223".

   Per this document, the existing sub-TLV registries for TLVs 135, 235,
   236, and 237 have been combined into a single registry -- the
   "Sub-TLVs for TLVs 135, 235, 236, and 237" registry -- as described
   in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   This document introduces no new security issues.
