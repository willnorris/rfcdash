 <span class="h1">Update to Remove DVI4 from the Recommended Codecs for the RTP Profile</span>
     <span class="h1">for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP)</span>

Abstract

   The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
   (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for
   Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback
   (RTP/AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based
   Feedback (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates <a href="./rfc3551">RFC 3551</a>, the RTP/AVP
   profile (and by extension, the profiles that build upon it), to
   reflect changes in audio codec usage since that document was
   originally published.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC3551">RFC3551</a>] says that audio applications operating under the RTP/AVP
   profile SHOULD be able to send and receive PCMU and DVI4.  However,
   in practice, many RTP deployments do not support DVI4, and there is
   little reason to use it when much more modern codecs are available.
   This document updates the recommended audio codec selection for the
   RTP/AVP profile and removes the SHOULD for DVI4.  By extension, this
   also updates the profiles that build on RTP/AVP, including RTP/SAVP
   [<a href="./rfc3711" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>], RTP/AVPF [<a href="./rfc4585" title='"Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"'>RFC4585</a>], and RTP/SAVPF [<a href="./rfc5124" title='"Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"'>RFC5124</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Updates%20to%20RFC%203551"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Updates to <a href="./rfc3551">RFC 3551</a></span>

   The following text of [<a href="./rfc3551" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>] is hereby updated as set forth in
   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>:

      Audio applications operating under this profile SHOULD, at a
      minimum, be able to send and/or receive payload types 0 (PCMU)
      and 5 (DVI4).  This allows interoperability without format
      negotiation and ensures successful negotiation with a conference
      control protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Updates%20to%20Section%206%20of%20RFC%203551"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Updates to <a href="./rfc3551#section-6">Section 6 of RFC 3551</a></span>

   This document updates the final paragraph of <a href="./rfc3551#section-6">Section 6 of RFC 3551</a> by
   replacing "payload types 0 (PCMU) and 5 (DVI4)" with "payload
   type 0 (PCMU)".  We also add a final sentence to that paragraph that
   states, "Some environments necessitate support for PCMU".  This
   results in the following paragraph:

      Audio applications operating under this profile SHOULD, at a
      minimum, be able to send and/or receive payload type 0 (PCMU).
      This allows interoperability without format negotiation and
      ensures successful negotiation with a conference control protocol.
      Some environments necessitate support for PCMU.

   [<a href="./rfc3551" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>].
