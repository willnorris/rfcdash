         <span class="h1">Wrongful Termination of Internet Protocol (IP) Packets</span>

Abstract

   Routers and middleboxes terminate packets for various reasons.  In
   some cases, these packets are wrongfully terminated.  This memo
   describes some of the most common scenarios of wrongful termination
   of Internet Protocol (IP) packets and presents recommendations for
   mitigating them.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   IP packets are often terminated by network devices.  In some cases,
   control-plane packets are terminated and processed by the local
   device, while in other cases packets are terminated (discarded) due
   to a packet filtering mechanism.  Packet filtering is widely employed
   in network devices for sanity checking, policy enforcement, and
   security.  IP routers and middleboxes, such as firewalls, often
   terminate packets that do not comply with a predefined policy.
   Unfortunately, some filtering policies cause false positive or
   unnecessary packet termination.  Moreover, these wrongful
   terminations are sometimes biased and discriminate against packets
   based on their color, age, origin, length, or IP version.

   This memo discusses some of the most common scenarios of wrongful
   termination of IP packets and presents recommendations for preventing
   such discrimination.

   Synopsis

      IP packets are terminated due to their color.

   Description

      Routers often employ metering mechanisms [<a href="./rfc4115" title='"A Differentiated Service Two-Rate, Three-Color Marker with Efficient Handling of in-Profile Traffic"'>RFC4115</a>].  These
      mechanisms often support a color-aware mode, in which the packet's
      color (green, yellow, or red) is used as a criterion in the
      metering algorithm.  This mode has been known to prefer green
      packets over red and yellow packets.

   Recommendation

      Use of color-blind metering is recommended, as it allows equal
      opportunity for packets of different colors.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Age-Based%20Termination"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Age-Based Termination</span>

   Synopsis

      IP packets are terminated based on their TTL.

   Description

      The IPv4 TTL field [<a href="./rfc791" title='"Internet Protocol"'>RFC791</a>] and the IPv6 Hop Limit field [<a href="./rfc8200" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC8200</a>]
      are used for loop prevention.  These fields essentially represent
      the packet's age.  A router that receives an IP packet with a TTL
      value of 0 or 1 typically terminates the packet.  In this
      document, packets with a TTL or Hop Limit of 0 or 1 are referred
      to as 'senior packets'.

   Recommendation

      When possible, the practice of reverse discrimination is
      recommended.  Notably, senior packets have been known to be highly
      effective for OAM tasks, such as Hello [<a href="./rfc2328" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>RFC2328</a>] and Traceroute
      [<a href="./rfc2151" title='"A Primer On Internet and TCP/IP Tools and Utilities"'>RFC2151</a>].  Therefore, senior packets should not be easily
      dismissed; to the extent possible, senior packets should be used
      in control-plane protocols.

   Synopsis

      IP packets are terminated based on their origin (source IP address
      prefix).

   Description

      Routers and middleboxes often perform IP address filtering.
      Packets are often discarded based on the prefix of their source IP
      address.  In this memo, prefix-based source address filtering is
      referred to as origin-based filtering.  While source IP address
      filtering is an acceptable technique for preventing security
      attacks performed by known attackers, filtering an entire prefix
      may lead to unnecessary termination of legitimate traffic.

   Recommendation

      Origin-based filtering should be limited, to the extent possible,
      so as not to punish an entire autonomous system for the crime of a
      single host.  Individual address-based filtering should be
      preferred in cases where the address of the potential threat is
      well known.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Length-Based%20Termination"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Length-Based Termination</span>

   Synopsis

      Short IP packets are wrongfully terminated due to their length.

   Description

      The minimum permissible size of an IPv4 [<a href="./rfc791" title='"Internet Protocol"'>RFC791</a>] packet is 20
      octets, and the minimum size of an IPv6 [<a href="./rfc8200" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC8200</a>] packet is 40
      octets.  However, due to the size limits of Ethernet, it is often
      the case that IP packets that are shorter than 46 octets are
      discarded.  This is because the minimal Ethernet frame size is 64
      octets, the minimal Ethernet header size is 14 octets, and the
      Ethernet Frame Check Sequence is 4 octets long (i.e., 64 - 14 - 4
      = 46). In the context of this memo, legitimate IP packets that are
      less than 46 octets long are referred to as 'short IP packets'.

   Recommendation

      Short IP packets should not be discarded.  The Ethernet frame
      length should be enforced at the Ethernet layer, while the IP
      layer should avoid discrimination of short IP packets.

   Synopsis

      IPv6 packets are terminated due to their version.

   Description

      Many routers and middleboxes are configured to process only IPv4
      [<a href="./rfc791" title='"Internet Protocol"'>RFC791</a>] packets and to reject IPv6 [<a href="./rfc8200" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC8200</a>] packets.

   Recommendation

      It is quite unsettling that there are still networks in which IPv6
      packets are deemed unwanted in the second decade of the 21st
      century.  Indeed, IPv6 packets have a slightly shorter payload
      than IPv4 packets.  However, they are essential to the future
      growth of the Internet.  It is time for operators to finally give
      IPv6 its well-deserved opportunity.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.6.%20%20Flag-Based%20Termination"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6" id="section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Flag-Based Termination</span>

   Synopsis

      IPv4 packets are terminated because their More Fragments (MF) flag
      is set.

   Description

      Many routers and middleboxes are configured to discard fragmented
      packets.

   Recommendation

      A packet should not be discarded on the grounds of a flag it
      supports.  All flags should be respected, as well as the features
      they represent.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This memo proposes to practice liberality with respect to IP packet
   filtering in routers and middleboxes.  Arguably, such a liberal
   approach may compromise security in some cases.  Not only must
   security be done; it must also be seen to be done.

   This memo recommends that every router and middlebox be an Equal
   Opportunity Device, which does not discriminate on the basis of
   actual or perceived rate, color, age, origin, length, IP version,
   fragmentation characteristics, higher-layer protocols, or any other
   IP characteristic.
