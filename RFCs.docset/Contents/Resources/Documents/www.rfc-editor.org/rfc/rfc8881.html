<title>RFC 8881: Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 Protocol</title>
<meta content="David Noveck" name="author"/>
<meta content="Charles Lever" name="author"/>
<meta content="
       
 This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4
 minor version 1,
        including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor
        version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol
        extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version
        has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and 
        is considered a separate protocol. 
       
       
 This document obsoletes RFC 5661.  It substantially revises the treatment
 of features relating to multi-server namespace, superseding the
 description of those features appearing in RFC 5661.

  NOTE: Changes at the bottom of this file overrides some earlier settings.

  Once the style has stabilized and has been adopted as an official RFC style,
  this can be consolidated so that style settings occur only in one place, but
  for now the contents of this file consists first of the initial CSS work as
  provided to the RFC Formatter (xml2rfc) work, followed by itemized and
  commented changes found necssary during the development of the v3
  formatters.

<p id="section-abstract-1">
 This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4
 minor version 1,
        including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor
        version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol
        extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version
        has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and 
        is considered a separate protocol.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-abstract-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-abstract-2">
 This document obsoletes RFC 5661.  It substantially revises the treatment
 of features relating to multi-server namespace, superseding the
 description of those features appearing in RFC 5661.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-abstract-2">¶</a></p>

      Two important features previously defined in minor version 0 but
      never fully addressed in minor version 1 are trunking, which is the
      simultaneous use of
      multiple connections between a client and server, potentially to
      different network addresses, and Transparent State Migration, which
      allows a file system to be transferred between servers in a way that
      provides to the client the ability to maintain its existing locking
      state across the transfer.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-1.1-1">¶</a></p>

      The revised description of the NFS version 4 minor version 1
      (NFSv4.1) protocol presented in this update is necessary to enable
      full use of these features together with other multi-server namespace
      features.  This document is in the form of an updated description of
      the NFSv4.1 protocol previously defined in RFC 5661
      <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5661">66</a>]</span>.
      RFC 5661 is obsoleted by this document. However, the update has a
      limited scope and is focused on enabling full use of trunking and
      Transparent State Migration. The need for these changes is discussed
      in <a class="xref" href="#NEED">Appendix A</a>.  <a class="xref" href="#CHG">Appendix B</a> describes the specific changes made to
      arrive at the current text.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-1.1-2">¶</a></p>

      addressing the issues within the scope of the update. However, it will
      not address issues that are known but outside of this limited scope
      as could be expected by a full update of the protocol. Below are some

 versioning rules.  As 
        RFC 5661 is currently inconsistent with

 RFC 5661.  When that
 work is done and the resulting documents approved,
 the new NFSv4.1 specification document will provide a clear set

      The NFS version 4 minor version 1 (NFSv4.1) protocol
      is the second minor version of the NFS version 4
      (NFSv4) protocol. The first minor version, NFSv4.0, is
      now described in RFC 7530 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC7530">68</a>]</span>.  It generally
      follows the guidelines for minor versioning that are
      listed in Section <a class="relref" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3530#section-10">10</a>
      of RFC 3530 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC3530">37</a>]</span>.  However, it
      diverges from guidelines 11 ("a client and server
      that support minor version X must support minor
      versions 0 through X-1") and 12 ("no new features may be
      introduced as mandatory in a minor version"). These
      divergences are due to the introduction of
      the sessions model for managing non-idempotent
      operations and the RECLAIM_COMPLETE operation.
      These two new features are infrastructural in
      nature and simplify implementation of existing and
      other new features.  Making them anything but <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span>
      would add undue complexity to protocol definition and
      implementation.  NFSv4.1 accordingly updates the

<p id="section-1.8-1">
      The major features of
      the NFSv4.1 protocol will be reviewed in brief.  This will be done
      to provide an appropriate context for both the reader who is familiar
      with the previous versions of the NFS protocol and the reader
      who is new to the NFS protocols.  For the reader new to the NFS protocols,
      there is still a set of fundamental knowledge that is expected.  
      The reader should be familiar with the External Data
      Representation (XDR) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocols 
      as described in <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC4506">2</a>]</span> and <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5531">3</a>]</span>.
      A basic knowledge of file systems and distributed file systems is expected as well.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-1.8-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1.8-2">
      In general, this specification of NFSv4.1 will
      not distinguish those features added in minor version
      1 from those present in the base protocol but
      will treat NFSv4.1 as a unified whole.  See <a class="xref" href="#intro_differences">Section 1.9</a> for a summary of

        As with previous versions of NFS, the External Data Representation
        (XDR) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanisms used for the NFSv4.1 protocol are those defined in 
        <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC4506">2</a>]</span> and <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5531">3</a>]</span>.  To
        meet end-to-end security requirements, the RPCSEC_GSS framework
        <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC2203">4</a>]</span> is used to extend the basic 
        RPC security.  With the
        use of RPCSEC_GSS, various mechanisms can be provided to offer
        authentication, integrity, and privacy to the NFSv4 protocol.
        Kerberos V5 is used as described in 
        <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC4121">5</a>]</span> to provide one
        security framework.
        With the use of
        RPCSEC_GSS, other mechanisms may also be specified and used for NFSv4.1 security.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-1.8.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1.8.1-2">
        To enable in-band security negotiation, the NFSv4.1 protocol
        has operations that provide the client a method of
        querying the server about its policies regarding which security
        mechanisms must be used for access to the server's file system
        resources.  With this, the client can securely match the security
        mechanism that meets the policies specified at both the client and
        server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-1.8.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1.8.1-3">
 NFSv4.1 introduces parallel access (see <a class="xref" href="#parallel_access">Section 1.8.2.2</a>), which is
 called pNFS.  

The security framework
 described in this section is
 significantly modified by the
 introduction of pNFS (see <a class="xref" href="#security_considerations_pnfs">Section 12.9</a>),
 because data access is sometimes not over
 RPC.  The level of significance varies
 with the storage protocol (see <a class="xref" href="#storage_protocol">Section 12.2.5</a>) and can be as low as zero
        impact (see <a class="xref" href="#file_security_considerations">Section 13.12</a>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-1.8.1-3">¶</a></p>

        hierarchical with the regular files contained within being

        The NFSv4.1 protocol does not require a separate

        are presented as a tree so that all file systems are reachable

        allows LOOKUP operations to be used to perform functions
        previously provided by the MOUNT protocol.  The server
        provides any necessary pseudo file systems to bridge any

   The NFSv4.1 protocol has a rich and extensible
   file object attribute structure, which is divided
   into <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span>, <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span>, and named attributes
   (see <a class="xref" href="#file_attributes">Section 5</a>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-1.8.3.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1.8.3.2-2">
   Several (but not all) of the <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> attributes
   are derived from the attributes of NFSv3 (see
   the definition of the fattr3 data type in <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC1813">38</a>]</span>). An example of a <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span>
   attribute is the file object's type (<a class="xref" href="#attrdef_type">Section 5.8.1.2</a>) so that regular files
   can be distinguished from directories (also known
   as folders in some operating environments) and
   other types of objects. <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> attributes are
   discussed in <a class="xref" href="#mandatory_attributes_intro">Section 5.1</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-1.8.3.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1.8.3.2-3">
   An example of three <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> attributes are
   acl, sacl, and dacl.  These attributes define an
   Access Control List (ACL) on a file object
   (<a class="xref" href="#acl">Section 6</a>).  An ACL provides
   directory and file access control beyond the
   model used in NFSv3.   The ACL definition allows
   for specification of specific sets of permissions
   for individual users and groups.  In addition,
   ACL inheritance allows propagation of access
   permissions and restrictions down a directory tree
   as file system objects are created.  <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span>

          A named attribute is an opaque byte stream that is associated

          as a method to associate application-specific data with a 
          regular file or directory.  NFSv4.1 modifies named attributes

        include support for many types of locks including a number
        of sorts of recallable locks.  Recallable locks such as
        delegations allow the client to be assured that certain

   Previous NFS versions have been thought of as having a
   host-based authentication model, where the NFS server
   authenticates the NFS client, and trusts the client
   to authenticate all users.
   Actually, NFS has always depended on RPC for
   authentication. One of the first forms of RPC authentication,
   AUTH_SYS, had no strong authentication and
   required a host-based authentication
   approach. NFSv4.1 also depends on RPC for basic security
   services and mandates RPC support for a user-based
   authentication model. The user-based authentication
   model has user principals authenticated by a server, and
   in turn the server authenticated by user principals.

     RPC security is encapsulated in the RPC header, via a

      Via the GSS-API, RPCSEC_GSS can be used to identify and authenticate

      perform integrity checking on the entire RPC message, including
      the RPC header, and on the arguments or results. Finally, privacy,
      usually via encryption, is a service available with RPCSEC_GSS.
      Privacy is performed on the arguments and results. Note that
      if privacy is selected, integrity, authentication, and identification
      are enabled.
      If privacy is not selected, but integrity is selected, authentication
      and identification are enabled. If integrity and privacy are not

        </h3>
<p id="section-2.3-1">
   A significant departure from the versions of the NFS
   protocol before NFSv4 is the introduction of the 
   COMPOUND procedure.  For the NFSv4 protocol, 
   in all minor versions, there are exactly two RPC procedures, 
   NULL and COMPOUND.  The COMPOUND procedure is defined 
   as a series of individual operations and these operations 
   perform the sorts of functions performed by traditional 
   NFS procedures.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.3-2">
   The operations combined within a COMPOUND
   request are evaluated in order by the server, without
   any atomicity guarantees.  A limited set of facilities
   exist to pass results from one operation to another.  Once an 
   operation returns a failing result, the evaluation ends 
   and the results of all
   evaluated operations are returned to the client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.3-3">
   With the use of the COMPOUND procedure, the client is able to build
   simple or complex requests.  These COMPOUND requests allow for a
   reduction in the number of RPCs needed for logical file system
   operations.  For example, multi-component look up requests can
   be constructed by combining multiple LOOKUP operations.  Those
   can be further combined with operations such as GETATTR, READDIR,
   or OPEN plus READ to do more complicated sets of operation without
   incurring additional latency.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.3-4">
   NFSv4.1 also contains a considerable set of
   callback operations in which the server makes an RPC
   directed at the client.  Callback RPCs have a similar
   structure to that of the normal server requests.
   In all minor versions of the NFSv4 protocol,
   there are two callback RPC procedures:
   CB_NULL and CB_COMPOUND.  The CB_COMPOUND procedure is defined 
   in an analogous fashion to that of COMPOUND 
   with its own set of callback operations.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.3-5">
   The addition of new server and callback operations within the 
   COMPOUND and CB_COMPOUND request
   framework provides a means of extending the protocol in
   subsequent minor versions.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.3-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.3-6">
   Except for a small number of operations needed for session
   creation, server requests and callback requests are performed
   within the context of a session.  Sessions provide a client
   context for every request and support robust replay 
   protection for non-idempotent requests.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.3-6">¶</a></p>

    For each operation that obtains or depends on locking state, the 
    specific client needs to be identifiable by the server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.4-2">
    Each distinct client instance is represented
    by a client ID.  A client ID is a 64-bit identifier
    representing a specific client at a given time.
    The client ID is changed whenever the client re-initializes,
    and may change when the server re-initializes.
    Client IDs are used to support lock identification
    and crash recovery.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.4-3">
    During steady state operation,
    the client ID associated with each operation
    is derived from the session (see <a class="xref" href="#Session">Section 2.10</a>) on which the operation is sent. A session is associated with
    a client ID when the session is created.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.4-4">
    Unlike NFSv4.0, the only NFSv4.1 operations possible before a
    client ID is established are those needed to
    establish the client ID.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.4-5">
    A sequence of an EXCHANGE_ID operation followed by a 
    CREATE_SESSION operation using that client ID 
    (eir_clientid as returned from EXCHANGE_ID)
    is required to establish and confirm the
    client ID on the server.  Establishment of identification by a
    new incarnation of the client also has the effect of immediately
    releasing any locking state that a previous incarnation of that 
    same client might have had on the server.  Such released state 
    would include all byte-range lock, share reservation, layout state, and -- where the server supports neither the CLAIM_DELEGATE_PREV nor CLAIM_DELEG_CUR_FH claim types -- all delegation state associated with the same client with the same
    identity. For discussion of delegation state recovery, see
    <a class="xref" href="#delegation_recovery">Section 10.2.1</a>. For discussion of layout state
    recovery, see <a class="xref" href="#pnfs_client_recovery">Section 12.7.1</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.4-6">
    Releasing such state requires that the server be able to determine
    that one client instance is the successor of another.  Where this
    cannot be done, for any of a number of reasons, the locking state
    will remain for a time subject to lease expiration 
    (see <a class="xref" href="#lease_renewal">Section 8.3</a>)
    and the new client will need to wait for
    such state to be removed, if it makes conflicting lock requests.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.4-7">
    Client identification is encapsulated in the following client owner
    data type:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-7">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-2.4-9">
    The first field, co_verifier, is a client incarnation
    verifier, allowing the server to distinguish successive incarnations
    (e.g., reboots) of the same client.  The server will start the process of
    canceling the client's leased state if co_verifier
    is different than what the server has previously
    recorded for the identified client (as specified in
    the co_ownerid field).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.4-10">
    The second field, co_ownerid, is a variable length string that uniquely defines
    the client so that subsequent instances of the same client bear the
    same co_ownerid with a different verifier.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.4-11">
    There are several considerations for how the client
    generates the co_ownerid string:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-11">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-2.4-12.1">
        The string should be unique so that multiple clients
        do not present the same string. The consequences of
        two clients presenting the same string range from
        one client getting an error to one client having its
        leased state abruptly and unexpectedly cancelled.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-12.1">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-2.4-12.2"> 
        The string should be selected so that subsequent incarnations
        (e.g., restarts) of the same client cause the client to present 
        the same string. The implementor 
        is cautioned from an approach that requires the string to 
        be recorded in a local file because this precludes the use
        of the implementation in an environment where there is no local
        disk and all file access is from an NFSv4.1 server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4-12.2">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-2.4-12.3">
        The string should be the same for each server network address that
        the client accesses.
        This way, if a server has multiple interfaces, the client
        can trunk traffic over multiple network paths
        as described in <a class="xref" href="#Trunking">Section 2.10.5</a>.
        (Note: the precise opposite was advised in the NFSv4.0

        The algorithm for generating the string should not
        assume that the client's network address will not
        change, unless the client implementation knows it
        is using statically assigned network addresses.
        This includes changes between client incarnations
        and even changes while the client is still running
        in its current incarnation.  Thus, with dynamic
        address assignment, if the
        client includes just the client's network address
        in the co_ownerid string, there is a real risk
        that after the
        client gives up the network address, another
        client, using a similar algorithm for generating
        the co_ownerid string, would generate a conflicting

    In the event of a server restart, a client may find

    circumstances depend on the characteristics of the
    sessions involved, specifically whether the session is
    persistent (see <a class="xref" href="#Persistence">Section 2.10.6.5</a>), but in
    each case the client will receive this error when it attempts
    to establish a new session with the existing client ID and
    receives the error NFS4ERR_STALE_CLIENTID, indicating that a new
    client ID needs to be obtained via EXCHANGE_ID and the new session

    client previously transmitted and did not see replies
    to. Replies to operations that the server previously performed
    will come from the reply cache; otherwise,
    NFS4ERR_DEADSESSION will be returned.
    Hence, such a session is referred to as "dead". In this situation,
    in order to perform new operations, the client needs to 
    establish a new session.  If an attempt is made to

    To facilitate upgrade from NFSv4.0 to NFSv4.1, a server
    may compare a value of data type client_owner4 in an EXCHANGE_ID with a
    value of data type nfs_client_id4 that was established using the SETCLIENTID operation of
    NFSv4.0. A server that does so will allow
    an upgraded client to avoid waiting
    until the lease (i.e., the lease established by the NFSv4.0 instance
    client) expires.
    This requires that the value of data type client_owner4 be constructed
    the same way as the value of data type nfs_client_id4.  If the latter's
    contents included the server's network address (per the
    recommendations of the NFSv4.0 specification <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC3530">37</a>]</span>), and
    the NFSv4.1 client does not wish to use a client
    ID that prevents trunking, it should send two
    EXCHANGE_ID operations.  The first EXCHANGE_ID will
    have a client_owner4 equal to the nfs_client_id4.
    This will clear the state created by the NFSv4.0
    client. The second EXCHANGE_ID will not have the
    server's network address. The state created for the
    second EXCHANGE_ID will not have to wait for lease
    expiration, because there will be no state to expire.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.4.1-1">¶</a></p>

    Each channel is associated with zero or more transport
    connections (whether of the same transport protocol or different
    transport protocols).  A connection can be associated with
    one channel or both channels of a session; the client
    and server negotiate whether a connection will carry
    traffic for one channel or both channels via the
    CREATE_SESSION (<a class="xref" href="#OP_CREATE_SESSION">Section 18.36</a>) and the BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION (<a class="xref" href="#OP_BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION">Section 18.34</a>) operations. When a
    session is created via CREATE_SESSION, the connection
    that transported the CREATE_SESSION request is
    automatically associated with the fore channel, and
    optionally the backchannel. If the client specifies no
    state protection (<a class="xref" href="#OP_EXCHANGE_ID">Section 18.35</a>)
    when the session is created, then when SEQUENCE is
    transmitted on a different connection, the connection
    is automatically associated with the fore channel of

<p id="section-2.10.3.1-2">
    A connection's association with a session is
    not exclusive.  A connection associated with the channel(s)

    associated with the channel(s) of other sessions including
    sessions associated with other client IDs.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.3.1-2">¶</a></p>

    It is permissible for connections of multiple transport

      Servers each specify a server scope value in the form
      of an opaque string eir_server_scope returned as part of

      same server scope value has arranged to use distinct  
      values of opaque identifiers so that the two servers never
      assign the same value to two distinct objects. Thus, the identifiers
      generated by two servers within that set can be assumed compatible

      The use of such compatible values does not imply that

     eir_server_scope, and eir_clientid values, the client

      to use RPCSEC_GSS authentication when sending each

      sends EXCHANGE_ID to a second destination
      network address different from the one the first 
      EXCHANGE_ID was sent to.
      The client checks that each EXCHANGE_ID reply has the
      same eir_clientid, eir_server_owner.so_major_id, and
      eir_server_scope. If so, the client verifies the
      claim by sending a CREATE_SESSION operation to the second
      destination address, protected with RPCSEC_GSS integrity
      using an RPCSEC_GSS handle returned by the second
      EXCHANGE_ID. If the server accepts the CREATE_SESSION
      request, and if the client verifies the RPCSEC_GSS
      verifier and integrity codes, then the client has
      proof the second server knows the SSV, and thus
      the two servers are cooperating for the purposes of

            </h5>
<p id="section-2.10.6.1-1">
     The RPC layer provides a transaction ID (XID), which,
     while required to be unique, is not
     convenient for tracking requests for two reasons.
     First, the XID is only
     meaningful to the requester; it cannot be interpreted
     by the replier except to test for equality with
     previously sent requests. When consulting an RPC-based
     duplicate request cache, the opaqueness of the XID requires
     a computationally expensive look up (often via a hash that
     includes XID and source address). NFSv4.1 requests use
     a non-opaque slot ID, which is an index into a slot table,
     which is far more efficient. Second, because RPC requests
     can be executed by the replier in any order, there is
     no bound on the number of requests that may be outstanding
     at any time. To achieve perfect EOS, using ONC RPC
     would require storing all replies in the reply cache.
     XIDs are 32 bits; storing over four billion (2<sup>32</sup>) replies
     in the reply cache is not practical. In practice, previous versions
     of NFS have chosen to store a fixed number of replies in
     the cache, and to use a least recently used (LRU) approach to
     replacing cache entries with new entries when the cache
     is full. In NFSv4.1, the number of outstanding requests is
     bounded by the size of the slot table, and a sequence ID
     per slot is used to tell the replier when it is safe to
     delete a cached reply.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.6.1-2">
     In the NFSv4.1 reply cache, when the requester sends a new request,
     it selects a slot ID in the
     range 0..N, where N is the replier's current maximum slot ID
     granted to the requester on the session over which the request is to be
     sent. The value of N starts out as equal to
     ca_maxrequests - 1 (<a class="xref" href="#OP_CREATE_SESSION">Section 18.36</a>), but
     can be adjusted by the response to SEQUENCE or CB_SEQUENCE as described
     later in this section.
     The slot ID must be unused by any of the requests that the
     requester has already active on the session.  "Unused" here means the
     requester has no outstanding request for that slot ID.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.6.1-3">
     A slot contains a sequence ID and the cached reply corresponding to
     the request sent with that sequence ID. The sequence ID is a
     32-bit unsigned value, and is therefore in the range 0..0xFFFFFFFF (2<sup>32</sup> - 1).
     The first time a slot is used, the requester <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> specify
     a sequence ID of one (<a class="xref" href="#OP_CREATE_SESSION">Section 18.36</a>).
     Each time a slot is reused, the request <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> specify a sequence ID
     that is one greater than that of the previous request on the
     slot. If the previous sequence ID was 0xFFFFFFFF, then the next
     request for the slot <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> have the sequence ID set to zero (i.e.,
     (2<sup>32</sup> - 1) + 1 mod 2<sup>32</sup>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.6.1-4">
     The sequence ID accompanies the slot ID in each request. It is
     for the critical check at the replier: it used to efficiently
     determine whether a request using a certain
     slot ID is a retransmit or a new, never-before-seen request.  It is
     not feasible for the requester to assert that it is retransmitting to
     implement this, because for any given request the requester cannot
     know whether the replier has seen it unless the replier actually replies.  Of
     course, if the requester has seen the reply, the requester would
     not retransmit.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.6.1-5">
     The replier compares each received request's
     sequence ID with the last one previously received for that slot ID,
     to see if the new request is:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-5">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-2.10.6.1-6.1">
      A new request, in which the sequence ID is one greater
      than that previously seen in the slot (accounting for sequence
      wraparound).  The replier proceeds to execute the new request,

      <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> increase the slot's sequence ID by one.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-6.1">¶</a>

      reply. See <a class="xref" href="#Retry_and_Replay">Section 2.10.6.2</a> for direction on how the replier

      wrap around to zero once it reaches 0xFFFFFFFF, a
      misordered new request and a misordered retry
      cannot be distinguished. Thus, the replier <span class="bcp14">MUST</span>
      return NFS4ERR_SEQ_MISORDERED (as the result from
      SEQUENCE or CB_SEQUENCE).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-6.4">¶</a>

            </ul>
<p id="section-2.10.6.1-7">
     Unlike the XID, the slot ID is always within a specific
     range; this has two implications.  The first
     implication is that for a given session, the replier
     need only cache the results of a limited number of
     COMPOUND requests.
     The second implication derives
     from the first, which is that unlike XID-indexed reply
     caches (also known as duplicate request caches - DRCs),
     the slot ID-based reply cache cannot be overflowed.
     Through use of the sequence ID to identify
     retransmitted requests, the replier does not need to
     actually cache the request itself, reducing the
     storage requirements of the reply cache further.  These
     facilities make it practical to maintain all the
     required entries for an effective reply cache.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.6.1-8">
     The slot ID, sequence ID, and session ID therefore take over the traditional role
     of the XID and source network address in the replier's
     reply cache implementation.
     This approach is considerably
     more portable and completely robust -- it is not subject to the
     reassignment of ports as clients reconnect over IP
     networks.  In addition, the RPC XID is not used in the reply cache,
     enhancing robustness of the cache in the face of any rapid reuse of
     XIDs by the requester. While the replier does not care
     about the XID for the purposes of reply cache management
     (but the replier <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> return the same XID that was in the request),
     nonetheless there are considerations for the XID in NFSv4.1
     that are the same as all other previous versions of NFS.
     The RPC XID remains in each message and needs to be formulated
     in NFSv4.1 requests as in any other ONC RPC request. The reasons
     include:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-8">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-2.10.6.1-10">
     Given that well-formulated XIDs continue to be required,
     this raises the question: why do SEQUENCE and CB_SEQUENCE replies
     have a session ID, slot ID, and sequence ID? Having the session ID
     in the reply means that the requester does not have to use the
     XID to look up
     the session ID, which would be necessary if the connection were
     associated with multiple sessions. Having the slot ID and sequence ID
     in the reply means that the requester does not have to use the XID to
     look up the slot ID and sequence ID.
     Furthermore, since the XID is only 32 bits, it is too small to
     guarantee the re-association of a reply with its request 
     <span>[<a class="xref" href="#rpc_xid_issues">44</a>]</span>; having
     session ID, slot ID, and sequence ID in the reply allows the

<p id="section-2.10.6.1-11">
     The SEQUENCE (and CB_SEQUENCE) operation also carries
     a "highest_slotid" value, which carries additional
     requester slot usage information.  The requester <span class="bcp14">MUST</span>
     always indicate the slot ID representing the outstanding request with the
     highest-numbered slot
     value.
     The requester should in all cases provide the most
     conservative value possible, although it can be increased somewhat
     above the actual instantaneous usage to maintain some minimum or
     optimal level.  This provides a way for the requester to yield unused
     request slots back to the replier, which in turn can use the
     information to reallocate resources.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.1-11">¶</a></p>

      The target highest_slotid is
      an indication to the requester of the highest_slotid the replier
      wishes the requester to be using.  This permits the replier to withdraw
      (or add) resources from a requester that has been found to not be
      using them, in order to more fairly share resources among a varying
      level of demand from other requesters.  The requester must always comply
      with the replier's value updates, since they indicate newly
      established hard limits on the requester's access to session

      Once the replier has forcibly lowered the enforced

      If a request is received with a slot ID that is higher than

     it will not be able
     to use only the receipt of the slot ID and highest_slotid
     in the request.  Neither the slot ID nor the

     operations. For example, a client may have been
     granted a delegation to a file it has opened, but the
     reply to the OPEN (informing the client of the
     granting of the delegation) may be delayed in the
     network. If a conflicting operation arrives at the
     server, it will recall the delegation using the
     backchannel, which may be on a different
     transport connection, perhaps even a different
     network, or even a different session associated with
     the same client ID.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.6.3-2">
     The presence of a session between the client and server
     alleviates this issue. When a session is in place,
     each client request is uniquely identified by its {
     session ID, slot ID, sequence ID } triple. By the rules under which
     slot entries (reply cache entries) are
     retired, the server has knowledge whether the client
     has "seen" each of the server's replies. The server
     can therefore provide sufficient information to the
     client to allow it to disambiguate between an
     erroneous or conflicting callback race
     condition.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.6.3-3">
     For each client operation that might result in some
     sort of server callback, the server <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> "remember"
     the { session ID, slot ID, sequence ID } triple of the client request
     until the slot ID retirement rules allow the server to
     determine that the client has, in fact, seen the
     server's reply. Until the time the { session ID, slot ID,
     sequence ID } request triple can be retired, any recalls
     of the associated object <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> carry an array of these
     referring identifiers (in the CB_SEQUENCE operation's
     arguments), for the benefit of the client.  After this
     time, it is not necessary for the server to provide
     this information in related callbacks, since it is
     certain that a race condition can no longer occur.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.6.3-4">
     The CB_SEQUENCE operation that begins each server
     callback carries a list of "referring" { session ID, slot ID,
     sequence ID } triples.  If the client finds the request
     corresponding to the referring session ID, slot ID, and sequence ID
     to be currently outstanding (i.e., the server's reply has
     not been seen by the client), it can determine that
     the callback has raced the reply, and act
     accordingly. If the client does not find the request
     corresponding to the referring triple to be outstanding (including
     the case of a session ID referring to a destroyed session),
     then there is no race with respect to this triple.
     The server <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> limit the referring triples
     to requests that refer to just those that apply to the objects 
     referred to in
     the CB_COMPOUND procedure.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.6.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.6.3-5">
     The client must not simply wait forever for the
     expected server reply to arrive before responding to the
     CB_COMPOUND that won the race,
     because it is possible
     that it will be delayed indefinitely. The client should
     assume the likely case that the reply will arrive within
     the average round-trip time for COMPOUND requests to the
     server, and wait that period of time. If
     that period of time
     expires, it can respond to the CB_COMPOUND with
     NFS4ERR_DELAY.  There are other scenarios under which callbacks
     may race replies.

    A client needs to take care that, when sending

<p id="section-2.10.7.1-2">
    Registration of memory can be a relatively high-overhead operation,
    since it requires pinning of buffers, assignment of attributes
    (e.g., readable/writable), and initialization of hardware
    translation.  Preregistration is desirable to reduce overhead.
    These registrations are specific to hardware interfaces and even to
    RDMA connection endpoints; therefore, negotiation of their limits is
    desirable to manage resources effectively.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.7.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.7.1-3">
    Following basic registration, these buffers must be posted by
    the RPC layer to handle receives.  These buffers remain in use by
    the RPC/NFSv4.1 implementation; the size and number of them must be
    known to the remote peer in order to avoid RDMA errors that would

    NFSv4.1 manages slots as resources on a per-session
    basis (see <a class="xref" href="#Session">Section 2.10</a>), while RDMA
    connections manage credits on a per-connection basis.
    This means that in order for a peer to send data over
    RDMA to a remote buffer, it has to have both an NFSv4.1
    slot and an RDMA credit.  If multiple RDMA connections
    are associated with a session, then if the total number
    of credits across all RDMA connections associated with
    the session is X, and the number of slots in the session

<p id="section-2.10.7.2-1">
    Previous versions of NFS do not provide flow control;
    instead, they rely on the windowing provided by
    transports like TCP to throttle requests.  This does
    not work with RDMA, which provides no operation flow
    control and will terminate a connection in error when
    limits are exceeded. 

    Limits such as maximum number of requests
    outstanding are therefore negotiated when a session
    is created (see the ca_maxrequests field in <a class="xref" href="#OP_CREATE_SESSION">Section 18.36</a>).  These limits then
    provide the maxima within which each connection associated
    with the session's channel(s) must remain.
    RDMA connections are managed within these limits as
    described in <span><a class="relref" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8166#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> of [<a class="xref" href="#RFC8166">32</a>]</span>; if there are multiple
    RDMA connections, then the maximum number of requests
    for a channel will be divided among the RDMA
    connections.  Put a different way, the onus is on the

    outstanding requests.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.7.2-1">¶</a></p>

        Padding leverages the useful property
        that RDMA preserve alignment of data, even when they are
        placed into anonymous (untagged) buffers.  If requested, client
        inline writes will insert appropriate pad bytes within the request
        header to align the data payload on the specified boundary.  The
        client is encouraged to add sufficient padding (up to the
        negotiated size) so that
        the "data" field of the WRITE operation
        is aligned.
        Most servers can make good use of such padding,
        which allows them to chain receive buffers in such a way that any
        data carried by client requests will be placed into appropriate
        buffers at the server, ready for file system processing.  The
        receiver's RPC layer encounters no overhead from skipping over pad
        bytes, and the RDMA layer's high performance makes the insertion
        and transmission of padding on the sender a significant
        optimization.  In this way, the need for servers to perform RDMA
        Read to satisfy all but the largest client writes is obviated.  An
        added benefit is the reduction of message round trips on the network
        -- a potentially good trade, where latency is present.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.7.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.7.3-3">
        The value to choose for padding is subject to a number of criteria.
        A primary source of variable-length data in the RPC header is the
        authentication information, the form of which is client-determined,
        possibly in response to server specification.  The contents of
        COMPOUNDs, sizes of strings such as those passed to RENAME, etc. all
        go into the determination of a maximal NFSv4.1 request size and
        therefore minimal buffer size.  The client must select its offered
        value carefully, so as to avoid overburdening the server, and vice
        versa.  The benefit of an appropriate padding value is higher
        performance.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.7.3-3">¶</a></p>

        In the above case, the server may recycle unused buffers to the

        may pass the now-complete buffers by reference for normal write
        processing.  For a server that can make use of it, this removes
        any need for data copies of incoming data, without resorting to
        complicated end-to-end buffer advertisement and management.  This
        includes most kernel-based and integrated server designs, among

     As described to this point in the specification, the state model
     of NFSv4.1 is vulnerable to an attacker that
     sends a SEQUENCE operation with a forged session ID and with a slot ID that
     it expects the legitimate client to use next. When the legitimate client
     uses the slot ID with the same sequence number, the server
     returns the attacker's result from the reply cache, which
     disrupts the legitimate client and thus denies service to it.
     Similarly, an attacker could send a CREATE_SESSION with a forged
     client ID to create a new session associated with the client ID.
     The attacker could send requests using the new session that
     change locking state, such as LOCKU operations to release locks
     the legitimate client has acquired. Setting a security
     policy on the file that requires RPCSEC_GSS credentials when
     manipulating the file's state is one potential work around,
     but has the disadvantage of preventing a legitimate client from
     releasing state when RPCSEC_GSS is required to do so, but
     a GSS context cannot be obtained (possibly because the user

      In cases where the server's security policies on a

      a client may have to use an RPCSEC_GSS credential
      to remove per-file state (e.g., LOCKU, CLOSE, etc.).
      The server may require that the principal that removes
      the state match certain criteria (e.g.,
      the principal might have to be the same as the one
      that acquired the state). However, the client might
      not have an RPCSEC_GSS context for such a principal,
      and might not be able to create such a context (perhaps
      because the user has logged off). When the client
      establishes SP4_MACH_CRED or SP4_SSV protection,
      it can specify a list of operations that the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span>
      allow using the machine credential (if SP4_MACH_CRED

   The SSV mechanism defines four subkeys derived from

   of the four respective ssv_subkey4 enumerated values. The calculation

   The field smpt_ssv_seq is the same as smt_ssv_seq.
   The field smpt_orig_plain is the "message" input passed

   The caller of GSS_GetMIC() provides a pointer to a buffer

   one after SET_SSV (<a class="xref" href="#OP_SET_SSV">Section 18.47</a>)
   is called the first time on a client
   ID.
   Thereafter, the SSV sequence number is incremented on each SET_SSV.

         then the client will be unable to provide NFSv4.1
         service, and fatal errors should be returned
         to processes that were using the server. If the
         client is using a "mount" paradigm, unmounting
         the server is advised.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.13.1.4-6.4">¶</a>

<p id="section-2.10.13.1.4-7">
      If there is a reconfiguration event that results in the 
      same network address being assigned to servers where the 
      eir_server_scope value is different, it cannot be guaranteed
      that a session ID generated by the first will be recognized
      as invalid by the first.  Therefore, in managing server
      reconfigurations among servers with different server scope
      values, it is necessary to make sure that all clients have
      disconnected from the first server before effecting
      the reconfiguration.  Nonetheless, clients should not
      assume that servers will always adhere to this requirement;
      clients <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be prepared to deal with unexpected
      effects of server reconfigurations.
      Even where a session ID is inappropriately 
      recognized as valid, it is likely either that the connection 
      will not be recognized as valid or that a sequence value
      for a slot will not be correct.  Therefore, when a client
      receives results indicating such unexpected errors, the use of
      EXCHANGE_ID to determine the current server configuration
      is <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.13.1.4-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.13.1.4-8">
      A variation on the above is that after a server's network 
      address moves, there is no NFSv4.1 server listening, e.g., no 
      listener on port 2049. In this example, one of the following occur: the NFSv4 server returns 
      NFS4ERR_MINOR_VERS_MISMATCH, the NFS server returns a 
      PROG_MISMATCH error, the RPC listener on 2049 returns 
      PROG_UNVAIL, or attempts to reconnect to the network address 
      timeout. These <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> be treated as equivalent to SEQUENCE 
      returning NFS4ERR_BADSESSION for these purposes.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.13.1.4-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.13.1.4-9">
     When the client detects session loss, it needs to call CREATE_SESSION
     to recover.  Any non-idempotent operations that were in progress
     might have been performed on the server at the time of
     session loss. The client has no general way to recover from this.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.13.1.4-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.13.1.4-10">
     Note that loss of session does not imply loss of byte-range lock, open, delegation,
     or layout state because locks, opens, delegations, and layouts
     are tied to the client ID and depend on the client ID, not the session.
     Nor does loss of byte-range lock, open, delegation,
     or layout state imply loss of session state, because the session depends
     on the client ID; loss of client ID however does imply loss of
     session, byte-range lock, open, delegation, and layout state.
     See <a class="xref" href="#server_failure">Section 8.4.2</a>.
     A session can survive a server restart,
     but lock recovery may still be needed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.13.1.4-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.10.13.1.4-11">
     It is possible that CREATE_SESSION will fail with NFS4ERR_STALE_CLIENTID
     (e.g., the server restarts and does not preserve client ID
     state).
     If so, the client needs to call EXCHANGE_ID, followed by 
     CREATE_SESSION.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2.10.13.1.4-11">¶</a></p>

 The nfstime4 data type gives the number of seconds and
 nanoseconds since midnight or zero hour January 1, 1970
 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Values greater than zero
 for the seconds field denote dates after the zero hour January 1,
 1970.  Values less than zero for the seconds field denote
 dates before the zero hour January 1, 1970.  In both cases, the
 nseconds field is to be added to the seconds field for the
 final time representation.  For example, if the time to be
 represented is one-half second before zero hour January 1, 1970,
 the seconds field would have a value of negative one (-1) and
 the nseconds field would have a value of one-half second
 (500000000).  Values greater than 999,999,999 for nseconds are

    The filehandle in the NFS protocol is a per-server unique identifier
    for a file system object.  The contents of the filehandle are opaque
    to the client.  Therefore, the server is responsible for translating

<p id="section-4.1-1">
      The operations of the NFS protocol are defined in terms of one
      or more filehandles.  Therefore, the client needs a filehandle
      to initiate communication with the server.  With the NFSv3
      protocol (<span><a class="xref" href="#RFC1813">RFC 1813</a> [<a class="xref" href="#RFC1813">38</a>]</span>), there
      exists an ancillary protocol to obtain this first filehandle.
      The MOUNT protocol, RPC program number 100005, provides the
      mechanism of translating a string-based file system pathname to
      a filehandle, which can then be used by the NFS protocols.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.1-2">
      The MOUNT protocol has deficiencies in the area of security and
      use via firewalls.  This is one reason that the use of the
      public filehandle was introduced in <span><a class="xref" href="#RFC2054">RFC 2054</a> [<a class="xref" href="#RFC2054">49</a>]</span> and <span><a class="xref" href="#RFC2055">RFC 2055</a> [<a class="xref" href="#RFC2055">50</a>]</span>.  With the use of the public
      filehandle in combination with the LOOKUP operation in the NFSv3
      protocol, it has been demonstrated that the
      MOUNT protocol is unnecessary for viable interaction between NFS
      client and server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.1-3">
      Therefore, the NFSv4.1 protocol will not use an ancillary
      protocol for translation from string-based pathnames to a filehandle.
      Two special filehandles will be used as starting points for the NFS

<p id="section-4.1.1-1">
        The first of the special filehandles is the ROOT filehandle.  The ROOT
        filehandle is the "conceptual" root of the file system namespace at
        the NFS server.  The client uses or starts with the ROOT filehandle
        by employing the PUTROOTFH operation.  The PUTROOTFH operation
        instructs the server to set the "current" filehandle to the ROOT of
        the server's file tree.  Once this PUTROOTFH operation is used, the
        client can then traverse the entirety of the server's file tree with
        the LOOKUP operation.  A complete discussion of the server namespace

        for this binding.  It may be that the PUBLIC filehandle and the ROOT
        filehandle refer to the same file system object.  However, it is up to
        the administrative software at the server and the policies of the
        server administrator to define the binding of the PUBLIC filehandle
        and server file system object.  The client may not make any

<p id="section-4.2-1">
      In the NFSv3 protocol, there was one type of filehandle
      with a single set of semantics.  This type of filehandle is termed
      "persistent" in NFSv4.1.  The semantics of a persistent
      filehandle remain the same as before.  A new type of filehandle
      introduced in NFSv4.1 is the "volatile" filehandle, which
      attempts to accommodate certain server environments.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.2-2">
      The volatile filehandle type was introduced to address server
      functionality or implementation issues that make correct
      implementation of a persistent filehandle infeasible.  Some server
      environments do not provide a file-system-level invariant that can be
      used to construct a persistent filehandle.  The underlying server
      file system may not provide the invariant or the server's file system
      programming interfaces may not provide access to the needed invariant.
      Volatile filehandles may ease the implementation of server
      functionality such as hierarchical storage management or file system
      reorganization or migration.  However, the volatile filehandle
      increases the implementation burden for the client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.2-3">
      Since the client will need to handle persistent and volatile
      filehandles differently, a file attribute is defined that may be used
      by the client to determine the filehandle types being returned by the
      server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4.2-3">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-4.2.1-1">
        The filehandle contains all the information the
        server needs to distinguish an individual file.
        To the client, the filehandle is opaque. The
        client stores filehandles for use in a later
        request and can compare two filehandles from the
        same server for equality by doing a byte-by-byte
        comparison.  However, the client <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> otherwise
        interpret the contents of filehandles.  If two
        filehandles from the same server are equal, they
        <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> refer to the same file.  Servers <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> try
        to maintain a one-to-one correspondence between
        filehandles and files, but this is not required.
        Clients <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> use filehandle comparisons only to
        improve performance, not for correct behavior.
        All clients need to be prepared for situations
        in which it cannot be determined whether two
        filehandles denote the same object and in such
        cases, avoid making invalid assumptions that might
        cause incorrect behavior.  Further discussion
        of filehandle and attribute comparison in the
        context of data caching is presented in <a class="xref" href="#data_caching_and_file_identity">Section 10.3.4</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4.2.1-1">¶</a></p>

    To meet the requirements of extensibility and increased
    interoperability with non-UNIX platforms, attributes need to be handled
    in a flexible manner.  The NFSv3 fattr3 structure contains a
    fixed list of attributes that not all clients and servers are able to
    support or care about.  The fattr3 structure cannot be extended as
    new needs arise and it provides no way to indicate non-support.  With
    the NFSv4.1 protocol, the client is able to query what attributes
    the server supports and construct requests with only those supported
    attributes (or a subset thereof).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5-2">
    To this end, attributes are divided into three groups: <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span>,
    <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span>, and named.  Both <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> and <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> attributes are
    supported in the NFSv4.1 protocol by a specific and well-defined
    encoding and are identified by number.  They are requested by setting
    a bit in the bit vector sent in the GETATTR request; the server
    response includes a bit vector to list what attributes were returned
    in the response.  New <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> or <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> attributes may be added
    to the NFSv4 protocol as part of a new minor version
    by publishing a
    Standards Track RFC that allocates a new attribute number value and
    defines the encoding for the attribute.  See
    <a class="xref" href="#minor_versioning">Section 2.7</a> for further
    discussion.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5-3">
    Named attributes are accessed by the new OPENATTR operation, which
    accesses a hidden directory of attributes associated with a file
    system object.  OPENATTR takes a filehandle for the object and returns
    the filehandle for the attribute hierarchy.  The filehandle for the
    named attributes is a directory object accessible by LOOKUP or READDIR
    and contains files whose names represent the named attributes and
    whose data bytes are the value of the attribute.  For example:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5-3">¶</a></p>

    Named attributes are intended for data needed by applications rather
    than by an NFS client implementation.  NFS implementors are strongly
    encouraged to define their new attributes as <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> attributes by
    bringing them to the IETF Standards Track process.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5-6">
    The set of attributes that are classified as <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> is
    deliberately small since servers need to do whatever it takes to support
    them.  A server should support as many of the <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> attributes
    as possible but, by their definition, the server is not required to
    support all of them.  Attributes are deemed <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> if the data is

<p id="section-5-7">
    Note that the hidden directory returned by OPENATTR is a convenience
    for protocol processing.  The client should not make any assumptions

    or not the underlying file system at the server has a named
    attribute directory.  Therefore, operations such as SETATTR and

      These attributes are understood well enough to warrant support in the
      NFSv4.1 protocol.  However, they may not be supported on all
      clients and servers.  A client may ask for any of these attributes to
      be returned by setting a bit in the GETATTR request but must handle
      the case where the server does not return them.  A client <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> ask for
      the set of attributes the server supports and <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> request
      attributes the server does not support.  A server should be tolerant
      of requests for unsupported attributes and simply not return them
      rather than considering the request an error.  It is expected that
      servers will support all attributes they comfortably can and only fail
      to support attributes that are difficult to support in their
      operating environments.  A server should provide attributes whenever
      they don't have to "tell lies" to the client.  For example, a file
      modification time should be either an accurate time or should not be
      supported by the server.  At times this will be difficult for
      clients, but a client is better positioned to decide whether and how to
      fabricate or construct an attribute or whether to do without the
      attribute.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.2-1">¶</a></p>

      These attributes are not supported by direct encoding in the NFSv4 
      protocol but are accessed by string names rather than
      numbers and correspond to an uninterpreted stream of bytes that are
      stored with the file system object.  The namespace for these
      attributes may be accessed by using the OPENATTR operation.  The
      OPENATTR operation returns a filehandle for a virtual "named attribute
      directory", and further perusal and modification of the namespace may 
      be done using operations that work on more typical directories.  In
      particular, READDIR may be used to get a list of such named attributes,
      and LOOKUP and OPEN may select a particular attribute.  Creation of
      a new named attribute may be the result of an OPEN specifying file
      creation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.3-1">¶</a></p>

      Named attributes and the named attribute directory may have

      attributes.  However, the set of attributes for named attributes

      Named attributes and the named attribute directory might be the
      target of delegations (in the case of the named attribute directory,
      these will be directory delegations).  However, since granting of
      delegations is at the server's discretion, a server
      need not support delegations on named attributes or the named
      attribute directory.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.3-5">
      It is <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> that servers support arbitrary named attributes.  A
      client should not depend on the ability to store any named attributes
      in the server's file system.  If a server does support named
      attributes, a client that is also able to handle them should be able
      to copy a file's data and metadata with complete transparency from
      one location to another; this would imply that names allowed for

      In NFSv4.1, the structure of named attribute directories is

      of non-interoperable implementations in which some servers support
      a fully general hierarchical directory structure for named attributes
      while others support a limited but adequate structure for named attributes.

 Like fileid, but if the target filehandle is the root of a

<p id="section-5.8.2.23-2">
 UNIX-based operating environments connect a file system into
 the namespace by connecting (mounting) the file system onto
 the existing file object (the mount point, usually a
 directory) of an existing file system. When the mount point's
 parent directory is read via an API like readdir(), the return
 results are directory entries, each with a component name and
 a fileid. The fileid of the mount point's directory entry will
 be different from the fileid that the stat() system call
 returns. The stat() system call is returning the fileid of the
 root of the mounted file system, whereas readdir() is
 returning the fileid that stat() would have returned before any
 file systems were mounted on the mount point.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.8.2.23-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.8.2.23-3">
 Unlike NFSv3, NFSv4.1 allows a client's LOOKUP
 request to cross other file systems. The client detects the
 file system crossing whenever the filehandle argument of
 LOOKUP has an fsid attribute different from that of the
 filehandle returned by LOOKUP. A UNIX-based client will
 consider this a "mount point crossing".  UNIX has a legacy
 scheme for allowing a process to determine its current working
 directory. This relies on readdir() of a mount point's parent
 and stat() of the mount point returning fileids as previously
 described.  The mounted_on_fileid attribute corresponds to the
 fileid that readdir() would have returned as described
 previously.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.8.2.23-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.8.2.23-4">
 While the NFSv4.1 client could simply fabricate a fileid
 corresponding to what mounted_on_fileid provides (and if the
 server does not support mounted_on_fileid, the client has no
 choice), there is a risk that the client will generate a
 fileid that conflicts with one that is already assigned to
 another object in the file system. Instead, if the server can
 provide the mounted_on_fileid, the potential for client
 operational problems in this area is eliminated.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.8.2.23-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.8.2.23-5">
 If the server detects that there is no mounted point at the
 target file object, then the value for mounted_on_fileid that
 it returns is the same as that of the fileid attribute.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.8.2.23-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.8.2.23-6">
 The mounted_on_fileid attribute is <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span>, so the server
 <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> provide it if possible, and for a UNIX-based server,
 this is straightforward. Usually, mounted_on_fileid will be
 requested during a READDIR operation, in which case it is
 trivial (at least for UNIX-based servers) to return
 mounted_on_fileid since it is equal to the fileid of a
 directory entry returned by readdir().  If mounted_on_fileid
 is requested in a GETATTR operation, the server should obey an
 invariant that has it returning a value that is equal to the
 file object's entry in the object's parent directory,
 i.e., what readdir() would have returned.  Some operating
 environments allow a series of two or more file systems to be
 mounted onto a single mount point. In this case, for the
 server to obey the aforementioned invariant, it will need to
 find the base mount point, and not the intermediate mount
 points.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.8.2.23-6">¶</a></p>

 The time_access attribute represents the time of last access to
 the object by a READ operation sent to the server. The notion
 of what is an "access" depends on the server's operating environment
 and/or the server's file system semantics.  For example, for
 servers obeying Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) semantics, time_access would be updated only
 by the READ and READDIR operations and not any of the operations
 that modify the content of the object <span>[<a class="xref" href="#read_atime">13</a>]</span>,
 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#readdir_atime">14</a>]</span>, <span>[<a class="xref" href="#write_atime">15</a>]</span>. Of
 course, setting the corresponding time_access_set attribute is
 another way to modify the time_access attribute.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.8.2.37-1">¶</a></p>

 Whenever the file object resides on a writable file system,
 the server should make its best efforts to record time_access into
 stable storage.  However, to mitigate the performance effects
 of doing so, and most especially whenever the server is
 satisfying the read of the object's content from its cache,
 the server <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> cache access time updates and lazily write them
 to stable storage.  It is also acceptable to give
 administrators of the server the option to disable time_access

        </h3>
<p id="section-5.9-1">
      The <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> attributes "owner" and "owner_group" (and also
      users and groups within the "acl" attribute) are represented in
      terms of a UTF-8 string.  To avoid a representation that is tied
      to a particular underlying implementation at the client or
      server, the use of the UTF-8 string has been chosen.  Note that
      Section <a class="relref" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2624#section-6.1">6.1</a> 
      of RFC 2624 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC2624">53</a>]</span> provides
      additional rationale.  It is expected that the client and server
      will have their own local representation of owner and
      owner_group that is used for local storage or presentation to
      the end user.  Therefore, it is expected that when these
      attributes are transferred between the client and server,
      the local representation is translated to a syntax of the form
      "user@dns_domain".  This will allow for a client and server that
      do not use the same local representation the ability to
      translate to a common syntax that can be interpreted by both.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.9-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.9-2">
      Similarly, security principals may be represented in different
      ways by different security mechanisms.  Servers normally
      translate these representations into a common format,
      generally that used by local storage, to serve as a means of
      identifying the users corresponding to these security
      principals.  When these local identifiers are translated to
      the form of the owner attribute, associated with files created
      by such principals, they identify, in a common format, the
      users associated with each corresponding set of security
      principals.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.9-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.9-3">
      The translation used to interpret owner and group strings is
      not specified as part of the protocol.  This allows various
      solutions to be employed.  For example, a local translation
      table may be consulted that maps a numeric identifier to the
      user@dns_domain syntax.  A name service may also be used to
      accomplish the translation.  A server may provide a more
      general service, not limited by any particular translation
      (which would only translate a limited set of possible strings)
      by storing the owner and owner_group attributes in local
      storage without any translation or it may augment a
      translation method by storing the entire string for attributes
      for which no translation is available while using the local
      representation for those cases in which a translation is
      available.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.9-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.9-4">
      Servers that do not provide support for all possible values of
      the owner and owner_group attributes <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> return an error
      (NFS4ERR_BADOWNER) when a string is presented that has no
      translation, as the value to be set for a SETATTR of the
      owner, owner_group, or acl attributes.  When a server does
      accept an owner or owner_group value as valid on a SETATTR
      (and similarly for the owner and group strings in an acl), it
      is promising to return that same string when a corresponding
      GETATTR is done.  Configuration changes (including
      changes from the mapping of the string to the local representation)
      and ill-constructed
      name translations (those that contain aliasing) may make that
      promise impossible to honor.  Servers should make appropriate
      efforts to avoid a situation in which these attributes have
      their values changed when no real change to ownership has
      occurred.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.9-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.9-5">
      The "dns_domain" portion of the owner string is meant to be a
      DNS domain name, for example, user@example.org.  Servers should
      accept as valid a set of users for at least one domain.  A
      server may treat other domains as having no valid
      translations.  A more general service is provided when a
      server is capable of accepting users for multiple domains, or
      for all domains, subject to security constraints.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.9-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.9-6">
      In the case where there is no translation available to the
      client or server, the attribute value will be constructed
      without the "@".  Therefore, the absence of the @ from the
      owner or owner_group attribute signifies that no translation
      was available at the sender and that the receiver of the
      attribute should not use that string as a basis for
      translation into its own internal format.  Even though the
      attribute value cannot be translated, it may still be useful.
      In the case of a client, the attribute string may be used for
      local display of ownership.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.9-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.9-7">
      To provide a greater degree of compatibility with NFSv3,
      which identified users and groups by 32-bit unsigned user
      identifiers and group identifiers, owner and group strings that
      consist of decimal numeric values with no leading zeros can be
      given a special interpretation by clients and servers that
      choose to provide such support.  The receiver may treat such a
      user or group string as representing the same user as would be
      represented by an NFSv3 uid or gid having the corresponding
      numeric value.  A server is not obligated to accept such a
      string, but may return an NFS4ERR_BADOWNER instead.  To avoid
      this mechanism being used to subvert user and group translation,
      so that a client might pass all of the owners and groups in
      numeric form, a server <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> return an NFS4ERR_BADOWNER error
      when there is a valid translation for the user or owner
      designated in this way.  In that case, the client must use the
      appropriate name@domain string and not the special form for compatibility.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.9-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.9-8">
      The owner string "nobody" may be used to designate an

      means to the owner attribute. Users and implementations
      of NFSv4.1 <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> use "nobody" to designate a real user whose access is not anonymous.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.9-8">¶</a></p>

            but it does not render invalid any previously
            existing implementations. Additionally, this
            section provides clarifications based on previous
            implementations and discussions around them.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6.1-2.5">¶</a>

            On servers that support both the mode and the acl or
            dacl attributes, the server must keep the two consistent
            with each other.  The value of the mode attribute (with
            the exception of the three high-order bits described in
            <a class="xref" href="#attrdef_mode">Section 6.2.4</a>) must be determined entirely
            by the value of the ACL, so that use of the mode is
            never required for anything other than setting the
            three high-order bits.  See <a class="xref" href="#setattr">Section 6.4.1</a>

            When a mode attribute is set on an object, the ACL

            ACL keep as much information as possible. This includes
            information about inheritance, AUDIT and ALARM ACEs, and
            permissions granted and denied that do not conflict with

          The NFSv4.1 ACL attribute contains an array of Access
          Control Entries (ACEs) that are associated with the file
          system object.  Although the client can set and
          get the acl attribute, the server is responsible for using
          the ACL to perform access control. The client can use the
          OPEN or ACCESS operations to check access without modifying
          or reading data or metadata.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6.2.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6.2.1-2">
          The NFS ACE structure is defined as follows:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6.2.1-2">¶</a></p>
<div id="section-6.2.1-3">
<pre class="sourcecode lang-xdr">typedef uint32_t        acetype4;

<p id="section-6.2.1-4">
          To determine if a request succeeds, the server processes
          each nfsace4 entry in order.  Only ACEs that have a "who"
          that matches the requester are considered.  Each ACE is
          processed until all of the bits of the requester's access
          have been ALLOWED.  Once a bit (see below) has been ALLOWED
          by an ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE, it is no longer considered in the
          processing of later ACEs.  If an ACCESS_DENIED_ACE is
          encountered where the requester's access still has unALLOWED
          bits in common with the "access_mask" of the ACE, the
          request is denied.  When the ACL is fully processed, if
          there are bits in the requester's mask that have not been
          ALLOWED or DENIED, access is denied.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6.2.1-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6.2.1-5">
          Unlike the ALLOW and DENY ACE types, the ALARM and AUDIT ACE
          types do not affect a requester's access, and instead are
          for triggering events as a result of a requester's access
          attempt.  Therefore, AUDIT and ALARM ACEs are processed only
          after processing ALLOW and DENY ACEs.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6.2.1-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6.2.1-6">
          The NFSv4.1 ACL model is quite rich. Some server
          platforms may provide access-control functionality that goes
          beyond the UNIX-style mode attribute, but that is not as
          rich as the NFS ACL model.  So that users can take advantage
          of this more limited functionality, the server may support
          the acl attributes by mapping between its ACL model and the
          NFSv4.1 ACL model.  Servers must ensure that the ACL
          they actually store or enforce is at least as strict as the
          NFSv4 ACL that was set.  It is tempting to accomplish this
          by rejecting any ACL that falls outside the small set that
          can be represented accurately.  However, such an approach
          can render ACLs unusable without special client-side
          knowledge of the server's mapping, which defeats the purpose
          of having a common NFSv4 ACL protocol.  Therefore, servers
          should accept every ACL that they can without compromising
          security.  To help accomplish this, servers may make a
          special exception, in the case of unsupported permission
          bits, to the rule that bits not ALLOWED or DENIED by an ACL
          must be denied.  For example, a UNIX-style server might
          choose to silently allow read attribute permissions even
          though an ACL does not explicitly allow those permissions.
          (An ACL that explicitly denies permission to read attributes
          should still be rejected.)<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6.2.1-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6.2.1-7">
          The situation is complicated by the fact that a server may
          have multiple modules that enforce ACLs. For example, the
          enforcement for NFSv4.1 access may be different from,
          but not weaker than, the enforcement for local access, and
          both may be different from the enforcement for access
          through other protocols such as SMB (Server Message Block). So it may be useful for
          a server to accept an ACL even if not all of its modules are
          able to support it.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6.2.1-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6.2.1-8">
          The guiding principle with regard to NFSv4 access is
          that the server must not accept ACLs that appear to
          make access to the file more restrictive than it really is.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6.2.1-8">¶</a></p>

            cannot be trusted to set an ACL for which automatic

    Single-server namespaces may be presented directly to clients,

      On a UNIX server, the namespace describes all the files reachable by
      pathnames under the root directory or "/".  On a Windows server, the
      namespace constitutes all the files on disks named by mapped disk
      letters.  NFS server administrators rarely make the entire server's
      file system namespace available to NFS clients.  More often, portions
      of the namespace are made available via an "export" feature.  In
      previous versions of the NFS protocol, the root filehandle for each
      export is obtained through the MOUNT protocol; the client sent a
      string that identified the export name within the namespace and 
      the server returned the root filehandle 
      for that export.  The MOUNT protocol also provided an EXPORTS
      procedure that enumerated the server's exports.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-7.1-1">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-7.2-1">
      The NFSv4.1 protocol provides a root filehandle that clients can
      use to obtain filehandles for the exports of a particular server,
      via a series of LOOKUP operations within a COMPOUND, to traverse
      a path.  A common user experience is to use a graphical user interface
      (perhaps a file "Open" dialog window) to find a file via progressive
      browsing through a directory tree.  The client must be able to move
      from one export to another export via single-component, progressive
      LOOKUP operations.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-7.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-7.2-2">
      This style of browsing is not well supported by the NFSv3 protocol.  In NFSv3, the client expects all 
      LOOKUP operations to remain
      within a single server file system.  For example, the device attribute
      will not change.  This prevents a client from taking namespace paths
      that span exports.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-7.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-7.2-3">
      In the case of NFSv3, an automounter on the client
      can obtain a snapshot of the server's namespace
      using the EXPORTS procedure of the MOUNT protocol.
      If it understands the server's pathname syntax,
      it can create an image of the server's namespace
      on the client.  The parts of the namespace that
      are not exported by the server are filled in
      with directories that might be constructed similarly
      to an NFSv4.1 "pseudo file system" (see <a class="xref" href="#server_pseudo_file_system">Section 7.3</a>) that
      allows the user to browse from one mounted file
      system to another.  There is a drawback to this
      representation of the server's namespace on the
      client: it is static.  If the server administrator
      adds a new export, the client will be unaware of it.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-7.2-3">¶</a></p>

      NFSv4.1 servers avoid this namespace inconsistency by

      Where there are portions of the server namespace that are not

      to reach actual exported file systems.  A technique that servers
      may use to provide for this is to bridge the unexported portion of 
      the namespace via a
      "pseudo file system" that provides a view of exported directories
      only.  A pseudo file system has a unique fsid and behaves like a
      normal, read-only file system.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-7.3-2">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-7.5-1">
      The nature of the server's pseudo file system is that it is a logical
      representation of file system(s) available from the server.
      Therefore, the pseudo file system is most likely constructed
      dynamically when the server is first instantiated.  It is expected
      that the pseudo file system may not have an on-disk counterpart from
      which persistent filehandles could be constructed.  Even though it is
      preferable that the server provide persistent filehandles for the
      pseudo file system, the NFS client should expect that pseudo file
      system filehandles are volatile.  This can be confirmed by checking
      the associated "fh_expire_type" attribute for those filehandles in
      question.  If the filehandles are volatile, the NFS client must be
      prepared to recover a filehandle value (e.g., with a series of
      LOOKUP operations) when receiving an error of NFS4ERR_FHEXPIRED.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-7.5-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-7.5-2">
      Because it is quite likely that servers will implement pseudo
      file systems using volatile filehandles, clients need to be

    Integrating locking into the NFS protocol necessarily causes it to be
    stateful.  With the inclusion of such features as share reservations,
    file and directory delegations, recallable layouts, and support for 
    mandatory byte-range locking, the protocol becomes substantially more 
    dependent on proper management of state than the traditional
    combination of NFS and NLM (Network Lock Manager)
    <span>[<a class="xref" href="#xnfs">54</a>]</span>. These features include expanded
    locking facilities, which provide some measure of inter-client

    In this model, the server owns the state information.  The client
    requests changes in locks and the server responds with the changes
    made.  Non-client-initiated changes in locking state are infrequent.
    The client receives prompt notification of such changes and can adjust
    its view of the locking state to reflect the server's changes.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8-4">
    Individual pieces of state created by the server and passed to the
    client at its request are represented by 128-bit stateids.  These

    to access a file in particular ways or at a particular location.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8-4">¶</a></p>

    In all cases, there is a transition from the most general
    information that represents a client as a whole to the eventual 
    lightweight stateid used for most client and server

        lock) for the same file, of the same type, and sharing the same
        ownership characteristics.  Thus, opens of the same file by
        different open-owners each have an identifying stateid.  Similarly,

        associated stateids by which they may be referenced. 
        The stateid is used as a shorthand reference to a lock or set
        of locks, and given a stateid, the server can determine the associated
        state-owner or state-owners (in the case of an open-owner/lock-owner pair)

<p id="section-8.2.2-1">
   Stateids are divided into two fields, a 96-bit
   "other" field identifying the specific set
   of locks and a 32-bit "seqid" sequence value.
   Except in the case of special stateids
          (see <a class="xref" href="#special_stateid">Section 8.2.3</a>), 
   a particular value of the 
          "other" field denotes a 
          set of locks of the same type (for example, 
          byte-range locks, opens, delegations, or layouts),
          for a specific file or directory, and sharing
          the same ownership characteristics.  The seqid
          designates a specific instance of such a set of
          locks, and is incremented to indicate changes in
          such a set of locks, either by the addition or
          deletion of locks from the set, a change in the 
          byte-range they apply to, or an upgrade or downgrade
          in the type of one or more locks.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.2.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.2.2-2">  
          When such a set of locks is first created, the server returns a
          stateid with seqid value of one.  On subsequent
          operations that modify the set of locks, the server
          is required to increment the "seqid" field by one
          whenever it returns a stateid for the same 
          state-owner/file/type  combination and there is some
          change in the set of locks actually designated.
          In this case, the server will return a stateid with an "other" field
          the same as previously used for that 
          state-owner/file/type  combination, with an 
          incremented "seqid" field.
          This pattern continues until the seqid is incremented
          past NFS4_UINT32_MAX, and one
          (not zero) is the next seqid value.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.2.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.2.2-3">
   The purpose of the incrementing of the seqid
   is to allow the server to
   communicate to the client the order in which
   operations that modified locking state associated
   with a stateid have been processed and to make
          it possible for the client to send requests
          that are conditional on the set of locks not
          having changed since the stateid in question
          was returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.2.2-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.2.2-4">
   Except for layout stateids (<a class="xref" href="#layout_stateid">Section 12.5.3</a>),
          when a client sends a stateid to the server, it has two
          choices with regard to the seqid sent.  It may set the seqid
          to zero to indicate to the server that it wishes the most
          up-to-date seqid for that stateid's "other" field to be
          used.  This would be the common choice in the case of a
          stateid sent with a READ or WRITE operation.  It also may
          set a non-zero value, in which case the server checks if that
          seqid is the correct one.  In that case, the server is
          required to return NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID if the seqid is lower
          than the most current value and NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID if the
          seqid is greater than the most current value.  This would be
          the common choice in the case of stateids sent with a CLOSE
          or OPEN_DOWNGRADE.  Because OPENs may be sent in parallel
          for the same owner, a client might close a file without
          knowing that an OPEN upgrade had been done by the server,
          changing the lock in question.  If CLOSE were sent with a
          zero seqid, the OPEN upgrade would be cancelled before the
          client even received an indication that an upgrade had
          happened.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.2.2-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.2.2-5">
          When a stateid is sent by the server to the client as part of
          a callback operation, it is not subject to checking for
          a current seqid and returning NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID.  This
          is because the client is not in a position to know the
          most up-to-date seqid and thus cannot verify it.  Unless
          specially noted, the seqid value for a stateid sent by the
          server to the client as part of a callback is required
          to be zero with NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID returned if it is
          not.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.2.2-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.2.2-6">
          In making comparisons between seqids, both by the client
   in determining the order of operations and by the server
   in determining whether the NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID is to be
          returned, the possibility of the seqid being swapped
   around past the NFS4_UINT32_MAX value needs to be taken
   into account.  When two seqid values are being compared,
     the total count of slots for all sessions associated 
   with the current client is used to do this.  When one
   seqid value is less than this total slot count and
   another seqid value is greater than NFS4_UINT32_MAX
   minus the total slot count, the former is to be treated
   as lower than the latter, despite the fact that it is
   numerically greater.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.2.2-6">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-8.3-1">
      Each client/server pair, as represented by a client ID, has a single
      lease.
      The purpose of the lease is to allow the client to indicate
      to the server, in a low-overhead way, that it is active, and 
      thus that the server is to retain the client's locks.  This arrangement 
      allows the server to remove stale locking-related objects
      that are held by a client that has crashed or is otherwise
      unreachable, once the relevant lease expires.  This in turn allows 
      other clients to obtain conflicting locks without being 
      delayed indefinitely by inactive or unreachable clients.  
      It is not a 
      mechanism for cache consistency and lease
      renewals may not be denied if the lease interval has not expired.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.3-2">
      Since each session is associated with a specific
      client (identified by the client's client ID), any
      operation sent on that session is an indication
      that the associated client is reachable.  When a
      request is sent for a given session, successful
      execution of a SEQUENCE operation (or successful
      retrieval of the result of SEQUENCE from the reply
      cache) on an unexpired lease will result in the
      lease being implicitly renewed, for the standard
      renewal period (equal to the lease_time attribute).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.3-3">
      If the client ID's lease has not expired when the
      server receives a SEQUENCE operation, then the server
      <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> renew the lease.  If the client ID's lease has expired
      when the server receives a SEQUENCE operation, the
      server <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> renew the lease; this depends on whether
      any state was revoked as a result of the client's
      failure to renew the lease before expiration.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.3-4">
      Absent other activity that would renew the lease, a COMPOUND
      consisting of a single SEQUENCE operation will suffice.  The
      client should also take communication-related delays into
      account and take steps to ensure that the renewal messages
      actually reach the server in good time.  For example:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.3-4">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-8.3-5.1">
          When trunking is in effect, the client should 
          consider sending multiple requests on different
          connections, in order to ensure that renewal
          occurs, even in the event of blockage in the 
          path used for one of those connections.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.3-5.1">¶</a>

   Transport retransmission delays might become
   so large as to approach or exceed the length
   of the lease period. This may be particularly
   likely when the server is unresponsive due to
   a restart; see <a class="xref" href="#reclaim_locks">Section 8.4.2.1</a>. If the client implementation is not careful,
   transport retransmission delays can result in the
   client failing to detect a server restart before
   the grace period ends. The scenario is that the
   client is using a transport with exponential
   backoff, such that the maximum retransmission
   timeout exceeds both the grace period and the
   lease_time attribute. A network partition causes
   the client's connection's retransmission interval
   to back off, and even after the partition heals,
   the next transport-level retransmission is sent
   after the server has restarted and its grace
   period ends.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.3-5.2.1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.3-5.2.2">

          The client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> either recover from the ensuing

          despite transport-level retransmission intervals
          that exceed the lease_time, a SEQUENCE operation is sent
          that renews the lease before expiration. The client can achieve this
          by associating a new connection with the session,
          and sending a SEQUENCE operation on it. However, if
          the attempt to establish a new connection is delayed
          for some reason (e.g., exponential backoff of the connection
          establishment packets), the client will have to
          abort the connection establishment attempt before
          the lease expires, and attempt to reconnect.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.3-5.2.2">¶</a></p>

      in the COMPOUND procedure's request are still
      executing. Once the last operation has finished, and
      the response to COMPOUND has been sent, the server
      <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> set the lease to expire no sooner than the
      sum of current time and the value of the lease_time attribute.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.3-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.3-7">
      A client ID's lease can expire when it has been
      at least the lease interval (lease_time) since the

      Because the SEQUENCE operation is the basic mechanism to renew

      will inform the client of changes in the lease status that the
      client needs to be informed of.  The client should inspect the
      status flags (sr_status_flags) returned by sequence and take

      server restarts. All READ and WRITE operations that
      may have been queued within the client or network buffers must
      wait until the client has successfully recovered the locks

        In the event that a client fails, the server may release the 
        client's locks when the associated lease has expired.  Conflicting 
        locks from another client may only be granted after this lease 
        expiration.  As discussed in <a class="xref" href="#lease_renewal">Section 8.3</a>, when
        a client has not failed and re-establishes its lease before expiration

        To minimize client delay upon restart, lock requests are associated
        with an instance of the client by a client-supplied verifier.  This
        verifier is part of the client_owner4 sent in the initial 
        EXCHANGE_ID call made by the client.
        The server returns a client ID as a result of the EXCHANGE_ID
        operation.  The client then confirms the use of the client ID by
        establishing a session associated with that client ID  (see
        <a class="xref" href="#OP_CREATE_SESSION_DESCRIPTION">Section 18.36.3</a> for a
        description of how this is done).  All locks,
        including opens, byte-range locks, delegations, and layouts obtained

        Since the verifier will be changed by the client upon each
        initialization, the server can compare a new verifier to the verifier
        associated with currently held locks and determine that they do not
        match.  This signifies the client's new instantiation and subsequent
        loss (upon confirmation of the new client ID) of locking
        state.  As a result, the server is free to release all
        locks held that are associated with the old client ID that was
        derived from the old verifier.  At this point, conflicting locks from
        other clients, kept waiting while the lease had not yet expired, can
        be granted.  In addition, all stateids associated with the old client ID

        When state information and the associated locks are lost
        as a result of a server restart, the protocol must provide
        a way to cause that state to be re-established.  The 
        approach used is to define, for most types of locking
        state (layouts are an exception), a request whose function 
        is to allow the client to 
        re-establish on the server a lock first obtained from a
        previous instance.  Generally, these requests are variants
        of the requests normally used to create locks of that type
        and are referred to as "reclaim-type" requests, and the process
        of re-establishing such locks is referred to as "reclaiming"

        all of the locks that it has without the possibility that
        some other client will be granted a conflicting lock,
        a "grace period" is devoted
        to the reclaim process.  During this period, requests 
        creating client IDs and
        sessions are handled normally, but locking requests are
        subject to special restrictions.  Only 
        reclaim-type locking requests are allowed, unless the
        server can reliably determine (through state
        persistently maintained across restart instances) that
        granting any such lock cannot possibly conflict with a
        subsequent reclaim.  
        When a request is made to obtain
        a new lock (i.e., not a reclaim-type request) during the
        grace period and such a determination cannot be made,

        claim type of CLAIM_PREVIOUS;  see
        <a class="xref" href="#open_br_reclaim">Section 9.11</a>) to re-establish its locking
        state.  Once this is done, or if there is no such locking
        state to reclaim, the client sends a global RECLAIM_COMPLETE
        operation, i.e., one with the rca_one_fs argument set to FALSE, to
        indicate that it has reclaimed all of the locking state that
        it will reclaim.  Once a client sends such a RECLAIM_COMPLETE
        operation, it may attempt non-reclaim locking operations,

        the period of special handling is over.

        the server restart.  This means that a client that has done a
        RECLAIM_COMPLETE must be prepared to receive an NFS4ERR_GRACE
        when attempting to acquire new locks.  
        In order for the server to know that all clients with possible prior
        lock state have done a RECLAIM_COMPLETE,
        the server must maintain in stable
        storage a list clients that may have such locks.  The server

        even within the grace period, although NFS4ERR_GRACE must always
        be returned to clients attempting a non-reclaim lock request
        before doing their own global RECLAIM_COMPLETE.
        For the server to be able
        to service READ and WRITE operations during the grace period, it must
        again be able to guarantee that no possible conflict could arise

        For a server to provide simple, valid handling during the grace

        requests and READ and WRITE operations by returning the NFS4ERR_GRACE
        error.  However, a server may keep information about granted locks in
        stable storage.  With this information, the server could determine if
        a locking, READ or WRITE operation can be safely processed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.4.2.1-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.4.2.1-9">
        For example, if the server maintained on stable storage summary
        information on whether mandatory locks exist, either mandatory 
        byte-range locks, or share reservations specifying deny modes,
        many requests could be allowed during the grace period.  If it
        is known that no such share reservations exist, OPEN request that
        do not specify deny modes may be safely granted.  If, in addition,
        it is known that no mandatory byte-range locks exist, either 
        through information stored on stable storage or simply because
        the server does not support such locks, READ and WRITE operations
        may be safely processed during the grace period.
        Another important case is where it is known that no mandatory 
        byte-range locks exist, either because the server does not 
        provide support for them or because their absence is known
        from persistently recorded data.  In this case, READ and
        WRITE operations specifying stateids derived from reclaim-type
        operations may be validly processed during the grace period

        several seconds) between retries should be used to avoid overwhelming
        the server.  Further discussion of the general issue is included in

          While the server has to trust the client to tell the truth, the
          negative consequences for security are limited to enabling
   denial-of-service attacks in situations in which AUTH_SYS is
   supported.   The
          fundamental rule for the server when processing reclaim requests
          is that it <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> grant the reclaim if an equivalent non-reclaim
          request would not be granted during steady state due to access
          control or access conflict issues. For example, an OPEN request
   during a reclaim will be refused with NFS4ERR_ACCESS if the principal making
   the request does not have access to open the file according to the
   discretionary ACL (<a class="xref" href="#attrdef_dacl">Section 6.2.2</a>) on the file.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.4.2.1.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.4.2.1.1-2">
          Nonetheless, it is possible that a client operating in error or
          maliciously could, during reclaim, prevent another client from
          reclaiming access to state. For example, an attacker could
          send an OPEN reclaim operation with a deny mode that prevents
          another client from reclaiming the OPEN state it had before the
          server restarted.
          The attacker could perform the same denial of service during
          steady state prior to server restart, as long as the
          attacker had permissions. Given that the attack
          vectors are equivalent, the grace period does not offer any
          additional opportunity for denial of service, and any concerns
          about this attack vector, whether during grace or steady state,
          are addressed the same way: use RPCSEC_GSS for authentication
          and limit access to the file only to principals that the owner of
          the file trusts.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.4.2.1.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.4.2.1.1-3">
           Note that if prior to restart the server had client
           IDs with the  EXCHGID4_FLAG_BIND_PRINC_STATEID (<a class="xref" href="#OP_EXCHANGE_ID">Section 18.35</a>) capability set, then the server
           <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> record in stable storage the client owner and the
           principal that established the client ID via EXCHANGE_ID.
           If the server does not, then there is a risk a client will
           be unable to reclaim state if it does not have a credential
           for a principal that was originally authorized to
           establish the state.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.4.2.1.1-3">¶</a></p>

        If the duration of a network partition is greater than the lease
        period provided by the server, the server will not have received a
        lease renewal from the client.  If this occurs, the server may free
        all locks held for the client or it may allow the lock state to
        remain for a considerable period, subject to the constraint that
        if a request for a conflicting lock is made, locks associated with
        an expired lease do not prevent such a conflicting lock from being
        granted but <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be revoked as necessary so as to avoid interfering with
        such conflicting requests.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.4.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.4.3-2">
        If the server chooses to delay freeing of lock state until there 
        is a conflict, it may either free all of the client's locks once 
        there is a conflict or it may only revoke the minimum set of locks
        necessary to allow conflicting requests.  When it adopts the 
        finer-grained approach, it must revoke all locks associated with a
        given stateid, even if the conflict is with only a subset of locks.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.4.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.4.3-3">
        When the server chooses to free all of a client's lock state, either
        immediately upon lease expiration or as a result of the first
        attempt to obtain a conflicting a lock, the server may report the
        loss of lock state in a number of ways.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.4.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.4.3-4">
        The server may choose to invalidate the session and the associated
        client ID.  In this case, once the client can communicate
        with the server, it will receive an NFS4ERR_BADSESSION error.  Upon
        attempting to create a new session, it would get an 
        NFS4ERR_STALE_CLIENTID.  Upon creating the new client ID and new
        session, the client will attempt to reclaim locks. Normally, the
        server will not allow the client to reclaim locks, because the
        server will not be in its recovery grace period.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.4.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.4.3-5"> 
        Another possibility is for the server to maintain the session and 
        client ID but for all stateids held by the
        client to become invalid or stale.  Once the client can reach
        the server after such a network partition, the status returned by
        the SEQUENCE operation will indicate a loss of locking state; i.e.,
        the flag SEQ4_STATUS_EXPIRED_ALL_STATE_REVOKED will be set in
        sr_status_flags. In
        addition, all I/O submitted by the
        client with the now invalid stateids will fail with the server
        returning the error NFS4ERR_EXPIRED.  Once the client learns of
        the loss of locking state, it 
        will suitably notify the applications that held the invalidated
        locks.  The client should then take action to free invalidated 
        stateids, either by establishing a new client ID using a new
        verifier or by doing a FREE_STATEID operation to release each
        of the invalidated stateids.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.4.3-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.4.3-6">
        When the server adopts a finer-grained approach to revocation
        of locks when a client's lease has expired, only a subset of stateids 
        will normally become invalid during a network partition.  
        When the client can communicate with the server after such a 
        network partition heals, the status returned by the SEQUENCE 
        operation will indicate a partial loss of locking state 
        (SEQ4_STATUS_EXPIRED_SOME_STATE_REVOKED).  
        In addition, operations, including I/O submitted by the
        client, with the now invalid stateids will fail with the server
        returning the error NFS4ERR_EXPIRED.  Once the client learns of
        the loss of locking state, it will use the TEST_STATEID operation 
        on all of its stateids to 
        determine which locks have been lost and then 
        suitably notify the applications that held the invalidated
        locks.  The client can then release the invalidated locking 
        state and acknowledge the revocation of the associated locks
        by doing a FREE_STATEID operation on each of the invalidated

        Solving the first and second edge conditions requires either that the server
        always assumes after it restarts that some edge condition 
        occurs, and thus returns NFS4ERR_NO_GRACE for all reclaim attempts, or that the server
        record some information in stable storage.  The amount 
        of information the
        server records in stable storage is in inverse proportion to how harsh
        the server intends to be whenever edge conditions arise.
        The server
        that is completely tolerant of all edge conditions will record in
        stable storage every lock that is acquired, removing the lock record
        from stable storage only when the lock is released.

      At any point, the server can revoke locks held by a client, and the
      client must be prepared for this event.  When the client detects that
      its locks have been or may have been revoked, the client is
      responsible for validating the state information between itself and
      the server.  Validating locking state for the client means that it
      must verify or reclaim state for each lock currently held.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.5-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.5-2">
      The first occasion of lock revocation is upon server
      restart.  Note that this includes situations
      in which sessions are persistent and locking state is
      lost.  In this class of instances, the client will

      informing the client of the scope of the lock revocation decided
      upon.  The client then uses the status information provided

      delegation or layout) was not returned within the lease period
      after having been recalled.  While these are
      considered rare events, they are possible, and the client must be
      prepared to deal with them.  When either of these events occurs,
      the client finds out about the situation through the status returned
      by the SEQUENCE operation.  Any use of stateids associated with 
      locks revoked during the lease period will receive the error

<p id="section-8.6-1">
      When determining the time period for the server lease, the usual lease
       trade-offs apply.  A short lease is good for fast server recovery at a
      cost of increased operations to effect lease renewal (when there are
      no other operations during the period to effect lease renewal as a
      side effect).  A long lease is certainly kinder and gentler to
      servers trying to handle very large numbers of clients.  The number of extra requests 
      to effect lock renewal drops in inverse
      proportion to the lease time.  The disadvantages of a long lease
      include the possibility of slower recovery after certain failures.
      After server failure, a longer grace period may be required when
      some clients do not promptly reclaim their locks and do a 
      global RECLAIM_COMPLETE.  In the event of client failure,
      the longer period for a lease to expire will force conflicting
      requests to wait longer.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.6-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.6-2">
      A long lease is practical if the server can store lease state in
      stable storage.  Upon recovery, the server can reconstruct the
      lease state from its stable storage and continue operation with
      its clients.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.6-2">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="section-8.7-1">
      To avoid the need for synchronized clocks, lease times are granted by
      the server as a time delta.  However, there is a requirement that the
      client and server clocks do not drift excessively over the duration of
      the lease.  There is also the issue of propagation delay across the
      network, which could easily be several hundred milliseconds, as well as
      the possibility that requests will be lost and need to be
      retransmitted.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.7-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.7-2">
      To take propagation delay into account, the client should
      subtract it from lease times (e.g., if the client estimates the
      one-way propagation delay as 200 milliseconds, then it can
      assume that the lease is already 200 milliseconds old when it
      gets it).  In addition, it will take another 200 milliseconds to
      get a response back to the server.  So the client must send a
      lease renewal or write data back to the server at least 400
      milliseconds before the lease would expire. If the propagation delay
      varies over the life of the lease (e.g., the client is on a mobile
      host), the client will need to continuously subtract the increase
      in propagation delay from the lease times.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.7-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-8.7-3">
      The server's lease period configuration should take into account the
      network distance of the clients that will be accessing the server's
      resources.  It is expected that the lease period will take into
      account the network propagation delays and other network delay factors
      for the client population.  Since the protocol does not allow for an
      automatic method to determine an appropriate lease period, the
      server's administrator may have to tune the lease period.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8.7-3">¶</a></p>

      partitions are relatively rare.  Therefore, it is important that the
      READ and WRITE operations have a lightweight mechanism to indicate if
      they possess a held lock.  A LOCK operation contains the

<p id="section-9.1.1-1">
        When opening a file or requesting a byte-range lock, the 
        client must specify an identifier that represents the owner of
        the requested lock.  This identifier is in the form of a
        state-owner, represented in the protocol by a state_owner4, a 
        variable-length opaque array that, when concatenated with the
        current client ID, uniquely defines the owner of a lock managed
        by the client. This may be a thread ID, process ID, or other 
        unique value.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9.1.1-1">¶</a></p>

        Owners of opens and owners of byte-range locks are separate

        are used to designate owners of each.  The protocol distinguishes
        between open-owners (represented by open_owner4 structures)

        open file under which the LOCK operation was done.  Delegations
        and layouts, on the other hand, are not associated with a

<p id="section-9.1.2-1">
        All READ, WRITE, and SETATTR operations contain a stateid.  For the
        purposes of this section, SETATTR operations that change the size
        attribute of a file are treated as if they are writing the area
        between the old and new sizes (i.e., the byte-range truncated or added to the
        file by means of the SETATTR), even where SETATTR is not explicitly
        mentioned in the text.  The stateid passed to one of these operations must
        be one that represents an open, a set of byte-range locks, or a 
        delegation, or it may be a special stateid representing anonymous
        access or the special bypass stateid.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9.1.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-9.1.2-2">
        If the state-owner performs a READ or WRITE operation in a situation in which
        it has established a byte-range lock or share reservation 
        on the server (any OPEN constitutes a share reservation), the
        stateid (previously returned by the server) must be used to
        indicate what locks, including both byte-range
        locks and share reservations, are held by the state-owner.  If no state
        is established by the client, either a byte-range lock or a share reservation,
        a special stateid for anonymous state (zero as the value for "other" and "seqid") 
        is used.  (See <a class="xref" href="#special_stateid">Section 8.2.3</a> for a description of 
        'special' stateids in general.)
        Regardless of whether a stateid for anonymous state
        or a stateid returned by the server is used, if there is a
        conflicting share reservation or mandatory byte-range lock held on the
        file, the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> refuse to service the READ or WRITE operation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9.1.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-9.1.2-3">
        Share reservations are established by OPEN operations and by their
        nature are mandatory in that when the OPEN denies READ or WRITE
        operations, that denial results in such operations being rejected with
        error NFS4ERR_LOCKED.  Byte-range locks may be implemented by the server
        as either mandatory or advisory, or the choice of mandatory or
        advisory behavior may be determined by the server on the basis of the
        file being accessed (for example, some UNIX-based servers support a
        "mandatory lock bit" on the mode attribute such that if set, byte-range
        locks are required on the file before I/O is possible).  When byte-range
        locks are advisory, they only prevent the granting of conflicting lock
        requests and have no effect on READs or WRITEs.  Mandatory byte-range
        locks, however, prevent conflicting I/O operations.  When they are
        attempted, they are rejected with NFS4ERR_LOCKED.  When the client
        gets NFS4ERR_LOCKED on a file for which it knows it has the proper share
        reservation, it will need to send a LOCK operation on the byte-range of
        the file that includes the byte-range the I/O was to be performed on, with
        an appropriate locktype field of the LOCK operation's arguments (i.e., READ*_LT for a READ operation, WRITE*_LT
        for a WRITE operation).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9.1.2-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-9.1.2-4">
        Note that for UNIX environments that support mandatory byte-range locking,
        the distinction between advisory and mandatory locking is subtle.  In
        fact, advisory and mandatory byte-range locks are exactly the same as
        far as the APIs and requirements on implementation. If the mandatory
        lock attribute is set on the file, the server checks to see if the
        lock-owner has an appropriate shared (READ_LT) or exclusive (WRITE_LT) byte-range
        lock on the byte-range it wishes to READ from or WRITE to. If there is no
        appropriate lock, the server checks if there is a conflicting lock
        (which can be done by attempting to acquire the conflicting lock on
        behalf of the lock-owner, and if successful, release the lock after
        the READ or WRITE operation is done), and if there is, the server returns
        NFS4ERR_LOCKED.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9.1.2-4">¶</a></p>

      overlaps -- fully or partially -- either with that initial lock or a

<p id="section-9.6-1">
      Some clients require the support of blocking locks.  While NFSv4.1 
      provides a callback when a previously unavailable lock becomes 
      available, this is an <span class="bcp14">OPTIONAL</span> feature and clients cannot 
      depend on its presence.  Clients need to be prepared to continually 
      poll for the lock.  This presents a fairness problem.  Two of
      the lock types, READW_LT and WRITEW_LT, are used to indicate to the
      server that the client is requesting a blocking lock.  When the
      callback is not used, the server should maintain an ordered
      list of pending blocking locks.  When the conflicting lock is
      released, the server may wait for the period of time equal to
      lease_time for the first waiting
      client to re-request the lock.  After the lease period expires, the
      next waiting client request is allowed the lock.  Clients are required
      to poll at an interval sufficiently small that it is likely to acquire
      the lock in a timely manner.  The server is not required to maintain a
      list of pending blocked locks as it is used to increase fairness and
      not correct operation.  Because of the unordered nature of crash
      recovery, storing of lock state to stable storage would be required to
      guarantee ordered granting of blocking locks.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9.6-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-9.6-2">
      Servers may also note the lock types and delay returning denial of the
      request to allow extra time for a conflicting lock to be released,
      allowing a successful return.  In this way, clients can avoid the
      burden of needless frequent polling for blocking locks.  The server
      should take care in the length of delay in the event the client
      retransmits the request.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9.6-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-9.6-3">
      If a server receives a blocking LOCK operation, denies it, and then
      later receives a nonblocking request for the same lock, which is
      also denied, then it should remove the lock in question from its list of
      pending blocking locks.  Clients should use such a nonblocking request
      to indicate to the server that this is the last time they intend to poll
      for the lock, as may happen when the process requesting the lock is
      interrupted.  This is a courtesy to the server, to prevent it from
      unnecessarily waiting a lease period before granting other LOCK operations.
      However, clients are not required to perform this courtesy, and servers
      must not depend on them doing so.  Also, clients must be prepared for
      the possibility that this final locking request will be accepted.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9.6-3">¶</a></p>

      When a server indicates, via the flag OPEN4_RESULT_MAY_NOTIFY_LOCK, that
      CB_NOTIFY_LOCK callbacks might be done for the current open file, the
      client should take notice of this, but, since this is a hint, cannot
      rely on a CB_NOTIFY_LOCK always being done.  A client may reasonably
      reduce the frequency with which it polls for a denied lock, since the
      greater latency that might occur is likely to be eliminated given a
      prompt callback, but it still needs to poll.  When it receives a 
      CB_NOTIFY_LOCK, it should promptly try to obtain the lock, but it
      should be aware that other clients may be polling and that the server is under
      no obligation to reserve the lock for that particular client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9.6-4">¶</a></p>

      When an OPEN is done for a file and the open-owner for which the OPEN

      open file status maintained on the server to include the access and
      deny bits specified by the new OPEN as well as those for the existing
      OPEN.  The result is that there is one open file, as far as the
      protocol is concerned, and it includes the union of the access and
      deny bits for all of the OPEN requests completed.  The OPEN 
      is represented by a single stateid whose "other" value matches
      that of the original open, and whose "seqid" value is incremented
      to reflect the occurrence of the upgrade.  The increment is required
      in cases in which the "upgrade" results in no change to the open mode (e.g., an OPEN
      is done for read when the existing open file is opened for 
      OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_BOTH).  Only a single CLOSE will be done to reset the
      effects of both OPENs.  The client may use the stateid returned
      by the OPEN effecting the upgrade or with a stateid sharing the
      same "other" field and a seqid of zero,
      although care needs to be taken as far as upgrades that happen 
      while the CLOSE is pending.  Note that the
      client, when sending the OPEN, may not know that the same file is in

      together the access and deny bits and coalesce the two open files.

      When multiple open files on the client are merged into a single OPEN

      open file on the server.  This is because the union of the access and
      deny bits for the remaining opens may be smaller (i.e., a proper
      subset) than previously.  The OPEN_DOWNGRADE operation is used to make
      the necessary change and the client should use it to update the server
      so that share reservation requests by other clients are handled
      properly.  The stateid returned has the same "other" field as
      that passed to the server.  The "seqid" value in the returned

      clients do this, they may encounter situations in which, because
      of the existence of hard links, two OPEN operations may turn out

<p id="section-10-1">
    Client-side caching of data, of file attributes, and of file names is
    essential to providing good performance with the NFS protocol.
    Providing distributed cache coherence is a difficult problem, and
    previous versions of the NFS protocol have not attempted it.  Instead,
    several NFS client implementation techniques have been used to reduce
    the problems that a lack of coherence poses for users.  These
    techniques have not been clearly defined by earlier protocol
    specifications, and it is often unclear what is valid or invalid client
    behavior.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10-2">
    The NFSv4.1 protocol uses many techniques similar to those that
    have been used in previous protocol versions.  The NFSv4.1
    protocol does not provide distributed cache coherence.  However, it
    defines a more limited set of caching guarantees to allow locks and
    share reservations to be used without destructive interference from
    client-side caching.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10-3">
    In addition, the NFSv4.1 protocol introduces a delegation
    mechanism, which allows many decisions normally made by the server to
    be made locally by clients.  This mechanism provides efficient support
    of the common cases where sharing is infrequent or where sharing is
    read-only.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10-3">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="section-10.1-1">
      Caching techniques used in previous versions of the NFS protocol have
      been successful in providing good performance.  However, several
      scalability challenges can arise when those techniques are used with
      very large numbers of clients.  This is particularly true when clients
      are geographically distributed, which classically increases the latency
      for cache revalidation requests.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.1-2">
      The previous versions of the NFS protocol repeat their file data cache
      validation requests at the time the file is opened.  This behavior can
      have serious performance drawbacks.  A common case is one in which a
      file is only accessed by a single client.  Therefore, sharing is
      infrequent.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.1-3">
      In this case, repeated references to the server to find that no
      conflicts exist are expensive.  A better option with regards to
      performance is to allow a client that repeatedly opens a file to do so
      without reference to the server.  This is done until potentially
      conflicting operations from another client actually occur.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.1-4">
      A similar situation arises in connection with byte-range locking.  Sending
      LOCK and LOCKU operations as well as the READ and
      WRITE operations necessary to make data caching consistent with the
      locking semantics (see <a class="xref" href="#dc_file_locking">Section 10.3.2</a>)
      can severely limit performance.  When locking is used to provide
      protection against infrequent conflicts, a large penalty is incurred.
      This penalty may discourage the use of byte-range locking by applications.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.1-4">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-10.2-1">
      Recallable delegation of server responsibilities for a file to a
      client improves performance by avoiding repeated requests to the
      server in the absence of inter-client conflict.  With the use of a
      "callback" RPC from server to client, a server recalls delegated
      responsibilities when another client engages in sharing of a delegated
      file.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.2-2">
      A delegation is passed from the server to the client, specifying the
      object of the delegation and the type of delegation.  There are
      different types of delegations, but each type contains a stateid to be
      used to represent the delegation when performing operations that
      depend on the delegation.  This stateid is similar to those associated
      with locks and share reservations but differs in that the stateid for
      a delegation is associated with a client ID and may be used on behalf
      of all the open-owners for the given client.  A delegation is made
      to the client as a whole and not to any specific process or thread of
      control within it.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.2-3">
      The backchannel is established by CREATE_SESSION and
      BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION, and the client is required
      to maintain it. Because the backchannel may be down, even
      temporarily,
      correct protocol operation does not depend on
      them.  Preliminary testing of backchannel functionality by means of a
      CB_COMPOUND procedure with a single operation, CB_SEQUENCE,
      can be used to check the continuity of the backchannel.  A
      server avoids delegating responsibilities until it has
      determined that the backchannel exists.  Because the granting of a
      delegation is always conditional upon the absence of conflicting
      access, clients <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> assume that a delegation will be granted and
      they <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> always be prepared for OPENs, WANT_DELEGATIONs, and
      GET_DIR_DELEGATIONs to be processed without any
      delegations being granted.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.2-4">
      Unlike locks, an operation by a second client to a delegated file will
      cause the server to recall a delegation through a callback.  For
      individual operations, we will describe, under IMPLEMENTATION, when
      such operations are required to effect a recall.  A number of
      points should be noted, however.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-4">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-10.2-5.1">
          The server is free to recall a delegation
          whenever it feels it is desirable and may do so even if no 
          operations requiring recall are being done.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-5.1">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-10.2-5.2">
          Operations done outside the NFSv4.1 protocol, due to, for 
          example, access by other protocols, or by local access, 
          also need to result in delegation recall when they make 
          analogous changes to file system data.  What is crucial 
          is if the change would invalidate the guarantees provided 
          by the delegation.  When this is possible, the
          delegation needs to be recalled and <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be returned or
          revoked  before allowing the operation to proceed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-5.2">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-10.2-5.3">
          The semantics of the file system are crucial in defining
          when delegation recall is required.  If a particular change
          within a specific implementation causes change to a 
          file attribute, then delegation recall is required, whether
          that operation has been specifically listed as requiring
          delegation recall.  Again, what is critical is whether the
          guarantees provided by the delegation are being invalidated.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-5.3">¶</a>

      On recall, the client holding the delegation needs to flush modified
      state (such as modified data) to the server and return the
      delegation.  The conflicting request will not be acted on until
      the recall is complete.  The recall is considered complete when
      the client returns the delegation or the server times its wait
      for the delegation to be returned and revokes the delegation as
      a result of the timeout.  In the interim, the server will either
      delay responding to conflicting requests or respond to them with
      NFS4ERR_DELAY.  Following the resolution of the recall, the
      server has the information necessary to grant or deny the second
      client's request.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.2-9">
      At the time the client receives a delegation recall, it may have
      substantial state that needs to be flushed to the server.  Therefore,
      the server should allow sufficient time for the delegation to be
      returned since it may involve numerous RPCs to the server.  If the
      server is able to determine that the client is diligently flushing
      state to the server as a result of the recall, the server may extend
      the usual time allowed for a recall.  However, the time allowed for
      recall completion should not be unbounded.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.2-10">
      An example of this is when responsibility to mediate opens on a given
      file is delegated to a client (see <a class="xref" href="#open_delegation">Section 10.4</a>).
      The server will not know what opens are in effect on the client.
      Without this knowledge, the server will be unable to determine if the
      access and deny states for the file allow any particular open until
      the delegation for the file has been returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2-10">¶</a></p>

      A client failure or a network partition can result in failure to

        In the event the client restarts, the failure to renew
        the lease will result in the revocation of byte-range locks and share
        reservations.  Delegations, however, may be treated a bit differently.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.2.1-4">
        There will be situations in which delegations will need to be
        re-established after a client restarts.  The reason for this
        is that the client may have file data stored locally and this data was
        associated with the previously held delegations.  The client will need
        to re-establish the appropriate file state on the server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2.1-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.2.1-5">
        To allow for this type of client recovery, the server <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> extend the
        period for delegation recovery beyond the typical lease expiration
        period.  This implies that requests from other clients that conflict
        with these delegations will need to wait.  Because the normal recall
        process may require significant time for the client to flush changed
        state to the server, other clients need be prepared for delays that
        occur because of a conflicting delegation.  This longer interval would
        increase the window for clients to restart and consult stable storage
        so that the delegations can be reclaimed.  For OPEN delegations, such
        delegations are reclaimed using OPEN with a claim type of
        CLAIM_DELEGATE_PREV or CLAIM_DELEG_PREV_FH (see Sections

        When the server restarts, delegations are reclaimed (using
        the OPEN operation with CLAIM_PREVIOUS) in a similar fashion to byte-range
        locks and share reservations.  However, there is a slight semantic
        difference.  In the normal case, if the server decides that a
        delegation should not be granted, it performs the requested action
        (e.g., OPEN) without granting any delegation.  For reclaim, the server
        grants the delegation but a special designation is applied so that the
        client treats the delegation as having been granted but recalled by
        the server.  Because of this, the client has the duty to write all
        modified state to the server and then return the delegation.  This
        process of handling delegation reclaim reconciles three principles of
        the NFSv4.1 protocol:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2.1-7">¶</a></p>

        When a client needs to reclaim a delegation and there is no associated
        open, the client may use the CLAIM_PREVIOUS variant of the
        WANT_DELEGATION operation.  However, since the server is not required
        to support this operation, an alternative is to reclaim via a dummy OPEN 
        together with the delegation
        using an OPEN of type CLAIM_PREVIOUS.  The dummy open file can 
        be released using a CLOSE to re-establish the original state to be
        reclaimed, a delegation without an associated open.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2.1-9">¶</a></p>

        When a client has more than a single open associated with a delegation,

        establish opens associated with reclaimed delegations, the

        When a network partition occurs, delegations are subject to freeing by
        the server when the lease renewal period expires.  This is similar to
        the behavior for locks and share reservations.  For delegations,
        however, the server may extend the period in which conflicting
        requests are held off.  Eventually, the occurrence of a conflicting
        request from another client will cause revocation of the delegation.
        A loss of the backchannel (e.g., by later network configuration
        change) will have the same effect.  A recall request will fail and
        revocation of the delegation will result.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.2.1-11">¶</a></p>

            First, cached data present on a client must be revalidated after doing
            an OPEN. Revalidating means that the client fetches the change
            attribute from the server, compares it with the cached change
            attribute, and if different, declares the cached data (as well as the
            cached attributes) as invalid.  This is to ensure that the data for
            the OPENed file is still correctly reflected in the client's cache.
            This validation must be done at least when the client's OPEN operation
            includes a deny of OPEN4_SHARE_DENY_WRITE or
            OPEN4_SHARE_DENY_BOTH, thus terminating a period in which

            OPENs specifying a deny mode of OPEN4_SHARE_DENY_NONE) to parallel the NFSv3 protocol's
            practice for the benefit of users assuming this degree of cache

            Since the change attribute is updated for data and metadata

            metadata changes do not spuriously invalidate clean data.  The
            implementor is cautioned in  this approach. The change attribute is
            guaranteed to change for each update to the file, whereas time_modify
            is guaranteed to change only at the granularity of the time_delta
            attribute. Use by the client's data cache validation logic of
            time_modify and not change runs the risk of the client incorrectly

        For those applications that choose to use byte-range locking instead of
        share reservations to exclude inconsistent file access, there is an
        analogous set of constraints that apply to client-side data caching.
        These rules are effective only if the byte-range locking is used in a way
        that matches in an equivalent way the actual READ and WRITE operations
        executed.  This is as opposed to byte-range locking that is based on pure
        convention.  For example, it is possible to manipulate a two-megabyte
        file by dividing the file into two one-megabyte ranges and protecting
        access to the two byte-ranges by byte-range locks on bytes zero and one.  A WRITE_LT lock on
        byte zero of the file would represent the right to perform
        READ and WRITE operations on the first byte-range.  A WRITE_LT lock on
        byte one of the file would represent the right to perform READ and WRITE
        operations on the second byte-range.  As long as all applications
        manipulating the file obey this convention, they will work on a local
        file system.  However, they may not work with the NFSv4.1
        protocol unless clients refrain from data caching.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.3.2-1">¶</a></p>

<ul class="normal">

            First, when a client obtains a byte-range lock for a particular byte-range, the
            data cache corresponding to that byte-range (if any cache data exists)
            must be revalidated.  If the change attribute indicates that the file
            may have been updated since the cached data was obtained, the client
            must flush or invalidate the cached data for the newly locked byte-range.
            A client might choose to invalidate all of the non-modified cached data
            that it has for the file, but the only requirement for correct
            operation is to invalidate all of the data in the newly locked byte-range.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.3.2-3.1">¶</a>

<p id="section-10.3.2-4">
        Note that flushing data to the server and the invalidation of cached
        data must reflect the actual byte-ranges locked or unlocked.  Rounding
        these up or down to reflect client cache block boundaries will cause
        problems if not carefully done.  For example, writing a modified block
        when only half of that block is within an area being unlocked may
        cause invalid modification to the byte-range outside the unlocked area.
        This, in turn, may be part of a byte-range locked by another client.
        Clients can avoid this situation by synchronously performing portions
        of WRITE operations that overlap that portion (initial or final) that
        is not a full block.  Similarly, invalidating a locked area that is
        not an integral number of full buffer blocks would require the client
        to read one or two partial blocks from the server if the revalidation
        procedure shows that the data that the client possesses may not be
        valid.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.3.2-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.3.2-5">
        The data that is written to the server as a prerequisite to the
        unlocking of a byte-range must be written, at the server, to stable
        storage.  The client may accomplish this either with synchronous
        writes or by following asynchronous writes with a COMMIT operation.
        This is required because retransmission of the modified data after a
        server restart might conflict with a lock held by another client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.3.2-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.3.2-6">
        A client implementation may choose to accommodate applications that
        use byte-range locking in non-standard ways (e.g., using a byte-range lock as a
        global semaphore) by flushing to the server more data upon a LOCKU
        than is covered by the locked range.  This may include modified data
        within files other than the one for which the unlocks are being done.
        In such cases, the client must not interfere with applications whose
        READs and WRITEs are being done only within the bounds of byte-range locks
        that the application holds.  For example, an application locks a
        single byte of a file and proceeds to write that single byte.  A
        client that chose to handle a LOCKU by flushing all modified data to
        the server could validly write that single byte in response to an
        unrelated LOCKU operation.  However, it would not be valid to write the entire
        block in which that single written byte was located since it includes
        an area that is not locked and might be locked by another client.
        Client implementations can avoid this problem by dividing files with
        modified data into those for which all modifications are done to areas
        covered by an appropriate byte-range lock and those for which there are
        modifications not covered by a byte-range lock.  Any writes done for the
        former class of files must not include areas not locked and thus not
        modified on the client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.3.2-6">¶</a></p>

        Client-side data caching needs to respect mandatory byte-range locking when
        it is in effect.  The presence of mandatory byte-range locking for a given
        file is indicated when the client gets back NFS4ERR_LOCKED from a READ
        or WRITE operation on a file for which it has an appropriate share reservation.  When
        mandatory locking is in effect for a file, the client must check for
        an appropriate byte-range lock for data being read or written.  If a byte-range lock
        exists for the range being read or written, the client may satisfy the
        request using the client's validated cache.  If an appropriate
        byte-range lock is not held for the range of the read or write, the read or write
        request must not be satisfied by the client's cache and the request
        must be sent to the server for processing.  When a read or write

        When clients cache data, the file data needs to be organized according
        to the file system object to which the data belongs.  For NFSv3
        clients, the typical practice has been to assume for the purpose of
        caching that distinct filehandles represent distinct file system
        objects.  The client then has the choice to organize and maintain the

        In the NFSv4.1 protocol, there is now the possibility to have
        significant deviations from a "one filehandle per object" model
        because a filehandle may be constructed on the basis of the object's
        pathname.  Therefore, clients need a reliable method to determine if
        two filehandles designate the same file system object.  If clients
        were simply to assume that all distinct filehandles denote distinct
        objects and proceed to do data caching on this basis, caching

        inconsistencies within the same client could occur, and this has not
        been present in previous versions of the NFS protocol.  Note that it

        An OPEN delegation allows much of the message overhead associated with
        the opening and closing files to be eliminated.  An open when an OPEN
        delegation is in effect does not require that a validation
        message be sent to the server.  The continued endurance of the
        "OPEN_DELEGATE_READ delegation" provides a guarantee that no OPEN
        for OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_WRITE/OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_BOTH, and thus
        no write, has occurred.  Similarly, when closing a file opened
        for OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_WRITE/OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_BOTH and if an OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation is in effect,
        the data written does not have to be written to the server until
        the OPEN delegation is recalled.  The continued endurance of
        the OPEN delegation provides a
        guarantee that no open, and thus no READ or WRITE, has been done by
        another client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.4.1-2">
        For the purposes of OPEN delegation, READs and WRITEs done without an
        OPEN are treated as the functional equivalents of a corresponding type
        of OPEN.  Although a client <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> use special stateids when 
        an open exists, delegation handling on the server can use the 
        client ID associated with the current session to determine if the
        operation has been done by the holder of the delegation (in which
        case, no recall is necessary) or by another client (in which case,
        the delegation must be recalled and I/O not proceed until the 
        delegation is returned or revoked).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.4.1-3">
        With delegations, a client is able to avoid writing data to the server
        when the CLOSE of a file is serviced.  The file close system call is
        the usual point at which the client is notified of a lack of stable
        storage for the modified file data generated by the application.  At
        the close, file data is written to the server and, through normal
        accounting, the server is able to determine if the available file system
        space for the data has been exceeded (i.e., the server returns
        NFS4ERR_NOSPC or NFS4ERR_DQUOT).  This accounting includes quotas.
        The introduction of delegations requires that an alternative method be
        in place for the same type of communication to occur between client
        and server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.4.1-4">
        In the delegation response, the server provides either the limit of
        the size of the file or the number of modified blocks and associated
        block size.  The server must ensure that the client will be able to
        write modified data to the server of a size equal to that provided in the
        original delegation.  The server must make this assurance for all
        outstanding delegations.  Therefore, the server must be careful in its
        management of available space for new or modified data, taking into
        account available file system space and any applicable quotas.  The
        server can recall delegations as a result of managing the available
        file system space.  The client should abide by the server's state
        space limits for delegations.  If the client exceeds the stated limits
        for the delegation, the server's behavior is undefined.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.1-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.4.1-5">
        Based on server conditions, quotas, or available file system space, the
        server may grant OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegations with very restrictive space
        limitations.  The limitations may be defined in a way that will always
        force modified data to be flushed to the server on close.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.1-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.4.1-6">
        With respect to authentication, flushing modified data to the server
        after a CLOSE has occurred may be problematic.  For example, the user
        of the application may have logged off the client, and unexpired
        authentication credentials may not be present.  In this case, the
        client may need to take special care to ensure that local unexpired
        credentials will in fact be available.  This may be accomplished by
        tracking the expiration time of credentials and flushing data well in
        advance of their expiration or by making private copies of credentials
        to assure their availability when needed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.1-6">¶</a></p>

          </h4>
<p id="section-10.4.3-1">
        The server needs to employ special handling for a GETATTR where the
        target is a file that has an OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation in effect.  The
        reason for this is that the client holding the OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation may
        have modified the data, and the server needs to reflect this change to
        the second client that submitted the GETATTR.  Therefore, the client
        holding the OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation needs to be interrogated.  The server
        will use the CB_GETATTR operation.  The only attributes that the
        server can reliably query via CB_GETATTR are size and change.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.4.3-2">
        Since CB_GETATTR is being used to satisfy another client's GETATTR
        request, the server only needs to know if the client holding the
        delegation has a modified version of the file.  If the client's copy
        of the delegated file is not modified (data or size), the server can
        satisfy the second client's GETATTR request from the attributes stored
        locally at the server.  If the file is modified, the server only needs
        to know about this modified state.  If the server determines that the
        file is currently modified, it will respond to the second client's
        GETATTR as if the file had been modified locally at the server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.4.3-3">
        Since the form of the change attribute is determined by the server and
        is opaque to the client, the client and server need to agree on a
        method of communicating the modified state of the file.  For the size
        attribute, the client will report its current view of the file size.
        For the change attribute, the handling is more involved.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.3-3">¶</a></p>

            When the client is queried via CB_GETATTR for the change attribute, it

            value d is returned for the change attribute value.  If this file is
            not currently modified, the client returns the value c for the change
            attribute.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.3-5.3">¶</a>

<p id="section-10.4.3-6">
        For simplicity of implementation, the client <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> for each CB_GETATTR
        return the same value d.  This is true even if, between successive
        CB_GETATTR operations, the client again modifies the file's data or
        metadata in its cache.  The client can return the same value because
        the only requirement is that the client be able to indicate to the
        server that the client holds modified data.  Therefore, the value of d
        may always be c + 1.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.4.3-6">¶</a></p>

        While the change attribute is opaque to the client in the sense that
        it has no idea what units of time, if any, the server is counting
        change with, it is not opaque in that the client has to treat it as an
        unsigned integer, and the server has to be able to see the results of
        the client's changes to that integer.  Therefore, the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span>
        encode the change attribute in network order when sending it to the
        client.  The client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> decode it from network order to its native
        order when receiving it, and the client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> encode it in network order
        when sending it to the server.  For this reason, change is defined as

            attribute values for time_metadata and time_modify.  A new value of

            (which would happen if the client holding the delegation fails to

        Whether a RENAME of a directory in the path leading to the file

        a file is open, the recall must be performed to determine whether the

        When a client receives a recall for an OPEN delegation, it needs

        which a WRITE_LT lock was released while the OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation was in
        effect.  However, because the OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation implies no other
        locking by other clients, a simpler implementation is to flush all
        modified data for the file (as described just above) if any WRITE_LT lock

        An implementation need not wait until delegation recall (or
        the decision to voluntarily return a delegation) to perform any of the above
        actions, if implementation considerations (e.g., resource availability
        constraints) make that desirable.  Generally, however, the fact that
        the actual OPEN state of the file may continue to change makes it not
        worthwhile to send information about opens and closes to the server,
        except as part of delegation return.  An exception is
        when the client has no more internal opens of the file. In this

        reduces resource utilization on the client
        and server.


Regardless of the client's choices on scheduling these
        actions, all must be performed before the delegation is returned,
        including (when applicable) the close that corresponds to the OPEN
        that resulted in the delegation.  These actions can be performed

        awareness could result in the client finding out long after the
        failure that its delegation has been revoked, and another client has
        modified the data for which the client had a delegation.  This is

      When locks and delegations are revoked, the assumptions upon which
      successful caching depends are no longer guaranteed.  For any locks or
      share reservations that have been revoked, the corresponding state-owner
      needs to be notified.  This notification includes applications with a
      file open that has a corresponding delegation that has been revoked.
      Cached data associated with the revocation must be removed from the
      client.  In the case of modified data existing in the client's cache,
      that data must be removed from the client without being written to
      the server.  As mentioned, the assumptions made by the client are no
      longer valid at the point when a lock or delegation has been revoked.
      For example, another client may have been granted a conflicting byte-range lock
      after the revocation of the byte-range lock at the first client.  Therefore, the
      data within the lock range may have been modified by the other client.
      Obviously, the first client is unable to guarantee to the application

      make such notification impossible because errors for certain

      that an invariant on which an application depends may be violated.

        Revocation recovery for an OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation poses the special
        issue of modified data in the client cache while the file is not open.
        In this situation, any client that does not flush modified data to
        the server on each close must ensure that the user receives
        appropriate notification of the failure as a result of the revocation.
        Since such situations may require human action to correct problems,
        notification schemes in which the appropriate user or administrator is

        the file system namespace to ease recovery.  Note that when the
        client can determine that the file has not been modified by any other
        client, or when the client has a complete cached copy of the file in
        question, such a saved copy of the client's view of the file may be of
        particular value for recovery.  In another case, recovery using a copy
        of the file based partially on the client's cached data and partially
        on the server's copy as modified by other clients will be anything but
        straightforward, so clients may avoid saving file contents in these

<p id="section-10.6-2">
      The attributes discussed in this section do not include named
      attributes.  Individual named attributes are analogous to files, and
      caching of the data for these needs to be handled just as data caching
      is for ordinary files.  Similarly, LOOKUP results from an OPENATTR
      directory (as well as the directory's contents) are to be cached on
      the same basis as any other pathnames.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.6-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.6-3">
      Clients may cache file attributes obtained from the server and use
      them to avoid subsequent GETATTR requests.  Such caching is write
      through in that modification to file attributes is always done by
      means of requests to the server and should not be done locally and
      should not be cached.  The exception to this are modifications to attributes that
      are intimately connected with data caching.  Therefore, extending a
      file by writing data to the local data cache is reflected immediately
      in the size as seen on the client without this change being
      immediately reflected on the server.  Normally, such changes are not
      propagated directly to the server, but when the modified data is
      flushed to the server, analogous attribute changes are made on the
      server.  When OPEN delegation is in effect, the modified attributes
      may be returned to the server in reaction to a CB_RECALL call.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.6-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.6-4">
      The result of local caching of attributes is that the attribute
      caches maintained on individual clients will not be coherent.

      The typical file system application programming interfaces do not

      multiple files at the same time.  The following rules provide an
      environment where the potential incoherencies mentioned above can be

          This is accomplished by following the modifying operation with a

      A client may validate its cached version of attributes for a file by

      change does not update time_access.  For example, POSIX file semantics
      do not update access time when a file is modified by the write system
      call <span>[<a class="xref" href="#write_atime">15</a>]</span>.  Therefore, the client that wants a current time_access value
      should fetch it with change during the attribute cache validation
      processing and update its cached time_access.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.6-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.6-9">
      The client may maintain a cache of modified attributes for those
      attributes intimately connected with data of modified regular files
      (size, time_modify, and change). Other than those three attributes,
      the client <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> maintain a cache of modified attributes. Instead,
      attribute changes are immediately sent to the server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.6-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.6-10">
      In some operating environments, the equivalent to time_access is
      expected to be implicitly updated by each read of the content of the
      file object.  If an NFS client is caching the content of a file
      object, whether it is a regular file, directory, or symbolic link, the
      client <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> update the time_access attribute (via SETATTR or a
      small READ or READDIR request) on the server with each read that is
      satisfied from cache.  The reason is that this can defeat the
      performance benefits of caching content, especially since an explicit
      SETATTR of time_access may alter the change attribute on the server.
      If the change attribute changes, clients that are caching the content
      will think the content has changed, and will re-read unmodified data
      from the server.  Nor is the client encouraged to maintain a modified
      version of time_access in its cache, since the client either would
      eventually have to write the access time to the server
      with bad performance effects or never update the
      server's time_access, thereby resulting in a situation where an
      application that caches access time between a close and open of
      the same file observes the access time oscillating between the past and
      present.  The time_access attribute always means the time of last
      access to a file by a read that was satisfied by the server. This way
      clients will tend to see only time_access changes that go forward in
      time.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.6-10">¶</a></p>

      block that has not been loaded into the address space, a page fault
      occurs and the file is read (or if the block does not exist in the

      change) will be updated.  However, in many operating environments,
      when page faults are not required, these attributes will not be updated

        The results of LOOKUP and READDIR operations may be cached to avoid
        the cost of subsequent LOOKUP operations.  Just as in the case of
        attribute caching, inconsistencies may arise among the various client
        caches.  To mitigate the effects of these inconsistencies and given
        the context of typical file system APIs, an upper time boundary is
        maintained for how long a client name cache entry can be kept without
        verifying that the entry has not been made invalid by a directory
        change operation performed by another client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.8.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.8.1-2">
        When a client is not making changes to a directory for which there
        exist name cache entries, the client needs to periodically fetch
        attributes for that directory to ensure that it is not being modified.
        After determining that no modification has occurred, the expiration
        time for the associated name cache entries may be updated to be the
        current time plus the name cache staleness bound.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.8.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.8.1-3">
        When a client is making changes to a given directory, it needs to
        determine whether there have been changes made to the directory by
        other clients.  It does this by using the change attribute as reported
        before and after the directory operation in the associated
        change_info4 value returned for the operation.  The server is able to
        communicate to the client whether the change_info4 data is provided
        atomically with respect to the directory operation.  If the change
        values are provided atomically, the client has a basis for determining,
        given proper care, whether other clients are modifying the directory
        in question.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.8.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.8.1-4">
        The simplest way to enable the client to make this determination is
        for the client to serialize all changes made to a specific directory.
        When this is done, and the server provides before and after values of the 
        change attribute atomically, the client can simply compare the 
        after value of the change attribute from one operation on a 
        directory with the before value on the subsequent operation
        modifying that directory.  When these are equal, the client is
        assured that no other client is modifying the directory in question.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.8.1-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.8.1-5">
        When such serialization is not used, and there may be multiple 
        simultaneous outstanding operations modifying a single directory sent 
        from a single client, making this sort of determination can be more 
        complicated.  If two such operations
        complete in a different order than they were actually performed,
        that might give an appearance consistent with modification being 
        made by another client.  Where this appears to happen, the client
        needs to await the completion of all such modifications that were
        started previously, to see if the outstanding before and after
        change numbers can be sorted into a chain such that the before
        value of one change number matches the after value of a previous
        one, in a chain consistent with this client being the only one
        modifying the directory.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.8.1-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.8.1-6">
        In either of these cases, the client is able to determine whether
        the directory is being modified by another client.
        If the comparison indicates that the directory was updated by
        another client, the name cache associated with the modified directory
        is purged from the client.  If the comparison indicates no
        modification, the name cache can be updated on the client to reflect
        the directory operation and the associated timeout can be extended.  The
        post-operation change value needs to be saved as the basis for future
        change_info4 comparisons.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.8.1-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.8.1-7">
        As demonstrated by the scenario above, name caching requires that the
        client revalidate name cache data by inspecting the change attribute
        of a directory at the point when the name cache item was cached.  This
        requires that the server update the change attribute for directories
        when the contents of the corresponding directory is modified.  For a
        client to use the change_info4 information appropriately and
        correctly, the server must report the pre- and post-operation change
        attribute values atomically.  When the server is unable to report the
        before and after values atomically with respect to the directory
        operation, the server must indicate that fact in the change_info4
        return value.  When the information is not atomically reported, the

        Directory caching for the NFSv4.1 protocol, as previously
        described, is similar to file 
        caching in previous versions.  Clients typically cache 
        directory information for
        a duration determined by the client. At the end of a predefined
        timeout, the client will query the server to see if the directory has
        been updated. By caching attributes, clients reduce the number of
        GETATTR calls made to the server to validate attributes. Furthermore,
        frequently accessed files and directories, such as the current
        working directory, have their attributes cached on the client so that
        some NFS operations can be performed without having to make an RPC
        call. By caching name and inode information about most recently
        looked up entries in a Directory Name Lookup Cache (DNLC), clients do
        not need to send LOOKUP calls to the server every time these files
        are accessed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.9.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.9.1-2">
        This caching approach works reasonably well at reducing network
        traffic in many environments. However, it does not address
        environments where there are numerous queries for files that do not
        exist. In these cases of "misses", the client sends requests to
        the server in order to provide reasonable application semantics and
        promptly detect the creation of new directory entries. Examples of
        high miss activity are compilation in software development
        environments. The current behavior of NFS limits its potential
        scalability and wide-area sharing effectiveness in these types of
        environments. Other distributed stateful file system architectures
        such as AFS and DFS have proven that adding state around directory
        contents can greatly reduce network traffic in high-miss
        environments.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.9.1-2">¶</a></p>

        changes, the client can avoid making frequent requests to interrogate
        the contents of slowly-changing directories, reducing network traffic
        and improving client performance.  It can also simplify the task of
        determining whether other clients are making changes to the directory
        when the client itself is making many changes to the directory and
        changes are not serialized.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.9.1-3">¶</a></p>

        Directory delegations allow improved namespace cache consistency to be

        NFSv4.1 introduces the GET_DIR_DELEGATION 
        (<a class="xref" href="#OP_GET_DIR_DELEGATION">Section 18.39</a>) operation to allow the 
        client to ask for a
        directory delegation. The delegation covers directory attributes and
        all entries in the directory. If either of these change, the
        delegation will be recalled synchronously. The operation causing the
        recall will have to wait before the recall is complete. Any changes
        to directory entry attributes will not cause the delegation to be
        recalled.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.9.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.9.2-2">
        In addition to asking for delegations, a client can also ask for
        notifications for certain events. These events include changes to
        the directory's attributes and/or its contents.  If a client asks for
        notification for a certain event, the server will notify the client
        when that event occurs. This will not result in the delegation being
        recalled for that client.  The notifications are asynchronous and
        provide a way of avoiding recalls in situations where a directory is
        changing enough that the pure recall model may not be effective while
        trying to allow the client to get substantial benefit. In the absence
        of notifications, once the delegation is recalled the client has to
        refresh its directory cache; this might not be very efficient for
        very large directories.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-10.9.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-10.9.2-3">
        The delegation is read-only and the client may not make changes to
        the directory other than by performing NFSv4.1 operations that modify
        the directory or the associated file attributes so that the server
        has knowledge of these changes. In order to keep the client's
        namespace synchronized with that of the server, the server will notify
        the delegation-holding client (assuming it has requested
        notifications) of the changes made as a result of that client's
        directory-modifying operations.  This is to avoid any need for
        that client to send subsequent GETATTR or READDIR operations
        to the server.  If a single client is holding the delegation
        and that client makes any changes to the directory (i.e., the
        changes are made via operations sent on a session
        associated with the client ID holding the delegation), the
        delegation will not be recalled. Multiple clients may hold a delegation
        on the same directory, but if any such client modifies the directory,
        the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> recall the delegation from the other clients,

        Delegations can be recalled by the server at any time.  Normally, the
        server will recall the delegation when the directory changes in a way
        that is not covered by the notification, or when the directory
        changes and notifications have not been requested.
        If another client removes the directory for

      NFSv4.1 contains attributes that provide information

      in the namespace of one server can be
      associated with one or more instances of that
      file system on other servers.  These attributes contain file
      system location
      entries specifying a server address
      target (either as a DNS name representing one or more IP

<p id="section-11.3-1">
      A given location in an NFSv4.1 namespace (typically but not necessarily
      a multi-server namespace) can have a number of file system instance 
      locations
      associated with it (via the fs_locations or fs_locations_info
      attribute).  There may also be an actual current file system at 
      that location, accessible via normal namespace operations (e.g.,
      LOOKUP).  In this case, the file system is said to be 
      "present" at that position in the namespace, and clients will 
      typically use it, reserving use of additional locations 
      specified via the location-related attributes to situations in
      which the principal location is no longer available.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.3-2">
      When there is no actual file system at the namespace location
      in question, the file system is said to be "absent".  An absent
      file system contains no files or directories other than the
      root.  Any reference to it, except 
      to access a small set of attributes useful in determining
      alternate locations, will result in an error, NFS4ERR_MOVED.
      Note that if the server ever returns the error NFS4ERR_MOVED,
      it <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> support the fs_locations 
      attribute and <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> support the fs_locations_info and fs_status
      attributes.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.3-3">
      While the error name suggests that we have a case of a file system
      that once was present, and has only become absent later, this is 
      only one possibility.  A position in the namespace may be permanently
      absent with the set of file system(s) designated by the location 
      attributes being the only realization.  
      The name NFS4ERR_MOVED reflects an earlier,
      more limited conception of its function, but this error will be
      returned whenever the referenced file system is absent, whether it
      has moved or not.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.3-4">
      Except in the case of GETATTR-type operations (to be discussed 
      later), when the 
      current filehandle at the start of an operation is within an 
      absent file system, that operation is not performed and the error
      NFS4ERR_MOVED is returned, to indicate that the file system is
      absent on the current server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.3-5">
      Because a GETFH cannot succeed if the current filehandle is
      within an absent file system, filehandles within an absent
      file system cannot be transferred to the client.  When a 
      client does have filehandles within an absent file system, it
      is the result of obtaining them when the file system was
      present, and having the file system become 
      absent subsequently.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.3-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.3-6">
      It should be noted that because the check for the current
      filehandle being within an absent file system happens at the
      start of every operation, operations that change the current
      filehandle so that it is within an absent file system will not
      result in an error.  This allows such combinations as 
      PUTFH-GETATTR and LOOKUP-GETATTR to be used to get attribute

        Trunking is the use of multiple connections between a client and
        server in order to increase the speed of data transfer.
        A client may determine the set of network addresses to use to

   The client may fetch the file system location attribute for the
   file system. This will 
   provide either the name of the server (which can be turned
   into a set of network addresses using DNS) or  
   a set of server-trunkable location entries.  Using the latter
   alternative, the server can
   provide addresses it regards as desirable to use
   to access the file system in question.  Although these entries can
   contain port numbers, these port numbers are not used in determining
   trunking relationships.  Once the candidate addresses have been
   determined and EXCHANGE_ID done to the proper server, only the value
   of the so_major_id field returned by the servers in question determines
   whether a trunking relationship actually exists.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.5.2-2.2">¶</a>

<p id="section-11.5.2-3">
         When the client fetches a location attribute 
         for a file system, it should be noted that the client may encounter multiple entries for a number of 
         reasons, such that when it determines trunking information, it may

<p id="section-11.5.3-1">
 Because of the need to support multiple types of connections,
 clients face
 the issue of determining the proper connection type to use
 when establishing
 a connection to a given server network address.  In some cases,
 this issue can be addressed through the use of the connection
 "step-up" facility described in 
 <a class="xref" href="#OP_CREATE_SESSION">Section 18.36</a>.  However,
 because there are cases in which that facility is not available,
 the client may have to choose a connection type with no
 possibility of changing it within the scope of a single connection.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.5.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.5.3-2">
 The two file system location attributes differ as to the
 information made available in this regard. The fs_locations attribute provides no information
 to support connection type selection.  As a result, clients
 supporting multiple connection types would need to attempt to
 establish connections using multiple connection types until
 the one preferred by the client is successfully established.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.5.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.5.3-3">
   The fs_locations_info attribute includes the FSLI4TF_RDMA flag,
   which is convenient for a client wishing to use RDMA. When this 
   flag is set, it indicates that RPC-over-RDMA support is available 
   using the specified location entry. A client can establish a TCP 
   connection and then convert that connection to use RDMA by using 
   the step-up facility.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.5.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.5.3-4">
 Irrespective of the particular attribute used, when there is
 no indication that a step-up operation can be performed,
 a client supporting RDMA operation can establish a new RDMA
 connection, and it can be bound to
 the session already established by the
 TCP connection, allowing the TCP connection to be dropped
 and the session converted to further use in RDMA mode, if
 the server supports that.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.5.3-4">¶</a></p>

        of or in addition to 
        the current file system instance.  On first access to a
        file system, the client should obtain the set

        The alternate locations may be physical replicas of the
        (typically read-only) file system data supplemented by
 possible asynchronous propagation of updates.  Alternatively,
 they may provide for the use of various forms of server
        clustering in which multiple servers provide alternate 
        ways of accessing the same physical file system.  How the
        difference between replicas affects file system transitions
 can be represented within the fs_locations and fs_locations_info

<p id="section-11.5.4-4">
 Although the location attributes provide some information about
 the nature of the inter-replica transition, many aspects of the
 semantics of possible asynchronous updates are not currently described
 by the protocol, which makes it necessary for clients using replication
 to switch among replicas undergoing change to familiarize themselves
 with the semantics of the update approach used. 
   Due to this lack of specificity, many applications may find the 
   use of migration more appropriate because a server can propagate
   all updates made before an established point in time to the new 
   replica as part of the migration event.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.5.4-4">¶</a></p>

        In most instances, servers will choose to migrate all clients using
 a particular file system to a successor replica at the same time
 to avoid cases in which different clients are updating different
 replicas.  However, migration of an individual client can be helpful
 in providing load balancing, as long as the replicas in question
 are such that they represent the same data as described in

        choice left to the server implementer.  The NFSv4.1 protocol

        In the case of various forms of server clustering, the new location

        responsibilities in dealing with this transition will depend
        on whether a switch between replicas has occurred and
 the means the server has chosen to provide continuity of locking state.

        Although a single successor location is typical, multiple 
        locations may be provided.  When multiple locations are 
        provided, the client will typically use the first one provided.
 If that is inaccessible for some reason, later ones can be used.  In such
        cases, the client might consider the transition to the new
        replica to be a migration event, even though some of the servers
 involved might not be aware of the use of the server that was
 inaccessible.  In such a case, a client might lose access to 
        locking state as a result of the access transfer.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.5.5-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.5.5-10">
        When an alternate location is designated as the target for
        migration, it must designate the same data

        fs_locations_info attribute).  Where file systems are writable,
        a change made on the original file system must be visible on
        all migration targets. Where a file system is not writable
        but represents a read-only copy (possibly periodically 
        updated) of
        a writable file system, similar requirements apply to the 
        propagation of updates.  Any change visible in the original
        file system must already be effected on all migration targets,

        a position in the current namespace, that it is part of a new 
        file system and that the file system is absent.  When this 
        occurs, typically upon receiving the error NFS4ERR_MOVED, the
        actual location or locations of the file system can be 
        determined by fetching a locations attribute.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.5.6-2">¶</a></p>

        The file system location attribute may designate a single

        be selected based on the needs of the client.  The server,
        in the fs_locations_info attribute, may specify priorities to 
        be associated with various file system location choices.
        The server may assign different priorities to different
        locations as reported to individual clients, in order to
        adapt to client physical location or to effect load balancing.
        When both read-only and read-write file systems are present,
        some of the read-only locations might not be absolutely up-to-date
        (as they would have to be in the case of replication and
        migration).  Servers may also specify file system locations
        that include client-substituted variables so that different
        clients are referred to different file systems (with different
        data contents) based on client attributes such as CPU

      additional writable
        replicas to which it subsequently might switch.  Note that,
        as distinguished from the case of replication, there is no

        </h3>
<p id="section-11.8-1">
      When clients make use of servers that implement referrals,
      replication, and
      migration, care should be taken that a user who mounts a given
      file system that includes a referral or a relocated file system
      continues to see a coherent picture of that user-side file system
      despite the fact that it contains a number of server-side
      file systems that may be on different servers.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.8-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.8-2">
      One important issue is upward navigation from the root of a
      server-side file system to its parent (specified as ".." in UNIX),
      in the case in which it transitions to that file system as a
      result of referral, migration, or a transition as a result of
      replication.  When the client is at such a point, and it needs to ascend to
      the parent, it must go back to the parent as seen within the
      multi-server namespace rather than sending a LOOKUPP operation to the
      server, which would result in the parent within that server's
      single-server namespace.  In order to do this, the client
      needs to remember the filehandles that represent such
      file system roots and use these instead of sending a 
      LOOKUPP operation to the current server.  This will allow the client
      to present to applications a consistent namespace, where 
      upward navigation and downward navigation are consistent.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.8-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.8-3">
      Another issue concerns refresh of referral locations.  When
      referrals are used extensively, they may change as server
      configurations change.  It is expected that clients will cache
      information related to traversing referrals so that future
      client-side requests are resolved locally without server
      communication.
      This is usually rooted in client-side name look up caching. Clients
      should periodically purge this data for referral points in order to
      detect changes in location information.  When the change_policy
      attribute changes for directories that hold referral entries 
      or for the referral entries themselves, clients should consider 
      any associated
      cached referral information to be out of date.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.8-3">¶</a></p>

      used to continue access, with a continuity of lock state.   In
      many cases, the same sessions can also be used.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.10-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.10-2">
      The appropriate action depends on the set of replacement addresses

        currently in use that is server-trunkable with it, requests
        that would have been issued on the address whose use is to be
 discontinued can be issued on the remaining address(es).  When an
 address is server-trunkable but not session-trunkable with the
 address whose use is to be discontinued, the request might need

 that address is
 still indicated as accessible according to the appropriate
 file system location
 entries, it is likely that requests can be issued on a new
 connection of a different connection type once that connection
 is established. 
   Since any two non-port-specific server endpoints that share a 
   network address are inherently session-trunkable, the client 
   can use BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION to access the existing session

        to access the existing session using the new address.  Although
        the target session will generally be accessible, there may be
        rare situations in which that session is no longer accessible
 when an attempt is made to bind the new connection to it. In this
        case, the client can create a new session to enable continued
        access to the existing instance using the new connection,
 providing for the use of existing filehandles, stateids, and 
        client ids while supplying continuity of locking state.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.10-3.3">¶</a>

        used to provide continued access.  Although the use of CREATE_SESSION

        servers have the option of providing continued access to the

      across the transition depends on the occasion prompting the 
      transition, with transitions initiated by the servers 
      (i.e., migration) offering much more scope for a nondisruptive
      transition than cases in which the client on its own
      shifts its access to another replica (i.e., replication).

        The fs_locations_info attribute (described in
 <a class="xref" href="#SEC11-li-new">Section 11.17</a>) 
 may indicate that two replicas
        may be used simultaneously, although some situations in which such
 simultaneous access is permitted are more appropriately described
 as instances of trunking (see <a class="xref" href="#SEC11-USES-repl-trunk">Section 11.5.4.1</a>).
 Although situations
        in which multiple replicas may be accessed simultaneously are
        somewhat similar to those in which a single replica is
        accessed by multiple network addresses, there are important
        differences since locking state is not shared among multiple

         Because of this difference in state handling, many clients will 
         not have the ability to take advantage of the fact that such 
         replicas represent the same data.  Such clients will not be
         prepared to use multiple replicas simultaneously but will access
         each file system using only a single replica, although the
         replica selected might make multiple server-trunkable addresses

        Clients who are prepared to use multiple replicas simultaneously

<p id="section-11.11.3-1">
        In NFSv4.0, the issue of continuity of fileids in the event
        of a file system transition was not addressed.  The general 
        expectation had been that in situations in
        which the two file system instances are created by a single vendor
        using some sort of file system image copy, fileids would be
        consistent across the transition, while in the analogous 
        multi-vendor transitions they would not.  This poses difficulties, 
        especially for the client without special knowledge  
        of the transition mechanisms adopted by the server.  Note
        that although fileid is not a <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> attribute, many servers
        support fileids and many clients provide APIs that depend on fileids.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.11.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.11.3-2">
        It is important to note that while clients themselves may have no
        trouble with a fileid changing as a result of a file system
        transition event, applications do typically have access to the
        fileid (e.g., via stat).  The result is that an
        application may work perfectly well if there is no file system
        instance transition or if any such transition is among instances
        created by a single vendor, yet be unable to deal with the
        situation in which a multi-vendor transition occurs at the wrong
        time.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.11.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.11.3-3">
        Providing the same fileids in a multi-vendor (multiple server
        vendors) environment has generally been held to be quite difficult.
        While there is work to be done, it needs to be pointed out that
        this difficulty is partly self-imposed.  Servers have typically
        identified fileid with inode number, i.e. with a quantity used to
        find the file in question.  This identification poses special
        difficulties for migration of a file system between vendors
        where assigning
        the same index to a given file may not be possible.  Note here that
        a fileid is not required to be useful to find the file in
        question, only that it is unique within the given file system.  Servers
        prepared to accept a fileid as a single piece of metadata and store
        it apart from the value used to index the file information can
        relatively easily maintain a fileid value across a migration event,
        allowing a truly transparent migration event.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.11.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.11.3-4">
        In any case, where servers can provide continuity of fileids, they
        should, and the client should be able to find out that such
        continuity is available and take appropriate action.  Information
        about the continuity (or lack thereof) of fileids across a file
        system transition is represented by specifying whether the file systems 
        in question are of the same fileid class.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.11.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.11.3-5">
        Note that when consistent fileids do not exist across a 
        transition (either because there is no continuity of fileids
        or because fileid is not a supported attribute on one of 
        instances involved), and there are
        no reliable filehandles across a transition event (either because
        there is no filehandle continuity or because the filehandles are
        volatile), the client is in a position where it cannot verify
        that files it was accessing before the transition are the 
        same objects.  It is forced to assume that no object has been 
        renamed, and, unless there are guarantees that provide this
        (e.g., the file system is read-only), problems for applications
        may occur.  Therefore, use of such configurations should be 
        limited to situations where the problems that this may cause
        can be tolerated.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.11.3-5">¶</a></p>

        between the data of one and the data of another is not, as a 
        general matter, specified by the NFSv4.1 protocol.  It is quite 
        possible to present as replicas file systems where the data of

        another, only those that are up-to-date would be considered replicas.

          data. Where file systems are writable, a change made on
          one instance must be visible on all instances at the same
   time, regardless of whether the interrogated instance is the
   one on which the modification was done.

          in order to avoid any possibility that a client, in effecting a transition to a
          replica, will see any reversion in file system state.  
          The specific means of this guarantee varies based on the value of
          the fss_type field that is reported as part of the fs_status attribute 
          (see <a class="xref" href="#fs_status">Section 11.18</a>).  
          Since these file systems are presumed to be unsuitable for simultaneous use, 
          there is no specification of how locking is handled; in general, locks obtained on one file
          system will be separate from those on others.  
          Since these are expected to be read-only file systems, 
          this is not likely to pose an issue for clients or applications.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.11.8-2.3">¶</a>

      When none of these special situations applies, there is no basis
      within the protocol for the client to make assumptions about the
      contents of a replica file system or its relationship to previous
      file system instances.  Thus, switching between nominally
      identical read-write file systems would not be possible because either the
      client does not use the fs_locations_info attribute, or the server does not support it.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.11.8-3">¶</a></p>

 to obtain new locks that contrast with existing locks

          For simplicity, the client may choose to reference

      For a client to respond to an access transition, it must become 
      aware of it.  The ways in which this can happen are discussed
      in <a class="xref" href="#V41c-clrecov">Section 11.13.1</a>, which discusses indications
      that a specific file system access path has transitioned as well as
      situations in which additional activity is necessary to 
      determine the set of file systems that have been migrated.  
      <a class="xref" href="#V41c-migrdisc">Section 11.13.2</a> goes on to complete the discussion
      of how the set of migrated file systems might be determined.

        When there is a change in the network access
 path that a client is to use to access a file system, there 
        are a number of related status indications with which clients 
        need to deal:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-1">¶</a></p>

          within a file system that is no longer accessible at the 
          address previously used to access it, the
          error NFS4ERR_MOVED is returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-2.1.1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.13.1-2.1.2">
          Exceptions are made to allow such filehandles to be used
          when interrogating a file system location attribute.
   This enables a client to determine
          a new replica's location or a new network access path.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-2.1.2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.13.1-2.1.3">
          This condition continues on subsequent attempts to access
          the file system in question.  The only way the client 
          can avoid the error is to cease accessing the file system in 
          question at its old server location and access it instead
          using a different address at which it is now available.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-2.1.3">¶</a></p>

Whenever a client sends a SEQUENCE operation to a server that
generated state held on that client and associated with a
file system no longer accessible on that server, the response will contain 
the status bit SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED, indicating that there has 
been a lease migration.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-2.2.1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.13.1-2.2.2">
          This condition continues until the client acknowledges
          the notification by fetching a file system location attribute for the
          file system whose network access path is being changed.
   When there are multiple such file systems, a location attribute
          for each such file system needs to be fetched. The location
   attribute for all migrated file systems needs to be fetched
   in order to clear the condition.  Even after the condition is cleared, the
          client needs to respond by using the location information
          to access the file system at its new location
          to ensure that leases are not needlessly expired.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-2.2.2">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-11.13.1-3">
        Unlike NFSv4.0, in which the corresponding
        conditions are both errors and thus mutually exclusive, 
        in NFSv4.1 the client can, 
        and often will, receive both indications on the same
        request.  As a result, implementations need to address the 
        question of how to coordinate
        the necessary recovery actions when both indications
        arrive in the response to the same request.  It should be noted
 that when processing an NFSv4 COMPOUND, the server
 will normally decide
 whether SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED is to be set before
        it determines which file system will be referenced or whether
        NFS4ERR_MOVED is to be returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.13.1-4">
        Since these indications are not mutually exclusive in NFSv4.1, 
        the following combinations are possible results when a COMPOUND
        is issued:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-4">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-11.13.1-5.1.2">
          In this case, transition recovery is required.  While it is
          possible that migration discovery is needed in addition, it
          is likely that only the accessed file system has transitioned.
          In any case, because addressing NFS4ERR_MOVED is necessary to 
          allow the rejected requests to be processed on the target,
          dealing with it will typically have priority over 
          migration discovery.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-5.1.2">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-11.13.1-5.2.2">
          In this case, transition recovery is also required. It is 
          clear that migration discovery is not needed to find
          file systems that have been migrated other than the one
          returning NFS4ERR_MOVED.  Cases in which this
          result can arise include a referral or a migration for which
          there is no associated locking state.  This can also arise in
          cases in which an access path transition
          other than migration occurs within the same server.  In such a 
          case, there is no need to set SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED, since 
          the lease remains associated with the current server even though 
          the access path has changed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-5.2.2">¶</a></p>

          In this case, no transition recovery activity is required on

          lease expiration, migration discovery needs to be done.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-5.3.2">¶</a></p>

        Note that the specified actions only need to be taken if they are
        not already going on.  For example, when NFS4ERR_MOVED is received
 while accessing a file system for which transition recovery is already occurring, the client
 merely waits for that recovery to be completed, while the receipt of
 the SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED indication only
        needs to initiate migration discovery for a server if such
 discovery is not already underway for that server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-6">¶</a></p>

        The fact that a lease-migrated condition does not result in
        an error in NFSv4.1 has a number of important consequences.
        In addition to the fact that the two 
        indications are not mutually exclusive, as discussed above, there are number of
        issues that are important in considering implementation of
        migration discovery, as discussed in 
        <a class="xref" href="#V41c-migrdisc">Section 11.13.2</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.1-7">¶</a></p>

        Because SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED is not an error condition, it is possible
 for file systems whose access paths have not changed to be
 successfully accessed on a given server even though recovery
        is necessary for other file systems on the same server.  As

        Migration discovery can be performed in the same context as
        transition recovery, allowing recovery for each migrated file 
        system to be invoked as it is discovered.  Alternatively, it may
        be done in a separate migration discovery thread, allowing
        migration discovery to be done in parallel with

        In either case, because the lease-migrated indication

        server can proceed normally, with the possibility that further 
        such indications will be received, raising the issue of how

        This leaves a potential difficulty in situations in which the
        migration discovery process is near to completion but is still
        operating.  One should not ignore a SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED indication if 
        the migration discovery process is not able to respond to 
        the discovery of additional migrating file 
        systems without additional aid.  A further complexity relevant in
        addressing such situations is that a lease-migrated indication may
        reflect the server's state at the time the SEQUENCE operation
        was processed, which may be different from that in effect at the
        time the response is received.  Because new migration events
 may occur at any time, and because a SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED indication may reflect
 the situation in effect a considerable time before the indication
 is received, special care needs to be taken to ensure that SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED
 indications are not inappropriately ignored.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.2-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.13.2-5">
        A useful approach to this issue involves the use of separate 
        externally-visible migration discovery states for each server.

        the migration discovery process for a server:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.2-5">¶</a></p>

   is a migrated one (i.e., fss_absent is true, and
   fss_type != STATUS4_REFERRAL), then a migrated file system has
   been found.  In this situation, it is likely

 It should be noted that the process described above is not
 guaranteed to terminate, as a long series of new migration
 events might continually delay the clearing of the SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED

 to use the discovery of migrations to effect lease
 renewal immediately, rather than waiting for the clearing of the

        Lease discovery needs to be provided as described above. This
 ensures that the client discovers file system migrations soon
 enough to renew its leases on each destination server before they
 expire.   Non-renewal of leases can lead to loss of locking state.
 While the consequences of such
 loss can be ameliorated through implementations of courtesy locks,
 servers are under no obligation to do so, and a conflicting lock request
 may mean that a lock is revoked unexpectedly.  Clients should be aware

 Once the client ID has been obtained, it is necessary to

 new server.
        In any of the cases in which Transparent State Migration 
        has occurred, it is possible that a session was transferred
        as well.  To deal with that possibility, clients can, after
        doing the EXCHANGE_ID, issue a BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION to 
        connect the transferred session to a connection to the new
        server.  If that fails,  it is an indication that the session

        may have already had a set of existing sessions, with it
        being possible that the session ID of a given session is the
        same as one that might have been migrated.  In that event,
        a BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION might succeed, even though there
        could have been no migration of the session with that session ID.
 In such cases, the client will receive sequence errors when the
 slot sequence values used are not appropriate on the new

        Once the client has determined the initial migration status,

        needs to re-establish its locking state, if possible.  To enable
        this to happen without loss of the guarantees normally provided by
        locking, the destination server needs to implement a per-fs grace
        period in all cases in which lock state was lost, including
        those in which Transparent State Migration was not
        implemented.  Each client for which there was a transfer of locking
 state to the new server will have the duration of the grace period
 to reclaim its locks, from the time its locks were transferred.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.13.4-5">¶</a></p>

          To determine whether this has happened, the client can use 
          TEST_STATEID to check whether the stateids created on the
          source server are still accessible on the destination server.
          Once a single stateid is found to have been successfully

 In this case, the destination server needs no knowledge of
 the locks held
 on the source server.  It relies on the clients to accurately report
 (via reclaim operations) the locks previously held, and does not allow
 new locks to be granted on migrated file systems until the grace
 period expires.   Disallowing of new locks applies to
 all clients accessing these file systems, while grace period
 expiration occurs for each migrated client independently.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.14.1-1">¶</a></p>

 During this grace period, clients have the opportunity to use

 have the option of subjecting these requests to verification.

 A further server responsibility concerns locks that are revoked
 or otherwise lost during the process of file system migration.
 Because locks that appear to be lost during the process of
 migration will be reclaimed by the client, the servers have to
 take steps to ensure that locks revoked soon before or soon
 after migration are not inadvertently allowed to be reclaimed
 in situations in which the continuity of lock possession
 cannot be assured.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.14.2-4">¶</a></p>

        When sessions are transferred, there are a number of issues that
        pose challenges in terms of making the transferred state
 unmodifiable during the period it is gathered up and
 transferred to the destination server:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.14.3-3">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-11.14.3-4.1">

<p id="section-11.14.3-7">
 It should be noted that the history of any particular slot is likely
 to include a number of these request classes.  In the case in which
 a session that is migrated is used by file systems other than the
 one migrated, requests of class 5 may be common and may be the last
 request processed for many slots.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.14.3-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.14.3-8">
 Since session state can change even after the locking
 state has been fixed as part of the migration process,
 the session state known to the client could be different from that on
 the destination server, which necessarily reflects the session
 state on the source server at an earlier time.
        In deciding how to deal with this situation, it is helpful to 
        distinguish between two sorts of behavioral consequences of
        the choice of initial sequence ID values:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.14.3-8">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-11.14.3-9.1">
              <p id="section-11.14.3-9.1.1">
          The error NFS4ERR_SEQ_MISORDERED is returned when the sequence ID
          in a request is neither equal to the last one seen for the 
          current slot nor the next greater one.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.14.3-9.1.1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.14.3-9.1.2">
          In view of the difficulty of arriving at a mutually acceptable
          value for the correct last sequence value at the point of migration,
          it may be necessary for the server to show some degree of
          forbearance when the sequence ID is one that would be
          considered unacceptable if session migration were not 
          involved.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.14.3-9.1.2">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-11.14.3-9.2.2">
          In the cases in which an error is returned and there is no
          possibility of any non-idempotent operation having been executed,
          it may not be necessary to adhere to this as strictly as might
          be proper if session migration were not involved.  For example, 
          the fact that the error NFS4ERR_DELAY
          was returned may not assist the client in any material way, while
          the fact that NFS4ERR_MOVED was returned by the source server
          may not be relevant when the request was reissued and directed 
          to the destination server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.14.3-9.2.2">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-11.14.3-10">
        An important issue is that the specification needs to take note of
        all potential COMPOUNDs, even if they might be unlikely
        in practice.  For example, a COMPOUND is allowed to access 
        multiple file systems and might perform non-idempotent operations
        in some of them before accessing a file system being migrated.
        Also, a COMPOUND may return considerable data in the response 
        before being rejected with NFS4ERR_DELAY or NFS4ERR_MOVED, and may
        in addition be marked as sa_cachethis.  However, note that
 if the client and server adhere to rules in
 <a class="xref" href="#err_DELAY">Section 15.1.1.3</a>, there is no possibility of
 non-idempotent operations being spuriously reissued after receiving

        not obtain filehandles and attribute information (e.g., fsid) for
        the intermediate directories, so that it would not be sure where
        the absent file system starts.  It could be the case, for example,
        that /this/is/the is the root of the moved file system and that
        the reason that the look up of "path" succeeded is that the
        file system was not absent on that operation but was moved between the last
        LOOKUP and the GETFH (since COMPOUND is not atomic).  Even if we
        had the fsids for all of the intermediate directories, we could
        have no way of knowing that /this/is/the/path was the root of a
        new file system, since we don't yet have its fsid.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.15.1-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.15.1-6">
        In order to get the necessary information, let us re-send the
        chain of LOOKUPs with GETFHs and GETATTRs to at least get the
        fsids so we can be sure where the appropriate file system boundaries are.
        The client could choose to get fs_locations_info 
        at the same time but in
        most cases the client will have a good guess as to where file system
        boundaries are (because of where NFS4ERR_MOVED was, and was not,
        received) making fetching of fs_locations_info unnecessary.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.15.1-6">¶</a></p>

          We are getting the fsid to know where the file system boundaries are.
          In this operation, the fsid will be different than that of the
          parent directory (which in turn was retrieved in OP10).
          Note that the fsid we are given will not necessarily be preserved at the new
          location.  That fsid might be different, and in fact the fsid

          on (e.g., /this/is/the might be a non-pseudo file system
          separate from /this/is/the/path), so we need to have
          other reliable source information on the boundary of the file system
          that is moved.  If, for example, the file system /this/is
          had moved, we would have a case of migration rather than
          referral, and once the boundaries of the migrated file system

      The fs_location4 data type is used to represent the location of a
      file system by providing a server name and the path to the root 
      of the file system within that server's namespace.  
      When a set of servers have corresponding file systems at the
      same path within their namespaces, an array of server names may 
      be provided.  An
      entry in the server array is a UTF-8 string and represents one 
      of a
      traditional DNS host name, IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or a
      zero-length string.
      An IPv4 or IPv6 address is represented as a universal
      address (see <a class="xref" href="#netaddr4">Section 3.3.9</a> and <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5665">12</a>]</span>), minus the netid, and either with
      or without the trailing ".p1.p2" suffix that
      represents the port number. If the suffix is omitted,
      then the default port, 2049, <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> be assumed.

      A zero-length string <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> be used to indicate the current address 
      being used for the RPC call. It is not
      a requirement that all servers that share the same rootpath 
      be listed
      in one fs_location4 instance.  The array of server names is provided for
      convenience.  Servers that share the same rootpath may also be listed
      in separate fs_location4 entries in the fs_locations attribute.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.16-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.16-5">
     The fs_locations4 data type and the fs_locations attribute each
     contain an array of
     such locations.  Since the namespace of each server may be 
     constructed differently, the "fs_root" field is provided.  The 
     path represented
     by fs_root represents the location of the file system in the 
     current server's namespace, i.e., that of the
     server from which the fs_locations attribute was obtained.  The
     fs_root path is meant to aid the client by clearly referencing
     the root of the file system whose locations are being reported,
     no matter what object within the current file system the 
     current filehandle designates.  The fs_root is simply the
     pathname the client used to reach the object on the current server
     (i.e., the object to which the fs_locations attribute applies).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.16-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.16-6">
     When the fs_locations attribute
     is interrogated and there are no alternate file system locations,
     the server <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> return a zero-length array of fs_location4 
     structures, together with a valid fs_root.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.16-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.16-7">
     As an example, suppose there is a replicated file system located 
     at two
     servers (servA and servB).  At servA, the file system is located at
     path /a/b/c.  At, servB the file system is located at path /x/y/z.
     If the client were to obtain the fs_locations value for the
     directory at /a/b/c/d, it might not necessarily know  
     that the file system's root is located in servA's namespace 
     at /a/b/c.  When the client switches to servB, it will need
     to determine that the directory it first referenced at servA is now
     represented by the path /x/y/z/d on servB.  To facilitate this, the
     fs_locations attribute provided by servA would have an fs_root value
     of /a/b/c and two entries in fs_locations.  One entry in fs_locations
     will be for itself (servA) and the other will be for servB with a
     path of /x/y/z.  With this information, the client is able to
     substitute /x/y/z for the /a/b/c at the beginning of its access
     path and construct /x/y/z/d to use for the new server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.16-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.16-8">
     Note that there is no requirement that the number
     of components in each rootpath be the same; there
     is no relation between the number of components in
     rootpath or fs_root, and none of the components
     in a rootpath and fs_root have to be the same. In
     the above example, we could have had a third element
     in the locations array, with server equal to "servC"
     and rootpath equal to "/I/II", and a fourth element in
     locations with server equal to "servD" and rootpath
     equal to "/aleph/beth/gimel/daleth/he".<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.16-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.16-9">
     The relationship between fs_root to a rootpath is
     that the client replaces the pathname indicated in
     fs_root for the current server for the substitute
     indicated in rootpath for the new server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.16-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.16-10">
     For an example of a referred or migrated file
     system, suppose there is a file system located
     at serv1. At serv1, the file system is located at
     /az/buky/vedi/glagoli. The client finds that object
     at glagoli has migrated (or is a referral).  The
     client gets the fs_locations attribute, which contains
     an fs_root of /az/buky/vedi/glagoli, and one element
     in the locations array, with server equal to serv2,
     and rootpath equal to /izhitsa/fita. The client
     replaces /az/buky/vedi/glagoli with /izhitsa/fita,
     and uses the latter pathname on serv2.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.16-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.16-11">
     Thus, the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> return an fs_root that is equal

          remembers the directory filehandle associated with each open
          file, it may proceed upward using LOOKUPP to find the new file system
          boundaries.  Note that in the event of a referral, there will
          not be any such files and so these actions will not be performed.
   Instead, a reference to a portion of the original

          Once the client recognizes that one file system has been split

          one until a convenient point to recognize the transition,
          such as a restart.  This would require a mapping

          this is already necessary for other reasons.  As noted 
          above, existing fileids within the two descendant file systems
          will not conflict.  Providing non-conflicting fileids for 
          newly created files on the split file systems
          is the responsibility of the server (or servers working in 
          concert).  The server can encode filehandles such
          that filehandles generated before the split event can be discerned
          from those generated after the split,

        Attribute continuity and file system identity information are 
        expressed by defining equivalence relations on the sets of
        file systems presented to the client.  Each such relation
        is expressed as a set of file system equivalence classes.
        For each relation, a file system has an 8-bit class number.
        Two file systems belong to the same class if both have 
        identical non-zero class numbers.  Zero is treated as 
        non-matching.  Most often, 
        the relevant question for the client will be whether a
        given replica is identical to / continuous with the current one in a
        given respect, but the information should be available also as to
        whether two other replicas match in that respect as well.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.17.1-17">¶</a></p>

        Server-specified preference information is also provided via

        rank and an order (see below) to be used with separate values
        specifiable for the cases of read-only and writable file 
        systems.  
        These values are compared
        for different file systems to establish the server-specified

        Rank is used to express a strict server-imposed ordering on
        clients, with lower values indicating "more preferred".  Clients
        should attempt to use all replicas with a given rank before they
        use one with a higher rank.  Only if all of those file systems are
        unavailable should the client proceed to those of a higher rank.
        Because specifying a rank will override client preferences, servers
        should be conservative about using this mechanism, particularly
        when the environment is one in which client communication characteristics
        are neither tightly controlled nor visible to the server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.17.1-21">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.17.1-22">

        preferences are not controlling, with lower values of order
        indicating "more preferred".  If replicas are approximately equal
        in all respects, clients should defer to the order specified by the
        server.  When clients look at server latency as part of their
        selection, they are free to use this criterion, but it is suggested
        that when latency differences are not significant, the

          The fli_valid_for field specifies a time in seconds

          without refetch.  The fli_valid_for value does not provide a
          guarantee of validity since servers can unexpectedly go out of
          service or become inaccessible for any number of reasons.
          Clients are well-advised to refetch this information for an
          actively accessed file system at every fli_valid_for seconds.  This
          is particularly important when file system replicas may go out
          of service in a controlled way using the FSLI4GF_GOING flag to
          communicate an ongoing change.  The server should set
          fli_valid_for to a value that allows well-behaved clients to
          notice the FSLI4GF_GOING flag and make an orderly switch before
          the loss of service becomes effective.  If this value is zero,
          then no refetch interval is appropriate and the client need
          not refetch this data on any particular schedule.
          In the event of a transition to a new file system instance, a
          new value of the fs_locations_info attribute will be fetched at
          the destination.  It is to be expected that this may have a
          different fli_valid_for value, which the client should then use
          in the same fashion as the previous value.   Because a refetch
   of the attribute causes information from all component entries to
   be refetched, the server will typically provide a low value for
   this field if any of the replicas are likely to go out of service
   in a short time frame.   Note that, because of the ability of the
   server to return NFS4ERR_MOVED to trigger the use of different paths,
   when alternate trunked paths are available, there is generally no
   need to use low values of fli_valid_for in connection with the
   management of alternate paths to the same replica.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.17.2-2.4">¶</a>

      The opaque strings fss_source and fss_current provide a way of presenting
      information about the source of the file system image being present.
      It is not intended that the client do anything with this information
      other than make it available to administrative tools.  It is
      intended that this information be helpful when researching possible
      problems with a file system image that might arise when it is
      unclear if the correct image is being accessed and, if not, how that
      image came to be made.  This kind of diagnostic information will be
      helpful, if, as seems likely, copies of file systems are made in
      many different ways (e.g., simple user-level copies, 
      file-system-level point-in-time copies, 
      clones of the underlying storage),
      under a variety of administrative arrangements.  In such
      environments, determining how a given set of data was constructed
      can be very helpful in resolving problems.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.18-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.18-8">
      The opaque string fss_source is used to indicate the source of a
      given file system with the expectation that tools capable of
      creating a file system image propagate this information, when
      possible.  It is understood that this may not always be possible
      since a user-level copy may be thought of as creating a new data
      set and the tools used may have no mechanism to propagate this
      data.  When a file system is initially created, it is desirable 
      to associate with it
      data regarding how the file system was created, where it was
      created, who created it, etc. Making this information available 
      in this attribute in a human-readable 
      string will be helpful for applications and 
      system administrators and will also serve to make it available when
      the original file system is used to make subsequent copies.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.18-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.18-9">
      The opaque string fss_current should provide whatever information is
      available about the source of the current copy.  Such
      information includes
      the tool creating it, any relevant parameters to that tool, the
      time at which the copy was done, the user making the change, the
      server on which the change was made, etc.  All information should be
      in a human-readable string.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.18-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.18-10">
      The field fss_age provides an indication of how out-of-date the file system 
      currently is with respect to its ultimate data source (in case of 
      cascading data updates).  This complements the fls_currency field of 
      fs_locations_server4 (see <a class="xref" href="#SEC11-li-new">Section 11.17</a>) in the 
      following way: the information in fls_currency
      gives a bound for how out of date the data in a file system might 
      typically get, while the value in fss_age gives a bound on how out-of-date that 
      data actually is.  Negative values imply that no information is 
      available.  A zero means that this data is known to be current.
      A positive value means that this data is known to be no older than 
      that number of seconds with respect to the ultimate data source.
      Using this value, the client may be able to decide that a data copy
      is too old, so that it may search for a newer version to use.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.18-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.18-11">
      The fss_version field provides a version identification, in the form of
      a time value, such that successive versions always have later time
      values.  When the fs_type is anything other than
      STATUS4_VERSIONED, the server may provide such a value, but there is
      no guarantee as to its validity and clients will not use it except
      to provide additional information to add to fss_source and fss_current.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.18-11">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.18-12">
      When fss_type is STATUS4_VERSIONED, servers <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> provide a value
      of fss_version that progresses monotonically whenever any new version
      of the data is established.  This allows the client, if reliable
      image progression is important to it, to fetch this attribute as
      part of each COMPOUND where data or metadata from the file system is
      used.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.18-12">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.18-13">
      When it is important to the client to make sure that only valid
      successor images are accepted, it must make sure that it does not
      read data or metadata from the file system without updating its
      sense of the current state of the image. This is to avoid the possibility
      that the fs_status that the client holds will be one for an
      earlier image, which would cause the client to accept a new file
      system instance that is later than that but still earlier than
      the updated data read by the client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.18-13">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.18-14">
      In order to accept valid images reliably, the client must do a GETATTR of the fs_status
      attribute that follows any interrogation of data or metadata within the
      file system in question.  Often this is most conveniently done by
      appending such a GETATTR after all other operations that reference
      a given file system.  When errors occur between reading file system
      data and performing such a GETATTR, care must be exercised to make
      sure that the data in question is not used before obtaining the
      proper fs_status value.  In this connection, when an OPEN is done
      within such a versioned file system and the associated GETATTR of
      fs_status is not successfully completed, the open file in question
      must not be accessed until that fs_status is fetched.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.18-14">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-11.18-15">
      The procedure above will ensure that before using any data from the
      file system the client has in hand a newly-fetched current version
      of the file system image.  Multiple values for multiple requests in
      flight can be resolved by assembling them into the required partial
      order (and the elements should form a total order within the
      partial order) and
      using the last.  
The client may then, when switching among
      file system instances, decline to use an instance that does not have
      an fss_type of STATUS4_VERSIONED or whose fss_version field is earlier than the
      last one obtained from the predecessor file system instance.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-11.18-15">¶</a></p>

  NFSv4.1's pNFS feature provides parallel data access to a
  file system that stripes its content across multiple
  storage servers.  The first instantiation of pNFS, as
  part of NFSv4.1, separates the file system protocol
  processing into two parts: metadata processing and data
  processing.  Data consist of the contents of regular
  files that are striped across storage servers. Data
  striping occurs in at least two ways:  on a file-by-file
  basis and, within sufficiently large files, on a
  block-by-block basis. In contrast, striped access to
  metadata by pNFS clients is not provided in NFSv4.1, even
  though the file system back end of a pNFS server might
  stripe metadata.  Metadata consist of everything else,
  including the contents of non-regular files (e.g.,
  directories); see <a class="xref" href="#metadata">Section 12.2.1</a>.  The
  metadata functionality is implemented by an NFSv4.1

  devices that hold the data.  A layout is said to belong to a
  specific layout type (data type layouttype4, see <a class="xref" href="#layouttype4">Section 3.3.13</a>).  The layout type allows for variants to
  handle different storage protocols, such as those associated with
  block/volume <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5663">48</a>]</span>, object <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5664">47</a>]</span>, and file (<a class="xref" href="#file_layout_type">Section 13</a>) layout types.  A metadata server, along with its control
  protocol, <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> support at least one layout type.  A private
  sub-range of the layout type namespace is also defined. Values from
  the private layout type range <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> be used for internal testing or
  experimentation (see <a class="xref" href="#layouttype4">Section 3.3.13</a>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.7-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.7-2">
  As an example,  the organization of the file layout type could be
  an array of tuples (e.g., device ID, filehandle), along with a
  definition of how the data is
  stored across the devices (e.g., striping). A block/volume layout
  might be an array of tuples that store &lt;device ID, block number,
  block count&gt; 
along with information about block size and the
  associated file offset of the block number.  An object layout might
  be an array of tuples &lt;device ID, object ID&gt; and an additional
  structure (i.e., the aggregation map) that defines how the logical
  byte sequence of the file data is serialized into the different
  objects.  Note that the actual layouts are typically more complex
  than these simple expository examples.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.7-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.7-3">
  Requests for pNFS-related operations will often specify a layout 
  type.  Examples of such operations are GETDEVICEINFO and LAYOUTGET.
  The response for these operations will include structures such
  as a device_addr4 or a layout4, each of which includes a layout type within
  it.  The layout type sent by the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> always be the same
  one requested by the client.  When a server sends a response that
  includes a different layout type, the client <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> ignore the
  response and behave as if the server had returned an error response.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.7-3">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-12.2.8-1">
  A layout defines how a file's data is organized on one or more
  storage devices.  There are many potential layout types; each of the
  layout types are differentiated by the storage protocol used to
  access data and by the aggregation scheme that lays out the file
  data on the underlying storage devices.  A layout is precisely
  identified by the tuple &lt;client ID, filehandle, layout
  type, iomode, range&gt;, where filehandle refers to the filehandle
  of the file on the metadata server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.8-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.8-2">
  It is important to define when layouts overlap and/or conflict with
  each other.  For two layouts with overlapping byte-ranges to
  actually overlap each other, both layouts must be of the same layout
  type, correspond to the same filehandle, and have the same iomode.
  Layouts conflict when they overlap and differ in the content of the
  layout (i.e., the storage device/file mapping parameters differ).
  Note that differing iomodes do not lead to conflicting layouts.  It
  is permissible for layouts with different iomodes, pertaining to the
  same byte-range, to be held by the same client.  An example of this
  would be copy-on-write functionality for a block/volume layout type.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.8-2">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-12.2.9-1">
  The layout iomode (data type layoutiomode4, see <a class="xref" href="#layoutiomode4">Section 3.3.20</a>) indicates to the metadata server the
  client's intent to perform either just READ operations
  or a mixture containing READ
  and WRITE operations. For certain layout
  types, it is useful for a client to specify this intent at the time it sends LAYOUTGET
  (<a class="xref" href="#OP_LAYOUTGET">Section 18.43</a>).  For example, for
  block/volume-based protocols, block allocation could occur when a
  LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW iomode is specified.  A special LAYOUTIOMODE4_ANY iomode is defined
  and can only be used for LAYOUTRETURN and CB_LAYOUTRECALL, not for
  LAYOUTGET.  It specifies that layouts pertaining to both LAYOUTIOMODE4_READ and
  LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW iomodes are being returned or recalled, respectively.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.9-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.9-2">
  A storage device may validate I/O with regard to the iomode; this
  is dependent upon storage device implementation and layout type.
  Thus, if the client's layout iomode is inconsistent with the I/O
  being performed, the storage device may reject the client's I/O with
  an error indicating that a new layout with the correct iomode should be
  obtained via LAYOUTGET.  For example, if a client gets a layout with a LAYOUTIOMODE4_READ iomode and
  performs a WRITE to a storage device, the storage device is allowed
  to reject that WRITE.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.9-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.9-3">
  The use of the layout iomode does not conflict with OPEN share modes or byte-range LOCK operations;
  open share mode and byte-range lock conflicts are enforced as they are without the
  use of pNFS and are logically separate from the pNFS layout level.
  Open share modes and byte-range locks are the preferred method for
  restricting user access to data files.  For example, an OPEN of
  OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_WRITE does not conflict with a LAYOUTGET containing an iomode
  of LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW performed by another client.  Applications that depend
  on writing into the same file concurrently may use byte-range locking to
  serialize their accesses.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.9-3">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-12.2.10-1">
    The device ID (data type deviceid4, see
    <a class="xref" href="#deviceid4">Section 3.3.14</a>) identifies a group of storage devices. The scope
    of a device ID is the pair &lt;client ID, layout type&gt;. In practice, a
    significant amount of information may be required to fully address
    a storage device.  Rather than embedding all such information in a
    layout, layouts embed device IDs.  The NFSv4.1 operation
    GETDEVICEINFO (<a class="xref" href="#OP_GETDEVICEINFO">Section 18.40</a>) is used to
    retrieve the complete address information (including
    all device addresses for the device ID) regarding the storage
    device according to its layout type and device ID.  For example,
    the address of an NFSv4.1 data server or of an object-based storage
    device could be an IP address and port.  The address of a block
    storage device could be a volume label.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.10-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.10-2">
    Clients cannot expect the mapping between a device ID and
    its storage device address(es) to persist across metadata server restart.
    See <a class="xref" href="#mds_recovery">Section 12.7.4</a> for a description of how
    recovery works in that situation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.10-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.10-3">
    A device ID lives as long as there is a layout
    referring to the device ID.  If there are no layouts
    referring to the device ID, the server is free to
    delete the device ID any time.
    Once a device ID is deleted by the server, the server <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span>
    reuse the device ID for the same layout type and client ID again.
    This requirement is feasible because the device ID is 16 bytes
    long, leaving sufficient room to store a generation number if the
    server's implementation requires most of the rest of the device ID's
    content to be reused. This requirement is necessary because
    otherwise the race conditions between asynchronous notification
    of device ID addition and deletion would be too difficult to
    sort out.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.10-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.10-4">
    Device ID to device address mappings are not leased,
    and can be changed at any time. (Note that while
    device ID to device address mappings are likely
    to change after the metadata server restarts, the
    server is not required to change the mappings.)
    A server has two
    choices for changing mappings.  It can recall all
    layouts referring to the device ID or it can use a
    notification mechanism.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.10-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.10-5">
    The NFSv4.1 protocol has no optimal way to recall
    all layouts that referred to a particular device ID
    (unless the server associates a single device ID with
    a single fsid or a single client ID; in which case,
    CB_LAYOUTRECALL has options for recalling all layouts
    associated with the fsid, client ID pair, or just the
    client ID).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.2.10-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.2.10-6">
    Via a notification mechanism
    (see <a class="xref" href="#OP_CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID">Section 20.12</a>),
    device ID to device address mappings can change over the duration
    of server operation without recalling or revoking the layouts that
    refer to device ID. The notification mechanism can also delete
    a device ID, but only if the client has no layouts referring
    to the device ID.
    A notification of a change to a device ID to device address
    mapping will immediately or eventually invalidate some or all of
    the device ID's mappings.
    The server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> support notifications and the client must
    request them before they can be used.  For further information

  Layouts grant to the client the ability to access data located at
  a storage device with the appropriate storage protocol.  The client
  is guaranteed the layout will be recalled when one of two things
  occur: either a conflicting layout is requested or the state
  encapsulated by the layout becomes invalid (this can happen when
  an event directly or indirectly modifies the layout).  When a layout
  is recalled and returned by the client, the client continues with
  the ability to access file data with normal NFSv4.1 operations
  through the metadata server.  Only the ability to access the storage
  devices is affected.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.1-2">
  The requirement of NFSv4.1 that all user access rights <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be
  obtained through the appropriate OPEN, LOCK, and ACCESS operations
  is not modified with the existence of layouts.  Layouts are provided
  to NFSv4.1 clients, and user access still follows the rules of the
  protocol as if they did not exist.  It is a requirement that for a
  client to access a storage device, a layout must be held by the
  client.  If a storage device receives an I/O request for a byte-range for
  which the client does not hold a layout, the storage device <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span>
  reject that I/O request.  Note that the act of modifying a file for
  which a layout is held does not necessarily conflict with the
  holding of the layout that describes the file being modified.
  Therefore, it is the requirement of the storage protocol or layout
  type that determines the necessary behavior.  For example,
  block/volume layout types require that the layout's
  iomode agree with the type of I/O being performed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.1-3">
  Depending upon the layout type and storage protocol in use, storage
  device access permissions may be granted by LAYOUTGET and may be
  encoded within the type-specific layout.  For an example of storage
  device access permissions, see an object-based protocol such as <span>[<a class="xref" href="#OSD-T10">58</a>]</span>.  If access permissions are encoded within the
  layout, the metadata server <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> recall the layout when those
  permissions become invalid for any reason -- for example, when a file
  becomes unwritable or inaccessible to a client.  Note, clients are
  still required to perform the appropriate
  OPEN, LOCK, and ACCESS operations as described above.  The degree to which it is
  possible for the client to circumvent these operations and
  the consequences of doing so must be clearly specified by the
  individual layout type specifications.  In addition, these
  specifications must be clear about the requirements and

  one client obtains a mandatory byte-range lock and a second client accesses the

  A client obtains a layout with the
  LAYOUTGET operation.  The metadata server
  will grant layouts of a particular type
  (e.g., block/volume, object, or file).
  The client selects an appropriate layout
  type that the server supports and the client
  is prepared to use.  The layout returned to
  the client might not exactly match the
  requested byte-range as described in <a class="xref" href="#OP_LAYOUTGET_DESCRIPTION">Section 18.43.3</a>.  As needed a client
  may send multiple LAYOUTGET operations; these might result
  in multiple overlapping, non-conflicting layouts (see
  <a class="xref" href="#layout">Section 12.2.8</a>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.2-2">
  In order to get a layout, the client must first have opened the file
  via the OPEN operation. When a client has no layout on a file, it
  <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> present an open stateid, a delegation stateid, or
  a byte-range lock stateid in the loga_stateid argument. A successful
  LAYOUTGET result includes a layout stateid. The first successful
  LAYOUTGET processed by the server using a non-layout stateid as an
  argument <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> have the "seqid" field of the layout stateid in the
  response set to one. Thereafter, the client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> use a layout
  stateid (see <a class="xref" href="#layout_stateid">Section 12.5.3</a>) on future invocations
  of LAYOUTGET on the file, and the "seqid" <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> be set to
  zero.  Once the layout has been retrieved, it can be held across
  multiple OPEN and CLOSE sequences.  Therefore, a client may hold a
  layout for a file that is not currently open by any user on the
  client.  This allows for the caching of layouts beyond CLOSE.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.2-3">
  The storage protocol used by the client to access the data on the
  storage device is determined by the layout's type.  The client is
  responsible for matching the layout type with an available method to
  interpret and use the layout.  The method for this layout type
  selection is outside the scope of the pNFS functionality.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.2-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.2-4">
  Although the metadata server is in control
  of the layout for a file, the pNFS client
  can provide hints to the server when a file
  is opened or created about the preferred
  layout type and aggregation schemes.
  pNFS introduces a layout_hint attribute (<a class="xref" href="#attrdef_layout_hint">Section 5.12.4</a>) 
  that the client can set at file creation
  time to provide a hint to the server for new
  files. Setting this attribute separately,
  after the file has been created might make
  it difficult, or impossible, for the server
  implementation to comply.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.2-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.2-5">
  Because the EXCLUSIVE4 createmode4 does not allow the
  setting of attributes at file creation time, NFSv4.1
  introduces the EXCLUSIVE4_1 createmode4, which does
  allow attributes to be set at file creation time. In
  addition, if the session is created with persistent
  reply caches, EXCLUSIVE4_1 is neither necessary
  nor allowed. Instead, GUARDED4 both works better and is
  prescribed. <a class="xref" href="#exclusive_create">Table 18</a> in <a class="xref" href="#OP_OPEN_DESCRIPTION">Section 18.16.3</a> summarizes how a client

<p id="section-12.5.3-1">
  As with all other stateids, the layout stateid consists of a "seqid" and
  "other" field. Once a layout stateid is established, the "other" field
  will stay constant unless the stateid is revoked or the client
  returns all layouts on the file and the server disposes of the
  stateid.  The "seqid" field is initially set to one, and is never
  zero on any NFSv4.1 operation that uses layout stateids, whether it
  is a fore channel or backchannel operation. After the layout stateid
  is established, the server increments by one the value of the
  "seqid" in each subsequent LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTRETURN response, and
  in each CB_LAYOUTRECALL request.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.3-2">
  Given the design goal of pNFS to provide parallelism, the layout
  stateid differs from other stateid types in that the client is
  expected to send LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTRETURN operations in parallel.
  The "seqid" value is used by the client to properly sort responses
  to LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTRETURN.  The "seqid" is also used to prevent
  race conditions between LAYOUTGET and CB_LAYOUTRECALL.  Given that the
  processing rules differ from layout stateids and other stateid
  types, only the pNFS sections of this document should be considered
  to determine proper layout stateid handling.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.3-3">
  Once the client receives a layout stateid, it <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> use the correct
  "seqid" for subsequent LAYOUTGET or LAYOUTRETURN operations.  The
  correct "seqid" is defined as the highest "seqid" value from
  responses of fully processed LAYOUTGET or LAYOUTRETURN operations or
  arguments of a fully processed CB_LAYOUTRECALL operation.  Since the
  server is incrementing the "seqid" value on each layout operation,
  the client may determine the order of operation processing by
  inspecting the "seqid" value.  In the case of overlapping layout
  ranges, the ordering information will provide the client the
  knowledge of which layout ranges are held.  Note that overlapping
  layout ranges may occur because of the client's specific requests or
  because the server is allowed to expand the range of a requested
  layout and notify the client in the LAYOUTRETURN results. Additional
  layout stateid sequencing requirements are provided in
  <a class="xref" href="#pnfs_operation_sequencing">Section 12.5.5.2</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.3-4">
  The client's receipt of a "seqid" is not sufficient for subsequent
  use.  The client must fully process the operations before the
  "seqid" can be used.  For LAYOUTGET results, if
  the client is not using the forgetful model
  (<a class="xref" href="#recall_robustness">Section 12.5.5.1</a>), it <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> first update its
  record of what ranges of the file's layout it has before using the
  seqid. For LAYOUTRETURN results, the client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> delete the range
  from its record of what ranges of the file's layout it had before
  using the seqid. For CB_LAYOUTRECALL arguments, the client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> send
  a response to the recall before using the seqid.
  The fundamental requirement in client
  processing is that the "seqid" is used to provide the order of
  processing.  LAYOUTGET results may be processed in parallel.
  LAYOUTRETURN results may be processed in parallel.  LAYOUTGET and
  LAYOUTRETURN responses may be processed in parallel as long as the
  ranges do not overlap.  CB_LAYOUTRECALL request processing <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be
  processed in "seqid" order at all times.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.3-5">
  Once a client has no more layouts on a file, the layout stateid is

  Allowing for varying storage protocol capabilities, the pNFS
  protocol does not require the metadata server and storage devices to
  have a consistent view of file attributes and data location
  mappings.  Data location mapping refers to aspects such as which offsets
  store data as opposed to storing holes (see <a class="xref" href="#sparse_dense">Section 13.4.4</a> for a discussion).  Related issues arise
  for storage protocols where a layout may hold provisionally
  allocated blocks where the allocation of those blocks does not
  survive a complete restart of both the client and server.  Because
  of this inconsistency, it is necessary to resynchronize the client
  with the metadata server and its storage devices and make any
  potential changes available to other clients.  This is accomplished
  by use of the LAYOUTCOMMIT operation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.4-2">
  The LAYOUTCOMMIT operation is responsible for committing a modified
  layout to the metadata server.  The data should be written
  and committed to the appropriate storage devices before the
  LAYOUTCOMMIT occurs.  The
  scope of the LAYOUTCOMMIT operation depends on the storage protocol
  in use.  It is important to note that the level of
  synchronization is from the point of view of the client that sent
  the LAYOUTCOMMIT.  The updated state on the metadata server need
  only reflect the state as of the client's last operation previous to
  the LAYOUTCOMMIT.  The metadata server is not <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> to maintain a global view
  that accounts for other clients' I/O that may have occurred within
  the same time frame.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.4-3">
  For block/volume-based layouts, LAYOUTCOMMIT may require
  updating the block list that comprises the file and committing this
  layout to stable storage.  For file-based layouts, synchronization of
  attributes between the metadata and storage devices, primarily the
  size attribute, is required.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.4-4">
  The control protocol is free to synchronize the attributes before
  it receives a LAYOUTCOMMIT; however, upon successful completion of a
  LAYOUTCOMMIT, state that exists on the metadata server that
  describes the file <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be synchronized with the state that exists on the
  storage devices that comprise that file as of the client's
  last sent operation.  Thus, a client that queries the size of a file

  a size that does not reflect the actual data written.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.4-4">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-12.5.4.1-1">
  The change and time_modify attributes may be updated
  by the server when the LAYOUTCOMMIT operation is processed.  The
  reason for this is that some layout types do not support the update
  of these attributes when the storage devices process I/O operations.
  If a client has a layout with the LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW iomode on the file,
  the client <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> provide a suggested value to the server for
  time_modify within the arguments to LAYOUTCOMMIT.
  Based on the layout type, the provided value may or may not be used.
  The server should sanity-check the client-provided values
  before they are used.  For example, the server should ensure that
  time does not flow backwards.  The client always has the option to
  set time_modify through an explicit SETATTR operation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.4.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.4.1-2">
  For some layout protocols, the storage device is able to notify the
  metadata server of the occurrence of an I/O; as a result, the
  change and time_modify attributes may be updated at
  the metadata server.  For a metadata server that is capable of
  monitoring updates to the change and time_modify
  attributes, LAYOUTCOMMIT processing is not required to update the
  change attribute.  In this case, the metadata server must ensure that
  no further update to the data has occurred since the last update of
  the attributes; file-based protocols may have enough information to
  make this determination or may update the change attribute upon each
  file modification.  This also applies for the time_modify
  attribute.  If the server implementation is able to
  determine that the file has not been modified since the last
  time_modify update, the server need not update time_modify at
  LAYOUTCOMMIT.  At LAYOUTCOMMIT completion, the updated attributes
  should be visible if that file was modified since the latest
  previous LAYOUTCOMMIT or LAYOUTGET.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.4.1-2">¶</a></p>

  The size of a file may be updated when the LAYOUTCOMMIT operation is

  LAYOUTCOMMIT is loca_last_write_offset; this field indicates the
  highest byte offset written but not yet committed with the
  LAYOUTCOMMIT operation.  The data type of loca_last_write_offset is
  newoffset4 and is switched on a boolean value, no_newoffset, that
  indicates if a previous write occurred or not.  If no_newoffset is
  FALSE, an offset is not given.  If the client has a layout with
  LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW iomode on the file, with a byte-range (denoted by the values of lo_offset and lo_length)
  that overlaps loca_last_write_offset, then the client <span class="bcp14">MAY</span>
  set no_newoffset to TRUE and provide an offset that will
  update the file size. Keep in mind that offset is not the same
  as length, though they are related. For example, a loca_last_write_offset

<p id="section-12.5.5-1">
  Since a layout protects a client's access to a file via a direct
  client-storage-device path, a layout need only be recalled when it
  is semantically unable to serve this function.  Typically, this
  occurs when the layout no longer encapsulates the true location of
  the file over the byte-range it represents.  Any operation or
  action, such as server-driven restriping or load balancing, that
  changes the layout will result in a recall of the layout.  A layout
  is recalled by the CB_LAYOUTRECALL callback operation (see <a class="xref" href="#OP_CB_LAYOUTRECALL">Section 20.3</a>) and returned with LAYOUTRETURN (see <a class="xref" href="#OP_LAYOUTRETURN">Section 18.44</a>).  The CB_LAYOUTRECALL operation may
  recall a layout identified by a byte-range, all layouts
  associated with a file system ID (FSID), or all layouts associated with
  a client ID.
  <a class="xref" href="#pnfs_operation_sequencing">Section 12.5.5.2</a> discusses sequencing issues
  surrounding the getting, returning, and recalling of layouts.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.5-2">
  An iomode is also specified when recalling a layout.
  Generally, the iomode in the recall request must match the layout
  being returned; for example, a recall with an iomode of
  LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW should cause the client to only return
  LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW layouts and not LAYOUTIOMODE4_READ layouts.
  However, a special LAYOUTIOMODE4_ANY enumeration is
  defined to enable recalling a layout of any iomode; in other words,
  the client must return both LAYOUTIOMODE4_READ and LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW layouts.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.5-3">
  A REMOVE operation <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> cause the metadata server to recall the
  layout to prevent the client from accessing a non-existent file and
  to reclaim state stored on the client.  Since a REMOVE may be delayed
  until the last close of the file has occurred, the recall may also
  be delayed until this time.  After the last reference on the file
  has been released and the file has been removed, the client should
  no longer be able to perform I/O using the layout.  In the case of a
  file-based layout, the data server <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> return NFS4ERR_STALE in

  Although pNFS does not alter the file data caching capabilities of
  clients, or their semantics, it recognizes that some clients may
  perform more aggressive write-behind caching to optimize the
  benefits provided by pNFS.  However, write-behind caching may
  negatively affect the latency in returning a layout in response to a
  CB_LAYOUTRECALL; this is similar to file delegations and the impact
  that file data caching has on DELEGRETURN.  Client implementations
  <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> limit the amount of unwritten data they have outstanding at

  period has passed, the server may choose to fence the client's access
  to the storage devices if the server perceives the client has taken
  too long to return a layout. However, just as in the case of data
  delegation and DELEGRETURN, the server may choose to wait, given that
  the client is showing forward progress on its way to returning the
  layout.  This forward progress can take the form of successful
  interaction with the storage devices or of sub-portions of the layout
  being returned by the client.  The server can also limit exposure to
  these problems by limiting the byte-ranges initially provided in

  It has been assumed thus far that pNFS client
  state
  (layout ranges and iomode)
  for a file exactly matches that of the pNFS server for that file.
  This assumption
  leads to the implication that any callback results in a
  LAYOUTRETURN or set of LAYOUTRETURNs that exactly match the range in
  the callback, since both client and server agree about the state
  being maintained.  However, it can be useful if this assumption does
  not always hold.  For example:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.1-1">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-12.5.5.1-2.1">
  If conflicts that require
  callbacks are very rare, and a server can use a multi-file callback
  to recover per-client resources (e.g., via an FSID recall or a

  significantly less client-server pNFS traffic.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.1-2.1">¶</a>

  It may be useful for servers to maintain information about
  what ranges are held by a client on a coarse-grained basis, leading
  to the server's layout ranges being beyond those actually held by
  the client.
  In the extreme, a server could manage conflicts on
  a per-file basis, only sending whole-file callbacks even though
  clients may request and be granted sub-file ranges.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.1-2.2">¶</a>
</li>
              <li class="normal" id="section-12.5.5.1-2.3">
  It may be useful for clients to "forget" details about
  what layouts and ranges the client actually has, leading
  to the server's layout ranges being beyond those that the
  client "thinks" it has. As long as the client does not
  assume it has layouts that are beyond what the server
  has granted, this is a safe practice.  When a client
  forgets what ranges and layouts it has, and it receives
  a CB_LAYOUTRECALL operation, the client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> follow up
  with a LAYOUTRETURN for what the server recalled, or
  alternatively return the NFS4ERR_NOMATCHING_LAYOUT error
  if it has no layout to return in the recalled range.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.1-2.3">¶</a>
</li>
              <li class="normal" id="section-12.5.5.1-2.4">
  In order to avoid errors, it is vital that a client not assign
  itself layout permissions beyond what the server has granted, and
  that the server not forget layout permissions that have been granted.
  On the other hand, if a
  server believes that a client holds a layout that the client
  does not know about, it is useful for the client to cleanly indicate
  completion of the requested recall either by sending a LAYOUTRETURN
  operation for the entire requested range or by returning an
  NFS4ERR_NOMATCHING_LAYOUT error to the CB_LAYOUTRECALL.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.1-2.4">¶</a>

<p id="section-12.5.5.1-3">
  Thus, in light of the above, it is useful for a server to be able to
  send callbacks for layout ranges it has not granted to a client,
  and for a client to return ranges it does not hold.  A pNFS client
  <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> always return layouts that comprise the full range
  specified by the recall.  Note, the full recalled layout range need
  not be returned as part of a single operation, but may be returned
  in portions.  This allows the client to stage the flushing of dirty
  data and commits and returns of layouts.
Also, it indicates to the
  metadata server that the client is making progress.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.5.1-4">
  When a layout is returned, the client <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> have any outstanding

  outstanding I/O requests to the storage device.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.1-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.5.1-5">
  Even with this requirement for the client, it is possible that I/O
  requests may be presented to a storage device no longer allowed to
  perform them.  Since the server has no strict control as to when the
  client will return the layout, the server may later decide to
  unilaterally revoke the client's access to the storage devices
  as provided by the layout.  In
  choosing to revoke access, the server must deal with the possibility
  of lingering I/O requests, i.e., I/O requests that are
  still in flight to
  storage devices identified by the revoked layout.

  All layout type specifications <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> define whether unilateral layout revocation by
  the metadata server is supported; if it is, the specification must
  also describe how lingering writes are processed.  For example,
  storage devices identified by the revoked layout could be fenced off

<p id="section-12.5.5.1-6">
  In order to ensure client/server convergence with regard to layout state,
  the final LAYOUTRETURN operation in a sequence of LAYOUTRETURN

  recall/return type (FILE, FSID, or ALL), and byte-range, even if
  layouts pertaining to partial ranges were previously
  returned.  In addition, if the client holds no layouts that

  One critical issue with regard to layout operations sequencing
  concerns callbacks.  The protocol must defend against
  races between the reply to a LAYOUTGET or LAYOUTRETURN

  <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> process a CB_LAYOUTRECALL that implies one or
  more outstanding LAYOUTGET or LAYOUTRETURN operations to
  which the client has not yet received a reply. The client
  detects such a CB_LAYOUTRECALL by examining the "seqid"
  field of the recall's layout stateid. If the "seqid" 
  is not exactly one higher than what the client currently has recorded, and the
  client has at least one LAYOUTGET and/or LAYOUTRETURN operation
  outstanding, the client knows the server sent the CB_LAYOUTRECALL

  If these possibilities cannot be distinguished, a

  the recall is processed in the second case. Note that
  in the first case, the "seqid" in the layout stateid
  of the recall is two greater than what the client has
  recorded; in the second case, the "seqid" is one greater than
  what the client has recorded.  This allows the client

<p id="section-12.5.5.2.1.4-1">
  The rules for layout stateid processing differ from other stateids
  in the protocol because the "seqid" value cannot be zero and the
  stateid's "seqid" value changes in a CB_LAYOUTRECALL operation.  The
  non-zero requirement combined with the inherent parallelism of
  layout operations means that a set of LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTRETURN
  operations may contain the same value for "seqid".
  The server uses a slightly modified version of the modulo arithmetic
  as described in 
  <a class="xref" href="#Slot_Identifiers_and_Server_Reply_Cache">Section 2.10.6.1</a> 
  when incrementing the layout stateid's "seqid".  The difference
  is that zero is not a valid value for "seqid"; when the value
  of a "seqid" is 0xFFFFFFFF, the next valid value will be 0x00000001.
  The modulo arithmetic is also used for the comparisons of
  "seqid" values in the processing of CB_LAYOUTRECALL events as
  described above in <a class="xref" href="#layout_server_consider">Section 12.5.5.2.1.3</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.2.1.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.5.2.1.4-2">
  Just as the server validates the "seqid" in the event of
  CB_LAYOUTRECALL usage, as described in
  <a class="xref" href="#layout_server_consider">Section 12.5.5.2.1.3</a>, the server also validates
  the "seqid" value to ensure that it is within an appropriate range.
  This range represents the degree of parallelism the server supports
  for layout stateids.  If the client is sending multiple layout
  operations to the server in parallel, by definition, the "seqid"
  value in the supplied stateid will not be the current "seqid" as
  held by the server.  The range of parallelism spans from the highest
  or current "seqid" to a "seqid" value in the past.  To assist in the
  discussion, the server's current "seqid" value for a layout stateid
  is defined as SERVER_CURRENT_SEQID.  The lowest "seqid" value that
  is acceptable to the server is represented by PAST_SEQID.  And the
  value for the range of valid "seqid"s or range of parallelism is
  VALID_SEQID_RANGE.  Therefore, the following holds:
  VALID_SEQID_RANGE = SERVER_CURRENT_SEQID - PAST_SEQID.  In the
  following, all arithmetic is the modulo arithmetic as described
  above.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.2.1.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.5.2.1.4-3">
  The server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> support a minimum VALID_SEQID_RANGE.  The minimum is
  defined as: VALID_SEQID_RANGE = summation over 1..N of
  (ca_maxoperations(i) - 1), where N is the number of session fore
  channels and ca_maxoperations(i) is the value of the ca_maxoperations returned from
  CREATE_SESSION of the i'th session.  The reason for "- 1" is to allow for the required
  SEQUENCE operation.  The server <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> support a VALID_SEQID_RANGE
  value larger than the minimum.  The maximum VALID_SEQID_RANGE is (2<sup>32</sup> - 2) (accounting for zero not being a valid "seqid" value).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.2.1.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.5.5.2.1.4-4">
  If the server finds the "seqid" is zero, the NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID
  error is returned to the client.  The server further validates the
  "seqid" to ensure it is within the range of parallelism,
  VALID_SEQID_RANGE.  If the "seqid" value is outside of that range,
  the error NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID is returned to the client.  Upon
  receipt of NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID, the client updates the stateid in
  the layout request based on processing of other layout requests and
  re-sends the operation to the server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.5.5.2.1.4-4">¶</a></p>

  to combine a GETATTR operation after the OPEN within
  the same COMPOUND.  The GETATTR may then retrieve
  the layout_type attribute for the newly created file.

  chosen for the file and therefore what storage protocol
  the client must use.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.6-4">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-12.6-7">
  Assuming the client supports the layout type returned by GETATTR and
  it chooses to use pNFS for data access, it then sends LAYOUTGET
  using the filehandle and stateid returned by OPEN, specifying the range it wants
  to do I/O on. The response is a layout, which may be a subset of the
  range for which the client asked. It also includes device IDs and a
  description of how data is organized (or in the case of writing, how
  data is to be organized) across the devices.  The device IDs and
  data description are encoded in a format that is specific to the
  layout type, but the client is expected to understand.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.6-7">¶</a></p>

  When the client wants to send an I/O, it determines to which device ID
  it needs to send the I/O command by examining the data
  description in the layout. It then sends a
  GETDEVICEINFO to find the device address(es) of the device ID.  The
  client then sends the I/O request to one of device ID's device addresses, using the
  storage protocol defined for the layout type.

  these I/O requests may be done in parallel.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.6-8">¶</a></p>

  Recovery is complicated by the distributed nature of the pNFS
  protocol.  In general, crash recovery for layouts is similar to
  crash recovery for delegations in the base NFSv4.1 protocol.  However,
  the client's ability to perform I/O without contacting the metadata

   Client recovery for layouts is similar to client recovery for other
   lock and delegation state.  When a pNFS client restarts, it will lose
   all information about the layouts that it previously owned.  There
   are two methods by which the server can reclaim these resources and
   allow otherwise conflicting layouts to be provided to other
   clients.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.7.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.7.1-2">
   The first is through the expiry of the client's lease.  If the
   client recovery time is longer than the lease period, the client's
   lease will expire and the server will know that state may be
   released.  For layouts, the server may release the state immediately
   upon lease expiry or it may allow the layout to persist, awaiting
   possible lease revival, as long as no other layout conflicts.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.7.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.7.1-3">
   The second is through the client restarting in less time than it
   takes for the lease period to expire.  In such a case, the client
   will contact the server through the standard EXCHANGE_ID protocol.
   The server will find that the client's co_ownerid matches the
   co_ownerid of the previous client invocation, but that the verifier
   is different.  The server uses this as a signal to release all
   layout state associated with the client's previous invocation.  In
   this scenario, the data written by the client but not covered by a
   successful LAYOUTCOMMIT is in an undefined state; it may have been
   written or it may now be lost.  This is acceptable behavior and it
   is the client's responsibility to use LAYOUTCOMMIT to achieve the
   desired level of stability.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.7.1-3">¶</a></p>

    appears to be the same, the device IDs may map to different
    device addresses, and even if the device addresses are the same,
    the device addresses could have been assigned to a different

    The only recovery option for this scenario is to send a
    LAYOUTCOMMIT in reclaim mode, which the metadata server will
    accept as long as it is in its grace period.  The use of
    LAYOUTCOMMIT in reclaim mode informs the metadata server that the
    layout has changed.  It is critical that the metadata server
    receive this information before its grace period ends, and thus
    before it starts allowing updates to the file system.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.7.4-2.3.2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.7.4-2.3.3">

    To send LAYOUTCOMMIT in reclaim mode, the client sets the
    loca_reclaim field of the operation's arguments (<a class="xref" href="#OP_LAYOUTCOMMIT_ARGUMENT">Section 18.42.1</a>) to TRUE.  During the metadata
    server's recovery grace period (and only during the recovery grace

<p id="section-12.7.4-2.3.4">

    When loca_reclaim is TRUE, the client is attempting to commit
    changes to the layout that occurred prior to the restart
    of the metadata server.  The metadata server applies some
    consistency checks on the loca_layoutupdate field of the arguments
    to determine whether the client can commit the data written to the
    storage device to the file system.  The loca_layoutupdate field is of
    data type layoutupdate4 and contains layout-type-specific content
    (in the lou_body field of loca_layoutupdate).  The
    layout-type-specific information that loca_layoutupdate might have
    is discussed in <a class="xref" href="#layoutcommit_update">Section 12.5.4.3</a>.  If the
    metadata server's consistency checks on loca_layoutupdate succeed,
    then the metadata server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> commit the data (as described by the
    loca_offset, loca_length, and loca_layoutupdate fields of the
    arguments) that was written to the storage device.  If the metadata
    server's consistency checks on loca_layoutupdate fail, the
    metadata server rejects the LAYOUTCOMMIT operation and makes no
    changes to the file system.  However, any time LAYOUTCOMMIT with
    loca_reclaim TRUE fails, the pNFS client has lost all the data in
    the range defined by &lt;loca_offset, loca_length&gt;.  A client
    can defend against this risk by caching all data, whether written
    synchronously or asynchronously in its memory, and by not releasing the
    cached data until a successful LAYOUTCOMMIT.  This condition
    does not hold true for all layout types; for example, file-based

    Some of the recovery scenarios thus far noted that some

    these operations during its grace period.  For LAYOUTGET, the
    metadata server must reliably determine that servicing such a

    storage protocol (which is specific to the layout type) and
    metadata server implementation, the metadata server may be able to
    determine that a particular request is safe.  For example, a
    metadata server may save provisional allocation mappings for each
    file to stable storage, as well as information about potentially
    conflicting OPEN share modes and mandatory byte-range locks that might
    have been in effect at the time of restart, and the metadata

  may be impractical to provide confidentiality protection for some
  storage protocols to protect against eavesdropping.  In
  environments where eavesdropping on such protocols is of sufficient
  concern to require countermeasures, physical isolation of the
  communication channel (e.g., via direct connection from client(s)
  to storage device(s)) and/or a decision to forgo use of pNFS (e.g.,
  and fall back to conventional NFSv4.1) may be appropriate courses of action.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.9-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-12.9-3">
  Where communication with storage devices is subject to the same
  threats as client-to-metadata server communication, the protocols
  used for that communication need to provide security mechanisms as
  strong as or no weaker than those available via RPCSEC_GSS for
  NFSv4.1. Except for the storage protocol used for the LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES
  layout (see <a class="xref" href="#file_layout_type">Section 13</a>), i.e., except for NFSv4.1,
  it is beyond the scope of this document to specify the security mechanisms 
  for storage access protocols.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-12.9-3">¶</a></p>

  pNFS implementations <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> remove NFSv4.1's access controls.
  The combination of clients, storage devices, and the metadata server
  are responsible for ensuring that all client-to-storage-device file
  data access respects NFSv4.1's ACLs and file open modes.  This entails
  performing both of these checks on every access in the client, the
  storage device, or both (as applicable; when the storage device is
  an NFSv4.1 server, the storage device is ultimately responsible for
  controlling access as described in <a class="xref" href="#state_propagation">Section 13.9.2</a>).
  If a pNFS configuration performs these checks only in the client,
  the risk of a misbehaving client obtaining unauthorized access is
  an important consideration in determining when it is appropriate to
  use such a pNFS configuration.  Such layout types <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> be used
  when client-only access checks do not provide sufficient assurance
  that NFSv4.1 access control is being applied correctly. (This
  is not a problem for the file layout type described in <a class="xref" href="#file_layout_type">Section 13</a> because the storage access protocol for
  LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES is NFSv4.1, and thus the security model for
  storage device access via LAYOUT4_NFSv4_1_FILES is the same as that
  of the metadata server.) For handling of access control specific to
  a layout, the reader should examine the layout specification, such as

  As the above table implies, a server can have one
  or two roles. A server can be both a metadata server
  and a data server, or it can be both a data server and
  non-metadata server.  In addition to returning two roles
  in the EXCHANGE_ID's results, and thus serving both roles
  via a common client ID, a server can serve two roles
  by returning a unique client ID and server owner for

  In the case of a server with concurrent pNFS roles that

  of the server roles, with a preference to match the roles
  requested by the client. Thus, if a client request has
  (EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_NON_PNFS | EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_PNFS_MDS
  | EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_PNFS_DS) flags set, and the server
  is both a metadata server and a data server, serving

<p id="section-13.1-9">
   If a pNFS metadata client gets a layout that refers it to an NFSv4.1
   data server, it needs a client ID on that data server. If it does not
   yet have a client ID from the server that had the EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_PNFS_DS
   flag set in the EXCHANGE_ID results, then the client needs to
   send an EXCHANGE_ID to the data server, using
   the same co_ownerid as it sent to the metadata server, with the
   EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_PNFS_DS flag set in the arguments.
   If the server's
   EXCHANGE_ID results have EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_PNFS_DS set, then the
   client may use the client ID to create sessions that will
   exchange pNFS data operations.
   The client ID returned by the data server has no relationship with
   the client ID returned by a metadata server unless the client IDs
   are equal, and the server owners and server scopes of the data server
   and metadata server are equal.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.1-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.1-10">
   In NFSv4.1, the
   session ID in the SEQUENCE operation implies the
   client ID, which in turn might be used by the server to
   map the stateid to the right client/server pair.
   However, when a data server is presented with a READ or
   WRITE operation with a stateid, because the
   stateid is associated with a
   client ID on a metadata server, and because the session ID in
   the preceding SEQUENCE operation is tied to the
   client ID of the data server, the data server has no
   obvious way to determine the metadata server from the
   COMPOUND procedure, and thus has no way to validate the
   stateid. One <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> approach is for pNFS servers to
   encode metadata server routing and/or identity
   information in the data server filehandles as returned
   in the layout.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.1-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.1-11">

   If metadata server routing and/or identity information is encoded
   in data server filehandles,
   when the metadata server identity or location
   changes, the data server filehandles it gave out will become
   invalid (stale), and so the metadata server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> first
   recall the layouts.
   Invalidating a data server filehandle does not render
   the NFS client's data cache invalid. The client's cache should
   map a data server filehandle to a metadata server filehandle, and
   a metadata server filehandle to cached data.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.1-11">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.1-12">
   If a server is both a metadata server and a data server,
   the server might need to distinguish operations on
   files that are directed to the metadata server from
   those that are directed to the data server. It is
   <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> that the values of the filehandles returned by
   the LAYOUTGET operation be different than the value
   of the filehandle returned by the OPEN of the same file.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.1-12">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.1-13">
   Another scenario is for the metadata server and the
   storage device to be distinct from one client's point of
   view, and the roles reversed from another client's point
   of view. For example, in the cluster file system model,
   a metadata server to one client might be a data server to
   another client. If NFSv4.1 is being used as the storage
   protocol, then pNFS servers need to encode the values
   of filehandles according to their specific roles.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.1-13">¶</a></p>

   <a class="xref" href="#Obligations_of_the_Client">Section 2.10.11.2</a> states
   that a client has to keep its lease renewed in
   order to prevent a session from being deleted by
   the server. If the reply to EXCHANGE_ID has just the
   EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_PNFS_DS role set, then (as noted in
   <a class="xref" href="#ds_ops">Section 13.6</a>) the client will not be able
   to determine the data server's lease_time attribute
   because GETATTR will not be permitted. Instead, the
   rule is that any time a client receives a layout
   referring it to a data server that returns just
   the EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_PNFS_DS role, the client <span class="bcp14">MAY</span>
   assume that the lease_time attribute from the metadata
   server that returned the layout applies to the data
   server. Thus, the data server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be aware of the values

   For example, if one metadata server has a lease_time

   server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> renew a client's lease if the interval

          </h4>
<p id="section-13.4.4-1">
     The flag NFL4_UFLG_DENSE of the nfl_util4 data type (field nflh_util of the
     data type nfsv4_1_file_layouthint4 and field nfl_util of
     data type nfsv4_1_file_layout_ds_addr4) specifies how the data
     is packed within the
     data file on a data server.  It allows for two different data
     packings: sparse and dense.  The packing type determines the
     calculation that will be made to map the client-visible file offset
     to the offset within the data file located on the data server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.4.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.4.4-2">
   If nfl_util &amp; NFL4_UFLG_DENSE is zero, this means that
   sparse packing is being used. Hence, the logical offsets of the
   file as viewed by a client
   sending READs and WRITEs directly to the metadata server
   are the same offsets each data server uses when storing
   a stripe unit. The effect then, for striping patterns
   consisting of at least two stripe units, is for each
   data server file to be sparse or "holey". So for example,
   suppose there is a pattern with three stripe units, the stripe unit
   size is 4096 bytes, and there are three data servers in
   the pattern.  Then, the file in data server 1 will have
   stripe units 0, 3, 6, 9, ... filled; data server 2's
   file will have stripe units 1, 4, 7, 10, ... filled;
   and data server 3's file will have stripe units 2,
   5, 8, 11, ... filled. The unfilled stripe units of
   each file will be holes; hence, the files in each data
   server are sparse.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.4.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.4.4-3">
   If sparse packing is being used and a client attempts I/O to one of
   the holes, then an error <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be
   returned by the data server. Using the above example, if data server 3 received a READ or WRITE operation for block 4, the data server
   would return NFS4ERR_PNFS_IO_HOLE. Thus,
   data servers need to understand the striping pattern in order
   to support sparse packing.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.4.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.4.4-4">
   If nfl_util &amp; NFL4_UFLG_DENSE is one, this means that
   dense packing is being used, and the data server files have no holes.
   Dense packing might be selected because the data server does not
   (efficiently) support holey files or because the data server
   cannot recognize read-ahead unless there are no holes.
   If dense packing is indicated in the layout,
   the data files will be packed. Using the
   same striping pattern and stripe unit size that were used for
   the sparse packing example, the corresponding dense packing example would have
   all stripe units of all data files filled as follows:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.4.4-4">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">

        </h3>
<p id="section-13.5-1">
  The NFSv4.1 file layout supports multipathing to
  multiple data server addresses.
  Data-server-level multipathing is used for
  bandwidth scaling via trunking (<a class="xref" href="#Trunking">Section 2.10.5</a>) and for higher availability of use in the case of
  a data-server failure.  Multipathing allows the client
  to switch to another data server address which may be that
  of another data server that is exporting the
  same data stripe unit, without having to contact the
  metadata server for a new layout.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.5-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.5-2">
  To support data server multipathing, each element of
  the nflda_multipath_ds_list contains an array of one
  more data server network addresses.  This array (data
  type multipath_list4) represents a list of data servers
  (each identified by a network address), with the possibility
  that some data servers will appear in the list multiple times.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.5-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.5-3">

  The client is free to use any of the network addresses
  as a destination to send data server requests. If some
  network addresses are less optimal paths to the data than
  others, then the MDS <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> include those network
  addresses in an element of nflda_multipath_ds_list. If
  less optimal network addresses exist to provide failover, the 
  <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> method to offer the addresses is
  to provide them in a replacement device-ID-to-device-address 
  mapping, or a replacement device ID. When
  a client finds that no data server in an element of
  nflda_multipath_ds_list responds, it <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> send a
  GETDEVICEINFO to attempt to replace the existing
  device-ID-to-device-address mappings. If the MDS detects
  that all data servers represented by an element of
  nflda_multipath_ds_list are unavailable, the MDS <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span>
  send a CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID (if the client has indicated
  it wants device ID notifications for changed device IDs)
  to change the device-ID-to-device-address mappings to
  the available data servers. If the device ID itself will
  be replaced, the MDS <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> recall all layouts with the
  device ID, and thus force the client to get new layouts
  and device ID mappings via LAYOUTGET and GETDEVICEINFO.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.5-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.5-4">
  Generally, if two network addresses appear in an element
  of nflda_multipath_ds_list, they will designate the same
  data server, and the two data server addresses will
  support the implementation of
  client ID or session trunking (the latter is <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span>)
  as defined in <a class="xref" href="#Trunking">Section 2.10.5</a>.  The two
  data server addresses will share the same server owner
  or major ID of the server owner.  It is not always necessary for the
  two data server addresses to designate the same server 
  with trunking being used.  For example,
  the data could be read-only, and the data consist of
  exact replicas.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.5-4">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="section-13.10-1">
  A potential problem exists when a component data file on a
  particular data server has grown past EOF; the problem exists for
  both dense and sparse layouts.  Imagine the following scenario: a
  client creates a new file (size == 0) and writes to byte 131072; the
  client then seeks to the beginning of the file and reads byte 100.
  The client should receive zeroes back as a result of the READ. However,
  if the striping pattern directs the client to send the READ to
  a data server other than the one that received the
  client's original WRITE, the data server servicing the READ may
  believe that the file's size is still 0 bytes. In that event, the
  data server's READ response will contain zero bytes and an
  indication of EOF.  The data server can only return zeroes if it knows that
  the file's size has been extended. This would require the immediate
  propagation of the file's size to all data servers, which is
  potentially very costly.  Therefore, the client that has
  initiated the extension of the file's size <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be prepared to deal
  with these EOF conditions.
  When the offset in the arguments to READ
  is less than the client's view of the file size, if the READ response
  indicates EOF and/or contains fewer bytes than requested, the client
  will interpret such a response as a hole in the file, and the
  NFS client will substitute zeroes for the data.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.10-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.10-2">
  The NFSv4.1 protocol only provides close-to-open file data cache
  semantics; meaning that when the file is closed, all modified data is
  written to the server.  When a subsequent OPEN of the file is
  done, the change attribute is inspected for a difference from a
  cached value for the change attribute.  For the case above, this means
  that a LAYOUTCOMMIT will be done at close (along with the data
  WRITEs) and will update the file's size and change attribute.  Access
  from another client after that point will result in the appropriate
  size being returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.10-2">¶</a></p>

  As described in <a class="xref" href="#crash_recovery">Section 12.7</a>, the
  layout-type-specific storage protocol is responsible
  for handling the effects of I/Os that started before
  lease expiration and extend through lease expiration.
  The LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES layout type 
  can prevent all I/Os to data servers from
  being executed after lease expiration (this prevention is
  called "fencing"), without relying
  on a precise client lease timer and without requiring
  data servers to maintain lease timers. The
  LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES pNFS server has the flexibility to
  revoke individual layouts, and thus fence I/O on a per-file
  basis.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.11-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.11-2"> 
  In addition to lease expiration,
  the reasons a layout can be revoked include: client fails to respond to
  a CB_LAYOUTRECALL,
  the
  metadata server restarts, or administrative intervention. Regardless
  of the reason, once a client's layout has been revoked, the pNFS
  server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> prevent the client from sending I/O for the affected file
  from and to all data servers; in other words, it <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> fence the
  client from the affected file on the data servers.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.11-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-13.11-3"> 
  Fencing works as follows. As described in <a class="xref" href="#pnfs_session_stuff">Section 13.1</a>, in COMPOUND procedure
  requests to the data server, the data filehandle provided
  by the PUTFH operation and the stateid in the READ or
  WRITE operation are used to ensure that the client has
  a valid layout for the I/O being performed; if it does
  not, the I/O is rejected with NFS4ERR_PNFS_NO_LAYOUT.
  The server can simply check the stateid and, additionally,
  make the data filehandle stale if the layout specified
  a data filehandle that is different from the metadata server's
  filehandle for the file (see the nfl_fh_list description in
  <a class="xref" href="#file_data_types">Section 13.3</a>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-13.11-3">¶</a></p>

the implementation must normalize utf8str_cs strings within the
protocol before presenting the information to an application (at the

The attribute is an integer containing a pair of flags.

one, indicates that the server will accept (and generate) only
UTF-8 characters on the file system. If

<p id="section-15.1.1.3-4">
        In such cases, returning the error NFS4ERR_DELAY allows
        necessary preparatory operations to proceed without
        holding up requester resources such as a session slot.
        After delaying for period of time, the client can
        then re-send the operation in question, often as part
 of a nearly identical request.  Because of the need to avoid
 spurious reissues of non-idempotent operations and to avoid
 acting in response to NFS4ERR_DELAY errors returned on responses
 returned from the replier's reply cache,
 integration with the session-provided reply cache is necessary.
 There are a number of cases to deal with, each of which requires
 different sorts of handling by the requester and replier:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-15.1.1.3-4">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-15.1.1.3-5.1">
   If NFS4ERR_DELAY is returned on a SEQUENCE operation, the
   request is retried in full with the SEQUENCE operation
   containing the same  slot and sequence values.  In this case,
   the replier <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> avoid returning a response
          containing NFS4ERR_DELAY as the response to SEQUENCE solely
          because an earlier instance of the same request returned that error
          and it was stored in the reply cache. If the replier did this,
   the retries would not be effective as there would be no
   opportunity for the replier to see whether the condition that
   generated the NFS4ERR_DELAY had been rectified during the
   interim between the original request and the retry.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-15.1.1.3-5.1">¶</a>
</li>
              <li class="normal" id="section-15.1.1.3-5.2">
   If NFS4ERR_DELAY is returned on an operation other than SEQUENCE
   that validly appears as the first operation of a request, the handling
   is similar.  The request can be retried in full without modification.
   In this case as well,
   the replier <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> avoid returning a response containing
   NFS4ERR_DELAY as the response to an initial operation of a request
   solely on the basis
   of its presence in the reply cache.  If the replier did this,
   the retries would not be effective as there would be no
   opportunity for the replier to see whether the condition that
   generated the NFS4ERR_DELAY had been rectified during the
   interim between the original request and the retry.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-15.1.1.3-5.2">¶</a>
</li>
              <li class="normal" id="section-15.1.1.3-5.3">
   If NFS4ERR_DELAY is returned on an operation other than the first
   in the request, the request when retried <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> contain a SEQUENCE
   operation that is different than the original one, with either 
          the slot ID or the sequence value different from that in the original 
          request.  Because requesters do this, there is no need for the
   replier to take special care to avoid returning an
   NFS4ERR_DELAY error obtained from the reply cache.  When no non-idempotent
   operations have been processed before the NFS4ERR_DELAY was returned,
   the requester should retry the request in full, with the only
   difference from the original request being the modification to the
   slot ID or sequence value in the reissued SEQUENCE operation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-15.1.1.3-5.3">¶</a>
</li>
              <li class="normal" id="section-15.1.1.3-5.4">
                <p id="section-15.1.1.3-5.4.1">
   When NFS4ERR_DELAY is returned on an operation other than the first
   within a request and there has been a non-idempotent operation
   processed before the NFS4ERR_DELAY was returned, reissuing the request as is normally
   done would incorrectly cause the re-execution of the non-idempotent operation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-15.1.1.3-5.4.1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-15.1.1.3-5.4.2">
   To avoid this situation, the client should reissue the request without the
   non-idempotent operation.   The request still must use a SEQUENCE
   operation with either a different slot ID or sequence value from
   the SEQUENCE in the original request.  Because this is done, there
   is no way the replier could avoid spuriously re-executing the
   non-idempotent operation since the different SEQUENCE parameters
   prevent the requester from recognizing that the non-idempotent
   operation is being retried.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-15.1.1.3-5.4.2">¶</a></p>
</li>
            </ul>
<p id="section-15.1.1.3-6">
        Note that without the ability to return NFS4ERR_DELAY and the
        requester's willingness to re-send when receiving it, deadlock might
        result.  For example, if a recall is done, and if the delegation
 return or operations preparatory to delegation return are held up by
        other operations that need the delegation to be returned, 
        session slots might not be available.  The result could be
        deadlock.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-15.1.1.3-6">¶</a></p>

 As with the case of NFS4ERR_DELAY, it is possible that one or
 more non-idempotent operations may have been successfully executed
 within a COMPOUND before NFS4ERR_MOVED is returned.   Because of
 this, once the new location is determined, the original request
 that received the NFS4ERR_MOVED should not be re-executed in full.
 Instead, the client should send a new COMPOUND with any successfully
 executed non-idempotent
 operations removed.  When the client uses the same session for the
 new COMPOUND, its SEQUENCE operation should use a different slot ID or sequence.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-15.1.2.4-2">¶</a></p>

          </h4>
<p id="section-16.2.3-1">
      The COMPOUND procedure is used to combine one or more NFSv4
      operations into a
      single RPC request.  The server interprets each of the operations in
      turn.  If an operation is executed by the server and the status of that
      operation is NFS4_OK, then the next operation in the COMPOUND
      procedure is executed.  The server continues this process until there
      are no more operations to be executed or until one of the operations has a
      status value other than NFS4_OK.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3-2">
      In the processing of the COMPOUND procedure, the server may find that
      it does not have the available resources to execute any or all of the
      operations within the COMPOUND sequence. See
      <a class="xref" href="#COMPOUND_Sizing_Issues">Section 2.10.6.4</a> for a more detailed discussion.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3-3">
      The server will generally choose between two methods of decoding the
      client's request.  The first would be the traditional one-pass XDR
      decode.  If there is an XDR decoding error in this case, the RPC XDR
      decode error would be returned.  The second method would be to make an
      initial pass to decode the basic COMPOUND request and then to XDR
      decode the individual operations; the most interesting is the decode
      of attributes.  In this case, the server may encounter an XDR decode
      error during the second pass.  If it does, the server would return
      the error NFS4ERR_BADXDR to signify the decode error.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3-4">
      The COMPOUND arguments contain a "minorversion" field.  For NFSv4.1,
      the value for this field is 1.  If the server receives
      a COMPOUND procedure with a minorversion field value that it does not
      support, the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> return an error of
      NFS4ERR_MINOR_VERS_MISMATCH and a zero-length resultdata array.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3-5">
      Contained within the COMPOUND results is a "status" field.  If the
      results array length is non-zero, this status must be equivalent to
      the status of the last operation that was executed within the COMPOUND
      procedure.  Therefore, if an operation incurred an error then the
      "status" value will be the same error value as is being returned for
      the operation that failed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3-6">
      Note that operations zero and one are not defined for the
      COMPOUND procedure.  Operation 2 is not defined and is reserved for
      future definition and use with minor versioning.  If the server
      receives an operation array that contains operation 2 and the
      minorversion field has a value of zero, an error of
      NFS4ERR_OP_ILLEGAL, as described in the next paragraph, is returned to
      the client.  If an operation array contains an operation 2 and the
      minorversion field is non-zero and the server does not support the
      minor version, the server returns an error of
      NFS4ERR_MINOR_VERS_MISMATCH.  Therefore, the
      NFS4ERR_MINOR_VERS_MISMATCH error takes precedence over all other
      errors.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3-7">
      It is possible that the server receives a request that contains an
      operation that is less than the first legal operation (OP_ACCESS) or
      greater than the last legal operation (OP_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER).  In this
      case, the server's response will encode the opcode OP_ILLEGAL rather
      than the illegal opcode of the request. The status field in the
      ILLEGAL return results will be set to NFS4ERR_OP_ILLEGAL.  The COMPOUND
      procedure's return results will also be NFS4ERR_OP_ILLEGAL.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3-8">
      The definition of the "tag" in the request is left to the implementor.
      It may be used to summarize the content of the Compound request for
      the benefit of packet-sniffers and engineers debugging
      implementations.  However, the value of "tag" in the response <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span>
      be the same value as provided in the request.  This applies to the tag
      field of the CB_COMPOUND procedure as well.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3-8">¶</a></p>

      The current and saved filehandles are used throughout
      the protocol.  Most operations implicitly use
      the current filehandle as an argument, and many set
      the current filehandle as part of the results.
      The combination of client-specified sequences
      of operations and current and saved filehandle
      arguments and results allows for greater protocol
      flexibility.  The best or easiest example of current
      filehandle usage is a sequence like the following:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3.1.1-1">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-16.2.3.1.1-3">
      In this example, the PUTFH (<a class="xref" href="#OP_PUTFH">Section 18.19</a>) operation explicitly sets the current
      filehandle value while the result of each LOOKUP operation sets
      the current filehandle value to the resultant file system
      object.  Also, the client is able to insert GETATTR operations
      using the current filehandle as an argument.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3.1.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3.1.1-4">
       The PUTROOTFH (<a class="xref" href="#OP_PUTROOTFH">Section 18.21</a>) and
       PUTPUBFH (<a class="xref" href="#OP_PUTPUBFH">Section 18.20</a>) operations also set the
       current filehandle. The above example would replace "PUTFH fh1" with
       PUTROOTFH or PUTPUBFH with no filehandle argument in order to 
       achieve the same effect (on the assumption that "compA" is directly
       below the root of the namespace).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3.1.1-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3.1.1-5">
      Along with the current filehandle, there is a saved filehandle.
      While the current filehandle is set as the result of
      operations like LOOKUP, the saved filehandle must be set
      directly with the use of the SAVEFH operation.  The SAVEFH
      operation copies the current filehandle value to the saved
      value.  The saved filehandle value is used in combination with
      the current filehandle value for the LINK and RENAME
      operations.  The RESTOREFH operation will copy the saved filehandle value to the current filehandle value; as a result, the
      saved filehandle value may be used a sort of "scratch" area for
      the client's series of operations.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3.1.1-5">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-16.2.3.1.2-1">
      With NFSv4.1, additions of a current stateid and a saved stateid
      have been made to the COMPOUND processing environment; this
      allows for the passing of stateids between operations.  There
      are no changes to the syntax of the protocol, only changes to
      the semantics of a few operations.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3.1.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3.1.2-2">
      A "current stateid" is the stateid that is associated
      with the current filehandle.  The current stateid
      may only be changed by an operation that modifies
      the current filehandle or returns a stateid.  If an
      operation returns a stateid, it <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> set the current
      stateid to the returned value. If an operation sets
      the current filehandle but does not return a stateid,
      the current stateid <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be set to the all-zeros
      special stateid, i.e., (seqid, other) = (0, 0).
      If an operation uses a stateid as an argument but does
      not return a stateid, the current stateid <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> be
      changed.
      For example, PUTFH, PUTROOTFH, and PUTPUBFH
      will change the current server state from {ocfh,
      (osid)} to {cfh, (0, 0)}, while LOCK will change the current
      state from {cfh, (osid} to {cfh, (nsid)}.  Operations like
      LOOKUP that transform a current filehandle and
      component name into a new current filehandle will also
      change the current state to {0, 0}.  The SAVEFH
      and RESTOREFH operations will save and restore both
      the current filehandle and the current stateid as a set.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3.1.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-16.2.3.1.2-3">
      The following example is the common case of a simple READ
      operation with a normal stateid showing that the PUTFH
      initializes the current stateid to (0, 0). The subsequent READ
      with stateid (sid1) leaves the current stateid unchanged.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3.1.2-3">¶</a></p>

      This next example performs an OPEN with the root
      filehandle and, as a result, generates stateid (sid1). The next
      operation specifies the READ with the argument stateid set such
      that (seqid, other) are equal to (1, 0),
      but the current stateid set by the previous operation is
      actually used when the operation is evaluated. This allows correct
      interaction with any existing, potentially conflicting,
      locks.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3.1.2-5">¶</a></p>

      This next example is similar to the second in how
      it passes the stateid sid2 generated by the LOCK
      operation to the next READ operation.  This allows
      the client to explicitly surround a single I/O
      operation with a lock and its appropriate stateid to
      guarantee correctness with other client locks. The
      example also shows how SAVEFH and RESTOREFH can
      save and later reuse a filehandle and stateid, passing them as the
      current filehandle and stateid to a READ operation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-16.2.3.1.2-7">¶</a></p>

    The following tables summarize the operations of the NFSv4.1
    protocol and the corresponding designation of <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span>,
    <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span>, and <span class="bcp14">OPTIONAL</span> to implement or <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> implement.  The
    designation of <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> implement is reserved for those operations
    that were defined in NFSv4.0 and <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> be implemented in NFSv4.1.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-17-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-17-2">
    For the most part, the <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span>, <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span>, or <span class="bcp14">OPTIONAL</span> designation for
    operations sent by the client is for
    the server implementation.  The client is generally required to
    implement the operations needed for the operating environment for
    which it serves.  For example, a read-only NFSv4.1 client would
    have no need to implement the WRITE operation and is not required
    to do so.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-17-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-17-3">
    The <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> or <span class="bcp14">OPTIONAL</span> designation for
    callback operations sent by the server is for both the client
    and server. Generally, the client has the option of
    creating the backchannel and sending the operations on the
    fore channel that will be a catalyst for the server sending
    callback operations. A partial
    exception is CB_RECALL_SLOT; the only way the client can
    avoid supporting this operation is by not creating a backchannel.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-17-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-17-4">
    Since this is a summary of the operations and their designation,
    there are subtleties that are not presented here.  Therefore, if
    there is a question of the requirements of implementation, the

ACCESS determines the access rights that a user, as identified by the
credentials in the RPC request, has with respect to the file system
object specified by the current filehandle.  The client encodes the
set of access rights that are to be checked in the bit mask "access".
The server checks the permissions encoded in the bit mask.  If a
status of NFS4_OK is returned, two bit masks are included in the
response.  The first, "supported", represents the access rights for
which the server can verify reliably.  The second, "access",
represents the access rights available to the user for the filehandle
provided.  On success, the current filehandle retains its value.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.1.3-1">¶</a></p>

Note that the reply's supported and access fields <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span>
contain more values than originally set in the request's
access field.  For example, if the client sends an ACCESS
operation with just the ACCESS4_READ value set and the
server supports this value, the server <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> set more
than ACCESS4_READ in the supported field even if it could

    ACCESS4_EXECUTE is a challenging semantic to implement because

<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-18.1.3-9.1">
     Whether or not a regular file is executable ought to be
     the responsibility of the NFS client and not the server. And yet

     When a client executes a regular file, it has to
     read the file from the server. Strictly speaking,
     the server should not allow the client to read a file
     being executed unless the user has read permissions
     on the file. Requiring
     explicit read permissions on executable files in order to
     access them over NFS is not going to be acceptable to
     some users and storage administrators. Historically, NFS servers have allowed
     a user to READ a file if the user has execute access
     to the file.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.1.3-9.2">¶</a>

   As a practical example, the UNIX specification <span>[<a class="xref" href="#access_api">60</a>]</span> states that an implementation
   claiming conformance to UNIX may indicate in the
   access() programming interface's result that a
   privileged user has execute rights, even if no
   execute permission bits are set on the regular file's
   attributes. It is possible to claim conformance
   to the UNIX specification and instead not indicate
   execute rights in that situation, which is true for
   some operating environments. Suppose the operating
   environments of the client and server are implementing
   the access() semantics for privileged users differently,
   and the ACCESS operation implementations of the client
   and server follow their respective access() semantics.
   This can cause undesired behavior:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.1.3-10">¶</a></p>

     Even if the execution subsystem is checking for
     execute permission bits, there are more potential
     issues.  For example, suppose the client is invoking access()
     to build a "path search table" of all executable
     files in the user's "search path", where the path
     is a list of directories each containing executable
     files. Suppose there are two files each in separate
     directories of the search path, such that files have
     the same component name.  In the first directory
     the file has no execute permission bits set,
     and in the second directory the file has execute
     bits set. The path search table will indicate that
     the first directory has the executable file, but
     the execute subsystem will fail to execute it. The
     command shell might fail to try the second file in
     the second directory. And even if it did, this is
     a potential performance issue. Clearly, the desired
     outcome for the client is for the path search table
     to not contain the first file.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.1.3-11.2.2.2">¶</a>

In general, it is not sufficient for the client to attempt to deduce
access permissions by inspecting the uid, gid, and mode fields in the
file attributes or by attempting to interpret the contents of the ACL
attribute.  This is because the server may perform uid or gid mapping
or enforce additional access-control restrictions.  It is also
possible that the server may not be in the same ID space as the
client.  In these cases (and perhaps others), the client cannot
reliably perform an access check with only current file attributes.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.1.4-1">¶</a></p>

In the NFSv2 protocol, the only reliable way to determine
whether an operation was allowed was to try it and see if it succeeded
or failed.  Using the ACCESS operation in the NFSv4.1 protocol,
the client can ask the server to indicate whether or not one or more
classes of operations are permitted.  The ACCESS operation is provided
to allow clients to check before doing a series of operations that
will result in an access failure.  The OPEN operation provides a point
where the server can verify access to the file object and a method to
return that information to the client.  The ACCESS operation is still
useful for directory operations or for use in the case that the UNIX interface
access() is used on the client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.1.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.1.4-3">
The information returned by the server in response to an ACCESS call
is not permanent.  It was correct at the exact time that the server
performed the checks, but not necessarily afterwards.  The server can
revoke access permission at any time.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.1.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.1.4-4">
The client should use the effective credentials of the user to build
the authentication information in the ACCESS request used to determine
access rights.  It is the effective user and group credentials that
are used in subsequent READ and WRITE operations.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.1.4-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.1.4-5">
Many implementations do not directly support the ACCESS4_DELETE
permission.  Operating systems like UNIX will ignore the ACCESS4_DELETE
bit if set on an access request on a non-directory object.  In these
systems, delete permission on a file is determined by the access
permissions on the directory in which the file resides, instead of
being determined by the permissions of the file itself.  Therefore,
the mask returned enumerating which access rights can be determined
will have the ACCESS4_DELETE value set to 0.  This indicates to the
client that the server was unable to check that particular access
right.  The ACCESS4_DELETE bit in the access mask returned will then be
ignored by the client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.1.4-5">¶</a></p>

      The COMMIT operation is similar in operation and semantics to the
      <span><a class="xref" href="#fsync">POSIX fsync()</a> [<a class="xref" href="#fsync">22</a>]</span> system interface that synchronizes a file's state with the
      disk (file data and metadata is flushed to disk or stable
      storage). COMMIT performs the same operation for a client, flushing
      any unsynchronized data and metadata on the server to the server's
      disk or stable storage for the specified file.  Like fsync(), it may
      be that there is some modified data or no modified data to
      synchronize.  The data may have been synchronized by the server's
      normal periodic buffer synchronization activity.  COMMIT should return
      NFS4_OK, unless there has been an unexpected error.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.3.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.3.4-2">
      COMMIT differs from fsync() in that it is possible for the client to
      flush a range of the file (most likely triggered by a
      buffer-reclamation scheme on the client before the file has been
      completely written).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.3.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.3.4-3">
      The server implementation of COMMIT is reasonably simple.  If the
      server receives a full file COMMIT request, that is, starting at offset
      zero and count zero, it should do the equivalent of applying fsync() to
      the entire file.
      Otherwise, it should arrange to have the modified data in the range
      specified by offset and count to be flushed to stable storage.  In
      both cases, any metadata associated with the file must be flushed to
      stable storage before returning.  It is not an error for there to be
      nothing to flush on the server.  This means that the data and metadata
      that needed to be flushed have already been flushed or lost during the
      last server failure.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.3.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.3.4-4">
      The client implementation of COMMIT is a little more complex.  There
      are two reasons for wanting to commit a client buffer to stable
      storage.  The first is that the client wants to reuse a buffer.  In
      this case, the offset and count of the buffer are sent to the server
      in the COMMIT request.  The server then flushes any modified data based
      on the offset and count, and flushes any modified metadata associated with the
      file.  It then returns the status of the flush and the write verifier.
      The second reason for the client to generate a COMMIT is for a full
      file flush, such as may be done at close.  In this case, the client
      would gather all of the buffers for this file that contain uncommitted
      data, do the COMMIT operation with an offset of zero and count of zero, and
      then free all of those buffers.  Any other dirty buffers would be sent
      to the server in the normal fashion.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.3.4-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.3.4-5">
      After a buffer is written (via the WRITE operation)
      by the client with the "committed" field in the result of WRITE
      set to UNSTABLE4, the buffer must be considered as modified by
      the client
      until the buffer has either been flushed via a COMMIT operation or
      written via a WRITE operation with the "committed" field in the
      result set to FILE_SYNC4
      or DATA_SYNC4. This is done to prevent the buffer from being freed and
      reused before the data can be flushed to stable storage on the server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.3.4-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.3.4-6">
      When a response is returned from either a WRITE or a COMMIT operation
      and it contains a write verifier that differs from that previously
      returned by the server, the client will need to retransmit all of the
      buffers containing uncommitted data to the server.  How this is
      to be done is up to the implementor.  If there is only one buffer of
      interest, then it should be sent in a WRITE request
      with the FILE_SYNC4 stable parameter.  If there is more than one
      buffer, it might be worthwhile retransmitting all of the buffers in
      WRITE operations with the stable parameter set to UNSTABLE4 and then
      retransmitting the COMMIT operation to flush all of the data on the
      server to stable storage. However, if the server repeatably
      returns from COMMIT a verifier that differs from that returned
      by WRITE, the only way to ensure progress is to retransmit all
      of the buffers with WRITE requests with the FILE_SYNC4 stable parameter.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.3.4-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.3.4-7">
      The above description applies to page-cache-based systems as well as
      buffer-cache-based systems.  In the former systems, the virtual memory
      system will need to be modified instead of the buffer cache.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.3.4-7">¶</a></p>

      This operation purges all of the delegations awaiting recovery for a given client.
      This is useful for clients that do not commit delegation information
      to stable storage to indicate that conflicting requests need not be
      delayed by the server awaiting recovery of delegation information.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.5.3-1">¶</a></p>

      The client is NOT specified by the clientid field of

      The DELEGPURGE operation should be used by clients that record delegation
      information on stable storage on the client.  In this case,
      after the client recovers all delegations it knows of,
      it should immediately send a DELEGPURGE operation.
      Doing so will notify the server that
      no additional delegations for the client will be recovered allowing it
      to free resources, and avoid delaying other clients which make requests
      that conflict with the unrecovered delegations.  The set of
      delegations known to the server and the client might be different.  The
      reason for this is that after sending a request that
      resulted in a delegation, the client might experience a failure
      before it both received the delegation and

      hide the existence of opens relevant to that decision.  The reason
      is that when a client holds a delegation, the server 
      might not have an accurate account of the opens for that client, since
      the client may execute OPENs and CLOSEs locally.  The LINK operation
      must be delayed only until a definitive result can be obtained.
      For example, suppose there are multiple delegations and one of them establishes
      an open whose presence would prevent the link. Given the server's

      The locker argument specifies the lock-owner that is associated with
      the LOCK operation.  The locker4 structure is a switched union that
      indicates whether the client has already created byte-range locking
      state associated with the current open file and lock-owner.  In the
      case in which it has, the argument is just a stateid representing
      the set of

      a lock_seqid value that <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> be any value and <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be ignored

      In the case where no byte-range locking state has been established, or the client
      does not have the stateid available, the argument contains the
      stateid of the open file with which this lock is to be associated,
      together with the lock-owner with which the lock is to be associated.
      The open_to_lock_owner case covers the very first lock done by a

      LOCK operations are subject to permission checks and to checks against

      When the client sends a LOCK operation that corresponds to a range that

      includes multiple locks already granted to that lock-owner, in whole or

      (i.e., does not support POSIX locking semantics), the server will
      return the error NFS4ERR_LOCK_RANGE.  In that case, the client may
      return an error, or it may emulate the required operations, using only
      LOCK for ranges that do not include any bytes already locked by that
      lock-owner and LOCKU of locks held by that lock-owner (specifying an
      exactly matching range and type).  Similarly, when the client sends a
      LOCK operation that amounts to upgrading (changing from a READ_LT lock to a
      WRITE_LT lock) or downgrading (changing from WRITE_LT lock to a READ_LT lock)
      an existing byte-range lock, and the server does not support such a lock,
      the server will return NFS4ERR_LOCK_NOTSUPP.  Such operations may not

      When a client holds an OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation, the client holding that

      Thus, there can be no conflicting LOCK operations from such clients.
      Therefore, the client may be handling locking requests locally, 
      without
      doing LOCK operations on the server.  If it does that, it must be
      prepared to update the lock status on the server, by sending 
      appropriate LOCK and LOCKU operations before returning

<p id="section-18.16.3-1">
      The OPEN operation opens a regular file in a
      directory with the provided name or filehandle.
      OPEN can also create a file if a name is provided,
      and the client specifies it wants to create a file.
      Specification of whether or not a file is to be created,
      and the method of creation is via the openhow
      parameter. The openhow parameter consists of
      a switched union (data type opengflag4), which
      switches on the value of opentype (OPEN4_NOCREATE
      or OPEN4_CREATE). If OPEN4_CREATE is specified,
      this leads to another switched union (data type
      createhow4) that supports four cases of creation
      methods: UNCHECKED4, GUARDED4, EXCLUSIVE4,
      or EXCLUSIVE4_1. If opentype is OPEN4_CREATE,
      then the claim field of the claim field
      <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be one of CLAIM_NULL, CLAIM_DELEGATE_CUR, or
      CLAIM_DELEGATE_PREV, because these claim methods
      include a component of a file name.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.3-2">
      Upon success (which might entail creation of a new
      file), the current filehandle is replaced by that
      of the created or existing object.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.3-3">
      If the current filehandle is a named attribute
      directory, OPEN will then create or open a named
      attribute file.  Note that exclusive create
      of a named attribute is not supported.  If the
      createmode is EXCLUSIVE4 or EXCLUSIVE4_1 and the
      current filehandle is a named attribute directory,
      the server will return EINVAL.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.3-4">
      UNCHECKED4 means that the file should be created if a
      file of that name does not exist and encountering an
      existing regular file of that name is not an error.
      For this type of create, createattrs specifies the
      initial set of attributes for the file.  The set
      of attributes may include any writable attribute
      valid for regular files.  When an UNCHECKED4
      create encounters an existing file, the attributes
      specified by createattrs are not used, except that
      when createattrs specifies the size attribute
      with a size of zero, the existing file is truncated.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.3-5">
      If GUARDED4 is specified, the server checks for
      the presence of a duplicate object by name before
      performing the create.  If a duplicate exists,
      NFS4ERR_EXIST is returned.
      If the object does not exist, the request is
      performed as described for UNCHECKED4.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.3-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.3-6">
      For the UNCHECKED4 and GUARDED4 cases, where the
      operation is successful, the server will return
      to the client an attribute mask signifying which
      attributes were successfully set for the object.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.3-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.3-7">
      EXCLUSIVE4_1 and EXCLUSIVE4
      specify that the server is to follow exclusive
      creation semantics, using the verifier to ensure
      exclusive creation of the target.  The server should
      check for the presence of a duplicate object by name.
      If the object does not exist, the server creates
      the object and stores the verifier with the object.
      If the object does exist and the stored verifier
      matches the client provided verifier, the server
      uses the existing object as the newly created object.
      If the stored verifier does not match, then an error
      of NFS4ERR_EXIST is returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.3-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.3-8">
      If using EXCLUSIVE4, and if the server uses attributes to
      store the exclusive create verifier, the server will signify
      which attributes it used by setting the appropriate bits in
      the attribute mask that is returned in the results.
      Unlike UNCHECKED4, GUARDED4, and EXCLUSIVE4_1, EXCLUSIVE4 does
      not support the setting of attributes at file creation, and
      after a successful OPEN via EXCLUSIVE4, the client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span>
      send a SETATTR to set attributes to a known state.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.3-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.3-9">
      In NFSv4.1, EXCLUSIVE4 has been deprecated in favor
      of EXCLUSIVE4_1.
      Unlike EXCLUSIVE4, attributes may be provided
      in the EXCLUSIVE4_1 case, but because the server
      may use attributes of the target object to store
      the verifier, the set of allowable attributes
      may be fewer than the set of attributes SETATTR
      allows. The allowable attributes for EXCLUSIVE4_1
      are indicated in the suppattr_exclcreat (<a class="xref" href="#attrdef_suppattr_exclcreat">Section 5.8.1.14</a>) attribute. If the client
      attempts to set in cva_attrs an attribute that is not in
      suppattr_exclcreat, the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> return NFS4ERR_INVAL.
      The response field, attrset, indicates both which attributes
      the server set from cva_attrs and which attributes the
      server used to store the verifier. As described
      in <a class="xref" href="#OP_OPEN_IMPLEMENTATION">Section 18.16.4</a>, the client can compare
      cva_attrs.attrmask with attrset to determine which attributes
      were used to store the verifier.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.3-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.3-10">
      With the addition of persistent sessions and
      pNFS, under some conditions EXCLUSIVE4 <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span>
      be used by the client or supported by the server.
      The following table summarizes the appropriate and
      mandated exclusive create methods for implementations

      The OPEN operation provides for Windows share

      expected deny value is OPEN4_SHARE_DENY_NONE.  In the case that

      In absence of a persistent session, the client
      invokes exclusive create by setting the how parameter
      to EXCLUSIVE4 or EXCLUSIVE4_1.  In these cases, the
      client provides a verifier that can reasonably be
      expected to be unique.  A combination of a client
      identifier, perhaps the client network address,
      and a unique number generated by the client, perhaps

      verifier. The verifier <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be stored in stable storage to prevent
      erroneous failure on retransmission of the request. It is assumed that
      an exclusive create is being performed because exclusive semantics are
      critical to the application. Because of the expected usage, exclusive
      CREATE does not rely solely on the server's reply cache
      for storage of the verifier. A nonpersistent reply cache
      does not survive a crash and the session and reply cache

      During an exclusive CREATE request, if the object
      already exists, the server reconstructs the object's
      verifier and compares it with the verifier in
      the request. If they match, the server treats the
      request as a success. The request is presumed to

      for which the reply was lost and that the server
      duplicate request cache mechanism did not detect. If

      After the client has performed a successful

      If EXCLUSIVE4 was used, the attributes set in

      was used, the client determines the attributes
      used for the verifier by comparing attrset with
      cva_attrs.attrmask; any bits set in the former but
      not the latter identify the attributes used to store
      the verifier.  The client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> immediately send a
      SETATTR to set attributes used to store the verifier.
      Until it does so, the attributes used to store the
      verifier cannot be relied upon.  The subsequent

      Unless a persistent session is used, use of the

      the server does not detect the retransmission of the
      request, the operation can fail with NFS4ERR_EXIST,
      even though the create was performed successfully.
      The client would use this behavior in the case that
      the application has not requested an exclusive create
      but has asked to have the file truncated when the
      file is opened.  In the case of the client timing
      out and retransmitting the create request, the client

      OPEN resembles LOOKUP in that it generates a filehandle for the client
      to use.  Unlike LOOKUP though, OPEN creates server state on the
      filehandle.  In normal circumstances, the client can only release this
      state with a CLOSE operation.  CLOSE uses the current filehandle to
      determine which file to close.  Therefore, the client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> follow every
      OPEN operation with a GETFH operation in the same COMPOUND procedure.
      This will supply the client with the filehandle such that CLOSE can be
      used appropriately.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.16.4.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.16.4.1-2">
      Simply waiting for the lease on the file to expire is insufficient

      The OPENATTR operation is used to obtain the filehandle of the named
      attribute directory associated with the current filehandle.  The
      result of the OPENATTR will be a filehandle to an object of type
      NF4ATTRDIR.  From this filehandle, READDIR and LOOKUP operations can
      be used to obtain filehandles for the various named attributes
      associated with the original file system object.  Filehandles returned

      The createdir argument allows the client to signify if a named
      attribute directory should be created as a result of the OPENATTR
      operation.  Some clients may use the OPENATTR operation with a value
      of FALSE for createdir to determine if any named attributes exist for
      the object.  If none exist, then NFS4ERR_NOENT will be returned.  If
      createdir has a value of TRUE and no named attribute directory exists,
      one is created and its filehandle becomes the current filehandle.
      On the other hand, if createdir has a value of TRUE and the named
      attribute directory already exists, no error results and the filehandle
      of the existing directory becomes the current filehandle.  The 
      creation of a named attribute directory assumes

      With the NFSv3 public filehandle, the client is
      able to specify whether the pathname provided in the LOOKUP
      should be evaluated as either an absolute path relative to the
      server's root or relative to the public filehandle.  <span><a class="xref" href="#RFC2224">RFC 2224</a> [<a class="xref" href="#RFC2224">61</a>]</span> contains further discussion of
      the functionality.  With NFSv4.1, that type of
      specification is not directly available in the LOOKUP operation.
      The reason for this is because the component separators needed
      to specify absolute vs. relative are not allowed in NFSv4.  Therefore, the client is responsible for constructing its
      request such that the use of either PUTROOTFH or PUTPUBFH
      signifies absolute or relative evaluation of an NFS URL,
      respectively.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.20.4-2">¶</a></p>

      Note that there are warnings mentioned in <span><a class="xref" href="#RFC2224">RFC 2224</a> [<a class="xref" href="#RFC2224">61</a>]</span> with respect to the use of
      absolute evaluation and the restrictions the server may place on
      that evaluation with respect to how much of its namespace has
      been made available.  These same warnings apply to NFSv4.1.  It is likely, therefore, that because of server
      implementation details, an NFSv3 absolute public
      filehandle look up may behave differently than an NFSv4.1
      absolute resolution.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.20.4-3">¶</a></p>

      the public filehandle and an overloading of the pathname.
      This method is not available with NFSv4.1 as
      filehandles are not overloaded with special
      meaning and therefore do not provide the same

      cookieverf field must match the cookieverf returned
      by the READDIR in which the cookie was acquired.
      If the server determines that the cookieverf
      is no longer valid for the directory, the error
      NFS4ERR_NOT_SAME must be returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.23.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.23.3-4">
      The dircount field of the request is a hint of the maximum number
      of bytes of directory information that should be returned.  This value
      represents the total length of the names of the directory entries and the
      cookie value for these entries.  This length represents the XDR

      overhead.  The server <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> return less data.  If the

<p id="section-18.23.3-6">
      Finally, the request's attr_request field represents

      A successful reply consists of a list of

      are no more entries in the directory.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.23.3-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.23.3-8">
      The cookie value is only meaningful to the server and is used 
      as a cursor for the directory entry.  As mentioned, this cookie 
      is used by the client for subsequent READDIR operations so that it may
      continue reading a directory.  The cookie is similar in concept to a
      READ offset but <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> be interpreted as such by the client.
      Ideally, the cookie value <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> change if the directory is
      modified since the client may be caching these values.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.23.3-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.23.3-9">
      In some cases, the server may encounter an error while obtaining the
      attributes for a directory entry.  Instead of returning an error for
      the entire READDIR operation, the server can instead return the
      attribute rdattr_error (<a class="xref" href="#attrdef_rdattr_error">Section 5.8.1.12</a>).  With this, the server is able to
      communicate the failure to the client and not fail the entire
      operation in the instance of what might be a transient failure.
      Obviously, the client must request the fattr4_rdattr_error attribute
      for this method to work properly.  If the client does not request the
      attribute, the server has no choice but to return failure for the
      entire READDIR operation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.23.3-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.23.3-10">
      For some file system environments, the directory entries "." and ".."
      have special meaning, and in other environments, they do not.  If the
      server supports these special entries within a directory, they <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> be returned to the client as part of the READDIR response.  To
      enable some client environments, the cookie values of zero, 1, and 2 are
      to be considered reserved.  Note that the UNIX client will use these
      values when combining the server's response and local representations
      to enable a fully formed UNIX directory presentation to the

      The server's file system directory representations
      can differ greatly.  A client's programming
      interfaces may also be bound to the local operating
      environment in a way that does not translate well
      into the NFS protocol.  Therefore, the use of the
      dircount and maxcount fields are provided to enable
      the client to provide hints to the server.  If the
      client is aggressive about attribute collection
      during a READDIR, the server has an idea of how to
      limit the encoded response.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.23.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.23.4-2">
      If dircount is zero, the server bounds the reply's

      The cookieverf may be used by the server to help manage cookie values
      that may become stale.  It should be a rare occurrence that a server is
      unable to continue properly reading a directory with the provided
      cookie/cookieverf pair.  The server <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> make every effort to avoid
      this condition since the application at the client might be unable to
      properly handle this type of failure.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.23.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.23.4-4">
      The use of the cookieverf will also protect the client from using
      READDIR cookie values that might be stale.  For example, if the file
      system has been migrated, the server might or might not be able to use the
      same cookie values to service READDIR as the previous server used.
      With the client providing the cookieverf, the server is able to
      provide the appropriate response to the client.  This prevents the
      case where the server accepts a cookie value but the underlying
      directory has changed and the response is invalid from the client's
      context of its previous READDIR.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.23.4-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.23.4-5">
      Since some servers will not be returning "." and ".." entries as has
      been done with previous versions of the NFS protocol, the client that
      requires these entries be present in READDIR responses must fabricate
      them.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.23.4-5">¶</a></p>

      NFSv3 required a different operator RMDIR for directory
      removal and REMOVE for non-directory removal. This allowed clients to
      skip checking the file type when being passed a non-directory delete
      system call (e.g., <span><a class="xref" href="#unlink">unlink()</a> [<a class="xref" href="#unlink">24</a>]</span> in POSIX) to remove a directory, as well as
      the converse (e.g., a rmdir() on a non-directory) because they knew the
      server would check the file type.  NFSv4.1 REMOVE can be used to
      delete any directory entry independent of its file type. The
      implementor of an NFSv4.1 client's entry points from the
      unlink() and rmdir() system calls should first check the file type
      against the types the system call is allowed to remove before sending
      a REMOVE operation. Alternatively, the implementor can produce a COMPOUND call
      that includes a LOOKUP/VERIFY sequence of operations to verify the file type before
      a REMOVE operation in the same COMPOUND call.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.25.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.25.4-2">
      The concept of last reference is server
      specific. However, if the numlinks field in the
      previous attributes of the object had the value 1,
      the client should not rely on referring to the
      object via a filehandle. Likewise, the client
      should not rely on the resources (disk space,
      directory entry, and so on) formerly associated
      with the object becoming immediately available.
      Thus, if a client needs to be able to continue to
      access a file after using REMOVE to remove it, the
      client should take steps to make sure that the file
      will still be accessible.  While the traditional
      mechanism used is to RENAME the file from its old

      The server <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> impose restrictions on the RENAME
      operation such that RENAME may not be done when the
      file being renamed is open or when that open is done
      by particular protocols, or with particular options
      or access modes.  Similar restrictions may be applied
      when a file exists with the target name and is open.

      If a server does implement such restrictions and those restrictions
      include cases of NFSv4 opens preventing successful execution of
      a rename, the server needs to recall any delegations that could
      hide the existence of opens relevant to that decision.  This is 
      because when a client holds a delegation, the server
      might not have an accurate account of the opens for that client, since
      the client may execute OPENs and CLOSEs locally.  The RENAME operation
      need only be delayed until a definitive result can be obtained.  For
      example, if there are multiple delegations and one of them establishes
      an open whose presence would prevent the rename, given the server's 
      semantics, NFS4ERR_FILE_OPEN may be returned to the caller as soon
      as that delegation is returned without waiting for other delegations
      to be returned.  Similarly, if such opens are not associated with 
      delegations, NFS4ERR_FILE_OPEN can be returned immediately with no 
      delegation recall being done.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.26.4-3">¶</a></p>

      If the current filehandle or the saved filehandle designates a

      the delegation <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be recalled, and the operation cannot proceed
      until the delegation is returned or revoked.  Except where this
      happens very quickly, one or more NFS4ERR_DELAY errors will be
      returned to requests made while delegation remains outstanding.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.26.4-4">¶</a></p>

      will be generated as a result of this operation.
      When oldname and rename refer to the same file,
      no notification is generated (because, as <a class="xref" href="#OP_RENAME_DESCRIPTION">Section 18.26.3</a> states, the server

          when the error value of NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC is returned from
          another NFS operation.  This signifies to the client that the
          server's security policy is different from what the client is
          currently using.  At this point, the client is expected to
          obtain a list of possible security flavors and choose what best
          suits its policies.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.29.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.29.4-2">
          As mentioned, the server's security
          policies will determine when a client
          request receives NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC.  See <a class="xref" href="#error_op_returns">Table 14</a> for a list of operations
          that can return NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC. In addition,
          when READDIR returns attributes, the rdattr_error
          (<a class="xref" href="#attrdef_rdattr_error">Section 5.8.1.12</a>)
          can contain NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC. Note that CREATE and
          REMOVE <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> return NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC. The
          rationale for CREATE is that unless the
          target name exists, it cannot have a separate
          security policy from the parent directory,
          and the security policy of the parent was
          checked when its filehandle was injected into
          the COMPOUND request's operations stream (for
          similar reasons, an OPEN operation that creates
          the target <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> return NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC). If
          the target name exists, while it might have a
          separate security policy, that is irrelevant
          because CREATE <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> return NFS4ERR_EXIST.
          The rationale for REMOVE is that while that
          target might have a separate security policy, the
          target is going to be removed, and so the
          security policy of the parent trumps that of the
          object being removed. RENAME and LINK <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> return
          NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC, but the NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC error
          applies only to the saved filehandle (see <a class="xref" href="#link_rename">Section 2.6.3.1.2</a>). Any NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC
          error on the current filehandle used by LINK and
          RENAME <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be returned by the PUTFH, PUTPUBFH,
          PUTROOTFH, or RESTOREFH operation that injected
          the current filehandle.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.29.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.29.4-3">
          With the exception of LINK and RENAME,
          the set of operations that can return NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC
          represents the point at which the client can inject a
          filehandle into the "current filehandle" at the server.  The
          filehandle is either provided by the client (PUTFH, PUTPUBFH,
          PUTROOTFH), generated as a result of a name-to-filehandle
          translation (LOOKUP and OPEN), or generated from the saved filehandle
          via RESTOREFH. As <a class="xref" href="#PUTFHplusSAVEFH">Section 2.6.3.1.1.1</a> states,
          a put filehandle operation followed by SAVEFH <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span>
          return NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC. Thus, the RESTOREFH operation, under
          certain conditions (see <a class="xref" href="#putfh_series">Section 2.6.3.1.1</a>), is
          permitted to return NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC so that security policies
          can be honored.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.29.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.29.4-4">
          The READDIR operation will not directly return the
          NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC error.  However, if the READDIR request
          included a request for attributes, it is possible that the
          READDIR request's security triple did not match that of a
          directory entry.  If this is the case and the client has
          requested the rdattr_error attribute, the server will return the
          NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC error in rdattr_error for the entry.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.29.4-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.29.4-5">
          To resolve an error return of

      The stateid argument for SETATTR is used to provide byte-range locking

      it has the same locking requirements as a corresponding WRITE.  Any
      SETATTR that sets the size attribute is incompatible with a share
      reservation that specifies OPEN4_SHARE_DENY_WRITE.  The area between the old
      end-of-file and the new end-of-file is considered to be modified just
      as would have been the case had the area in question been specified as
      the target of WRITE, for the purpose of checking conflicts with byte-range
      locks, for those cases in which a server is implementing mandatory
      byte-range locking behavior.  A valid stateid <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> always be specified.

      The file size attribute is used to request changes
      to the size of a file. A value of zero causes the
      file to be truncated, a value less than the current
      size of the file causes data from new size to the
      end of the file to be discarded, and a size greater
      than the current size of the file causes logically
      zeroed data bytes to be added to the end of the
      file.  Servers are free to implement this using
      unallocated bytes (holes) or allocated data bytes
      set to zero. Clients should not make any assumptions
      regarding a server's implementation of this feature,
      beyond that the bytes in the affected byte-range returned by
      READ will be zeroed.  Servers <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> support extending

      SETATTR is not guaranteed to be atomic.  A failed SETATTR may partially

      until each such delegation is returned 
      or revoked.  
      In all cases in which delegations are recalled, the server
      is likely to return one or more NFS4ERR_DELAY errors while the

      The WRITE operation is used to write data to a regular file.  The
      target file is specified by the current filehandle.  The offset
      specifies the offset where the data should be written.  An offset of zero
      specifies that the write should start at the beginning of the
      file.  The count, as encoded as part of the opaque data parameter,
      represents the number of bytes of data that are to be written.  If the
      count is zero, the WRITE will succeed and return a count of zero subject to permissions checking.  The server <span class="bcp14">MAY</span>
      write fewer bytes than requested by the client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.32.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.32.3-2">
      The client specifies with the stable parameter the method
      of how the data is to be processed by the server.  If stable is
      FILE_SYNC4, the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> commit the data written plus all
      file system metadata to stable storage before returning results. This
      corresponds to the NFSv2 protocol semantics.  Any other
      behavior constitutes a protocol violation.  If stable is DATA_SYNC4,
      then the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> commit all of the data to stable storage and
      enough of the metadata to retrieve the data before returning.  The
      server implementor is free to implement DATA_SYNC4 in the same fashion
      as FILE_SYNC4, but with a possible performance drop.  If stable is
      UNSTABLE4, the server is free to commit any part of the data and the
      metadata to stable storage, including all or none, before returning a
      reply to the client. There is no guarantee whether or when any
      uncommitted data will subsequently be committed to stable storage. The
      only guarantees made by the server are that it will not destroy any
      data without changing the value of writeverf and that it will not commit
      the data and metadata at a level less than that requested by the
      client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.32.3-2">¶</a></p>

      Except when special stateids are used, the 
      stateid value for a WRITE request represents a value returned from
      a previous byte-range LOCK or OPEN request or the stateid
      associated with a delegation.  The stateid identifies the associated
      owners if any and is

      The verifier is defined to allow a client to detect
      different instances of an NFSv4.1 protocol server
      over which cached, uncommitted data may be lost. In
      the most likely case, the verifier allows the client
      to detect server restarts.  This information is
      required so that the client can safely determine
      whether the server could have lost cached data.
      If the server fails unexpectedly and the client has
      uncommitted data from previous WRITE requests (done
      with the stable argument set to UNSTABLE4 and in
      which the result committed was returned as UNSTABLE4
      as well), the server might not have flushed cached
      data to stable storage. The burden of recovery is

      A suggested verifier would be to use the time that

      regardless of the value of the stable field in the arguments. A server
      that uses an NVRAM accelerator may choose to implement this policy.

      If mandatory byte-range locking is in effect for the file,

      lock, either the server attempted to temporarily effectively upgrade
      this READ_LT lock to a WRITE_LT lock or the server has no upgrade
      capability. If the server attempted to upgrade the READ_LT lock and
      failed, it is pointless for the client to re-attempt the upgrade via
      the LOCK operation, because there might be another client also trying
      to upgrade.  If two clients are blocked trying to upgrade the same lock,
      the clients deadlock.  If the server has no upgrade capability, then

      or revoked.  Except where this
      happens very quickly, one or more NFS4ERR_DELAY errors will be
      returned to requests made while the delegation remains outstanding.
      Normally, delegations will not be recalled as a result of a WRITE
      operation since the recall will occur as a result of an earlier
      OPEN.  However, since it is possible for a WRITE to be done with
      a special stateid, the server needs to check for this case even

      If a session's channel loses all connections, depending on
      the client ID's state protection and type of channel,
      the client might need to use
      BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION to associate a new connection. If the
      server restarted and does not keep the reply cache in stable
      storage, the server will not recognize the session ID.
      The client will ultimately have to invoke EXCHANGE_ID to
      create a new client ID and session.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.34.4-1">¶</a></p>

      included in the spo_must_enforce set when the
      client ID was created (<a class="xref" href="#OP_EXCHANGE_ID">Section 18.35</a>).
      If so, there is an issue if SET_SSV is sent, no response
      is returned, and the last connection associated
      with the client ID drops.  The client, per
      the sessions model, <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> retry the SET_SSV. But
      it needs a new connection to do so, and <span class="bcp14">MUST</span>
      associate that connection with the session via a
      BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION authenticated with the SSV
      GSS mechanism. The problem is that the RPCSEC_GSS
      message integrity codes use a subkey derived from the SSV as the
      key and the
      SSV may have changed. While there are multiple

     When a client specifies SP4_MACH_CRED or SP4_SSV,
     it also provides two lists of operations (each
     expressed as a bitmap).  The first list
     is spo_must_enforce and consists of those operations
     the client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> send (subject to the server confirming the
     list of operations in the result of EXCHANGE_ID) with the
     machine credential (if SP4_MACH_CRED protection is
     specified) or the SSV-based credential (if SP4_SSV
     protection is used).  The client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> send the
     operations with RPCSEC_GSS credentials that specify
     the RPC_GSS_SVC_INTEGRITY or RPC_GSS_SVC_PRIVACY
     security service.  Typically, the first list of
     operations includes EXCHANGE_ID, CREATE_SESSION,
     DELEGPURGE, DESTROY_SESSION, BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION,
     and DESTROY_CLIENTID.  The client <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> specify
     in this list any operations that require a filehandle
     because the server's access policies <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> conflict with
     the client's choice, and thus the client would then be
     unable to access a subset of the server's namespace.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.35.3-23">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.35.3-24">

     Note that if SP4_SSV protection is specified, and
     the client indicates that CREATE_SESSION must be
     protected with SP4_SSV, because the SSV cannot exist
     without a confirmed client ID, the first CREATE_SESSION
     <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> instead be sent using the machine credential,
     and the server <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> accept the machine credential.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.35.3-24">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.35.3-25">

     There is a corresponding result, also called spo_must_enforce,
     of the operations for which the server will require SP4_MACH_CRED or
     SP4_SSV protection. Normally, the server's result
     equals the client's argument, but the result <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> be different.
     If the client requests one or more operations in
     the set { EXCHANGE_ID, CREATE_SESSION,
     DELEGPURGE, DESTROY_SESSION, BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION,
     DESTROY_CLIENTID }, then the result spo_must_enforce

     If spo_must_enforce in the results has BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION

     the client <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> use the machine (if SP4_MACH_CRED protection is used)

     The second list is spo_must_allow and consists of those

     the client wants to have the option of sending with the machine credential or
     the SSV-based credential, even if the object the

     The corresponding result, also called

     credentials with.
     Normally, the server's result

     The purpose of spo_must_allow is to allow clients to
     solve the following conundrum. Suppose the client ID
     is confirmed with EXCHGID4_FLAG_BIND_PRINC_STATEID,
     and it calls OPEN with the RPCSEC_GSS credentials of
     a normal user. Now suppose the user's credentials expire,
     and cannot be renewed (e.g., a Kerberos ticket granting ticket
     expires, and the user has logged off and will not be
     acquiring a new ticket granting ticket). The client will be
     unable to send CLOSE without the user's credentials, which is to
     say the client has to either leave the state on the server
     or re-send EXCHANGE_ID with a new verifier to
     clear all state, that is, unless the client includes
     CLOSE on the list of operations in spo_must_allow and the

      CREATE_SESSION can be sent with or without a preceding SEQUENCE

      If CREATE_SESSION is sent with a preceding SEQUENCE

      relation to the session specified in the SEQUENCE operation, although
      the two sessions might be associated with the same client ID.

      After the client received a reply to an EXCHANGE_ID operation that contains
      a new, unconfirmed client ID,
      the server expects the client to follow
      with a CREATE_SESSION operation to confirm the client ID. The
      server expects value of csa_sequenceid in the arguments to
      that CREATE_SESSION to be
      to equal the value of the field eir_sequenceid that was returned in
      results of the EXCHANGE_ID that returned the unconfirmed
      client ID.
      Before the server replies to that EXCHANGE_ID operation,
      it initializes the client ID slot to be equal
      to eir_sequenceid - 1 (accounting for underflow),
      and records a contrived CREATE_SESSION result
      with a "cached" result of NFS4ERR_SEQ_MISORDERED.
      With the client ID slot thus initialized, the processing of the
      CREATE_SESSION operation is divided into four phases:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.36.4-6">¶</a></p>
<ol class="normal type-1" id="section-18.36.4-7" start="1" type="1">

        Client record look up. The server looks up the client ID
        in its client record table.
        If the server contains no records
        with client ID equal to clientid_arg, then most
        likely the client's state has been purged during a
        period of inactivity, possibly due to a loss of
        connectivity.  NFS4ERR_STALE_CLIENTID is returned,
        and no changes are made to any client records on
        the server. Otherwise, the server goes to phase 2.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.36.4-7.1">¶</a>

        sequence ID in the client ID's slot, then this is a replay 
        of the previous CREATE_SESSION request, and the server
        returns the cached result.
        If csa_sequenceid is not equal to the sequence ID in the slot,
        and is more than one greater (accounting for wraparound),
        then the server returns the error NFS4ERR_SEQ_MISORDERED,
        and does not change the slot.  If csa_sequenceid is
        equal to the slot's sequence ID + 1 (accounting for
        wraparound), then the slot's sequence ID is set to
        csa_sequenceid, and the CREATE_SESSION processing goes to
        the next phase. A subsequent new CREATE_SESSION call
        over the same client ID <span class="bcp14">MUST</span>

      Directory delegations provide the benefit of improving cache
      consistency of namespace information. This is done through
      synchronous callbacks. A server must support synchronous
      callbacks in order to support directory delegations. In addition
      to that, asynchronous notifications provide a way to reduce
      network traffic as well as improve client performance in certain
      conditions.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.39.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.39.4-2">
      Notifications are specified in terms of potential
      changes to the directory. A client can ask to be
      notified of events by setting one or more
      bits in gdda_notification_types.
      The client can ask for notifications on addition of entries
      to a directory (by setting the
      NOTIFY4_ADD_ENTRY in gdda_notification_types),
      notifications on entry removal
      (NOTIFY4_REMOVE_ENTRY), renames
      (NOTIFY4_RENAME_ENTRY), directory attribute
      changes (NOTIFY4_CHANGE_DIR_ATTRIBUTES),
      and cookie verifier changes
      (NOTIFY4_CHANGE_COOKIE_VERIFIER) by setting
      one or more corresponding bits in the
      gdda_notification_types field.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.39.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.39.4-3">
      The client can also ask for
      notifications of changes to
      attributes of directory entries
      (NOTIFY4_CHANGE_CHILD_ATTRIBUTES)
      in order to keep its attribute cache up to date. However, any
      changes made to child attributes do not cause the delegation to
      be recalled. If a client is interested in directory entry
      caching or negative name caching, it can set the
      gdda_notification_types appropriately to its particular need 
      and the server will notify it of
      all changes that would otherwise invalidate its name cache. The
      kind of notification a client asks for may depend on the
      directory size, its rate of change, and the applications being
      used to access that directory. The enumeration of the conditions under
      which a client might ask for a notification is out of the scope
      of this specification.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.39.4-3">¶</a></p>

      For attribute notifications, the client
      will set bits in the gdda_dir_attributes
      bitmap to indicate which attributes
      it wants to be notified of. If the server does not support
      notifications for changes to a certain attribute, it <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span>
      set that attribute in the supported attribute bitmap
      specified in the reply (gddr_dir_attributes). The client will
      also set in the gdda_child_attributes bitmap the attributes
      of directory entries it wants to be notified of, and
      the server will indicate in gddr_child_attributes which
      attributes of directory entries it will notify the client of.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.39.4-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.39.4-5">
      The client will also let the server know if
      it wants to get the notification as soon as the attribute change
      occurs or after a certain delay by setting a delay factor;
      gdda_child_attr_delay is for attribute changes to directory entries and
      gdda_dir_attr_delay is for attribute changes to the directory. If this
      delay factor is set to zero, that indicates to the server that
      the client wants to be notified of any attribute changes as soon
      as they occur. If the delay factor is set to N seconds, the server will
      make a best-effort guarantee that attribute updates are
      synchronized within N seconds.
      If the client asks
      for a delay factor that the server does not support or that may
      cause significant resource consumption on the server by causing
      the server to send a lot of notifications, the server should not
      commit to sending out notifications for attributes and
      therefore must not set the appropriate bit in the
      gddr_child_attributes and gddr_dir_attributes bitmaps in the response.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.39.4-5">¶</a></p>

      The GETDEVICEINFO operation returns pNFS storage device address
      information for the specified device ID.
      The client identifies the device information to be returned by
      providing the gdia_device_id and gdia_layout_type that uniquely
      identify the device.  The client provides gdia_maxcount
      to limit the number of bytes for the result.  This maximum size
      represents all of the data being returned within the
      GETDEVICEINFO4resok structure and includes the XDR overhead.
      The server may return less data.  If the server is unable to
      return any information within the gdia_maxcount limit, the error
      NFS4ERR_TOOSMALL will be returned. However, if gdia_maxcount is
      zero, NFS4ERR_TOOSMALL <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> be returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.40.3-1">¶</a></p>

      the response as invalid and behave as if the server returned
      an error, even if the client does have support for the 
      layout type returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.40.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.40.3-3">

      The client also provides a notification bitmap,
      gdia_notify_types, for the device ID mapping
      notification for which it is interested in receiving;
      the server must support device ID notifications
      for the notification request to have affect.
      The notification mask is composed in the same
      manner as the bitmap for file attributes (<a class="xref" href="#fattr4">Section 3.3.7</a>).  The numbers of bit positions
      are listed in the notify_device_type4 enumeration type
      (<a class="xref" href="#OP_CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID">Section 20.12</a>). Only
      two enumerated values of notify_device_type4 currently
      apply to GETDEVICEINFO:
      NOTIFY_DEVICEID4_CHANGE
      and NOTIFY_DEVICEID4_DELETE (see <a class="xref" href="#OP_CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID">Section 20.12</a>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.40.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.40.3-4">
      The notification bitmap applies only to the specified device ID.
      If a client sends a GETDEVICEINFO operation on a deviceID multiple times,
      the last notification bitmap is used by the server for
      subsequent notifications. If the bitmap is zero or empty,
      then the device ID's notifications are turned off.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.40.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.40.3-5">
     If the client wants to just update or turn off notifications,
     it <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> send a GETDEVICEINFO operation with gdia_maxcount set to zero.
     In that event, if the device ID is valid, the reply's da_addr_body

<p id="section-18.40.3-6">
      If an unknown device ID is given in gdia_device_id,
      the server returns NFS4ERR_NOENT.

      Otherwise, the device address
      information is returned in gdir_device_addr. 
      Finally, if the server supports
      notifications for device ID mappings, the gdir_notification
      result will contain a bitmap of which notifications
      it will actually send to the client (via CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID,

       If the client believes it has layouts that refer to the

       the deleted device ID have been revoked.
       The client should send a TEST_STATEID request using the
       stateid for each layout that might have been revoked. If
       TEST_STATEID indicates that any layouts have been revoked, the
       client must recover from layout revocation as described in

      may use this information to determine whether the file's size
      needs to be updated.  If the metadata server updates the file's
      size as the result of the LAYOUTCOMMIT operation, it must return
      the new size (locr_newsize.ns_size) as part of the results.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.42.3-6">¶</a></p>

      The loca_time_modify field
      allows the client to suggest a modification time it would like the metadata
      server to set.  The metadata server may use the suggestion or
      it may use the time of the LAYOUTCOMMIT operation to set the modification
      time.  If the metadata server uses the client-provided
      modification time, it should ensure that time does not flow backwards.  If the
      client wants to force the metadata server to set an exact time,
      the client should use a SETATTR operation in a COMPOUND right
      after LAYOUTCOMMIT.  See <a class="xref" href="#committing_layout">Section 12.5.4</a> for
      more details.  If the client desires the resultant modification time,
      it should construct the COMPOUND so that a GETATTR
      follows the LAYOUTCOMMIT.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.42.3-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.42.3-8">
     The loca_layoutupdate argument to LAYOUTCOMMIT provides a mechanism
     for a client to provide layout-specific updates to the metadata
     server.  For example, the layout update can describe what byte-ranges
     of the original layout have been used and what byte-ranges can be
     deallocated.  There is no NFSv4.1 file layout-specific layoutupdate4
     structure.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.42.3-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.42.3-9">
      The layout information is more verbose for block devices than for
      objects and files because the latter two hide the details of block
      allocation behind their storage protocols.  At the minimum, the
      client needs to communicate changes to the end-of-file location back
      to the server, and, if desired, its view of the file's modification
      time.  For block/volume layouts, it needs to specify precisely
      which blocks have been used.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.42.3-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.42.3-10">
      If the layout identified in the arguments does not exist, the
      error NFS4ERR_BADLAYOUT is returned.  The layout being committed
      may also be rejected if it does not correspond to an existing
      layout with an iomode of LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.42.3-10">¶</a></p>

      The client <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> also use LAYOUTCOMMIT with the

      I/O errors for object-based storage layouts, as normally done
      during normal operation. Doing so may help the metadata server
      to recover files more efficiently after restart.  For example,
      some file system implementations may require expansive recovery
      of file system objects if the metadata server does not get a
      positive indication from all clients holding a LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW layout that
      they have successfully completed all their writes.  Sending a
      LAYOUTCOMMIT (if required) and then following with LAYOUTRETURN

      The LAYOUTGET operation requests a layout from the metadata server for reading or
      writing the file given by the filehandle at the
      byte-range specified by offset and length.  Layouts are
      identified by the client ID (derived from the session ID in the
      preceding SEQUENCE operation), current filehandle, layout type
      (loga_layout_type), and the layout stateid (loga_stateid).  The
      use of the loga_iomode field depends upon the layout type, but should
      reflect the client's data access intent.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.3-1">¶</a></p>

      If the metadata server is in a grace period, and does not

<p id="section-18.43.3-3">
      The LAYOUTGET operation returns layout information
      for the specified byte-range: a layout.
      The client actually specifies two ranges, both starting
      at the offset in the loga_offset field. The first
      range is between loga_offset and loga_offset + loga_length - 1
      inclusive. This range indicates the desired range the client
      wants the layout to cover. The second range is between
      loga_offset and loga_offset + loga_minlength - 1 inclusive. This
      range indicates the required range the client needs the layout
      to cover. Thus, loga_minlength <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be less than or equal to
      loga_length.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.43.3-4">
      When a length field is set to NFS4_UINT64_MAX,
      this indicates a desire (when loga_length is NFS4_UINT64_MAX)
      or requirement (when loga_minlength is NFS4_UINT64_MAX)
      to get a layout from loga_offset through the
      end-of-file, regardless of the file's length.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.3-4">¶</a></p>

       If loga_minlength is zero, this is an indication
       to the metadata server that the client desires any layout
       at offset loga_offset or less that the metadata server has
       "readily available". Readily is subjective, and depends on
       the layout type and the pNFS server implementation. For example,
       some metadata servers might have to pre-allocate stable
       storage when they receive a request for a range of a
       file that goes beyond the file's current length.
       If loga_minlength is zero and
       loga_length is greater than zero, this tells the
       metadata server what range of the layout the client would
       prefer to have. If loga_length and loga_minlength
       are both zero, then the client is indicating that it desires
       a layout of any length with the ending offset of the range
       no less than the value specified loga_offset, and the starting offset at or
       below loga_offset. If the metadata server does not have
       a layout that is readily available, then it <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> return

      a layout across multiple OPENs. The client specifies
      a layout type that limits what kind of layout the
      metadata server will return.  This prevents metadata servers from
      granting layouts that are unusable by the client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.4-1">¶</a></p>

      As indicated by <a class="xref" href="#layout_hell">Table 22</a> and
      <a class="xref" href="#layout_hell2">Table 23</a>, the specification of
      LAYOUTGET allows a pNFS client and server considerable
      flexibility.

      A pNFS client can take several strategies for sending
      LAYOUTGET. Some examples are as follows.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.4-2">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-18.43.4-3.1">
       If LAYOUTGET is preceded by OPEN in the same
       COMPOUND request and the OPEN requests OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_READ access,
       the client might opt to request a _READ layout
       with loga_offset set to zero, loga_minlength set to
       zero, and loga_length set to NFS4_UINT64_MAX. If
       the file has space allocated to it, that space is
       striped over one or more storage devices, and there
       is either no conflicting layout or the concept of
       a conflicting layout does not apply to the pNFS
       server's layout type or implementation, then the
       metadata server might return a layout with a starting offset
       of zero, and a length equal to the length of the
       file, if not NFS4_UINT64_MAX. If the length of the
       file is not a multiple of the
       pNFS server's stripe
       width (see <a class="xref" href="#file_layout_definitions">Section 13.2</a>
       for a formal definition), the metadata server might round up
       the returned layout's length.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.4-3.1">¶</a>
</li>
            <li class="normal" id="section-18.43.4-3.2">
       If LAYOUTGET is preceded by OPEN in the same
       COMPOUND request, and the OPEN requests OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_WRITE access and does
       not truncate the file, the client might
       opt to request a _RW layout with loga_offset set
       to zero, loga_minlength set to zero, and loga_length
       set to the file's current length (if known), or
       NFS4_UINT64_MAX. As with the previous case, under
       some conditions the metadata server might return a layout
       that covers the entire length of the file or beyond.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.4-3.2">¶</a>
</li>
            <li class="normal" id="section-18.43.4-3.3">
       This strategy is as above, but the OPEN truncates the file. In this case,
       the client might anticipate it will be writing to the
       file from offset zero, and so loga_offset and loga_minlength
       are set to zero, and loga_length is set to the value of
       threshold4_write_iosize. The metadata server might return a layout
       from offset zero with a length at least as long as 
       threshold4_write_iosize.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.4-3.3">¶</a>
</li>
            <li class="normal" id="section-18.43.4-3.4">
       A process on the client invokes a request to read
       from offset 10000 for length 50000. The client
       is using buffered I/O, and has buffer sizes of
       4096 bytes. The client intends to map the request
       of the process into a series of READ requests
       starting at offset 8192. The end offset needs to be higher
       than 10000 + 50000 = 60000, and the next offset that is
       a multiple of 4096 is 61440. The difference between 61440 and
       that starting offset of the layout is 53248 (which is
       the product of 4096 and 15).
       The value
       of threshold4_read_iosize is less than 53248,
       so the client sends a LAYOUTGET request with
       loga_offset set to 8192, loga_minlength set to
       53248, and loga_length set to the file's length
       (if known) minus 8192 or NFS4_UINT64_MAX (if the
       file's length is not known). Since this LAYOUTGET
       request exceeds the metadata server's threshold, it grants
       the layout, possibly with an initial offset of
       zero, with an end offset of at least 8192 + 53248 -
       1 = 61439, but preferably a layout with an offset
       aligned on the stripe width and a length that is
       a multiple of the stripe width.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.4-3.4">¶</a>
</li>
            <li class="normal" id="section-18.43.4-3.5">
        This strategy is as above, but the client is not using buffered I/O, and
        instead all internal I/O requests are sent directly to
        the server. The LAYOUTGET request has loga_offset equal to
        10000 and loga_minlength set to 50000. The value of loga_length
        is set to the length of the file. The metadata server is free to
        return a layout that fully overlaps the requested range, with
        a starting offset and length aligned on the stripe width.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.4-3.5">¶</a>
</li>
            <li class="normal" id="section-18.43.4-3.6">
       Again, a process on the client invokes a request
       to read from offset 10000 for length 50000 (i.e. a
       range with a starting offset of 10000 and an ending
       offset of 69999), and
       buffered I/O is in use.  The client is expecting
       that the server might not be able to return the
       layout for the full I/O range.


       The client intends to map the request of the
       process into a series of thirteen READ requests starting at
       offset 8192, each with length 4096, with a total
       length of 53248 (which equals 13 * 4096), which
       fully contains the range that client's process wants to read.

       Because the value of threshold4_read_iosize is equal to
       4096, it is practical and reasonable for the client to
       use several LAYOUTGET operations to complete the series
       of READs.

       The client sends a LAYOUTGET request with
       loga_offset set to 8192, loga_minlength set to 4096,
       and loga_length set to 53248 or higher.  The server
       will grant a layout possibly with an initial offset
       of zero, with an end offset of at least 8192 + 4096 -
       1 = 12287, but preferably a layout with an offset
       aligned on the stripe width and a length that is a
       multiple of the stripe width.  This will allow the
       client to make forward progress, possibly
       sending more LAYOUTGET operations for the remainder
       of the range.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.4-3.6">¶</a>

            <li class="normal" id="section-18.43.4-3.7">
        An NFS client detects a sequential read pattern,
        and so sends a LAYOUTGET operation that goes well beyond any
        current or pending read requests to the server. The
        server might likewise detect this pattern, and
        grant the LAYOUTGET request. Once the client
        reads from an offset of the file that represents
        50% of the way through the range of the last layout
        it received, in order to avoid stalling I/O that would wait
        for a layout, the client sends more operations 
        from an offset of the file that represents 50%
        of the way through the last layout it received. The client
        continues to request layouts with byte-ranges that are

        This strategy is as above, but the client fails to detect the

        A client is using buffered I/O, and has a long

        write-behinds and well beyond, including ranges
        beyond the filer's current length.  The client
        continues to send LAYOUTGET operations once the write-behind

      CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID can race with LAYOUTGET. One race
      scenario is that LAYOUTGET returns a device ID for which the
      client does not have device address mappings,
      and the metadata server sends a CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID
      to add the device ID to the client's awareness
      and meanwhile the client sends GETDEVICEINFO on
      the device ID.  This scenario is discussed in
      <a class="xref" href="#OP_GETDEVICEINFO_IMPLEMENTATION">Section 18.40.4</a>.
      Another scenario is that the CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID
      is processed by the client before it processes
      the results from LAYOUTGET.  The client will send
      a GETDEVICEINFO on the device ID.  If the results
      from GETDEVICEINFO are received before the client
      gets results from LAYOUTGET, then there is no
      longer a race. If the results from LAYOUTGET are
      received before the results from GETDEVICEINFO, the
      client can either wait for results of GETDEVICEINFO
      or send another one to get possibly more up-to-date
      device address mappings for the device ID.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.43.4-5">¶</a></p>

      Like the SECINFO operation, SECINFO_NO_NAME is used by the
      client to obtain a list of valid RPC authentication flavors for
      a specific file object.  Unlike SECINFO, SECINFO_NO_NAME only
      works with objects that are accessed by filehandle.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.45.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.45.3-2">
      There are two styles of SECINFO_NO_NAME, as determined by the
      value of the secinfo_style4 enumeration. If SECINFO_STYLE4_CURRENT_FH is
      passed, then SECINFO_NO_NAME is querying for the required
      security for the current filehandle. If SECINFO_STYLE4_PARENT is passed, then
      SECINFO_NO_NAME is querying for the required security of the
      current filehandle's parent. If the style selected is SECINFO_STYLE4_PARENT,
      then SECINFO should apply the same access methodology used for
      LOOKUPP when evaluating the traversal to the parent directory.
      Therefore, if the requester does not have the appropriate access
      to LOOKUPP the parent, then SECINFO_NO_NAME must behave the same
      way and return NFS4ERR_ACCESS.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.45.3-2">¶</a></p>

      SECINFO_NO_NAME, style SECINFO_STYLE4_CURRENT_FH.

          callback operation, and so, per rules on

          operation over the same session. The

      The TEST_STATEID operation is used to check the validity of 
      a set of stateids.  It can be used at any time, but the client
      should definitely use it when it 
      receives an indication that one or more of its stateids have been
      invalidated due to lock revocation.  This occurs when the SEQUENCE
      operation returns with one of the following sr_status_flags set:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.48.3-1">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-18.48.3-3">
      The client can use TEST_STATEID one or more times to test the
      validity of its stateids.  Each use of TEST_STATEID allows a large
      set of such stateids to be tested and avoids problems with earlier
      stateids in a COMPOUND request from interfering with the checking of
      subsequent stateids, as would happen if individual stateids were
      tested by a series of corresponding by operations in a COMPOUND
      request.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.48.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.48.3-4">
      For each stateid, the server returns the status code that 
      would be returned if that stateid were to be used in normal
      operation.  Returning such a status indication is not an
      error and does not cause COMPOUND processing to terminate.  Checks
      for the validity of the stateid proceed as they would for
      normal operations with a number of exceptions:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.48.3-4">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-18.48.3-5.1">
          There is no check for the type of stateid object, as would be

<p id="section-18.51.3-1">
      A RECLAIM_COMPLETE operation is used to indicate that the client
      has reclaimed all of the locking state that it will recover using
      reclaim,
      when it is recovering state due to either a server restart or the
      migration of a file system to another server.  There are two types
      of RECLAIM_COMPLETE operations:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.3-1">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-18.51.3-2.1">
          When rca_one_fs is FALSE, a global RECLAIM_COMPLETE is being
          done.  This indicates that recovery of all
          locks that the client held on the previous server instance
          has been completed.  The current filehandle need not be set in
   this case.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.3-2.1">¶</a>
</li>
            <li class="normal" id="section-18.51.3-2.2">
          When rca_one_fs is TRUE, a file system-specific RECLAIM_COMPLETE
          is being done.  This indicates that recovery of locks
          for a single fs (the one designated by the current filehandle)
          due to the migration of the file system has been completed.  Presence
          of a current filehandle is required when rca_one_fs is set to TRUE.
   When the current filehandle designates a filehandle in a file system
   not in the process of migration, the operation returns NFS4_OK and
   is otherwise ignored.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.3-2.2">¶</a>
</li>
          </ul>
<p id="section-18.51.3-3">
      Once a RECLAIM_COMPLETE is done, there can be no further
      reclaim operations for locks whose scope is defined as having
      completed recovery.  Once the client sends RECLAIM_COMPLETE, 
      the server will not allow the client to do
      subsequent reclaims of locking state for that scope 
      and, if these are attempted, will return NFS4ERR_NO_GRACE.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.3-4">
      Whenever a client establishes a new client ID and before it does
      the first non-reclaim operation that obtains a lock, it <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> send a
      RECLAIM_COMPLETE with rca_one_fs set to FALSE, even if there
      are no locks to 
      reclaim.  If non-reclaim
      locking operations are done before the RECLAIM_COMPLETE, an NFS4ERR_GRACE
      error will be returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.3-5">
      Similarly, when the client accesses a migrated file system on a new
      server, before it sends the first non-reclaim operation that
      obtains a lock on this new server, it <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> send a RECLAIM_COMPLETE
      with rca_one_fs set to TRUE and current filehandle within that file system,
      even if there are no locks to reclaim.  If non-reclaim locking
      operations are done on that file system before the
      RECLAIM_COMPLETE, an NFS4ERR_GRACE error will be returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.3-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.3-6">
      It should be noted that there are situations in which a client needs
      to issue both forms of RECLAIM_COMPLETE.   An example is an instance
      of file system migration in which the file system is migrated to a
      server for which the client has no clientid.  As a result, the client
      needs to obtain a clientid from the server (incurring the responsibility
      to do RECLAIM_COMPLETE with rca_one_fs set to FALSE) as well as
      RECLAIM_COMPLETE with rca_one_fs set to TRUE to complete the per-fs
      grace period associated with the file system migration.  These two
      may be done in any order as long as all necessary lock reclaims
      have been done before
      issuing either of them.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.3-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.3-7">
      Any locks not reclaimed at the point at which RECLAIM_COMPLETE
      is done become non-reclaimable.  The client <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> attempt 
      to reclaim them, either during 
      the current server instance or in any subsequent
      server instance, or on another server to which responsibility
      for that file system is transferred.  If the client were to do so, 
      it would be
      violating the protocol by representing itself as owning locks
      that it does not own, and so has no right to reclaim.  See
      <span><a class="relref" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5661#section-8.4.3">Section 8.4.3</a> of [<a class="xref" href="#RFC5661">66</a>]</span> for a 
      discussion of edge conditions related to lock reclaim.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.3-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.3-8">
      By sending a RECLAIM_COMPLETE, the client indicates readiness
      to proceed to do normal non-reclaim locking operations.  The client
      should be aware that such operations may temporarily result in 
      NFS4ERR_GRACE errors until the server is ready to terminate its
      grace period.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.3-8">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-18.51.4-1">
      Servers will typically use the information as to when reclaim
      activity is complete to reduce the length of the grace period.
      When the server maintains in persistent storage
      a list of clients that might have had locks,
      it is able to use the fact that
      all such clients have done a RECLAIM_COMPLETE to terminate the
      grace period and begin normal operations (i.e., grant requests
      for new locks) sooner than it might otherwise.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.4-2">
      Latency can be minimized by doing a RECLAIM_COMPLETE as part of
      the COMPOUND request in which the last lock-reclaiming operation
      is done.  When there are no reclaims to be done, RECLAIM_COMPLETE
      should be done immediately in order to allow the grace period 
      to end as soon as possible.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.4-3">
      RECLAIM_COMPLETE should only be done once for each server instance
      or occasion of the transition of a file system.
      If it is done a second time, the error NFS4ERR_COMPLETE_ALREADY will 
      result.  Note that because of the session feature's retry protection,
      retries of COMPOUND
      requests containing RECLAIM_COMPLETE operation will not result 
      in this error.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.4-4">
      When a RECLAIM_COMPLETE is sent, the client effectively acknowledges
      any locks not yet reclaimed as lost.  This allows the server to
      re-enable the client to recover locks if the occurrence of edge
      conditions, as described in
      <a class="xref" href="#network_partitions_and_recovery">Section 8.4.3</a>,
      had caused the server to disable the client's ability to
      recover locks.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.4-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.4-5">
      Because previous descriptions of RECLAIM_COMPLETE were not 
      sufficiently explicit about the circumstances in which use of
      RECLAIM_COMPLETE with rca_one_fs set to TRUE was appropriate,
      there have been cases in which it has been misused by clients who
      have issued RECLAIM_COMPLETE with rca_one_fs set to TRUE when it
      should have not been.  There have also been
      cases in which servers have, in various ways, not responded to
      such misuse as described above, either ignoring the rca_one_fs
      setting (treating the operation as a global RECLAIM_COMPLETE) or
      ignoring the entire operation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.4-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-18.51.4-6">
      While clients <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> misuse
      this feature, and servers <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> respond to such misuse as described
      above, implementors need to be aware of the following considerations
      as they make necessary trade-offs between interoperability with
      existing implementations and proper support for facilities to
      allow lock recovery in the event of file system migration.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.4-6">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-18.51.4-7.1">
 When servers have no support for becoming the destination server
 of a file system subject to migration, there is no possibility of
 a per-fs RECLAIM_COMPLETE being done legitimately, and occurrences of it
 <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> be ignored.  However, the negative consequences of accepting
 such mistaken use are quite limited as long as the client does
 not issue it
 before all necessary reclaims are done.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.4-7.1">¶</a>

            <li class="normal" id="section-18.51.4-7.2">
 When a server might become the destination for a file system being
 migrated, inappropriate use of per-fs RECLAIM_COMPLETE is more
 concerning.  In the case in which the file system designated is not
 within a per-fs grace period, the per-fs RECLAIM_COMPLETE <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span>
 be ignored, with the
 negative consequences of accepting it being limited, as in the
 case in which migration is not supported.  However, if the server 
 encounters a file system undergoing migration, the operation
 cannot be accepted
 as if it were a global RECLAIM_COMPLETE without invalidating its
 intended use.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-18.51.4-7.2">¶</a>

      The CB_COMPOUND procedure is used to combine one or more of the
      callback procedures into a single RPC request.  The main callback RPC
      program has two main procedures: CB_NULL and CB_COMPOUND.  All other
      operations use the CB_COMPOUND procedure as a wrapper.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-19.2.3-1">¶</a></p>

      During the processing of the CB_COMPOUND procedure, the client may find
      that it does not have the available resources to execute any or all of

      The CB_LAYOUTRECALL operation is used by the server to recall
      layouts from the client; as a result, the client will begin the
      process of returning layouts via LAYOUTRETURN.  The
      CB_LAYOUTRECALL operation specifies one of three forms of recall
      processing with the value of layoutrecall_type4.  The recall is
      for one of the following: a specific layout of a specific file
      (LAYOUTRECALL4_FILE), an entire file system ID
      (LAYOUTRECALL4_FSID), or all file systems (LAYOUTRECALL4_ALL).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.3.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.3.3-2">
      The behavior of the operation varies based on the value of the
      layoutrecall_type4.  The value and behaviors are:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.3.3-2">¶</a></p>
<span class="break"></span><dl class="dlNewline" id="section-20.3.3-3">

              <p id="section-20.3.3-3.2.1">
        For a layout to match the recall request, the values of the following fields
        must match those of the layout: clora_type, clora_iomode,
        lor_fh, and the byte-range specified by lor_offset and
        lor_length.  The clora_iomode field may have a special value
        of LAYOUTIOMODE4_ANY.  The special value LAYOUTIOMODE4_ANY will match any
        iomode originally returned in a layout; therefore, it acts as a
        wild card.  The other special value used is for
        lor_length.  If lor_length has a value of NFS4_UINT64_MAX, the
        lor_length field means the maximum possible file size. If a
        matching layout is found, it <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be returned using the
        LAYOUTRETURN operation (see <a class="xref" href="#OP_LAYOUTRETURN">Section 18.44</a>).

      In processing the layout recall request, the client also varies
      its behavior based on the value of the clora_changed field.  This
      field is used by the server to provide additional context for
      the reason why the layout is being recalled.  A FALSE value for
      clora_changed indicates that no change in the layout is expected
      and the client may write modified data to the storage devices
      involved; this must be done prior to returning the layout via
      LAYOUTRETURN.  A TRUE value for clora_changed indicates that the
      server is changing the layout.  Examples of layout changes and
      reasons for a TRUE indication are the following: the metadata server is restriping
      the file or a permanent error has occurred on a storage device
      and the metadata server would like to provide a new layout for
      the file.  Therefore, a clora_changed value of TRUE indicates
      some level of change for the layout and the client <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span>
      write and commit modified data to the storage devices.  In this

      The client's processing for CB_LAYOUTRECALL is similar to
      CB_RECALL (recall of file delegations) in that
      the client responds to
      the request before actually returning layouts via the
      LAYOUTRETURN operation.  While the client responds to the
      CB_LAYOUTRECALL immediately, the operation is not considered
      complete (i.e., considered pending) until all affected layouts are returned to the server
      via the LAYOUTRETURN operation.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.3.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.3.4-2">
      Before returning the layout to the server via LAYOUTRETURN, the

      READ, WRITE, or COMMIT operations that use the recalled layout.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.3.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.3.4-3">
      If the client is holding modified data that is affected by a
      recalled layout, the client has various options for writing the
      data to the server.  As always, the client may write the data
      through the metadata server.  In fact, the client may not have a
      choice other than writing to the metadata server when the
      clora_changed argument is TRUE and a new layout is unavailable
      from the server.  However, the client may be able to write the
      modified data to the storage device if the clora_changed
      argument is FALSE; this needs to be done before returning the
      layout via LAYOUTRETURN.  If the client were to obtain a new
      layout covering the modified data's byte-range, then writing to the
      storage devices is an available alternative.  Note that before
      obtaining a new layout, the client must first return the
      original layout.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.3.4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.3.4-4">
      In the case of modified data being written while the layout is
      held, the client must use LAYOUTCOMMIT operations at the
      appropriate time; as required LAYOUTCOMMIT must be done before
      the LAYOUTRETURN.  If a large amount of modified data is
      outstanding, the client may send LAYOUTRETURNs for portions of
      the recalled layout; this allows the server to monitor the
      client's progress and adherence to the original recall request.
      However, the last LAYOUTRETURN in a sequence of returns <span class="bcp14">MUST</span>
      specify the full range being recalled (see <a class="xref" href="#recall_robustness">Section 12.5.5.1</a> for details).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.3.4-4">¶</a></p>

      cause the client to return all layouts referring to the device ID
      before the server can delete the device ID. If the client

<p id="section-20.4.3-1">
      The CB_NOTIFY operation is used by the server to
      send notifications to clients about changes to
      delegated directories.
      The registration of notifications for the directories
      occurs when the delegation is established using
      GET_DIR_DELEGATION.
      These notifications are sent over the backchannel. The
      notification is sent once the original request has been
      processed on the server. The server will send an array of
      notifications for changes that might have occurred in the
      directory. The notifications are sent as list of pairs of
      bitmaps and values.
      See <a class="xref" href="#fattr4">Section 3.3.7</a>
      for a description of how NFSv4.1 bitmaps work.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.4.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.4.3-2">
     If the server has more notifications than can fit in
     the CB_COMPOUND request, it <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> send a sequence of
     serial CB_COMPOUND requests so that the client's view
     of the directory does not become confused. For example, if the
     server indicates that a file named "foo" is added and that the
     file "foo" is removed, the order in which the client receives
     these notifications needs to be the same as the
     order in which the corresponding operations occurred on the server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.4.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.4.3-3">

      If the client holding the delegation makes any
      changes in the directory that cause files or sub-directories to
      be added or removed, the server will
      notify that client of the resulting change(s). If the
      client holding the delegation is making attribute
      or cookie verifier changes only, the server does
      not need to send notifications to that client.
      The server will send the following information for
      each operation:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.4.3-3">¶</a></p>

            <dd id="section-20.4.3-4.2"> 
   The server will send
   information about the new directory entry being created along with the
   cookie for that entry.  The entry information (data type
   notify_add4) includes the component name of the entry and
   attributes.  The server will send this type of entry when a
   file is actually being created, when an entry is being added
   to a directory as a result of a rename across directories
   (see below), and when a hard link is being created to an
   existing file.  If this entry is added to the end of the
   directory, the server will set the nad_last_entry flag to
   TRUE. If the file is added such that there is at least one
   entry before it, the server will also return the previous
   entry information (nad_prev_entry, a variable-length array
   of up to one element. If the array is of zero length, there
   is no previous entry), along with its cookie.  This is to
   help clients find the right location in their file name caches and
   directory caches where this entry should be cached. If the
   new entry's cookie is available, it will be in
   the nad_new_entry_cookie (another variable-length array of up to
   one element) field.  If the addition of the entry causes another 
          entry to be deleted (which can only happen in the rename
          case) atomically with the addition, then information on
          this entry is reported in nad_old_entry.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.4.3-4.2">¶</a>

   the old entry and the new entry. This includes the name and
   attributes for each entry.  In addition, if the rename
          causes the deletion of an entry (i.e., the case of a file
          renamed over), then this is reported in 
          nrn_new_new_entry.nad_old_entry. 
          This notification is only sent if
   both entries are in the same directory. If the rename is
   across directories, the server will send a remove

   The client will use the attribute
   mask to inform the server of attributes for which it wants to
   receive notifications. This change notification can be
   requested for changes to the attributes of the directory
   as well as changes to any file's attributes in the directory by
   using two separate attribute masks. The client cannot ask
   for change attribute notification for a specific file. One attribute
   mask covers all the files in the directory. Upon any
   attribute change, the server will send back the values of
   changed attributes. Notifications might not make sense for
   some file system-wide attributes, and it is up to the server to
   decide which subset it wants to support.  The client can
   negotiate the frequency of attribute notifications by letting
   the server know how often it wants to be notified of an
   attribute change. The server will return supported
   notification frequencies or an indication that no
   notification is permitted for directory or child attributes

      The server may decide that it cannot hold all of the state for
      recallable objects, such as delegations and layouts, without 
      running out of resources.  In such a case, while not optimal,
      the server is free to recall individual objects to reduce the load.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.6.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.6.3-2">
      Because the general purpose of such recallable objects as
      delegations is to eliminate client interaction with the server,
      the server cannot interpret lack of recent use as indicating
      that the object is no longer useful.  The absence of visible
      use is consistent with a delegation keeping potential operations
      from being sent to the server. In the case of layouts, while it
      is true that the usefulness of a layout
      is indicated by the use of the layout when storage devices receive
      I/O requests, because there is no mandate that a storage
      device indicate to the metadata server any past or
      present use of a layout, the metadata server is not likely to know
      which layouts are good candidates to recall in response to
      low resources.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.6.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.6.3-3">
      In order to implement an effective reclaim scheme for such 
      objects, the server's knowledge of available resources must be
      used to determine when objects must be recalled with the 
      clients selecting the actual objects to be returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.6.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.6.3-4">
      Server implementations may differ in their resource allocation
      requirements.  For example, one server may share resources among
      all classes of recallable objects, whereas another may use
      separate resource pools for layouts and for delegations, or
      further separate resources by types of delegations.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.6.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.6.3-5">
      When a given resource pool is over-utilized, the server can
      send a CB_RECALL_ANY to clients holding recallable objects of
      the types involved, allowing it to keep a certain number of
      such objects and return any excess.  A mask specifies which 
      types of objects are to be limited.  The client chooses, based
      on its own knowledge of current usefulness, which of the objects
      in that class should be returned.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.6.3-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.6.3-6">
      A number of bits are defined.  For some of these, ranges
      are defined and it is up to the definition of the storage 
      protocol to specify how these are to be used.  There are ranges 
      reserved for object-based storage 
      protocols and for other experimental storage 
      protocols.  An RFC defining such a storage protocol needs to
      specify how particular bits within its range are to be used.  
      For example, it may specify a mapping between attributes of 
      the layout (read vs. write, size of area) and the bit to be 
      used, or it may define a field in the layout where the associated
      bit position is made available by the server to the client.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.6.3-6">¶</a></p>

      CB_RECALL_ANY specifies a count of objects that the client may
      keep as opposed to a count that the client must return.  This
      is to avoid a potential race between a CB_RECALL_ANY that had a 
      count of objects to free with a set of client-originated 
      operations to return layouts or delegations. As a result of the 
      race, the client and server would have differing ideas as to how
      many objects to return.  Hence, the client could mistakenly free 
      too many.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.6.3-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.6.3-10">
      If resource demands prompt it, the server may send another
      CB_RECALL_ANY with a lower count, even if it has not yet received
      an acknowledgment from the client for a previous CB_RECALL_ANY
      with the same type mask.  Although the possibility exists that
      these will be received by the client in an order different from
      the order in which they were sent, any such permutation of
      the callback stream is harmless.  It is the job of the client
      to bring down the size of the recallable object set in line
      with each CB_RECALL_ANY received, and until that obligation is
      met, it cannot be cancelled or modified by any subsequent 
      CB_RECALL_ANY for the same type mask.  Thus, if the server 
      sends two CB_RECALL_ANYs, the effect will be the same as 
      if the lower count was sent, whatever the order of recall
      receipt.  Note that this means that a server may not cancel
      the effect of a CB_RECALL_ANY by sending another recall with
      a higher count.  When a CB_RECALL_ANY is received and the
      count is already within the limit set or is above a limit 
      that the client is working to get down to, that callback has no
      effect.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.6.3-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-20.6.3-11">
      Servers are generally free to deny recallable objects
      when insufficient resources are available.  Note that the 
      effect of such a policy is implicitly to give precedence to
      existing objects relative to requested ones, with the result
      that resources might not be optimally used.  To prevent this, 
      servers are well advised to make the point at which they start 
      sending CB_RECALL_ANY callbacks somewhat below that at which they
      cease to give out new delegations and layouts.  This allows the 
      client to purge its less-used objects whenever appropriate and
      so continue to have its subsequent requests given new resources
      freed up by object returns.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-20.6.3-11">¶</a></p>

      The client can choose to return any type of object specified

      up to the server to handle this situation, typically by sending
      specific recalls (i.e., sending CB_RECALL operations)
      to properly limit resource usage.  The server 
      should give the client enough time to return objects before

   A previously provided device-ID-to-device-address

      </h2>
<p id="section-21-1">
   Historically, the authentication model of NFS
   was based on the entire machine being the NFS client, with the
   NFS server trusting the NFS client
   to authenticate the end-user.
   The NFS server in turn shared its files only to
   specific clients, as identified by the client's source
   network address.  Given this model, the AUTH_SYS
   RPC security flavor simply identified the end-user
   using the client to the NFS server.  When processing
   NFS responses, the client ensured that the responses
   came from the same network address and port number
   to which the request was sent.  While such a model is
   easy to implement and simple to deploy and use, it is
   unsafe.  Thus, NFSv4.1 
   implementations are <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> to support a security model that uses
   end-to-end authentication, where an end-user on a client 
   mutually authenticates (via cryptographic schemes that
   do not expose passwords or keys in the clear on the
   network) to a principal on an NFS server.  Consideration
   is also given to the integrity and privacy of
   NFS requests and responses.  The issues of end-to-end
   mutual authentication, integrity, and privacy are
   discussed in <a class="xref" href="#RPCSEC_GSS_and_Security_Services">Section 2.2.1.1.1</a>. 
   There are specific considerations when using Kerberos V5 as described
   in <a class="xref" href="#krb5_sec_consider">Section 2.2.1.1.1.2.1.1</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-21-2">
   Note that being <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> to implement does not mean <span class="bcp14">REQUIRED</span> to
   use; AUTH_SYS can be used by NFSv4.1 clients and servers.
   However, AUTH_SYS is merely an <span class="bcp14">OPTIONAL</span> security flavor in NFSv4.1,
   and so interoperability via AUTH_SYS is not assured.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-21-3">
   For reasons of reduced administration overhead, better
   performance, and/or reduction of CPU utilization,
   users of NFSv4.1 implementations might decline to use
   security mechanisms that enable integrity protection
   on each remote procedure call and response. The
   use of mechanisms without integrity leaves the user
   vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle of the NFS
   client and server that modifies the RPC request and/or
   the response. While implementations are free to provide
   the option to use weaker security mechanisms, there
   are three operations in particular that warrant the
   implementation overriding user choices.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-3">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-21-4.1">
   The first two such operations are SECINFO and
   SECINFO_NO_NAME.  It is <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> that the client send
   both operations such that they are protected with a
   security flavor that has integrity protection, such
   as RPCSEC_GSS with either the rpc_gss_svc_integrity
   or rpc_gss_svc_privacy service. Without integrity
   protection encapsulating SECINFO and SECINFO_NO_NAME
   and their results, a man-in-the-middle could
   modify results such that the client might select a
   weaker algorithm in the set allowed by the server, making
   the client and/or server vulnerable to further attacks.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-4.1">¶</a>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="section-21-4.2">
   The third operation that <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> use integrity protection
   is any GETATTR for the fs_locations and fs_locations_info attributes,
   in order to mitigate the severity of a man-in-the-middle attack.
   The attack has two
   steps.  First the attacker modifies the unprotected results of some
   operation to return NFS4ERR_MOVED. Second, when the client follows up
   with a GETATTR for the fs_locations or fs_locations_info attributes,
   the attacker modifies
   the results to cause the client to migrate its traffic to a server
   controlled by the attacker. With integrity protection, this attack is mitigated.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-4.2">¶</a>

      </ul>

  Relative to previous NFS versions, NFSv4.1 has additional security
  considerations for pNFS (see Sections <a class="xref" href="#security_considerations_pnfs">12.9</a> 
and <a class="xref" href="#file_security_considerations">13.12</a>), locking
  and session state (see <a class="xref" href="#protect_state_change">Section 2.10.8.3</a>),
  and state recovery during grace period (see <a class="xref" href="#reclaim_security_considerations">Section 8.4.2.1.1</a>).
  With respect to locking and session state, if SP4_SSV state protection
  is being used, <a class="xref" href="#rpcsec_ssv_consider">Section 2.10.10</a> has specific
  security considerations for the NFSv4.1 client and server.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-21-6">
  Security considerations for lock reclaim differ between the two different
  situations in which state reclaim is to be done.
  The server failure situation is discussed in
  <a class="xref" href="#reclaim_security_considerations">Section 8.4.2.1.1</a>, while the per-fs state
  reclaim done in support of migration/replication is discussed in
  <a class="xref" href="#SEC11-EFF-lock-sc">Section 11.11.9.1</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-21-7">
  The use of the multi-server namespace features described in
  <a class="xref" href="#NEW11">Section 11</a> raises
  the possibility that requests to determine the set of network 
  addresses corresponding to a given server might be interfered 
  with or have their responses modified in flight.
  In light of this possibility, the following considerations 
  should be noted:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-7">¶</a></p>

      DNSSEC <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC4033">29</a>]</span> is not available, the validity of

      However, when combined with a trusted resolver, DNS over TLS
      <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC7858">30</a>]</span> and DNS over HTTPS

      In situations in which the validity of the provided addresses

      The fetching of attributes containing file system location 
      information <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> be 
      performed using integrity protection. It is important to note here that 
      a client making a request of this sort without using
      integrity protection needs be aware of 
      the negative consequences of doing so, which can lead to 
      invalid hostnames or network addresses being returned.  These
      include cases in which the
      client is directed to a server under the control of an
      attacker, who might get access to data written or provide
      incorrect values for data read.  In light of
      this, the client needs to recognize that using such returned 
      location information to access an NFSv4 server
      without use of RPCSEC_GSS (i.e.,
      by using AUTH_SYS) poses dangers as it can result in the client
      interacting with such an attacker-controlled server without
      any authentication facilities to verify the server's identity.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-8.2">¶</a>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="section-21-8.3">
      Despite the fact that it is a requirement that implementations provide
      "support" for use of RPCSEC_GSS, it cannot be assumed that 
      use of RPCSEC_GSS is always available between any particular
      client-server pair.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-8.3">¶</a>

</li>
      </ul>
<p id="section-21-9">
  In light of the above, a server <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> present file system location
  entries that correspond to file systems on other servers using a
  hostname.  This would allow the client to interrogate the 
  fs_locations on the destination server to obtain trunking information
  (as well as replica information) using integrity protection,
  validating the name provided while assuring that the response has
  not been modified in flight.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-21-10">
  When RPCSEC_GSS is not available on a server, the client needs
  to be aware of the fact that the location entries are subject to
  modification in flight and so cannot be relied upon.
  In the case of a client being directed to another server after NFS4ERR_MOVED, 
  this could vitiate the
  authentication provided by the use of RPCSEC_GSS on the designated
  destination server.  Even when RPCSEC_GSS authentication is available
  on the destination, the server might still properly authenticate as the
  server to which the client was erroneously directed.
  Without a way to decide whether
  the server is a valid one, the client can only determine, using 
  RPCSEC_GSS, that the server corresponds to the name provided, with
  no basis for trusting that server.  As a result, the client <span class="bcp14">SHOULD NOT</span> use such unverified location entries as a basis for migration,
  even though RPCSEC_GSS might be available on the destination.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-21-11">
  When a file system location attribute is fetched upon connecting with an 
  NFS server, it <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span>, as stated above, be done with integrity protection.
  When this not possible, it is generally 
  best for the client to ignore trunking and replica information or 
  simply not fetch the location information for these purposes.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-11">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-21-12">
  When location information cannot be verified, it can be subjected 
  to additional filtering to prevent the client from being 
  inappropriately directed.  For example, if a range of network 
  addresses can be determined that assure that the servers and 
  clients using AUTH_SYS are subject to the appropriate set of 
  constraints (e.g., physical network isolation, administrative 
  controls on the operating systems used), then network addresses 
  in the appropriate range can be used with others discarded 
  or restricted in their use of AUTH_SYS.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-12">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-21-13">
  To summarize considerations regarding the use of RPCSEC_GSS in
  fetching location information, we need to consider the following 
  possibilities for requests to interrogate location information, with
  interrogation approaches on the referring and destination servers  
  arrived at separately:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-13">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-21-14.1">
    The use of integrity protection is <span class="bcp14">RECOMMENDED</span> 
    in all cases, since the absence of integrity protection exposes
    the client to the possibility of the results being modified in transit.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-14.1">¶</a>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="section-21-14.2">
    The use of requests issued without RPCSEC_GSS 
    (i.e., using AUTH_SYS, which has no provision to avoid
    modification of data in flight),
    while undesirable and a potential security exposure,
    may not be avoidable in all cases.  Where the use
    of the returned information cannot be avoided, it is made
    subject to filtering as described above to
    eliminate the possibility that the client would
    treat an invalid address as if it were a NFSv4 server.  The 
    specifics will vary depending on the degree of network isolation
    and whether the request is to the referring or destination servers.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-14.2">¶</a>
</li>
      </ul>
<p id="section-21-15">
  Even if such requests are not interfered with in flight, it is possible
  for a compromised server to direct the client to use inappropriate servers,
  such as those under the control of the attacker.  It is not clear that being
  directed to such servers represents a greater threat to the client than the
  damage that could be done by the compromised server itself.   However, it
  is possible that some sorts of transient server compromises might be
  exploited to direct a client to a server capable of doing greater
  damage over a longer time.   One useful step to guard against this
  possibility is to issue requests to fetch location data using RPCSEC_GSS,
  even if no mapping to an RPCSEC_GSS principal is available.   In this case,
  RPCSEC_GSS would not be used, as it typically is, to identify the client
  principal to the server, but rather to make sure (via RPCSEC_GSS mutual
  authentication) that the server being contacted is the one intended.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-15">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-21-16">
  Similar considerations apply if the threat to be avoided is the redirection
  of client traffic to inappropriate (i.e., poorly performing) servers.  In
  both cases, there is no reason for the information returned to depend on
  the identity of the client principal requesting it, while the validity of the
  server information, which has the capability to affect all client principals,
  is of considerable importance.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-21-16">¶</a></p>

     The IANA registry promotes interoperability where common interests exist.

 of the variable names ${ietf.org:CPU_ARCH} and
 ${ietf.org:OS_TYPE}. See Sections <a class="xref" href="#cpu_arch">22.6.2</a>
 and <a class="xref" href="#os_type">22.6.3</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-22.6.1.1.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-22.6.1.1.1-4">
 For the values of the variable
 ${ietf.org:OS_VERSION}, no registry is needed as
 the specifics of the values of the variable will
 vary with the value of ${ietf.org:OS_TYPE}. Thus,
 values for ${ietf.org:OS_VERSION} are on a
 Hierarchical Allocation basis and are of no concern
 to IANA.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-22.6.1.1.1-4">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-appendix.a-1">
      This document includes an explanation of how clients and servers 
      are to determine the particular network access paths to be used to access a
      file system.  This includes descriptions of
      how to handle changes to the specific replica to be used or to
      the set of addresses to be used to access it,
      and how to deal transparently with transfers of responsibility that need to be
      made.  This includes cases in which
      there is a shift between one replica and another and those in
      which different network access paths are used to access the
      same replica.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-appendix.a-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-appendix.a-2">
      As a result of the following problems in RFC 5661
      <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5661">66</a>]</span>, it
      was necessary to provide the specific updates that are made by this
      document. These updates are described in <a class="xref" href="#CHG">Appendix B</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-appendix.a-2">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-appendix.a-3.1">
   RFC 5661 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5661">66</a>]</span>, while it dealt with situations in
   which various forms of clustering allowed coordination
   of the state assigned by cooperating servers to be used,
   made no provisions for Transparent State Migration.  Within NFSv4.0,
        Transparent State Migration was first explained clearly in
   RFC 7530 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC7530">68</a>]</span> and corrected and
   clarified by RFC 7931 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC7931">69</a>]</span>.  No corresponding
 explanation for NFSv4.1 had been provided.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-appendix.a-3.1">¶</a>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="section-appendix.a-3.2">
    Although NFSv4.1 provided a clear definition of how
    trunking detection was to be done, there was no clear specification
    of how trunking discovery was to be done, despite the fact that 
         the specification clearly indicated that this information
         could be made available via the file system location attributes.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-appendix.a-3.2">¶</a>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="section-appendix.a-3.3">
         Because the existence of multiple network access paths to the same
    file system was dealt with as if there were multiple replicas, issues relating to
         transitions between replicas could never be clearly distinguished
         from trunking-related transitions between the addresses used to 
         access a particular file system instance.  As a result, in situations in
         which both migration and trunking configuration changes 
         were involved, neither of these could be clearly dealt with, and the relationship between 
         these two features was not seriously addressed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-appendix.a-3.3">¶</a>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="section-appendix.a-3.4">
   Because use of two network access paths to the same file system
   instance (i.e., trunking) was often treated as if two replicas were
 involved, it was considered that two replicas were being used simultaneously.  
        As a result, the treatment of replicas being used simultaneously
   in RFC 5661 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5661">66</a>]</span> was not clear, as it covered the
   two distinct cases of a single file system instance being accessed by
   two different network access paths and two
   replicas being accessed simultaneously, with the limitations
   of the latter case not being clearly laid out.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-appendix.a-3.4">¶</a>

      The majority of the consequences of these issues are dealt with
      by presenting in <a class="xref" href="#NEW11">Section 11</a> a replacement

      modifies existing subsections within that section and adds new
      ones as described in <a class="xref" href="#CHG-11">Appendix B.1</a>.   Also, some existing
      sections were deleted.  These changes were made in order to do the

   It had been assumed that an EXCHANGE_ID executed when the server 
   was already aware that a given client instance was either updating 
   associated parameters (e.g., with respect to callbacks) or dealing
   with a previously lost reply by retransmitting.  As a 
          result, any slot sequence returned by that operation
   would be of no use.  The original treatment
          went so far as to say that it "<span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span>" be used, although 
          this usage was not in accord with <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC2119">1</a>]</span>.
          This created a difficulty when an EXCHANGE_ID is done after Transparent State

          In the updated treatment, CREATE_SESSION is a way that client
          IDs are confirmed, but it is understood that other ways are
          possible.  The slot sequence can be used as needed, and cases

          and to communicate it to the client.  When multiple 
          simultaneous connections are involved, as often happens when
          trunking, that treatment was inadequate in that it ignored the
          role of EXCHANGE_ID in associating the client ID with the 
          connection on which it was done, so that it could be used
          by a subsequent CREATE_SESSION whose parameters do not

 Because of the need to appropriately address trunking-related
 issues, some uses of the term "replica" in RFC 5661
 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5661">66</a>]</span>
 became problematic because a shift in network access paths was
 considered to be a shift to a different replica.  As a result,
        the original definition of NFS4ERR_MOVED (in Section <a class="relref" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5661#section-15.1.2.4">15.1.2.4</a> of RFC 5661 <span>[<a class="xref" href="#RFC5661">66</a>]</span>) was updated to reflect the 
        different handling of unavailability of a particular fs via a
        specific network address.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-b.3-2.1.1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-b.3-2.1.2">
        Since such a situation is no longer
        considered to constitute unavailability of a file system 
        instance, the description has been changed, even though the set of circumstances in 
        which it is to be returned remains the same. 
 The new paragraph explicitly recognizes that a different network
 address might be used, while the previous description, misleadingly,
 treated this as a shift between two replicas while only a single
 file system instance might be involved. The updated description
        appears in <a class="xref" href="#err_MOVED">Section 15.1.2.4</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-b.3-2.1.2">¶</a></p>
