RFC #335                                     Roland F. Bryan
                                             1 May 1972



                         <span class="h1">NEW INTERFACE-IMP/360</span>



     The former interface to the network for our 360-75 was replaced
by a production unit similar to the NASA- AMES and USC versions.  This
controller went into operation 1 May 1972.

     We would be pleased to hear of any difficulties network users
encounter, while operating with UCSB, that might be related to this
unit.

     Thank you.
