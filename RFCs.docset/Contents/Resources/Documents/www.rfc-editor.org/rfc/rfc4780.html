   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used to
   manage Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) entities, which include User
   Agents, and Proxy, Redirect and Registrar servers.  The managed
   objects defined in this document are intended to provide basic SIP
   protocol management for SIP entities.  The management of
   application-specific or service-specific SIP configuration is out of
   scope.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a set
   of MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   STD 58, comprised of <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>], and <a href="./rfc2580">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2580">2580</a> [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Overview</span>

   SIP [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] is an application-layer control (signaling) protocol
   for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more
   participants.  These sessions include Internet telephone calls,
   multimedia distribution, and multimedia conferences.

   This MIB provides some managed objects for SIP entities defined in
   <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] - User Agents (UA), and Proxy, Redirect, and
   Registrar servers.  It is intended to provide management of the basic
   SIP entities.  It provides for monitoring of status and protocol
   statistics, as well as for configuration of SIP entities.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Structure%20of%20the%20SIP%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Structure of the SIP MIB</span>

   Four MIB modules are specified: SIP-COMMON-MIB, SIP-SERVER-MIB, SIP-
   UA-MIB, and SIP-TC-MIB.  SIP-COMMON-MIB contains common MIB objects
   used in all the SIP entities.  SIP-SERVER-MIB contains objects
   specific to Proxy, Redirect, and Registrar servers.  SIP-UA-MIB
   includes objects specific to User Agents.  SIP-TC-MIB defines the
   textual conventions used throughout the MIB modules.

   The MIB modules contain the following groups of objects:

   SIP-COMMON-MIB: Management objects common to all the SIP entities

   o  sipCommonMIBObjects

      *  sipCommonCfgBase: This object group defines configuration
         objects common to all SIP entities, including the SIP protocol
         version, the type of SIP entity (UA, proxy, redirect, registrar
         servers), the operational and administrative status, the SIP
         organization name, the maximum number of SIP transactions an
         entity can manage, etc.

      *  sipCommonCfgTimer: This object group defines timer
         configuration objects applicable to SIP user agent and stateful
         SIP proxy entities.

      *  sipCommonSummaryStats: This object group defines a table
         containing the summary statistics objects applicable to all SIP
         entities, including the total number of all SIP requests and
         responses in/out and the total number of transactions.

      *  sipCommonMethodStats: This object group defines a table
         containing the SIP method statistics objects applicable to all
         SIP entities, including the number of outbound and inbound
         requests on a per method basis.  Retransmissions, where
         appropriate, are also included in these statistics.

      *  sipCommonStatusCode: This object group defines a table
         indicating the number of SIP responses (in and out) that the
         SIP entity has been requested to monitor on a per-method basis
         (100, 200, 302, etc.).

      *  sipCommonStatsTrans: This object group defines a table
         containing a gauge reflecting the number of transactions
         currently awaiting definitive responses by the managed SIP
         entity.

      *  sipCommonStatsRetry: This object group defines statistic
         objects indicating the number of retransmissions sent on a
         per-method basis.

      *  sipCommonOtherStats: This object group defines additional
         statistics objects including the number of SIP requests
         received with unsupported URIs, the number of requests received
         with unsupported SIP methods, and the number of discarded
         messages.

      *  sipCommonNotifObjects: This object group defines objects
         accessible only via a notification (MAX ACCESS clause of
         accessible-for-notify): they are related to the SNMP
         notifications defined in this MIB module.

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB also contains notifications, including:

   o  sipCommonStatusCodeNotif: indicates that a specific status code
      has been sent or received by the system.

   o  sipCommonStatusCodeThreshExceededNotif: indicates that a specific
      status code has been sent or received by the system frequently
      enough to exceed the configured threshold.

   SIP-SERVER-MIB: Groups of objects for SIP Proxy, Redirect, and
   Registrar servers

   o  sipServerMIBObjects

      *  sipServerCfg: This object group defines common server
         configuration objects including the SIP server host address.

      *  sipServerProxyCfg: This object group defines configuration
         objects for SIP Proxy Servers including the proxy mode of
         operation (stateless, stateful, call stateful), the proxy
         authentication method(s), realm, etc.

      *  sipServerProxyStats: This object group defines a table
         containing the statistics objects applicable to SIP Proxy
         Servers.  It includes the number of occurrences of unsupported
         options being specified in received Proxy-Require headers.

      *  sipServerRegCfg: This object group defines common configuration
         objects for SIP Registrar servers, including the ability to
         accept third-party registrations, such as the maximum
         registration expiry that may be requested by user agents, the
         maximum number of users the registrar can support, the number
         of currently registered users, per contact registration
         information, etc.

      *  sipServerRegStats: This object group contains summary
         statistics objects for SIP Registrar servers.  Precisely, it
         contains the number of REGISTER requests that have been
         accepted or rejected.

   SIP-UA-MIB: Group of objects for SIP User Agents

   o  sipUAMIBObjects

      *  sipUACfgServer: This object group specifies SIP server
         configuration objects applicable to SIP user agents including
         the Internet address of the SIP Server the UA uses to register,
         proxy, or redirect calls.

   To conform with this specification, an SNMP agent MUST implement the
   SIP-TC-MIB module, plus the SIP-COMMON-MIB module and one of the SIP
   entity-type-specific MIB modules (SIP-SERVER-MIB or SIP-UA-MIB) as
   applicable for each instance of a SIP entity being managed.  If a
   device has more than one SIP entity or multiple instances of the same
   entity type, it MUST implement multiple SIP modules.  <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>
   describes handling of multiple instances in detail.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4780">RFC 4780</a>                    SIP MIB Modules                   April 2007</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Textual%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Textual Conventions</span>

   The data types SipTCTransportProtocol, SipTCEntityRole,
   SipTCOptionTagHeaders, and SipTCMethodName are defined in the SIP-
   TC-MIB module and used as Textual Conventions in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20Network%20Services%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Relationship to the Network Services MIB</span>

   In the design of the SIP MIB, the authors considered the following
   requirement: the SIP MIB must allow a single system with a single
   SNMP agent to support multiple instances of various SIP MIB modules.
   This requirement is met by using the framework provided by the
   Network Services Monitoring MIB, NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB, <a href="./rfc2788">RFC 2788</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2788" title='"Network Services Monitoring MIB"'>RFC2788</a>].

   A device implementing the SIP MIB MUST support the NETWORK-SERVICES-
   MIB and, at a minimum, MUST support the index and name objects
   (applIndex and applName) in the application table (applTable).  In
   order to allow each instance of a SIP entity to be managed as a
   separate network service application, a naming convention SHOULD be
   used to make the application name unique.  For example, if a system
   is running 2 SIP UAs that need to be managed as 2 separate SIP
   entities, by convention, the application names used in the Network
   Services Monitoring MIB application table should be "sip_ua1" and
   "sip_ua2".  This convention allows each instance to have its own row
   in the application table (applTable).

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the following application name
   conventions be adopted:

   o  for a SIP Proxy entity, the applName value SHOULD be equal to a
      character string starting with "sip_proxy" followed by a unique
      application instance identifier, for example, "sip_proxy1",
      "sip_proxy17".

   o  for a SIP Registrar entity, the applName value SHOULD be equal to
      a character string starting with "sip_registrar" followed by a
      unique application instance identifier, for example,
      "sip_registrar1", "sip_registrar2".

   o  for a SIP User Agent entity, the applName value SHOULD be equal to
      a character string starting with "sip_ua" followed by a unique
      application instance identifier, for example, "sip_ua1",
      "sip_ua2".







<span class="grey">Lingle, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-7"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4780">RFC 4780</a>                    SIP MIB Modules                   April 2007</span>


   o  for any combination of Proxy, Registrar, or Redirect Server being
      managed as a single aggregate entity, the applName value for the
      combined server entity SHOULD reflect the appropriate combination
      followed by a unique application instance identifier.  In order to
      facilitate consistent agent behavior and management application
      expectations, the following order of names is RECOMMENDED:

         *  if Proxy exists, list first.
         *  if Proxy and Redirect exists, list Redirect second.
         *  if Registrar exists, always list last.

      For example "sip_proxy1", "sip_proxy_registrar1",
      "sip_proxy_redirect5", "sip_proxy_redirect_registrar2", or
      "sip_registrar1".

   o  Note: the value of the network service application index
      (applIndex) may be different from the instance identifier used in
      the system (the applIndex is dynamically created and is the value
      assigned by the SNMP agent at the creation of the table entry,
      whereas the value of the instance identifier to be used in the
      application name is provided as part of the application name
      applName by the system administrator or configuration files of the
      SIP entity).  This note is illustrated in the first example
      provided below.

   Finally, the SNMP agent MAY support any combination of the other
   attributes in applTable.  If supported, the following objects SHOULD
   have values populated as follows:

   o  applVersion: version of the SIP application.

   o  applUptime: the value of applUptime MUST be identical to the value
      of sipCommonCfgServiceStartTime defined in the SIP-COMMON-MIB
      module.

   o  applOperStatus: the value of applOperStatus SHOULD reflect the
      operational status of sipCommonCfgServiceOperStatus, at least by
      means of a mapping.

   o  applLastChange: the value of applLastChange MUST be identical to
      the value of sipCommonCfgServiceLastChange defined in the SIP-
      COMMON module.

   A number of other objects are defined as part of the applTable.  They
   are not included for the sake of brevity and due to the fact that
   they do not enhance the concept being presented.

   Example 1:

   The tables below illustrate how a system acting as both Proxy and
   Registrar server might be configured to maintain separate SIP-
   COMMON-MIB instances.

   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable might be populated as follows:

            +-----------+-------------------+----------------------+
            | applIndex |      applName     |    applDescription   |
            +-----------+-------------------+----------------------+
            |     1     |   "sip_proxy10"   |   "ACME SIP Proxy"   |
            |     2     | "sip_registrar17" | "ACME SIP Registrar" |
            +-----------+-------------------+----------------------+

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have two rows: one for the
   proxy (applIndex=1) and one for the registrar (applIndex=2).  The
   SIP-SERVER-MIB tables would, however, only be populated with one row
   indexed by applIndex=1 and applIndex=2, respectively, if the server
   provides either proxy or registrar.

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable might be populated as:

   +---------+------------------------+--------------------------+-----+
   |applIndex| sipCommonCfgProtocol   | sipCommonCfgServiceOper  | ... |
   |         | Version                | Status                   |     |
   +---------+------------------------+--------------------------+-----+
   |    1    |        "SIP/2.0"       |           up(1)          |     |
   |    2    |        "SIP/2.0"       |       restarting(4)      |     |
   +---------+------------------------+--------------------------+-----+

   while the sipServerProxyCfgTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated
   as:

            +-----------+-------------------------------+-----+
            | applIndex | sipServerCfgProxyStatefulness | ... |
            +-----------+-------------------------------+-----+
            |     1     |          stateless(1)         |     |
            +-----------+-------------------------------+-----+

   and the sipServerRegUserTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated
   as:

      +-----------+-----------------------+---------------------+-----+
      | applIndex | sipServerRegUserIndex | sipServerRegUserUri | ... |

   Example 2:

   This example illustrates how to represent a system acting as both
   Proxy and Registrar server, where the two entities share a single
   instance of SIP-COMMON-MIB.

   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable might be populated as follows:

   +-----------+------------------------+------------------------------+
   | applIndex |        applName        |        applDescription       |
   +-----------+------------------------+------------------------------+
   |     1     | "sip_proxy_registrar1" |      "ACME SIP Proxy and     |
   |           |                        |          Registrar"          |
   +-----------+------------------------+------------------------------+

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have only one row to cover
   both the proxy and the registrar.

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable might be populated as:

  +----------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+
  |applIndex |sipCommonCfgProtocolVersion|sipCommonCfgServiceOperStatus|
  +----------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+
  |     1    |         "SIP/2.0"         |            up(1)            |
  +----------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+

   while the sipServerRegUserTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated
   as:

      +-----------+-----------------------+---------------------+-----+
      | applIndex | sipServerRegUserIndex | sipServerRegUserUri | ... |
      +-----------+-----------------------+---------------------+-----+

      +-----------+-----------------------+---------------------+-----+

   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB assocTable is not considered a requirement
   for SIP systems.  It is not a mandatory group for compliance with the
   NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB module.

   The relationship between the value of applOperStatus and
   sipCommonCfgServiceOperStatus is as follows:

   +-------------------------------+---------------+-------------------+
   | sipCommonCfgServiceOperStatus |       --      |   applOperStatus  |
   |                               |  corresponds  |                   |
   |                               |     to --&gt;    |                   |
   +-------------------------------+---------------+-------------------+
   |               up              |      --&gt;      |         up        |
   |              down             |      --&gt;      |        down       |
   |           congested           |      --&gt;      |     congested     |
   |           restarting          |      --&gt;      |     restarting    |
   |           quiescing           |      --&gt;      |     quiescing     |
   |            testing            |      --&gt;      |         up        |
   |            unknown            |      --&gt;      | --indeterminate-- |
   +-------------------------------+---------------+-------------------+

   If the sipOperStatus is 'unknown', there is no corresponding value of
   applOperStatus.  Therefore, the last known value of applOperStatus
   SHOULD be maintained until the sipOperStatus transitions to a value
   that can be mapped appropriately.

   The SIP MIB modules defined in this document IMPORT definitions
   normatively from the following MIB modules, beyond [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>],
   [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>], and [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>]: INET-ADDRESS-MIB [<a href="./rfc4001" title='"Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses"'>RFC4001</a>], NETWORK-
   SERVICES-MIB [<a href="./rfc2788" title='"Network Services Monitoring MIB"'>RFC2788</a>], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [<a href="./rfc3411" title='"An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks"'>RFC3411</a>].

   This MIB module also includes REFERENCE clauses that normatively
   refer to SIP [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and INET-ADDRESS-MIB [<a href="./rfc4001" title='"Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses"'>RFC4001</a>].

   Finally, this MIB module makes informative references to several RFCs
   in some of the examples described in the DESCRIPTION clauses,
   including Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP [<a href="./rfc3262" title='"Reliability of Provisional Responses in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3262</a>] and
   SIP over SCTP [<a href="./rfc4168" title='"The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4168</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Accommodating%20SIP%20Extension%20Methods"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Accommodating SIP Extension Methods</span>

   The core set of SIP methods is defined in <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>].  Other
   IETF RFCs define additional methods.  In the future, additional
   methods may be defined.  In order to avoid having to update the SIP-
   COMMON-MIB module to accommodate these extension methods, we use a
   method identifier name (SipTCMethodName TEXTUAL-CONVENTION) to
   represent all SIP methods registered with IANA.

   For example, the sipCommonMethodSupportedTable is the main table for
   listing all of the SIP methods supported by a system, including the
   SIP methods defined in <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and other SIP methods
   registered with IANA.  The table is informational in nature and
   populated by the system.  Entries cannot be added or deleted by an
   SNMP manager.

   The SIP specification (<a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> <a href="./rfc3261#section-27.4">[RFC3261], Section 27.4</a>) establishes
   the sub-registries for SIP Methods and Response Codes under
   <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters">http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters</a>.  This document uses
   the existing sub-registry for the names of registered SIP methods.

   For example, in the sipCommonMethodSupportedTable of SIP-COMMON-MIB,
   the sipCommonMethodSupportedName values can be represented as
   follows:

                +------------------------------+
                | sipCommonMethodSupportedName |
                +------------------------------+
                |             "ACK"            |
                |             "BYE"            |
                |           "CANCEL"           |
                |           "INVITE"           |
                |           "OPTIONS"          |
                +------------------------------+

SipTCEntityRole ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
       "This convention defines the role of a SIP entity.  Examples of
        SIP entities are proxies, user agents, redirect servers,
        registrars, or combinations of the above.

        User Agent (UA): A logical entity that can act as both a user
        agent client and user agent server.

        User Agent Client (UAC): A logical entity that creates a new
        request, and then uses the client transaction state machinery
        to send it.  The role of UAC lasts only for the duration of
        that transaction.  In other words, if a piece of software
        initiates a request, it acts as a UAC for the duration of that
        transaction.  If it receives a request later, it assumes the
        role of a user agent server for the processing of that
        transaction.

        User Agent Server (UAS): A logical entity that generates a
        response to a SIP request.  The response accepts, rejects,
        or redirects the request.  This role lasts only for the
        duration of that transaction.  In other words, if a piece of
        software responds to a request, it acts as a UAS for the
        duration of that transaction.  If it generates a request
        later, it assumes the role of a user agent client for the
        processing of that transaction.

        Proxy, Proxy Server: An intermediary entity that acts as both
        a server and a client for the purpose of making requests on
        behalf of other clients.  A proxy server primarily plays the
        role of routing, which means its job is to ensure that a
        request is sent to another entity 'closer' to the targeted
        user.  Proxies are also useful for enforcing policy.  A proxy
        interprets and, if necessary, rewrites specific parts of a
        request message before forwarding it.

        Redirect Server: A redirect server is a user agent server that
        generates 3xx responses to requests it receives, directing the
        client to contact an alternate set of URIs.

        Registrar: A registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER
        requests and places the information it receives in those
        requests into the location service for the domain it handles."

    DESCRIPTION
       "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common MIB module.  This
        module defines objects that may be common to all SIP entities.

        SIP is an application-layer signaling protocol for creating,
        modifying and terminating multimedia sessions with one or more
        participants.  These sessions include Internet multimedia
        conferences and Internet telephone calls.  SIP is defined in
        <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> (June 2002).

        This MIB is defined for managing objects that are common to
        SIP User Agents (UAs), Proxy, Redirect, and Registrar servers.
        Objects specific to each of these entities MAY be managed using
        entity specific MIBs defined in other modules.

        Copyright (C) The IETF Trust (2007).  This version of
        this MIB module is part of <a href="./rfc4780">RFC 4780</a>; see the RFC itself for

        Example: If a user agent client supports, and requires the

        (<a href="./rfc3262">RFC 3262</a>), this table contains a row with the option tag string

        '1010 0000' or '0xA0' in sipCommonOptionTagHeaderField.

        If a server does not support the required feature (indicated in
        a Require header to a UAS, or in a Proxy-Require to a Proxy
        Server), the server returns a 420 Bad Extension listing the
        feature in an Unsupported header.

        Normally, the list of such features supported by an entity is
        static (i.e., will not change over time)."

    DESCRIPTION
       "This object contains a count of the number of transactions that
        are in progress and transactions that have reached the
        'Terminated' state.  It is not applicable to stateless SIP Proxy
        Servers.

        A SIP transaction occurs between a client and a server, and
        comprises all messages from the first request sent from the
        client to the server, up to a final (non-1xx) response sent
        from the server to the client.

        If the request is INVITE and the final response is a non-2xx,
        the transaction also include an ACK to the response.  The ACK
        for a 2xx response to an INVITE request is a separate
        transaction.

        The branch ID parameter in the Via header field values serves
        as a transaction identifier.

        A transaction is identified by the CSeq sequence number within
        a single call leg.  The ACK request has the same CSeq number as
        the corresponding INVITE request, but comprises a transaction
        of its own.

        In the case of a forked request, each branch counts as a single
        transaction.

        For a transaction stateless Proxy Server, this counter is
        always 0.

    DESCRIPTION
       "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) MIB module.

        SIP is an application-layer signaling protocol for creating,
        modifying, and terminating multimedia sessions with one or more
        participants.  These sessions include Internet multimedia
        conferences and Internet telephone calls.  SIP is defined in
        <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> (June 2002).

        A User Agent is an application that contains both a User Agent
        Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).  A UAC is an
        application that initiates a SIP request.  A UAS is an
        application that contacts the user when a SIP request is
        received and that returns a response on behalf of the user.
        The response accepts, rejects, or redirects the request.

        this MIB module is part of <a href="./rfc4780">RFC 4780</a>; see the RFC itself for

        A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.  It accepts
        requests from other clients, either responding to them or
        passing them on to other servers, possibly after modification.

        A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and returns
        zero or more addresses to that client.  Unlike a User Agent
        Server, it does not accept calls.

        A Registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER requests.  A
        Registrar is typically co-located with a Proxy or Redirect
        Server.

       "This object reflects the default mode of operation for the
        Proxy Server entity.

        A stateless proxy is a logical entity that does not maintain
        the client or server transaction state machines when it
        processes requests.  A stateless proxy forwards every request it
        receives downstream and every response it receives upstream.  If
        the value of this object is stateless(1), the proxy defaults to
        stateless operations.

        A transaction stateful proxy, or simply a 'stateful proxy', is
        a logical entity that maintains the client and server
        transaction state machines during the processing of a request.
        A (transaction) stateful proxy is not the same as a call
        stateful proxy.  If the value of this object is
        transactionStateful(2), the proxy is stateful on a transaction
        basis.

        A call stateful proxy is a logical entity if it retains state
        for a dialog from the initiating INVITE to the terminating BYE
        request.  A call stateful proxy is always transaction stateful,
        but the converse is not necessarily true.  If the value of this
        object is callStateful(3), the proxy is call stateful."

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are a number of management objects defined in the SIP-COMMON-
   MIB MIB module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
   create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in
   some network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-
   secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   The following read-create object in SIP-COMMON-MIB is used to
   configure the status code statistics that will be monitored by the
   SIP entity:

      sipCommonStatusCodeRowStatus:

      If this object is SET maliciously, it may result in an over-
      allocation of resources in a system for the purpose of
      accumulating and maintaining statistics.

   The following read-write objects in SIP-COMMON-MIB are used to
   configure the behavior of certain SNMP notifications potentially
   generated by a SIP entity:

      sipCommonStatusCodeNotifSend, sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode,
      sipCommonStatusCodeNotifThresh, sipCommonStatusCodeNotifInterval,
      sipCommonCfgServiceNotifEnable:

      If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in a system
      and/or network performance impact due to the generation of SNMP
      notifications.

   Some of the readable objects in the MIB modules (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   The following object values may contain private or confidential
   customer information like first name, last name, customer
   identification, location, company affiliation, the time the
   information was updated, etc.

      sipServerRegContactDisplayName, sipServerRegContactURI,
      sipServerRegContactLastUpdated and sipCommonCfgOrganization.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4780">RFC 4780</a>                    SIP MIB Modules                   April 2007</span>


   The sipCommonCfgTable table contains some objects that may help
   attackers gain knowledge about the status and operations of the SIP
   service.  In particular, the object value of
   sipCommonCfgServiceOperStatus may indicate that the SIP entity is in
   congested state and may lead attackers to build additional service
   attacks to overload the system.

   The sipCommonCfgEntityType object indicates the type of SIP entity,
   and the sipCommonMethodSupportedTable table contains in the SIP-
   COMMON-MIB MIB module list of SIP methods supported by each entity in
   the system.  Gaining access to this information may allow attackers
   to build method-specific attacks or use unsupported methods to create
   denial-of-service attack scenarios.

   In the SIP-UA-MIB MIB module, the sipUACfgServerTable contains the
   address of the SIP servers providing services to the UA, and
   obtaining this information may disclose some private or sensitive
   information about the SIP service usage.

   In the SIP-SERVER-MIB MIB module, the sipServerCfgProxyAuthMethod
   object defines the authentication methods supported by the server and
   may be used to build specific denial-of-service attackers targeted at
   the security mechanisms employed by the SIP entity.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this set of MIB modules.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="./rfc3410">RFC 3410</a> [<a href="./rfc3410" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>]), including
   full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsi when bility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to
   an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
