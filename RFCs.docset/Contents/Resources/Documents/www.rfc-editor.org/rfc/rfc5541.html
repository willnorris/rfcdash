Abstract

   The computation of one or a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched
   Paths (TE LSPs) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks is subject to a set of one or more
   specific optimization criteria, referred to as objective functions
   (e.g., minimum cost path, widest path, etc.).

   In the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture, a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may want a path to be computed for one or
   more TE LSPs according to a specific objective function.  Thus, the
   PCC needs to instruct the PCE to use the correct objective function.
   Furthermore, it is possible that not all PCEs support the same set of
   objective functions; therefore, it is useful for the PCC to be able
   to automatically discover the set of objective functions supported by
   each PCE.

   This document defines extensions to the PCE communication Protocol
   (PCEP) to allow a PCE to indicate the set of objective functions it
   supports.  Extensions are also defined so that a PCC can indicate in
   a path computation request the required objective function, and a PCE
   can report in a path computation reply the objective function that
   was used for path computation.

   This document defines objective function code types for six objective
   functions previously listed in the PCE requirements work, and
   provides the definition of four new metric types that apply to a set
   of synchronized requests.

   The Path Computation Element-based network architecture [<a href="./rfc4655" title='"A Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture"'>RFC4655</a>]
   defines a Path Computation Element (PCE) as an entity capable of
   computing the paths of Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE
   LSPs) based on a network graph and of applying computational
   constraints.  A PCE services path computation requests that are sent
   by Path Computation Clients (PCC).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5541">RFC 5541</a>              Objective Functions in PCEP              June 2009</span>


   The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP), defined in [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>], allows
   for communication between a PCC and a PCE or between two PCEs, in
   compliance with requirements and guidelines set forth in [<a href="./rfc4657" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements"'>RFC4657</a>].
   Such interactions include path computation requests and path
   computation replies.

   The computation of one or a set of TE LSPs is subject to a set of one
   or more optimization criteria, called an objective function.  An
   objective function is used by the PCE when it computes a path or a
   set of paths in order to select the "best" candidate paths.  There is
   a variety of objective functions: an objective function could apply
   either to a set of non-synchronized path computation requests, or to
   a set of synchronized path computation requests.  In the former case,
   the objective function refers to an individual path computation
   request (e.g., computation of the shortest constrained path where the
   metric is the IGP metric, computation of the least loaded constrained
   path, etc.).  Conversely, in the latter case, the objective function
   refers to a set of path computation requests the computation of which
   is synchronized (e.g., minimize the aggregate bandwidth consumption
   of all LSPs, minimize the sum of the delays for two diverse paths or
   of the delta between those delays, etc.).  Moreover, some objective
   functions relate to the optimization of a single metric and others to
   the optimization of a set of metrics (organized in a hierarchical
   manner, using a weighted function, etc.).

   As spelled out in [<a href="./rfc4674" title='"Requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery"'>RFC4674</a>], it may be useful for a PCC to discover
   the set of objective functions supported by a PCE.  Furthermore,
   [<a href="./rfc4657" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements"'>RFC4657</a>] requires the ability for a PCC to indicate in a path
   computation request a required/desired objective function, as well as
   optional function parameters.

   For these purposes, this document extends the PCE communication
   Protocol (PCEP).  It defines PCEP extensions that allow a PCE to
   advertise a list of supported objective functions, as well as
   extensions to carry the objective function in PCEP request and reply
   messages.  It complements the PCEP base specification [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>].

   Note that OSPF- and IS-IS-based PCE discovery mechanisms are defined
   in [<a href="./rfc5088" title='"OSPF Protocol Extensions for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery"'>RFC5088</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5089" title='"IS-IS Protocol Extensions for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery"'>RFC5089</a>].  These mechanisms are dedicated to the
   discovery of a few generic parameters, while more detailed PCE
   parameters should be discovered using the PCE communication Protocol.
   Objective functions are in this second category; thus, the objective
   function discovery procedure is handled by PCEP.

   A new PCEP TLV, named the OF-List TLV, is defined in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.  The
   OF-List TLV is carried in the PCEP OPEN object and allows a PCE to
   list, during PCEP session-setup phase, the objective functions that
   it supports.

   A new PCEP object, the OF object, is defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  The OF
   object is carried within a PCReq (Path Computation Request) message
   to indicate the required/desired objective function to be applied by
   a PCE, or in a PCRep (Path Computation Reply) message to indicate the
   objective function that was used for path computation.

   Six mandatory objective functions that must be supported by PCEP are
   listed in [<a href="./rfc4657" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements"'>RFC4657</a>].  This document provides a definition of these
   six mandatory objective functions.  Additional objective functions
   may be defined in other documents.  Note that additional objective
   functions are defined for the PCE Global Concurrent Optimization
   (GCO) application, in [<a href="#ref-PCE-GCO" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Requirements and Protocol Extensions in Support of Global Concurrent Optimization"'>PCE-GCO</a>].

   This document also provides the definition of four new metric types
   that apply to a set of synchronized requests.

   This section defines PCEP extensions (see [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>]) so as to support
   the advertisement of the objective functions supported by a PCE.

   A new PCEP OF-List (Objective Function list) TLV is defined.  The
   PCEP OF-List TLV is carried within an OPEN object.  This way, during
   PCEP session-setup phase, a PCE can advertise to a PCEP peer the list
   of objective functions it supports.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20OF-List%20TLV"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  OF-List TLV</span>

   The PCEP OF-List TLV is optional.  It MAY be carried within an OPEN
   object sent by a PCE in an Open message to a PCEP peer so as to
   indicate the list of supported objective functions.

   The OF-List TLV format is compliant with the PCEP TLV format defined
   in [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>].  That is, the TLV is composed of 2 octets for the type,
   2 octets specifying the TLV length, and a Value field.  The Length
   field defines the length of the value portion in octets.  The TLV is
   padded to 4-octet alignment, and padding is not included in the
   Length field (e.g., a 3-octet value would have a length of three, but
   the total size of the TLV would be eight octets).

   The PCEP OF-List TLV has the following format:

   TYPE:    4
   LENGTH:  N * 2 (where N is the number of objective functions)
   VALUE:   list of 2-byte objective function code points, identifying
            the objective functions supported by the sender of the Open
            message.

   OF Code (2 bytes): Objective Function code point identifier.  IANA

   A PCE MAY include an OF-List TLV within an OPEN object in an Open
   message sent to a PCEP peer in order to advertise a set of one or
   more objective functions.  The OF-List TLV MUST NOT appear more than
   once in an OPEN object.  If it appears more than once, the PCEP
   session MUST be rejected with error type 1 and error value 1 (PCEP
   session establishment failure / Reception of an invalid Open
   message).  The absence of the OF-List TLV in an OPEN object MUST be
   interpreted as an absence of information on the list of supported
   objective functions by the PCE.

   As specified in [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>], a PCEP peer that does not recognize the
   OF-List TLV will silently ignore it.

   This section defines PCEP extensions [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>] so as to support the
   communication of objective functions in PCEP path computation request
   and reply messages.  A new PCEP OF (Objective Function) object is
   defined, to be carried within a PCReq message in order for the PCC to
   indicate the required/desired objective function.

   The PCEP OF object may also be carried within a PCRep message in
   order for the PCE to indicate the objective function that was used by
   the PCE.

   A new flag is defined in the RP (Request Parameters) object.  The
   flag is used in a PCReq message to indicate that the PCE MUST include
   an OF object in the PCRep message to indicate the objective function
   that was used during path computation.

   Also, new PCEP error types and values are defined.

   Reserved (2 bytes): This field MUST be set to zero on transmission
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Optional TLVs may be defined in the future so as to encode objective

   To request the use of a specific objective function by the PCE, a PCC
   includes an OF object in the PCReq message.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5440">RFC5440</a>] specifies a bit flag, referred to as the P bit, carried in
   the common PCEP object header.  The P bit is set by a PCC to mandate
   that a PCE must take the information carried in the object into
   account during the path computation.

   If the P bit is set in the OF object, the objective function is
   mandatory (required objective function) and the PCE MUST use the
   objective function during path computation.  If the P bit is clear in
   the OF object, the objective function is optional (desired objective
   function) and the PCE SHOULD apply the function if it is supported
   but MAY choose to apply a different objective function, according to
   local capabilities and policies.

   On receipt of a PCReq message with an OF object, a PCE MUST proceed
   as follows:

   - If the OF object is unknown/unsupported, the PCE MUST follow
     procedures defined in [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>].  That is, if the P bit is set, the
     PCE sends a PCErr message with error type 3 or 4 (Unknown / Not
     supported object) and error value 1 or 2 (unknown / unsupported
     object class / object type), and the related path computation
     request MUST be discarded.  If the P bit is cleared, the PCE is
     free to ignore the object.

   - If the objective function is unknown/unsupported and the P bit is
     set, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with error type 3 or 4
     (Unknown / Not supported object) and error value 4
     (Unrecognized/Unsupported parameter), and the related path
     computation request MUST be discarded.

   - If the objective function is unknown/unsupported and the P bit is
     cleared, the PCE SHOULD apply another (default) objective function.

   - If the objective function is supported but policy does not permit
     applying it and if the P bit is set, the PCE MUST send a PCErr
     message with the PCEP error type "policy-violation" (type 5) and a
     new error value, "objective function not allowed", which is defined
     in this document.

   - If the objective function is supported but policy does not allow
     applying it and if the P bit is cleared, the PCE SHOULD apply
     another (default) objective function.

   - If the objective function is supported and policy allows applying
     it and if the P bit is set, the PCE MUST apply the requested
     objective function.  Otherwise, if the P bit is cleared, the PCE is
     free to apply any other objective function.

   The default objective function may be locally configured.

   The OF object MAY be carried within a PCReq message.  If an objective
   function is to be applied to a set of synchronized path computation
   requests, the OF object MUST be carried just after the corresponding
   SVEC (Synchronization VECtor) object and MUST NOT be repeated for
   each elementary request.

   Similarly, if a metric is to be applied to a set of synchronized
   requests, the METRIC object MUST follow the SVEC object and MUST NOT
   be repeated for each elementary request.  Note that metrics applied
   to a set of synchronized requests are defined in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   An OF object specifying an objective function that applies to an
   individual path computation request (non-synchronized case) MUST
   follow the RP object for which it applies.

   The format of the PCReq message is updated as follows.  Please see
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> for a full set of RBNF fragments defined in this document
   and the necessary code license.

   The OF object MAY be carried within a PCRep message to indicate the
   objective function used by the PCE during path computation.

   When the PCE wants to indicate to the PCC the objective function that
   was used for the synchronized computation of a set of paths, the
   PCRep message MUST include the corresponding SVEC object directly
   followed by the OF object, which MUST NOT be repeated for each
   elementary request.  If a metric is applicable to the set of paths,
   the METRIC object MUST directly follow the SVEC object and MUST NOT
   be repeated for each elementary request.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5541">RFC 5541</a>              Objective Functions in PCEP              June 2009</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20New%20RP%20Object%20Flag"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  New RP Object Flag</span>

   In some cases, where no objective function is specified in the
   request or an optional objective function is desired (P flag cleared
   in the OF object common header) but the PCE does not follow the
   request, the PCC may desire to know the objective function that was
   used by the PCE during path computation.  To that end, a new flag is
   defined in the RP object, named the OF flag, allowing a PCC to
   request for the inclusion in the path computation reply of the
   objective function that was used by the PCE during path computation.

   The following new bit flag of the RP object is defined:

   The Supply OF on response flag (bit number 24).  When set in a PCReq
   message, this indicates that the PCE MUST provide the applied
   objective function (should a path satisfying the constraints be
   found) in the PCRep message.  When set in a PCRep message, this
   indicates that the objective function that was used during path
   computation is included.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.1.%20%20Elements%20Of%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.1" id="section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  Elements Of Procedure</span>

   If the PCC wants to know the objective function used by the PCE
   during path computation for a given request, it sets the OF flag in
   the RP object.

   On receipt of a PCReq message with the OF flag in the RP object set,
   the PCE proceeds as follows:

   - If policy permits, it MUST include in the PCRep message an OF
     object indicating the objective function it used during path
     computation.

   - If policy does not permit, it MUST send a PCErr message with the
     PCEP error code "policy-violation" (type 5) and a new error value,
     "objective function indication not allowed", which is defined in
     this document.

   Note that a legacy PCE might not recognize the OF flag in the RP
   object.  According to the definition of the Flags field for the RP
   object (<a href="./rfc5440#section-7.4.1">Section 7.4.1 of [RFC5440]</a>), the legacy PCE will ignore the
   unknown flag, resulting in it sending a PCRep that does not contain
   an OF object.  In this case, the PCC's behavior is an implementation
   choice.  The PCC might:

   - Discard the PCRep because it really wanted the OF object returned.

   - Accept the PCRep without the knowledge of the OF that was applied.

   Note also that these procedures can give rise to the situation where
   a PCC receives a PCRep that contains an OF object with an objective
   function identifier that the PCC does not recognize.  In this
   situation, the PCC behavior is dependent on implementation and
   configuration.  The PCC could choose any of the following (or some
   other action):

   - Ignore the OF object and use the computed path.

   - Add the objective function to its view of the PCE's repertoire for
     inclusion in future computation requests.

   - Discard the PCRep (i.e., the computed path) and send a PCReq to
     another PCE.

   - Discard the PCRep (i.e., the computed path) and send another PCReq
     to the same PCE explicitly requiring the use of some other
     objective function (i.e., by setting the P bit in the OF object).

   Six objective functions that must be supported by PCEP are listed in
   [<a href="./rfc4657" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements"'>RFC4657</a>].  Objective function codes have been assigned by IANA and
   are described below.

   Objective functions are formulated using the following terminology:

   - A network comprises a set of N links {Li, (i=1...N)}.

   - A path P is a list of K links {Lpi,(i=1...K)}.

   - Metric of link L is denoted M(L).  This can be the IGP metric, the
     TE metric, or any other metric.

   - The cost of a path P is denoted C(P), where C(P) = sum {M(Lpi),
     (i=1...K)}.

   - Residual bandwidth on link L is denoted r(L).

   - Maximum reservable bandwidth on link L is denoted R(L).

   There are three objective functions that apply to the computation of
   a single path:

   Objective Function Code: 1
   Name: Minimum Cost Path (MCP)
   Description: Find a path P such that C(P) is minimized.

   Objective Function Code: 2
   Name: Minimum Load Path (MLP)
   Description: Find a path P such that
           ( Max {(R(Lpi) - r(Lpi)) / R(Lpi), i=1...K } ) is minimized.

   Objective Function Code: 3
   Name: Maximum residual Bandwidth Path (MBP)
   Description: Find a path P such that
             ( Min { r(Lpi), i=1...K } ) is maximized.

   There are three objective functions that apply to a set of path
   computation requests the computation of which is synchronized:

   Objective Function Code: 4
   Name: Minimize aggregate Bandwidth Consumption (MBC)
   Description: Find a set of paths such that
             ( Sum {R(Li) - r(Li), i=1...N} ) is minimized.

   Objective Function Code: 5
   Name: Minimize the Load of the most loaded Link (MLL)
   Description: Find a set of paths such that
             ( Max { (R(Li) - r(Li)) / R(Li), i=1...N}) is minimized.

   Objective Function Code: 6
   Name: Minimize the Cumulative Cost of a set of paths (MCC)
   Description: Find a set of paths {P1...Pm} such that
             (Sum { C(Pi), i=1...m}) is minimized.

   Other objective functions may be defined in separate documents.

   Three metric types are defined in PCEP for the METRIC object: TE
   metric, IGP metric, and hop count.  These metric types apply to an
   individual request.  Here, we define four new metric types that apply
   to a set of synchronized requests:

      Type 4: Aggregate bandwidth consumption.

      Type 5: Load of the most loaded link.

      Type 6: Cumulative IGP cost.

      Type 7: Cumulative TE cost.

   These metrics may be used in a PCReq to indicate a bound (B bit set
   in the METRIC object) or to request the computation of a metric (C
   bit set in the METRIC object), or in a PCRep to indicate a computed
   metric.

   A METRIC object with one of these four types follows the SVEC object
   for which it applies.

   This document defines a 16-bit PCE objective function identifier to
   be carried within the PCEP OF object, and also defines the PCEP OF-
   List TLV.

   IANA created and now manages the 16-bit "PCE Objective Function" code
   point registry, starting from 1 and continuing through 32767, as
   follows:

   - Objective Function code point value
   - Objective Function name
   - Defining RFC

   The same registry is applicable to the OF object and the OF-List TLV
   that are defined in this document.

   The guidelines (using terms defined in [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>]) for the assignment
   of objective function code point values are as follows:

   - Function code value 0 is reserved.

   - Function code values in the range 1-32767 are assigned as follows:

     o Function code values 1 through 1023 are assigned by IANA using
       the "IETF Review" policy.

     o Function code values 1024 through 32767 are assigned by IANA,
       using the "First Come First Served" policy.

     o Function code values in the range 32768-65535 are for "Private
       Use".

   PCEP security mechanisms are described in [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>] and are used to
   secure entire PCEP messages.  Nothing in this document changes the
   message flows or introduces any new messages, so the security
   mechanisms set out in [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>] continue to be applicable.

   This document introduces a single new object that may optionally be
   carried on PCEP messages and will be automatically secured using the
   mechanisms described in [<a href="./rfc5440" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>].

   If a PCEP message is vulnerable to attack (for example, because the
   security mechanisms are not used), then the OF object could be used
   as part of an attack; however, it is likely that other objects will
   provide far more significant ways of attacking a PCE or PCC in this
   case.

   It MUST be possible to configure the activation/deactivation of
   objective function discovery in PCEP.

   In addition to the parameters already listed in <a href="./rfc5440#section-8.1">Section 8.1 of
   [RFC5440]</a>, a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring a list of
   authorized objective functions on a PCE.  This may apply to any
   session the PCEP speaker participates in, to a specific session with
   a given PCEP peer, or to a specific group of sessions with a specific
   group of PCEP peers.

   Note that it is not mandatory for an implementation to support all
   objective functions defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   It MUST be possible to configure a default objective function used
   for path computation when a path request is received that requests to
   use an optional objective function.

   The PCEP MIB Module defined in [<a href="#ref-PCEP-MIB" title='"PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) Management Information Base"'>PCEP-MIB</a>] could be extended to
   include objective functions.
