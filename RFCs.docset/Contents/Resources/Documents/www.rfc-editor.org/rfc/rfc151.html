                   <span class="h1">COMMENTS ON A PROFERRED OFFICIAL ICP</span>
                             <span class="h1">(RFCs 123, 127)</span>





Bob Long at SDC noticed that the order in which messages go out to the
network depend on the local NCP. In particular commands may be given
priority over data and therefore in the sequence specified for server in
<a href="./rfc123">RFC 123</a> (top of Page 3), the last two INIT commands may go out before the
data = S on socket = L is sent.  (This is the case in the current
implementation of SDC's NCP.) The implication is that the user's NCP should
be prepared to keep the INIT's it received from the server until the user
process gets the data = S and issues two INITs in response.

This case is brought up now so that people will think about it before the
Atlantic City meeting and comment whether their NCP can tolerate it. It may
be necessary to make it explicit in the ICP that the two INITs sent by the
server should go out only after the data = S is sent, or even after the
user process acknowledges its receipt.

I have a more general remark about the ICP. This is a third level protocol
and therefore should not alter or ignore procedures of the second level
protocol (Host-Host protocol). In particular three remarks seem
appropriate:

   to second level protocol (RDC 107) it is specified that it is up to the
   sending process to chose the byte size. According to the Host-Host
   protocol, NCPs should be prepared to accept messages in any byte size
   (1&lt;= size &lt;=255);  therefore there is no need to impose a size of 32 in
   this case.  Furthermore, since it is up to the sender to choose the byte
   size, some Hosts may choose a particular byte size (for simplicity and
   convenience) and their NCP may not be geared to transmit in an imposed
   byte size.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20In%20RFCs%2066%20and%2080%2C%20an%20ALL%20is%20expected%20on%20the%20connection%20to%20the%20server"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.

   disappeared.  But the ALL is a Host-Host protocol requirement and not
   requiring it creates special case. A particular NCP implementation may
   cause the ALL to be sent internally when a connection is created,
   without the user process having control of it. Relaxing this requirement
   will create a special case for the receiving NCP not to send the ALL and
   for the sending NCP to send the data = S without first receiving an ALL.

   can be sent in any size pieces and the size is to be specified through
   the ALL mechanism. In particular, there may be hosts which are not
   prepared to accept more than few bytes at a time (TIPs).

In general we should not make second level decisions in a third level
protocol.
