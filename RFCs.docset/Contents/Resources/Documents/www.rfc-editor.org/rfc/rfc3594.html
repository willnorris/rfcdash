Abstract

   This document defines a new sub-option for the DHCP CableLabs Client
   Configuration (CCC) Option.  This new sub-option will be used to
   direct CableLabs Client Devices (CCDs) to invalidate security tickets
   stored in CCD non volatile memory (i.e., locally persisted security
   tickets).

   The CableLabs Client Configuration Option [<a href="#ref-1" title='"DHCP Option for CableLabs Client Configuration"'>1</a>] defines several
   sub-options used to configure devices deployed into CableLabs
   architectures.  These architectures implement the PacketCable
   Security Specification [<a href="#ref-4" title='"PacketCable Security Specification"'>4</a>] (based on Kerberos V5 [<a href="#ref-5" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>5</a>]), to support CCD
   authentication and establishment of security associations between
   CCDs and application servers.

   CCDs are permitted to retain security tickets in local persistent
   storage.  Thus a power-cycled CCD is enabled to avoid expensive
   ticket acquisition for locally persisted, non-expired tickets.  This
   feature greatly reduces the security overhead of a deployment.

   This sub-option allows the service provider to control the lifetime
   of tickets persisted locally on a CCD.  The service provider requires
   this capability to support operational functions such as forcing re-
   establishment of security associations, remote testing, and remote
   diagnostic of CCDs.

   It should be noted that, although based on the Kerberos V5 RFC [<a href="#ref-5" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>5</a>],
   the PacketCable Security Specification is not a strict implementation
   of this RFC.  See [<a href="#ref-4" title='"PacketCable Security Specification"'>4</a>] for details of the PacketCable Security
   Specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20%20Security%20Ticket%20Control%20Sub-option"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.   Security Ticket Control Sub-option</span>

   This sub-option defines a Ticket Control Mask (TCM) that instructs
   the CCD to validate/invalidate specific application server tickets.
   The sub-option is encoded as follows:

    Code   Len      TCM
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  9  |  2  | m1  | m2  |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+

   The length MUST be 2.  The TCM field is encoded as an unsigned 16 bit
   quantity per network byte order.  Each bit of the TCM is assigned to
   a specific server or server group.  A bit value of 0 means the CCD
   MUST apply normal invalidation rules (defined in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"PacketCable Security Specification"'>4</a>]) to the locally

   persisted ticket for the server/server group. A bit value of 1 means
   the CCD MUST immediately invalidate the locally persisted ticket for
   the server/server group.

   Bit #0 is the least significant bit of the field.  The bit positions
   are assigned as follows:

      Bit #0 - the PacketCable Provisioning Server used by the CCD.

      Bit #1 - the group of all PacketCable Call Management Servers used
      by the CCD.

      Bit #2 - #15.  Reserved and MUST be set to 0.

   If a CCD does not locally store tickets, it MUST ignore this
   sub-option.  Bit values not known to the CCD MUST be ignored.

   IANA has assigned a sub-option code to this sub-option from the
   "CableLabs Client Configuration" sub-option number space (maintained
   within the BOOTP-DHCP Parameters Registry).

   IANA has also set-up a new registry and will maintain a new number
   space of "CableLabs Client Configuration Option Ticket Control Mask
   Bit Definitions", located in the BOOTP-DHCP Parameters Registry.  The
   initial bit definitions are described in <a href="#section-4">section 4</a> of this document.
   IANA will register future bit mask definitions via an "IETF
   Consensus" approval policy as described in <a href="./rfc2434">RFC 2434</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title="">3</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.   Security Considerations</span>

   Potential DHCP protocol attack exposure is discussed in <a href="#section-7">section 7</a> of
   the DHCP protocol specification [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>6</a>] and in Authentication for DHCP
   Messages [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Authentication for DHCP Messages"'>7</a>].  Additional CCC attack exposure is discussed in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"DHCP Option for CableLabs Client Configuration"'>1</a>].

   The STC sub-option could be used to disrupt a CableLabs architecture
   deployment.  In the specific case of PacketCable [<a href="#ref-8" title='"PacketCable 1.0 Architecture Framework Technical Report"'>8</a>], a deployment
   could be disrupted if a large number of MTAs are reset/power cycled,
   initiate their provisioning flow [<a href="#ref-9" title='"PacketCable MTA Device Provisioning Specification"'>9</a>], and are instructed by a
   malicious DHCP server to invalidate all security tickets.  This could
   lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition as this large set of MTAs
   simultaneously attempt to authenticate and obtain tickets from the
   security infrastructure.

   However, the scenario described above is unlikely to occur. Within
   the cable delivery architecture required by the various CableLabs
   projects, the DHCP client is connected to a network through a cable

   modem and the CMTS (head-end router).  The CMTS is explicitly
   configured with a set of valid DHCP server addresses to which DHCP
   requests are forwarded.  Further, a correctly configured CMTS will
   only allow DHCP downstream traffic from specific DHCP server
   addresses.

   It should be noted that the downstream filtering of DHCP packets will
   not prevent spoofed DHCP servers behind the CMTS, but the network
   infrastructure behind the CMTS is assumed to be closely controlled by
   the service provider.
