<title>RFC 9424: Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and Their Role in Attack Defence</title>

       Cyber defenders frequently rely on Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to
      identify, trace, and block malicious activity in networks or on
      endpoints. This document reviews the fundamentals, opportunities,
      operational limitations, and recommendations for IoC use. It highlights
      the need for IoCs to be detectable in implementations of Internet
      protocols, tools, and technologies -- both for the IoCs' initial
      discovery and their use in detection -- and provides a foundation for
      approaches to operational challenges in network security.

  NOTE: Changes at the bottom of this file overrides some earlier settings.

  Once the style has stabilized and has been adopted as an official RFC style,
  this can be consolidated so that style settings occur only in one place, but
  for now the contents of this file consists first of the initial CSS work as
  provided to the RFC Formatter (xml2rfc) work, followed by itemized and
  commented changes found necessary during the development of the v3
  formatters.

<h1 id="title">Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and Their Role in Attack Defence</h1>
<section id="section-abstract">
      <h2 id="abstract"><a class="selfRef" href="#abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p id="section-abstract-1">Cyber defenders frequently rely on Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to
      identify, trace, and block malicious activity in networks or on
      endpoints. This document reviews the fundamentals, opportunities,
      operational limitations, and recommendations for IoC use. It highlights
      the need for IoCs to be detectable in implementations of Internet
      protocols, tools, and technologies -- both for the IoCs' initial
      discovery and their use in detection -- and provides a foundation for
      approaches to operational challenges in network security.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-abstract-1">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-1-1">This document describes the various types of IoCs and how they are
      used effectively in attack defence (often called "cyber defence"). It
      introduces concepts such as the Pyramid of Pain <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#PoP">PoP</a>]</span> and the IoC lifecycle to highlight how IoCs may be
      used to provide a broad range of defences. This document provides
      suggestions for implementers of controls based on IoCs as well as
      potential operational limitations. Two case studies that demonstrate
      the usefulness of IoCs for detecting and defending against real-world
      attacks are included. One case study involves an intrusion set (a set of
      malicious activity and behaviours attributed to one threat actor) known
      as "APT33", and the other involves an attack tool called "Cobalt Strike". This
      document is not a comprehensive report of APT33 or Cobalt Strike and is

<p id="section-3.1-1">IoCs are observable artefacts relating to an attacker or their
        activities, such as their tactics, techniques, procedures, and
        associated tooling and infrastructure. These indicators can be
        observed at the network or endpoint (host) levels and can, with varying
        degrees of confidence, help network defenders to proactively block
        malicious traffic or code execution, determine a cyber intrusion
        occurred, or associate discovered activity to a known intrusion set
        and thereby potentially identify additional avenues for
        investigation. IoCs are deployed to firewalls and other security
        control points by adding them to the list of indicators that the
        control point is searching for in the traffic that it is monitoring.
       
        When associated with malicious activity, the following are some examples of protocol-related IoCs:<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-3.1-1">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.1-3">The common types of IoC form a Pyramid of Pain <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#PoP">PoP</a>]</span> that informs prevention, detection, and mitigation
        strategies. The position of each IoC type in the pyramid represents how much
        "pain" a typical adversary experiences as part of changing the
        activity that produces that artefact. The greater pain an adversary
        experiences (towards the top), the less likely they are to change
        those aspects of their activity and the longer the IoC is likely to
        reflect the attacker's intrusion set (i.e., the less fragile those
        IoCs will be from a defender's perspective). The layers of the PoP
        commonly range from hashes up to TTPs, with the pain ranging from
        simply recompiling code to creating a whole new attack strategy. Other
        types of IoC do exist and could be included in an extended version of
        the PoP should that assist the defender in understanding and
        discussing intrusion sets most relevant to them.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-3.1-3">¶</a></p>

        firewalls or endpoint protection to block malicious downloads or
        prevent code execution. While IoCs aren't the only way for defenders
        to do this kind of blocking, they are a quick, convenient, and
        nonintrusive method. Hashes are precise detections for individual
        files based on their binary content. To subvert this defence, however,
        an adversary need only recompile code, or otherwise modify the file
        content with some trivial changes, to modify the hash value.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-3.1-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.1-6">The next two levels are IP addresses and domain names. Interactions
        with these may be blocked, with varying false positive rates
        (misidentifying non-malicious traffic as malicious; see <a class="auto internal xref" href="#sec-operational-limitations">Section 5</a>), and often
        cause more pain to an adversary to subvert than file hashes. The
        adversary may have to change IP ranges, find a new provider, and
        change their code (e.g., if the IP address is hard-coded rather than
        resolved). A similar situation applies to domain names, but in some
        cases, threat actors have specifically registered these to masquerade
        as a particular organisation or to otherwise falsely imply or claim an
        association that will be convincing or misleading to those they are
        attacking. While the process and cost of registering new domain names
        are now unlikely to be prohibitive or distracting to many attackers,
        there is slightly greater pain in selecting unregistered, but
        appropriate, domain names for such purposes.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-3.1-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.1-7">Network and endpoint artefacts, such as a malware's beaconing
        pattern on the network or the modified timestamps of files touched on
        an endpoint, are harder still to change as they relate specifically to
        the attack taking place and, in some cases, may not be under the
        direct control of the attacker. However, more sophisticated attackers
        use TTPs or tooling that provides flexibility at this level (such as
        Cobalt Strike's malleable command and control <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#COBALT">COBALT</a>]</span>) or a means by which some artefacts can be masked
        (see <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#Timestomp">Timestomp</a>]</span>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-3.1-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.1-8">Tools and TTPs form the top two levels of the pyramid; these levels
        describe a threat actor's methodology -- the way they perform the
        attack. The tools level refers specifically to the software (and less
        frequently, hardware) used to conduct the attack, whereas the TTPs
        level picks up on all the other aspects of the attack strategy. IoCs
        at these levels are more complicated and complex -- for example, they
        can include the details of how an attacker deploys malicious code to
        perform reconnaissance of a victim's network, pivots laterally to
        a valuable endpoint, and then downloads a ransomware payload. TTPs and
        tools take intensive effort to diagnose on the part of the defender,
        but they are fundamental to the attacker and campaign and hence
        incredibly painful for the adversary to change.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-3.1-8">¶</a></p>

        more IoCs being discovered, assessed, shared, and deployed. This cycle

<p id="section-3.2.1-1">IoCs are discovered initially through manual investigation or
          automated analysis. They can be discovered in a range of sources,
          including at endpoints and in the network (on the wire). They must
          either be extracted from logs monitoring protocol packet captures,
          code execution, or system activity (in the case of hashes, IP
          addresses, domain names, and network or endpoint artefacts) or be
          determined through analysis of attack activity or tooling. In some
          cases, discovery may be a reactive process, where IoCs from past or
          current attacks are identified from the traces left behind. However,
          discovery may also result from proactive hunting for potential
          future IoCs extrapolated from knowledge of past events (such as from
          identifying attacker infrastructure by monitoring domain name

          indicators cannot be extracted or, once they are extracted, cannot
          be subsequently associated with a later related exchange of messages
          or artefacts in the same, or in a different, protocol. If it is not

          correct deployment is important.  Different IoCs will detect
          malicious activity at different layers of the network stack and at
          different stages of an attack, so deploying a range of IoCs enables
          layers of defence at each security control, reinforcing the benefits
          of using multiple security controls as part of a defence-in-depth
          solution. The network security controls and endpoint solutions where
          they are deployed need to have sufficient privilege, and sufficient
          visibility, to detect IoCs and to act on them. Wherever IoCs exist,
          they need to be made available to security controls and associated
          apparatus to ensure they can be deployed quickly and widely. While
          IoCs may be manually assessed after discovery or receipt,
          significant advantage may be gained by automatically ingesting,
          processing, assessing, and deploying IoCs from logs or intelligence
          feeds to the appropriate security controls. As not all IoCs are of
          the same quality, confidence in IoCs drawn from each threat

          thus addressing the threat for the whole user base at once in a

<p id="section-4.1.1-1">Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), and Intrusion
          Prevention Systems (IPSs) all employ IoCs to identify and mitigate
          threats across networks. Antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and
          Response (EDR) products deploy IoCs via catalogues or libraries to
          supported client endpoints. Security Incident Event Management
          (SIEM) platforms compare IoCs against aggregated logs from various
          sources -- network, endpoint, and application. Of course, IoCs do not
          address all attack defence challenges, but they form a vital tier
          of any organisation's layered defence. Some types of IoC may be
          present across all those controls while others may be deployed only
          in certain layers of a defence-in-depth solution. Further, IoCs
          relevant to a specific kill chain may only reflect activity
          performed during a certain phase and so need to be combined with
          other IoCs or mechanisms for complete coverage of the kill chain as
          part of an intrusion set.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4.1.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.1.1-2">As an example, open-source malware can be deployed by many
          different actors, each using their own TTPs and
          infrastructure. However, if the actors use the same executable, the
          hash of the executable file remains the same, and this hash can be
          deployed as an IoC in endpoint protection to block execution
          regardless of individual actor, infrastructure, or other TTPs.
          Should this defence fail in a specific case, for example, if an actor
          recompiles the executable binary producing a unique hash, other
          defences can prevent them progressing further through their attack,
          for instance, by blocking known malicious domain name lookups and
          thereby preventing the malware calling out to its C2 infrastructure.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4.1.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.1.1-3">Alternatively, another malicious actor may regularly change their
          tools and infrastructure (and thus the indicators associated with
          the intrusion set) deployed across different campaigns, but their
          access vectors may remain consistent and well-known. In this case,
          this access TTP can be recognised and proactively defended against,
          even while there is uncertainty of the intended subsequent
          activity. For example, if their access vector consistently exploits
          a vulnerability in software, regular and estate-wide patching can
          prevent the attack from taking place. However, should these
          preemptive measures fail, other IoCs observed across multiple
          campaigns may be able to prevent the attack at later stages in the

<p id="section-4.1.2-1">IoCs are inexpensive, scalable, and easy to deploy, making their
          use particularly beneficial for smaller entities, especially where
          they are exposed to a significant threat. For example, a small
          manufacturing subcontractor in a supply chain producing a critical,
          highly specialised component may represent an attractive target
          because there would be disproportionate impact on both the supply
          chain and the prime contractor if it were compromised. It may be
          reasonable to assume that this small manufacturer will have only
          basic security (whether internal or outsourced), and while it is likely
          to have comparatively fewer resources to manage the risks that it
          faces compared to larger partners, it can still leverage IoCs to
          great effect. Small entities like this can deploy IoCs to give a
          baseline protection against known threats without having access to a
          well-resourced, mature defensive team and the threat intelligence
          relationships necessary to perform resource-intensive
          investigations. While some level of expertise on the part of such a

          they are indeed malicious. In this way, a major part of the appeal

<p id="section-4.1.3-1">Individual IoCs can provide widespread protection that scales
          effectively for defenders across an organisation or
          ecosystem. Within a single organisation, simply blocking one IoC may
          protect thousands of users, and that blocking may be performed
          (depending on the IoC type) across multiple security controls
          monitoring numerous different types of activity within networks,
          endpoints, and applications. The prime contractor from our earlier
          example can supply IoCs to the small subcontractor and thus further
          uplift that smaller entity's defensive capability while protecting itself and its interests at the same

          application in services they utilise. In the case of an ongoing
          email-phishing campaign, IoCs can be monitored, discovered, and
          deployed quickly and easily by individual organisations. However, if
          they are deployed quickly via a mechanism such as a protective
          DNS filtering service, they can be more effective still -- an email
          campaign may be mitigated before some organisations' recipients ever
          click the link or before some malicious payloads can call out for
          instructions. Through such approaches, other parties can be

          </h4>
<p id="section-4.1.4-1">IoCs can also be very easily shared between individuals and
          organisations. First, IoCs are easy to distribute as they can be
          represented concisely as text (possibly in hexadecimal) and so are
          frequently exchanged in small numbers in emails, blog posts, or
          technical reports. Second, standards, such as those mentioned in

          well-defined formats for sharing large collections or regular sets
          of IoCs along with all the associated context. While discovering one
          IoC can be intensive, once shared via well-established routes, that
          individual IoC may protect thousands of organisations and thus all
          of the users in those organisations. Quick and easy sharing of IoCs gives blanket
          coverage for organisations and allows widespread mitigation in a
          timely fashion -- they can be shared with systems administrators,
          from small to large organisations and from large teams to single

<p id="section-4.1.5-1">Not only are there time savings from sharing IoCs, saving
          duplication of investigation effort, but deploying them
          automatically at scale is seamless for many enterprises. Where
          automatic deployment of IoCs is working well, organisations and
          users get blanket protection with minimal human intervention and
          minimal effort, a key goal of attack defence. The ability to do
          this at scale and at pace is often vital when responding to agile
          threat actors that may change their intrusion set frequently and
          hence change the relevant IoCs. Conversely, protecting a complex
          network without automatic deployment of IoCs could mean manually
          updating every single endpoint or network device consistently and
          reliably to the same security state. The work this entails
          (including locating assets and devices, polling for logs and system
          information, and manually checking patch levels) introduces
          complexity and a need for skilled analysts and engineers. While it
          is still necessary to invest effort both to enable efficient IoC
          deployment and to eliminate false positives when widely deploying
          IoCs, the cost and effort involved can be far smaller than the work
          entailed in reliably manually updating all endpoint and network
          devices. For example, legacy systems may be

<p id="section-4.1.7-1">Deployment of various modern security controls, such as firewall
          filtering or EDR, come with an inherent trade-off between breadth of
          protection and various costs, including the risk of false positives
          (see <a class="auto internal xref" href="#sec-precision">Section 5.2</a>), staff time,
          and pure financial costs. Organisations can use threat modelling and
          information assurance to assess and prioritise risk from identified
          threats and to determine how they will mitigate or accept each of
          them. Contextual information tying IoCs to specific threats or
          actors and shared alongside the IoCs enables organisations to focus
          their defences against particular risks. This contextual information
          is generally expected by those receiving IoCs as it allows them the
          technical freedom and capability to choose their risk appetite,
          security posture, and defence methods. The ease of sharing this
          contextual information alongside IoCs, in part due to the formats
          outlined in <a class="auto internal xref" href="#sec-sharing">Section 3.2.3</a>, makes it
          easier to track malicious actors across campaigns and
          targets. Producing this contextual information before sharing IoCs
          can take intensive analytical effort as well as specialist tools and
          training. At its simplest, it can involve documenting sets of IoCs
          from multiple instances of the same attack campaign, for example,
          from multiple unique payloads (and therefore with distinct file
          hashes) from the same source and connecting to the same C2 server. A
          more complicated approach is to cluster similar combinations of TTPs
          seen across multiple campaigns over a period of time. This can be
          used alongside detailed malware reverse engineering and target
          profiling, overlaid on a geopolitical and criminal backdrop, to

            Typically, APT33 performs spear phishing (sending targeted

            with document lures that imitate legitimate publications. User
            interaction with these lures executes the initial payload and
            enables APT33 to gain initial access. Once inside a target
            network, APT33 attempts to pivot to other machines to gather
            documents and gain access to administrative credentials. In some
            cases, users are tricked into providing credentials that are then
            used with Ruler <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#RULER">RULER</a>]</span>, a freely
            available tool that allows exploitation of an email client. The
            attacker, in possession of a target's password, uses Ruler to
            access the target's mail account and embeds a malicious script
            that will be triggered when the mail client is next opened,
            resulting in the execution of malicious code (often additional
            malware retrieved from the Internet) (see <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#FireEye">FireEye</a>]</span>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4.2.2.1-1">¶</a></p>

            loss and renders devices unusable until the operating system is
            reinstalled. In some cases, the actor uses administrator
            credentials to invoke execution across a large swathe of a
            company's IT estate at once; where this isn't possible, the actor
            may first attempt to spread the wiper manually or use

          as pain for the attacker. The less painful it is for the attacker to
          change an IoC, the more fragile that IoC is as a defence tool. It
          is relatively simple to determine the hash value for various
          malicious file attachments observed as lures in a phishing campaign
          and to deploy these through AV or an email gateway security
          control. However, those hashes are fragile and can (and often will)
          be changed between campaigns. Malicious IP addresses and domain
          names can also be changed between campaigns, but this may happen
          less frequently due to the greater pain of managing infrastructure
          compared to altering files, and so IP addresses and domain names may
          provide a less fragile detection capability.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.1.1-1">¶</a></p>

          and if a known IoC isn't changed by the attacker but wasn't blocked,
          then the defender missed an opportunity to halt an attack in its
          tracks. Second, even within one IoC type, there is variation in
          the fragility depending on the context of the IoC. The file hash of
          a phishing lure document (with a particular theme and containing a
          specific staging server link) may be more fragile than the file hash
          of a remote access trojan payload the attacker uses after initial
          access. That in turn may be more fragile than the file hash of an
          attacker-controlled post-exploitation reconnaissance tool that
          doesn't connect directly to the attacker's infrastructure. Third,
          some threats and actors are more capable or inclined to change than
          others, and so the fragility of an IoC for one may be very different
          to an IoC of the same type for another actor.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.1.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1.1-3">Ultimately, fragility is a defender's concern that impacts the
          ongoing efficacy of each IoC and will factor into decisions about
          end of life. However, it should not prevent adoption of individual
          IoCs unless there are significantly strict resource constraints that
          demand down-selection of IoCs for deployment. More usually,
          defenders researching threats will attempt to identify IoCs of
          varying fragilities for a particular kill chain to provide the
          greatest chances of ongoing detection given available investigative
          effort (see <a class="auto internal xref" href="#sec-discoverability">Section 5.1.2</a>)
          and while still maintaining precision (see <a class="auto internal xref" href="#sec-precision">Section 5.2</a>).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.1.1-3">¶</a></p>

          </h4>
<p id="section-5.1.2-1">To be used in attack defence, IoCs must first be discovered
          through proactive hunting or reactive investigation. As noted in
          <a class="auto internal xref" href="#sec-pop">Section 3.1</a>, IoCs in the tools and
          TTPs levels of the PoP require intensive effort and research to
          discover. However, it is not just an IoC's type that impacts its
          discoverability. The sophistication of the actor, their TTPs, and
          their tooling play a significant role, as does whether the IoC is
          retrieved from logs after the attack or extracted from samples or
          infected systems earlier.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.1.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1.2-2">For example, on an infected endpoint, it may be possible to
          identify a malicious payload and then extract relevant IoCs, such as
          the file hash and its C2 server address. If the attacker used the
          same static payload throughout the attack, this single file hash
          value will cover all instances. However, if the attacker
          diversified their payloads, that hash can be more fragile, and other
          hashes may need to be discovered from other samples used on other
          infected endpoints. Concurrently, the attacker may have simply
          hard-coded configuration data into the payload, in which case the C2
          server address can be easy to recover. Alternatively, the address
          can be stored in an obfuscated persistent configuration
          within either the payload (e.g., within its source code or associated
          resource) or the infected endpoint's file system (e.g., using
          alternative data streams <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#ADS">ADS</a>]</span>),
          thus requiring more effort to discover. Further, the attacker may be
          storing the configuration in memory only or relying on a
          DGA to generate C2 server addresses on
          demand. In this case, extracting the C2 server address can require a
          memory dump or the execution or reverse engineering of the DGA, all
          of which increase the effort still further.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.1.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1.2-3">If the malicious payload has already communicated with its C2
          server, then it may be possible to discover that C2 server address
          IoC from network traffic logs more easily. However, once again,
          multiple factors can make discoverability more challenging, such as
          the increasing adoption of HTTPS for malicious traffic, meaning C2
          communications blend in with legitimate traffic and can be
          complicated to identify. Further, some malwares obfuscate their
          intended destinations by using alternative DNS resolution services
          (e.g., OpenNIC <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#OPENNIC">OPENNIC</a>]</span>), by using
          encrypted DNS protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#OILRIG">OILRIG</a>]</span>, or by performing transformation
          operations on resolved IP addresses to determine the real C2 server
          address encoded in the DNS response <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#LAZARUS">LAZARUS</a>]</span>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.1.2-3">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-5.1.3-1">In many cases, the list of indicators resulting from an activity
          or discovered in a malware sample is relatively short and so only
          adds to the total set of all indicators in a limited and finite
          manner. A clear example of this is when static indicators for C2
          servers are discovered in a malware strain. Sharing, deployment, and
          detection will often not be greatly impacted by the addition of such
          indicators for one more incident or one more sample. However, in the
          case of discovery of a DGA, this
          requires a reimplementation of the algorithm and then execution to
          generate a possible list of domains. Depending on the algorithm,
          this can result in very large lists of indicators, which may cause
          performance degradation, particularly during detection. In some
          cases, such sources of indicators can lead to a pragmatic decision
          being made between obtaining reasonable coverage of the possible
          indicator values and theoretical completeness of a list of all

          </h4>
<p id="section-5.2.1-1">Alongside pain and fragility, the PoP's levels can also be
          considered in terms of how precise the defence can be, with the
          false positive rate usually increasing as we move up the pyramid to
          less specific IoCs. A hash value identifies a particular file, such
          as an executable binary, and given a suitable cryptographic hash
          function, the false positives are effectively nil (by "suitable", we
          mean one with preimage resistance and strong collision resistance).
          In comparison, IoCs in the upper levels (such as some network
          artefacts or tool fingerprints) may apply to various malicious
          binaries, and even benign software may share the same identifying
          characteristics. For example, threat actor tools making web requests
          may be identified by the user-agent string specified in the request
          header. However, this value may be the same as that used by
          legitimate software, either by the attacker's choice or through use
          of a common library.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.2.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.2.1-2">It should come as no surprise that the more specific an IoC, the
          more fragile it is; as things change, they move outside of that
          specific focus. While less fragile IoCs may be desirable for their
          robustness and longevity, this must be balanced with the increased
          chance of false positives from their broadness. One way in which
          this balance is achieved is by grouping indicators and using them in
          combination. While two low-specificity IoCs for a particular attack
          may each have chances of false positives, when observed together,
          they may provide greater confidence of an accurate detection of the
          relevant kill chain.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.2.1-2">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-5.2.2-1">As noted in <a class="auto internal xref" href="#sec-assessment">Section 3.2.2</a>, the
          context of an IoC, such as the way in which the attacker uses it,
          may equally impact the precision with which that IoC detects an
          attack. An IP address representing an attacker's staging server,
          from which their attack chain downloads subsequent payloads, offers
          a precise IP address for attacker-owned infrastructure. However, it
          will be less precise if that IP address is associated with a
          cloud-hosting provider and is regularly reassigned from one user to
          another; it will be less precise still if the attacker
          compromised a legitimate web server and is abusing the IP address
          alongside the ongoing legitimate use.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.2.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.2.2-2">Similarly, a file hash representing an attacker's custom remote
          access trojan will be very precise; however, a file hash
          representing a common enterprise remote administration tool will be
          less precise, depending on whether or not the defender organisation
          usually uses that tool for legitimate system
          administration. Notably, such dual-use indicators are context
          specific, considering both whether they are usually used
          legitimately and how they are used in a particular circumstance.
          Use of the remote administration tool may be legitimate for support
          staff during working hours but not generally by non-support staff,

          Network Address Translation (NAT) are increasing the
          number of systems associated with any one IP address at the same
          moment in time. This ongoing change to the use of IP addresses is
          somewhat reducing the specificity of IP addresses (at least for
          specific subnets or individual addresses) while also "side-stepping" the pain that threat actors would otherwise incur if they

<p id="section-5.3-1">As noted in <a class="auto internal xref" href="#sec-assessment">Section 3.2.2</a>,
        context is critical to effective detection using IoCs. However, at
        times, defenders may feel there are privacy concerns with how much and with whom to
        share about a cyber intrusion. For example, defenders
        may generalise the IoCs' description of the attack by removing context
        to facilitate sharing. This generalisation can result in an incomplete
        set of IoCs being shared or IoCs being shared without clear
        indication of what they represent and how they are involved in an
        attack. The sharer will consider the privacy trade-off when
        generalising the IoC and should bear in mind that the loss of context
        can greatly reduce the utility of the IoC for those they share
        with.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.3-2">In the authors' experiences, self-censoring by sharers appears more
        prevalent and more extensive when sharing IoCs into groups with more
        members, into groups with a broader range of perceived member
        expertise (particularly, the further the lower bound extends below the
        sharer's perceived own expertise), and into groups that do not
        maintain strong intermember trust. Trust within such groups often
        appears strongest where members interact regularly; have common
        backgrounds, expertise, or challenges; conform to behavioural
        expectations (such as by following defined handling requirements and
        not misrepresenting material they share); and reciprocate the sharing
        and support they receive. <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#LITREVIEW">LITREVIEW</a>]</span>

<p id="section-5.4-1">While IoCs can be effectively utilised by organisations of various
        sizes and resource constraints, as discussed in <a class="auto internal xref" href="#sec-limited-resources">Section 4.1.2</a>, automation of IoC
        ingestion, processing, assessment, and deployment is critical for
        managing them at scale. Manual oversight and investigation may be
        necessary intermittently, but a reliance on manual processing and
        searching only works at small scale or for occasional cases.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.4-2">The adoption of automation can also enable faster and easier
        correlation of IoC detections across different log sources and
        network monitoring interfaces across different times and physical
        locations. Thus, the response can be tailored to reflect the number
        and overlap of detections from a particular intrusion set, and the
        necessary context can be presented alongside the detection when
        generating any alerts for defender review. While manual processing and
        searching may be no less accurate (although IoC transcription errors
        are a common problem during busy incidents in the experience of the
        authors), the correlation and cross-referencing necessary to provide
        the same degree of situational awareness is much more
        time-consuming.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.4-3">A third important consideration when performing manual processing
        is the longer phase monitoring and adjustment necessary to effectively
        age out IoCs as they become irrelevant or, more crucially,
        inaccurate. Manual implementations must often simply include or
        exclude an IoC, as anything more granular is time-consuming and
        complicated to manage. In contrast, automations can support a gradual
        reduction in confidence scoring, enabling IoCs to contribute but not
        individually disrupt a detection as their specificity reduces.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5.4-3">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-6-1">IoCs provide the defender with a range of options across the PoP's
      layers, enabling them to balance precision and fragility to give high
      confidence detections that are practical and useful. Broad
      coverage of the PoP is important as it allows the defender to choose
      between high precision but high fragility options and more robust but
      less precise indicators depending on availability. As fragile
      indicators are changed, the more robust IoCs allow for continued
      detection and faster rediscovery. For this reason, it's important to
      collect as many IoCs as possible across the whole PoP to provide options
      for defenders.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-2">At the top of the PoP, TTPs identified through anomaly detection and
      machine learning are more likely to have false positives, which gives
      lower confidence and, vitally, requires better trained analysts to
      understand and implement the defences. However, these are very painful
      for attackers to change, so when tuned appropriately, they provide a
      robust detection. Hashes, at the bottom, are precise and easy to deploy
      but are fragile and easily changed within and across campaigns by
      malicious actors.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-3">Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) or Antivirus (AV) are often
      the first port of call for protection from intrusion, but endpoint
      solutions aren't a panacea. One issue is that there are many
      environments where it is not possible to keep them updated or, in some
      cases, deploy them at all. For example, the Owari botnet, a Mirai
      variant <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#Owari">Owari</a>]</span>, exploited Internet of
      Things (IoT) devices where such solutions could not be deployed. It is
      because of such gaps, where endpoint solutions can't be relied on, that
      a defence-in-depth approach is commonly advised, using a blended
      approach that includes both network and endpoint defences.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-4">If an attack happens, then the best situation is that an endpoint
      solution will detect and prevent it. If it doesn't, it could be for
      many good reasons: the endpoint solution could be quite
      conservative and aim for a low false-positive rate, it might not have
      ubiquitous coverage, or it might only be able to defend the initial step
      of the kill chain <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#KillChain">KillChain</a>]</span>. In the
      worst cases, the attack specifically disables the endpoint solution, or
      the malware is brand new and so won't be recognised.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-5">In the middle of the pyramid, IoCs related to network information
      (such as domains and IP addresses) can be particularly useful. They
      allow for broad coverage, without requiring each and every endpoint
      security solution to be updated, as they may be detected and enforced in
      a more centralised manner at network choke points (such as proxies and
      gateways). This makes them particularly useful in contexts where
      ensuring endpoint security isn't possible, such as Bring Your Own
      Device (BYOD), Internet of Things (IoT), and legacy environments. It's
      important to note that these network-level IoCs can also protect users
      of a network against compromised endpoints when these IoCs are used to
      detect the attack in network traffic, even if the compromise itself
      passes unnoticed. For example, in a BYOD environment, enforcing security
      policies on the device can be difficult, so non-endpoint IoCs and
      solutions are needed to allow detection of compromise even with no
      endpoint coverage.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-6">One example of how network-level IoCs provide a layer of a
      defence-in-depth solution is Protective DNS (PDNS) <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#Annual2021">Annual2021</a>]</span>, a free and voluntary
      DNS filtering service provided by the UK NCSC for UK public sector
      organisations <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#PDNS">PDNS</a>]</span>. In 2021, this
      service blocked access to more than 160 million DNS queries (out of 602
      billion total queries) for the organisations signed up to the service
      <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#ACD2021">ACD2021</a>]</span>. This included hundreds of
      thousands of queries for domains associated with Flubot, Android malware
      that uses DGAs to generate 25,000
      candidate command and control domains each month (these DGAs <span>[<a class="cite xref" href="#DGAs">DGAs</a>]</span> are a type of TTP).<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-7">IoCs such as malicious domains can be put on PDNS straight away and
      can then be used to prevent access to those known malicious domains
      across the entire estate of over 925 separate public sector entities
      that use NCSC's PDNS. Coverage can be patchy with endpoints, as the
      roll-out of protections isn't uniform or necessarily fast. However, if
      the IoC is on PDNS, a consistent defence is maintained for devices using
      PDNS, even if the device itself is not immediately updated. This offers
      protection, regardless of whether the context is a BYOD environment or a
      managed enterprise system. PDNS provides the most front-facing layer of
      defence-in-depth solutions for its users, but other IoCs, like
      Server Name Indication values in TLS or the server certificate
      information, also provide IoC protections at other layers.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-8">Similar to the AV scenario, large-scale services face risk decisions
      around balancing threat against business impact from false positives.
      Organisations need to be able to retain the ability to be more
      conservative with their own defences, while still benefiting from
      them. For instance, a commercial DNS filtering service is intended for
      broad deployment, so it will have a risk tolerance similar to AV
      products, whereas DNS filtering intended for government users
      (e.g., PDNS) can be more conservative but will still have a relatively
      broad deployment if intended for the whole of government. A government
      department or specific company, on the other hand, might accept the risk
      of disruption and arrange firewalls or other network protection devices
      to completely block anything related to particular threats, regardless
      of the confidence, but rely on a DNS filtering service for everything
      else.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-9">Other network defences can make use of this blanket coverage from
      IoCs, like middlebox mitigation, proxy defences, and application-layer
      firewalls, but are out of scope for this document. Large enterprise
      networks are likely to deploy their own DNS resolution architecture and
      possibly TLS inspection proxies and can deploy IoCs in these
      locations. However, in networks that choose not to, or don't have the
      resources to, deploy these sorts of mitigations, DNS goes through
      firewalls, proxies, and possibly a DNS filtering service; it doesn't
      have to be unencrypted, but these appliances must be able to decrypt it
      to do anything useful with it, like blocking queries for known bad

<p id="section-6-10">Covering a broad range of IoCs gives defenders a wide range of
      benefits: they are easy to deploy;
 they provide a high enough confidence to be effective;
 at least some will be painful for attackers to change; and
 their distribution around the infrastructure allows for different
 points of failure, and so overall they enable the defenders to disrupt
 bad actors.
 The combination of these factors cements IoCs as a particularly
 valuable tool for defenders with limited resources.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6-10">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-8-1">This document is all about system security. However, when poorly
      deployed, IoCs can lead to over-blocking, which may present an
      availability concern for some systems. While IoCs preserve privacy on a
      macro scale (by preventing data breaches), research could be done to
      investigate the impact on privacy from sharing IoCs, and improvements
      could be made to minimise any impact found. The creation of a
      privacy-preserving method of sharing IoCs that still allows both network
      and endpoint defences to provide security and layered defences would be
      an interesting proposal.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8-1">¶</a></p>

      </h2>
<p id="section-9-1">IoCs are versatile and powerful. IoCs underpin and enable multiple
      layers of the modern defence-in-depth strategy. IoCs are easy to share,
      providing a multiplier effect on attack defence efforts, and they save
      vital time. Network-level IoCs offer protection, which is especially
      valuable when an endpoint-only solution isn't sufficient. These
      properties, along with their ease of use, make IoCs a key component of
      any attack defence strategy and particularly valuable for defenders with
      limited resources.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-9-2">For IoCs to be useful, they don't have to be unencrypted or visible
      in networks, but it is crucial that they be made available, along
      with their context, to entities that need them. It is also important
      that this availability and eventual usage cope with multiple points of
      failure, as per the defence-in-depth strategy, of which IoCs are a key
      part.<a class="pilcrow" href="#section-9-2">¶</a></p>
