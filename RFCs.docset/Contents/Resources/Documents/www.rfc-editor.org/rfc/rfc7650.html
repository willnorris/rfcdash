              <span class="h1">for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)</span>

Abstract

   This document defines a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Usage
   for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD).  The CoAP Usage
   provides the functionality to federate Wireless Sensor Networks
   (WSNs) in a peer-to-peer fashion.  The CoAP Usage for RELOAD allows
   CoAP nodes to store resources in a RELOAD peer-to-peer overlay,
   provides a lookup service, and enables the use of RELOAD overlay as a
   cache for sensor data.  This functionality is implemented in the
   RELOAD overlay itself, without the use of centralized servers.  The
   RELOAD AppAttach method is used to establish a direct connection
   between nodes through which CoAP messages are exchanged.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Usage for REsource
   LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) allows CoAP nodes to store resources
   in a RELOAD peer-to-peer overlay, provides a lookup service, and
   enables the use of RELOAD overlay as a cache for sensor data.  This
   functionality is implemented in the RELOAD overlay itself, without
   the use of centralized servers.

   This usage is intended for interconnected devices over a wide-area
   geographical coverage, such as in cases where multiple Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSNs) need to be federated over some wider-area
   network.  These WSNs would interconnect by means of nodes that are
   equipped with long range modules (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G) as well as short
   range ones (e.g., XBee, ZigBee, Bluetooth LE).

   Constrained devices are likely to be heterogeneous when it comes to
   their radio layer; however, we expect them to use a common
   application-layer protocol -- CoAP, which is a specialized web
   transfer protocol [<a href="./rfc7252" title='"The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)"'>RFC7252</a>].  It realizes the Representational State
   Transfer (REST) architecture for the most constrained nodes, such as
   sensors and actuators.  CoAP can be used not only between nodes on
   the same constrained network but also between constrained nodes and
   nodes on the Internet.  The latter is possible since CoAP can be
   translated to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for integration with
   the web.  Application areas of CoAP include different forms of
   machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, such as home automation,
   construction, health care or transportation.  Areas with heavy use of
   sensor and actuator devices that monitor and interact with the
   surrounding environment.

   As specified in [<a href="./rfc6940" title='"REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol"'>RFC6940</a>], RELOAD is fundamentally an overlay
   network.  It provides a layered architecture with pluggable
   application layers that can use the underlaying forwarding, storage,
   and lookup functionalities.  Figure 1 illustrates where the CoAP
   Usage is placed within the RELOAD architecture.

                          Figure 1: Architecture

   The CoAP Usage involves three basic functions:

   Registration: CoAP nodes that can use the RELOAD data storage
   functionality, can store a mapping from their CoAP URI to their Node-
   ID in the overlay.  They can also retrieve the Node-IDs of other
   nodes.  Nodes that are not RELOAD aware can use other mechanisms, for
   example [<a href="#ref-CORERESDIR">CORERESDIR</a>] in their local network.

   Lookup: Once a CoAP node has identified the Node-ID for an URI it
   wishes to retrieve, it can use the RELOAD message routing system to
   set up a connection that can be used to exchange CoAP messages.
   Similarly as with the registration, nodes that are not RELOAD aware
   can use CoAP messages with a RELOAD Node (RN) that will in turn
   perform the lookup in the overlay.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7650">RFC 7650</a>                 A CoAP Usage for RELOAD          September 2015</span>


   Caching: Nodes can use the RELOAD overlay as a caching mechanism for
   information about what CoAP resources are available on the node.
   This is especially useful for power-constrained nodes that can make
   their data available in the cache provided by the overlay while in
   sleep mode.

   For instance, a CoAP proxy (See <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) could register its Node-ID
   (e.g. "9996172") and a list of sensors (e.g. "/sensors/temp-1;
   /sensors/temp-2; /sensors/light, /sensors/humidity") under its URI
   (e.g. "coap://overlay-1.com/proxy-1/").

   When a node wants to discover the values associated with that URI, it
   queries the overlay for "coap://overlay-1.com/proxy-1/" and gets back
   the Node-ID of the proxy and the list of its associated sensors.  The
   requesting node can then use the RELOAD overlay to establish a direct
   connection with the proxy and to read sensor values.

   Moreover, the CoAP proxy can store the sensor information in the
   overlay.  In this way, information can be retrieved directly from the
   overlay without performing a direct connection to the storing proxy.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   We use the terminology and definitions from the RELOAD Base Protocol
   [<a href="./rfc6940" title='"REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol"'>RFC6940</a>] extensively in this document.  Some of those concepts are
   further described in the "Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer
   SIP" [<a href="#ref-P2PSIP" title='"Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP"'>P2PSIP</a>] document.

   In our architecture we extend the different nodes present in RELOAD
   (Peer, Client) and add support for sensor devices or other
   constrained devices.  Figure 2 illustrates the overlay topology.  The
   different nodes, according to their functionality, are:

   Client
      As specified in [<a href="./rfc6940" title='"REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol"'>RFC6940</a>], clients are nodes that do not have
      routing or storage responsibilities in the Overlay.

   Peer
      As specified in [<a href="./rfc6940" title='"REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol"'>RFC6940</a>], peers are nodes in the overlay that can
      route messages for nodes other than those to which it is directly
      connected.

   Sensor
      Devices capable of measuring a physical quantity.  Sensors usually
      acquire quantifiable information about their surrounding
      environment such as: temperature, humidity, electric current,
      moisture, radiation, and so on.

   Actuator
      Devices capable of interacting and affecting their environment
      such as: electrical motors, pneumatic actuators, electric
      switches, and so on.

   Proxy Node
      Devices having sufficient resources to run RELOAD either as client
      or peer.  These devices are located at the edge of the sensor
      network and, in case of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), act as
      coordinators of the network.

   Physical devices can have one or several of the previous functional
   roles.  According to the functionalities that are present in each of
   the nodes, they can be:

   Constrained Node
      A Constrained Node (CN) is a node with limited computational
      capabilities.  CN devices belong to classes of at least C1 and C2
      devices as defined in [<a href="./rfc7228" title='"Terminology for Constrained-Node Networks"'>RFC7228</a>], their main constraint being the
      implementation of the CoAP protocol.  If the CN is wireless, then
      it will be part of a Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network
      (LR-WPAN), also termed Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN).  Lastly,
      devices will usually be in sleep mode in order to prevent battery
      drain, and will not communicate during those periods.  A CN is NOT
      part of the RELOAD overlay, therefore it cannot act as a client,
      peer, nor proxy.  A CN is always either a Sensor or an Actuator.
      In the latter case, the node is often connected to a continuous
      energy power supply.

   RELOAD Node
      A RELOAD Node (RN) MUST implement the client functionality in the
      Overlay.  Additionally, the node will often be a full RELOAD peer.
      An RN may also be sensor or actuator since it can have those
      devices connected to it.

   Proxy Node
      A Proxy Node (PN) MUST implement the RN functionality and act as a
      sink for the LR-WPAN network.  The PN connects the short range
      Wireless Network to the Wide Area Network or the Internet.  A
      Proxy Node fulfills the "Proxy Node" role as described previously
      in the Architecture.

   CoAP URIs are typically resolved using a DNS.  When CoAP is needed in
   a RELOAD environment, URI resolution is provided by the overlay as a
   whole.  Instead of registering a URI, a peer stores a
   CoAPRegistration structure under a hash of its own URI.  This uses
   the CoAP REGISTRATION Kind-ID, which is formally defined in
   <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a> and uses a DICTIONARY data model.

   In this example, a CoAP proxy that is located in an overlay
   overlay-1.com using a Node-ID "9996172" wants to register four
   different sensors to the URI "coap://overlay-1.com/proxy-1/.well-
   known/".  We will be using the link format specified in [<a href="./rfc6690" title='"Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format"'>RFC6690</a>] to
   store the following mapping in the overlay:

   Note that the Resource-ID stored in the overlay is calculated as hash
   over the URI, that is -- h(URI), which in RELOAD is usually SHA-1.

   This would inform any other node performing a lookup for the previous
   URI "coap://overlay-1.com/proxy-1/.well-known" that the Node-ID value
   for proxy-1 is "9996172".  In addition, this mapping provides
   relevant information as to the number of sensors (CNs) and the URI
   path to connect to them using CoAP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Lookup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Lookup</span>

   The RELOAD overlay supports a rendezvous system that can be used for
   the lookup of other CoAP nodes.  This is done by fetching mapping
   information between CoAP URIs and Node-IDs.

   As an example, if a node RN located in the overlay overlay-1.com
   wishes to read which resources are served at an RN with URI
   coap://overlay-1.com/proxy-1/, it performs a fetch in the overlay.
   The Resource-ID used in this fetch is a SHA-1 hash over the URI
   "coap://overlay-1.com/proxy-1/.well-known/".

   After this fetch request, the overlay will return the following
   result:

    Resource-ID = h(coap://overlay-1.com/proxy-1/.well-known/)
    KEY =  9996172,

    VALUE = [
     &lt;/sensors/temp-1&gt;;rt="temperature-c";if="sensor",
     &lt;/sensors/temp-2&gt;;rt="temperature-c";if="sensor",
     &lt;/sensors/light&gt;;rt="light-lux";if="sensor",
     &lt;/sensors/humidity&gt;;rt="humidity-p";if="sensor"
     ]

   The obtained KEY is the Node-ID of the RN responsible of this KEY/
   VALUE pair.  The VALUE is the set of URIs necessary to read data from
   the CNs associated with the RN.

   Using the RELOAD DICTIONARY model allows for multiple nodes to
   perform a store to the same Resource-ID.  This can be used, for
   example, to perform a store of resources of the same type or with
   similar characteristics.  After performing a lookup, this feature
   allows the fetching of those multiple RNs that host CNs of the same
   class.

   As an example, provided that the previous peer (9996172) and another
   peer (9996173) have stored the links to their respective temperature
   resources in this same Resource-ID (temperature), an RN (e.g.,
   node-A) can do a fetch to the URI "coap://overlay-1.com/
   temperature/.well-known/", obtaining the following results:

    Resource-ID = h(coap://overlay-1.com/temperature/.well-known/)

    KEY =  9996172,
    VALUE = [
     &lt;/sensors/temp-1&gt;;rt="temperature-c";if="sensor",
     &lt;/sensors/temp-2&gt;;rt="temperature-c";if="sensor",
      ]

    KEY = 9996173,
    VALUE = [
     &lt;/sensors/temp-a&gt;;rt="temperature-c";if="sensor",
           &lt;/sensors/temp-b&gt;;rt="temperature-c";if="sensor"
      ]

   Once an RN (e.g., node-A) has obtained the lookup information for a
   node in the overlay (e.g., proxy-1), it can directly connect to that
   node.  This is performed by sending an AppAttach request to the
   Node-ID obtained during the lookup process.

   After the AppAttach negotiation, node-A can access the values of the
   CNs at proxy-1 using the information obtained during the lookup.
   Following the example in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>, and according to [<a href="./rfc6690" title='"Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format"'>RFC6690</a>], the
   requests for accessing the CNs at proxy-1 would be:

    REQ: GET /sensors/temp-1
    REQ: GET /sensors/temp-2

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Caching%20Mechanisms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Caching Mechanisms</span>

   The CoAP protocol itself supports the caching of sensor information
   in order to reduce the response time and network bandwidth
   consumption of future, equivalent requests.  CoAP caching is
   specified in <a href="./rfc7252#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC7252]</a>.  It consists of reusing stored
   responses when new requests arrive.  This type of storage is done in
   CoAP proxies.

   This CoAP usage for RELOAD proposes an additional caching mechanism
   for storing sensor information directly in the overlay.  In order to
   do so, it is necessary to define how the data should be stored.  Such
   caching mechanism is primarily intended for CNs with sensor
   capabilities, not for RN sensors.  This is due to the battery
   constraints of CNs, forcing them to stay in sleep mode for long
   periods of time.

   Whenever a CN wakes up, it sends the most recent data from its
   sensors to its proxy (PN), which stores the data in the overlay using
   a RELOAD StoredData structure defined in <a href="./rfc6940#section-6">Section 6 of [RFC6940]</a>.  We
   use the StoredDataValue structure defined in <a href="./rfc6940#section-6.2">Section 6.2 of
   [RFC6940]</a>, in particular we use the SingleValue format type to store
   the cached values in the overlay.  From that structure length,
   storage_time, lifetime and Signature are used in the same way.  The
   only difference is DataValue, which in our case can be either a
   ProxyCache or a SensorCache:

   enum { reserved (0), proxy_cache(1), sensor_cache(2), (255) }
                CoAPCachingType;
   struct {
    CoAPCachingType coap_caching_type;

    select(coap_caching_type) {
     case proxy_cache: ProxyCache proxy_cache_entry;
     case sensor_cache: SensorCache sensor_cache_entry;
     /* extensions */

    }
   } CoAPCaching;

   ProxyCache is meant to store values and sensor information (e.g.,
   inactivity time) for all the sensors associated with a certain proxy,
   as well as their CoAP URIs.  SensorCache, on the other hand, is used
   for storing the information and cached value of only one sensor (CoAP
   URI is not necessary, as it is the same as the one used for
   generating the Resource-ID associated to that SensorCache entry).

    SensorInfo sensor_info;
    uint32  length;
    SensorValue sensor_value[count];

   sensor_info
      contains relevant sensor information;

   length
      The length of the rest of the structure;

   sensor_value

      for example, temperature, luminosity, etc.  It can also represent
      other semantic information about the device.

   SensorValue contains the measurement_time, lifetime, and value of the
   measurement.

   As specified in RELOAD Base [<a href="./rfc6940" title='"REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol"'>RFC6940</a>], every Kind that is storable in
   an overlay must be associated with an access control policy.  This
   policy defines whether a request from a given node to operate on a
   given value should succeed or fail.  Usages can define any access
   control rules they choose, including publicly writable values.

   CoAP Usage for RELOAD requires an access control policy that allows
   multiple nodes in the overlay read and write access.  This access is
   for registering and caching information using CoAP URIs as
   identifiers.  Therefore, none of the access control policies
   specified in RELOAD Base [<a href="./rfc6940" title='"REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol"'>RFC6940</a>] are sufficient.

   This document defines two access control policies, called URI-MATCH
   and URI-NODE-MATCH.  In the URI-MATCH policy, a given value MUST be
   written and overwritten if and only if the signer's certificate
   contains an uniformResourceIdentifier entry in the subjectAltName
   Extension [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>] that in canonicalized form hashes to the
   Resource-ID for the resource.  As explained in <a href="./rfc7252#section-6.3">Section 6.3 of
   [RFC7252]</a> the "coap" and "coaps" schemes conform to the generic URI,
   thus they are normalized in the generic form as explained in

   <a href="./rfc3986#section-6">Section 6 of [RFC3986]</a>.  The hash function used is specified in
   <a href="./rfc6940#section-10.2">Section 10.2 of [RFC6940]</a>.  The certificate can be generated as
   specified in <a href="./rfc7252#section-9">Section 9 of [RFC7252]</a>, using Certificate mode.

   In the URI-NODE-MATCH policy, a given value MUST be written and
   overwritten if and only if the condition for URI-MATCH is met and, in
   addition, the dictionary key is equal to the Node-ID in the
   certificate and that Node-ID is the one indicated in the
   SignerIdentity value cert_hash.

   These Access Control Policies are specified for IANA in <a href="#section-11.3">Section 11.3</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" id="section-10">10</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations of RELOAD [<a href="./rfc6940" title='"REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol"'>RFC6940</a>] and CoAP [<a href="./rfc7252" title='"The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)"'>RFC7252</a>]
   apply to this specification.  RELOAD's security model is based on
   public key certificates, which are used for signing messages and
   stored objects.  At the connection level, RELOAD can use either TLS
   or DTLS.  In the case of CoAP, several security modes have been
   defined.  Implementations of this specification MUST follow all the
   security-related rules specified in the RELOAD [<a href="./rfc6940" title='"REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol"'>RFC6940</a>] and CoAP
   [<a href="./rfc7252" title='"The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)"'>RFC7252</a>] specifications.

   Additionally, in RELOAD every Kind that is storable in an overlay
   must be associated with an access control policy.  This document
   specifies two new access control policies, which are specified in
   <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.  These policies cover the most typical deployment
   scenarios.

   During the phase of registration and lookup, security considerations
   relevant to RELOAD apply.  A CoAP node that advertises its existence
   via this mechanism, is more likely to be attacked, compared to a node
   (especially a sleepy node) that does not advertise its existence.
   <a href="./rfc7252#section-11">Section 11 of [RFC7252]</a> and <a href="./rfc6940#section-13">Section 13 of [RFC6940]</a> have more
   information about the kinds of attack and mitigation possible.

   The caching mechanism specified in this document is additional to the
   caching already done in CoAP.  Access control is handled by the
   RELOAD overlay, where the peer storing the data is responsible for
   validating the signature on the data being stored.

   IANA has created a "CoAP Usage for RELOAD Access Control Policy"
   registry.  This registry has been added to the existing RELOAD
   registry.  Entries in this registry are strings denoting access
   control policies, as described in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.  New entries in this
   registry are to be registered per the Specification Required policy
   in [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  The initial contents of this registry are:

       +-----------------+----------+
       | Access Policy   |      RFC |
       +-----------------+----------+
       | URI-NODE-MATCH  | <a href="./rfc7650">RFC 7650</a> |
       | URI-MATCH       | <a href="./rfc7650">RFC 7650</a> |
       +-----------------+----------+

   This access control policy was described in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.
