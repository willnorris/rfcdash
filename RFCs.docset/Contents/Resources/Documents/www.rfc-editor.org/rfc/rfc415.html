   NIC 11584 (<a href="./rfc392">RFC 392</a>) BY G. HICKS AND B. WESSLER AT UTAH RECENTLY
   DISCUSSED THE COST OF USING THE NETWORK.

   I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THESE SAME TYPES OF NUMBERS AND LOOK AT THEM
   FROM ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW.  WITHOUT CALCULATING COSTS, LET US
   CONSIDER ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE OF THE HOSTS.  I WROTE A SIMPLE TENEX
   PROGRAM THAT SENT ITSELF STRINGS OVER THE NET.  IT USED BIN/BOUT AND
   THE BUFFERED SEND MODE.   IT COUNTED THINGS, BUT DID NOT PROCESS THE
   STRING.  WITH SAMPLES OF A MILLION BITS, THE FOLLOWING RESULTS WERE
   OBTAINED.

   BYTES/SIZE      REAL BAUD       CPU BAUD      CPU NEEDED

     50/36          48.8K           291K          16%
    100/36          46.5K           309K          15%
    200/36          52.7K           322K          16%
    400/36          59.3K           267K          22%
    800/36          61.1K           279K          21%

     50/8           22.0K           70K           31%
    100/8           26.7K           76K           35%
    200/8           29.0K           79K           36%
    400/8           30.0K           81K           37%
    800/8           31.9K           78K           40%
   1600/8           38.1K           64K           59%
   3200/8           41.8K           59K           70%

   THE FOLLOWING WERE OBTAINED BY USING SIN/SOUT WITHOUT THE BUFFERED
   MODE.

   BYTES/SIZE      REAL BAUD       CPU BAUD      CPU NEEDED
     50/36          36K             95K           38%

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc415">RFC 415</a>                     TENEX BANDWIDTH                November 1972</span>


   THESE TESTS WERE RUN WITH NO OTHER LOAD ON OUR SYSTEM, AN EARLY
   VERSION OF 1.29.  THE INPUT AND OUTPUT HALVES OF THE TRANSMISSION
   HAVE BEEN AVERAGED TOGETHER.  I.E. THE ABOVE BAUD RATES WERE
   CALCULATED USING 2 MILLION BITS SINCE THE STRINGS WENT OUT AND IN.

OTHER PIECES OF DATA:

   OUR TTY'S AND LPT HAVE ULTIMATE CPU BANDWIDTHS NEAR 15-20 KB.  AT
   2400 BAUD, A TTY TAKES 15% OF THE CPU.  TELNETS NESTED THREE DEEP ARE
   ALMOST COMPUTE LIMITED WHEN JUST TYPING THINGS OUT ON A 2400 BAUD
   TERMINAL.

   AS A ROUGH CALCULATION, THE BANDWIDTH OF THE TIP TAPE TRANSMISSION
   FEATURE - USING STEVE BUTTERFIELD'S (OF BBN) NETMAG PROGRAM - IS
   ABOUT 7 KILOBITS/SEC.  ONE TAPE OF ABOUT 6,000 TENEX PAGES TOOK ABOUT
   4 HOURS TO TRANSMIT.  THIS WAS A FULL TAPE FROM ETAC TO CCA LATE ONE
   NIGHT WITH NOTHING ELSE RUNNING ON OUR SYSTEM.  ABOUT 30% OF THE CPU
   IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THIS BANDWIDTH.  AGAIN THIS IS ONLY ABOUT 20KB
   PER CPU SEC.
