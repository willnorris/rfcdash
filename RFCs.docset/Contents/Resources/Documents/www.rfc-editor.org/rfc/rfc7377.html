Abstract

   The IMAP4 specification allows the searching of only the selected
   mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a
   client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and
   SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the
   next.  This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes
   with one command, limiting the delays caused by many round trips and
   not requiring disruption of the currently selected mailbox.  This
   extension also uses MAILBOX, UIDVALIDITY, and TAG fields in ESEARCH
   responses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.
   This document updates <a href="./rfc4466">RFC 4466</a> and obsoletes <a href="./rfc6237">RFC 6237</a>.

   The IMAP4 specification allows the searching of only the selected
   mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a
   client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and
   SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the
   next.  The commands can't be pipelined, because the server might run
   them in parallel and the untagged SEARCH responses could not then be
   distinguished from each other.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7377">RFC 7377</a>           IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension      October 2014</span>


   This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes with one
   command and includes MAILBOX and TAG fields in the ESEARCH response,
   yielding the following advantages:

   o  A single command limits the number of round trips needed to search
      a set of mailboxes.

   o  A single command eliminates the need to wait for one search to
      complete before starting the next.

   o  A single command allows the server to optimize the search if it
      can.

   o  A command that is not dependent upon the selected mailbox
      eliminates the need to disrupt the selection state or to open
      another IMAP connection.

   o  The MAILBOX, UIDVALIDITY, and TAG fields in the responses allow a
      client to distinguish which responses go with which search (and
      which mailbox).  A client can safely pipeline these search
      commands without danger of confusion.  The addition of the MAILBOX
      and UIDVALIDITY fields updates the search-correlator item defined
      in [<a href="./rfc4466" title='"Collected Extensions to IMAP4 ABNF"'>RFC4466</a>].

   This extension was previously published in an Experimental RFC.
   There is now implementation experience, giving confidence in the
   protocol, so this document puts the extension on the Standards Track,
   with some minor updates that were informed by the implementation
   experience.  A brief summary of changes is in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   Result:     OK -- search completed
               NO -- error: cannot search that charset or criteria
               BAD -- command unknown or arguments invalid

   This section defines a new ESEARCH command, which works similarly to
   the UID SEARCH command described in <a href="./rfc4466#section-2.6.1">Section 2.6.1 of [RFC4466]</a>
   (initially described in <a href="./rfc3501#section-6.4.4">Section 6.4.4 of [RFC3501]</a> and extended by
   [<a href="./rfc4731" title='"IMAP4 Extension to SEARCH Command for Controlling What Kind of Information Is Returned"'>RFC4731</a>]).

   The ESEARCH command further extends searching by allowing for
   optional source and result options.  This document does not define
   any new result options (see <a href="./rfc4731#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]</a>).  A server that
   supports this extension includes "MULTISEARCH" in its IMAP capability
   string.

   Because there has been confusion about this, it is worth pointing out
   that with ESEARCH, as with any SEARCH or UID SEARCH command, it MUST
   NOT be considered an error if the search terms include a range of
   message numbers that extends (or, in fact, starts) beyond the end of
   the mailbox.  For example, a client might want to establish a rolling
   window through the search results this way:

   C: tag1 UID ESEARCH FROM "frobozz" 1:100

   ... followed later by this:

   C: tag1 UID ESEARCH FROM "frobozz" 101:200

   ... and so on.

   This tells the server to match only the first hundred messages in the
   mailbox the first time, the second hundred the second time, etc.  In
   fact, it might likely allow the server to optimize the search
   significantly.  In the above example, whether the mailbox contains
   50, 150, or 250 messages, neither of the search commands shown will
   result in an error.  It is up to the client to know when to stop
   moving its search window.

   In response to an ESEARCH command, the server MUST return ESEARCH
   responses [<a href="./rfc4731" title='"IMAP4 Extension to SEARCH Command for Controlling What Kind of Information Is Returned"'>RFC4731</a>] (that is, not SEARCH responses).  Because message
   numbers are not useful for mailboxes that are not selected, the
   responses MUST contain information about UIDs, not message numbers.
   This is true even if the source options specify that only the
   selected mailbox be searched.

   Presence of a source option in the absence of a result option implies
   the "ALL" result option (see <a href="./rfc4731#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]</a>).  Note that
   this is not the same as the result from the SEARCH command described
   in the IMAP base protocol [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>].

   Source options describe which mailboxes must be searched for
   messages.  An ESEARCH command with source options does not affect
   which mailbox, if any, is currently selected, regardless of which
   mailboxes are searched.

   For each mailbox satisfying the source options, a single ESEARCH
   response MUST be returned if any messages in that mailbox match the
   search criteria.  An ESEARCH response MUST NOT be returned for
   mailboxes that contain no matching messages.  This is true even when
   result options such as MIN, MAX, and COUNT are specified (see
   <a href="./rfc4731#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]</a>), and the values returned (lowest UID
   matched, highest UID matched, and number of messages matched,
   respectively) apply to the mailbox reported in that ESEARCH response.

   Note that it is possible for an ESEARCH command to return no untagged
   responses (no ESEARCH responses at all) in the case that there are no
   matches to the search in any of the mailboxes that satisfy the source
   options.  Clients can detect this situation by finding the tagged OK
   response without having received any matching untagged ESEARCH
   responses.

   Each ESEARCH response MUST contain the MAILBOX, TAG, and UIDVALIDITY
   correlators.  Correlators allow clients to issue several ESEARCH
   commands at once (pipelined).  If the SEARCHRES [<a href="./rfc5182" title='"IMAP Extension for Referencing the Last SEARCH Result"'>RFC5182</a>] extension
   is used in an ESEARCH command, that ESEARCH command MUST be executed
   by the server after all previous SEARCH/ESEARCH commands have
   completed and before any subsequent SEARCH/ESEARCH commands are
   executed.  The server MAY perform consecutive ESEARCH commands in
   parallel as long as none of them use the SEARCHRES extension.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Source%20Options%3A%20Specifying%20Mailboxes%20to%20Search"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Source Options: Specifying Mailboxes to Search</span>

   The source options, if present, MUST contain a mailbox specifier as
   defined in the IMAP NOTIFY extension <a href="./rfc5465#section-6">[RFC5465], Section 6</a> (using the
   "filter-mailboxes" ABNF item), with the following differences:

   1.  The "selected-delayed" specifier is not valid here.

   2.  A "subtree-one" specifier is added.  The "subtree" specifier
       results in a search of the specified mailbox and all selectable
       mailboxes that are subordinate to it, through an indefinitely

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7377">RFC 7377</a>           IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension      October 2014</span>


       deep hierarchy.  The "subtree-one" specifier results in a search
       of the specified mailbox and all selectable child mailboxes, one
       hierarchy level down.

   If "subtree" is specified, the server MUST defend against loops in
   the hierarchy (for example, those caused by recursive file-system
   links within the message store).  The server SHOULD do this by
   keeping track of the mailboxes that have been searched and by
   terminating the hierarchy traversal when a repeat is found.  If it
   cannot do that, it MAY do it by limiting the hierarchy depth.

   If the source options are not present, the value "selected" is
   assumed -- that is, only the currently selected mailbox is searched.

   The "personal" source option is a particularly convenient way to
   search all of the current user's mailboxes.  Note that there is no
   way to use wildcard characters to search all mailboxes; the
   "mailboxes" source option does not do wildcard expansion.

   If the source options include (or default to) "selected", the IMAP
   session MUST be in "selected" state.  If the source options specify
   other mailboxes and NOT "selected", then the IMAP session MUST be in
   either "selected" or "authenticated" state.  If the session is not in
   a correct state, the ESEARCH command MUST return a "BAD" result.

   The client SHOULD NOT provide source options that resolve to
   including the same mailbox more than once.  A server can, of course,
   remove the duplicates before processing, but the server MAY return
   "BAD" to an ESEARCH command with duplicate source mailboxes.

   If the server supports the SEARCHRES [<a href="./rfc5182" title='"IMAP Extension for Referencing the Last SEARCH Result"'>RFC5182</a>] extension, then the
   "SAVE" result option is valid only if "selected" is specified or
   defaulted to as the sole mailbox to be searched.  If any source
   option other than "selected" is specified, the ESEARCH command MUST
   return a "BAD" result.

   If the server supports the CONTEXT=SEARCH and/or CONTEXT=SORT
   extension [<a href="./rfc5267" title='"Contexts for IMAP4"'>RFC5267</a>], then the following additional rules apply:

   o  The CONTEXT return option (<a href="./rfc5267#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of [RFC5267]</a>) can be used
      with an ESEARCH command.

   o  If the UPDATE return option is used (<a href="./rfc5267#section-4.3">Section 4.3 of [RFC5267]</a>), it
      MUST apply only to the currently selected mailbox.  If UPDATE is
      used and there is no mailbox currently selected, the ESEARCH
      command MUST return a "BAD" result.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7377">RFC 7377</a>           IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension      October 2014</span>


   o  The PARTIAL search return option (<a href="./rfc5267#section-4.4">Section 4.4 of [RFC5267]</a>) can be
      used and applies to each mailbox searched by the ESEARCH command.

   If the server supports the Access Control List (ACL) [<a href="./rfc4314" title='"IMAP4 Access Control List (ACL) Extension"'>RFC4314</a>]
   extension, then the logged-in user is required to have the "r" right
   for each mailbox she wants to search.  In addition, any mailboxes
   that are not explicitly named (accessed through "personal" or
   "subtree", for example) are required to have the "l" right.
   Mailboxes matching the source options for which the logged-in user
   lacks sufficient rights MUST be ignored by the ESEARCH command
   processing.  In particular, ESEARCH responses MUST NOT be returned
   for those mailboxes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Strictness%20in%20Search%20Matches"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Strictness in Search Matches</span>

   The base IMAP SEARCH command (<a href="./rfc3501#section-6.4.4">Section 6.4.4. of [RFC3501]</a>) requires
   strict substring matching in text searches.  Many servers, however,
   use search engines that match strings in different ways, for example,
   matching "swim" to both "swam" and "swum" or only doing full word
   matching (where "swim" will not match "swimming").  This is covered
   by the "Fuzzy Search" extension to IMAP [<a href="./rfc6203" title='"IMAP4 Extension for Fuzzy Search"'>RFC6203</a>], and that extension
   is compatible with this one and can be combined with it.

   Whether or not Fuzzy Search is implemented or used, this extension
   explicitly allows flexible searching with respect to TEXT and BODY
   searches.  Servers MAY use fuzzy text matching in multimailbox
   searches.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20Server-Side%20Limitations%20on%20Search%20Volume"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Server-Side Limitations on Search Volume</span>

   To avoid having a search use more than a reasonable share of server
   resources, servers MAY apply limits that go beyond loop protection,
   such as limits on the number of mailboxes that may be searched at
   once and/or limits on the number or total size of messages searched.
   A server can apply those limits up front, responding with "NO
   [LIMIT]" if a limit is exceeded (see [<a href="./rfc5530" title='"IMAP Response Codes"'>RFC5530</a>] for information about
   response codes).  Alternatively, a server can process the search and
   terminate it when a limit is exceeded, responding with "OK [LIMIT]"
   and returning partial results.  Note that searches that return
   partial results can cause complexity for client implementations and
   confusion to users.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Examples</span>

   In the following example, note that two ESEARCH commands are
   pipelined and that the server is running them in parallel,
   interleaving a response to the second search amid the responses to
   the first (watch the tags).

   This new IMAP ESEARCH command allows a single command to search many
   mailboxes at once.  On the one hand, a client could do that by
   sending many IMAP SEARCH commands.  On the other hand, this makes it
   easier for a client to overwork a server by sending a single command
   that results in an expensive search of tens of thousands of
   mailboxes.  Server implementations need to be aware of that and
   provide mechanisms that prevent a client from adversely affecting
   other users.  Limitations on the number of mailboxes that may be
   searched in one command and/or on the server resources that will be
   devoted to responding to a single client, are reasonable limitations
   for an implementation to impose (see also <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>).

   Implementations MUST, of course, apply access controls appropriately,
   limiting a user's access to ESEARCH in the same way its access is
   limited for any other IMAP commands.  This extension has no data-
   access risks beyond what may exist in the unextended IMAP
   implementation.

   Mailboxes matching the source options for which the logged-in user
   lacks sufficient rights MUST be ignored by the ESEARCH command
   processing (see the paragraph about this in <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>).  In
   particular, any attempt to distinguish insufficient access from non-
   existent mailboxes may expose information about the mailbox hierarchy
   that isn't otherwise available to the client.
