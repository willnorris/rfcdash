                             Sockets in use

   I would like to collect information on the use of socket numbers
for "standard" service programs. For example Loggers (telnet servers)
Listen on socket 1. What sockets at your host are Listened to by what
programs?

   Recently Dick Watson suggested assigning socket 5 for use by a
mail-box protocol (<a href="./rfc196">RFC196</a>). Does any one object ? Are there any
suggestions for a method of assigning sockets to standard programs?
Should a subset of the socket numbers be reserved for use by future
standard protocols?

   Please phone or mail your answers and commtents to:
