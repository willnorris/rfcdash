   This document defines binary formats for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
   selector sub-options, as defined in [<a href="./rfc6089" title='"Flow Bindings in Mobile IPv6 and Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support"'>RFC6089</a>].

   The binary traffic selector format defined here, allows for efficient
   identification of flow(s) based on well-known fields in IPv4
   [<a href="./rfc0791" title='"Internet Protocol"'>RFC0791</a>], IPv6 [<a href="./rfc2460" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>], and transport layer headers like TCP
   [<a href="./rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>] and UDP [<a href="./rfc0768" title='"User Datagram Protocol"'>RFC0768</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Traffic%20Selector%20Sub-Options"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Traffic Selector Sub-Options</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC6089">RFC6089</a>] defines the format for the traffic selector sub-option.

   The following values of the TS Format field are defined in this
   specification for binary traffic selectors.

   TS Format:

      1 IPv4 binary traffic selector

      2 IPv6 binary traffic selector

   If the TS Format field of the traffic selector sub-option indicates
   "IPv4 binary traffic selector", then the traffic selector is
   formatted as shown below.

   Flags (A-N)

      Each flag indicates whether the corresponding field is present in
      the message.

   (A)Start Source Address

      This field identifies the first source address, from the range of
      32-bit IPv4 addresses to be matched, on data packets sent from a
      corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
      In other words, this is one of the addresses of the correspondent
      node.

   (B)End Source Address

      If more than one contiguous source address needs to be matched,
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Source Address field.  This
      field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Address field
      is included.  When this field is included, the receiver will match
      all of the addresses between fields (A) and (B), inclusive of (A)
      and (B).

   (C)Start Destination Address

      This field identifies the first destination address, from the
      range of 32-bit IPv4 addresses to be matched, on data packets sent
      from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home
      agent.  In other words, this is one of the registered home
      addresses of the mobile node.

   (D)End Destination Address

      If more than one contiguous destination address needs to be
      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of
      a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Address
      field.  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start
      Destination Address field is included.  When this field is
      included, the receiver will match all of the addresses between
      fields (C) and (D), inclusive of (C) and (D).

   (E)Start IPsec SPI - Security Parameter Index

      This field identifies the first 32-bit IPsec SPI value, from the
      range of SPI values to be matched, on data packets sent from a
      corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
      This field is defined in [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>].

   (F)End IPsec SPI - Security Parameter Index

      If more than one contiguous SPI value needs to be matched, then
      this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start IPsec SPI field.  This field
      MUST NOT be included unless the Start IPsec SPI field is included.
      When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the
      SPI values between fields (E) and (F), inclusive of (E) and (F).

   (G)Start Source Port

      This field identifies the first 16-bit source port number, from
      the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets sent from
      a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
      This is from the range of port numbers defined by IANA
      (<a href="http://www.iana.org">http://www.iana.org</a>).

   (H)End Source Port

      If more than one contiguous source port number needs to be
      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of
      a range starting from the value of the Start Source Port field.
      This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Port field
      is included.  When this field is included, the receiver will match
      all of the port numbers between fields (G) and (H), inclusive of
      (G) and (H).

   (I)Start Destination Port

      This field identifies the first 16-bit destination port number,
      from the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets sent
      from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home
      agent.

   (J)End Destination Port

      If more than one contiguous destination port number needs to be
      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of
      a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Port
      field.  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start
      Destination Port field is included.  When this field is included,
      the receiver will match all of the port numbers between fields (I)
      and (J), inclusive of (I) and (J).

   (K)Start DS - Differential Services

      This field identifies the first differential services value, from
      the range of differential services values to be matched, on data
      packets sent from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen
      by the home agent.  Note that this field is called a "Type of
      Service field" in [<a href="./rfc0791" title='"Internet Protocol"'>RFC0791</a>].  [<a href="./rfc3260" title='"New Terminology and Clarifications for Diffserv"'>RFC3260</a>] then clarified that the
      field has been redefined as a 6-bit DS field with 2 bits reserved,
      later claimed by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [<a href="./rfc3168" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>RFC3168</a>].
      For the purpose of this specification, the (K)Start DS field is 8
      bits long, where the 6 most significant bits indicate the DS field
      to be matched and the 2 least significant bits' values MUST be
      ignored in any comparison.

   (L)End DS - Differential Services

      If more than one contiguous DS value needs to be matched, then
      this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start DS field.  This field MUST
      NOT be included unless the Start DS field is included.  When this
      field is included, it MUST be coded the same way as defined for
      (K).  When this field is included, the receiver will match all of
      the values between fields (K) and (L), inclusive of (K) and (L).

   (M)Start Protocol

      This field identifies the first 8-bit protocol value, from the
      range of protocol values to be matched, on data packets sent from
      a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.

   (N)End Protocol

      If more than one contiguous protocol value needs to be matched,
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Protocol field.  This field
      MUST NOT be included unless the Start Protocol field is included.
      When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the
      values between fields (M) and (N), inclusive of (M) and (N).

   Reserved

      Reserved for future use.  These bits MUST be set to zero by the
      sender and ignored by the receiver.

   If the TS Format field of the traffic selector sub-option indicates
   "IPv6 binary traffic selector", then the traffic selector is
   formatted as follows:

   The alignment requirement for this sub-option is:

      8n if A, B, C, or D is set

      4n if E, F, G, or H is set

      2n if I, J, K, or L is set

      n if M, N, O, or P is set

   Flags (A-P)

      Each flag indicates whether the corresponding field is present in
      the message

   (A)Start Source Address

      This field identifies the first source address, from the range of
      128-bit IPv6 addresses to be matched, on data packets sent from a
      corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
      In other words, this is one of the addresses of the correspondent
      node.

   (B)End Source Address

      If more than one contiguous source address needs to be matched,
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Source Address field.  This
      field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Address field
      is included.  When this field is included, the receiver will match
      all of the addresses between fields (A) and (B), inclusive of (A)
      and (B).

   (C)Start Destination Address

      This field identifies the first destination address, from the
      range of 128-bit IPv6 addresses to be matched, on data packets
      sent from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the
      home agent.  In other words, this is one of the registered home
      addresses of the mobile node.

   (D)End Destination Address

      If more than one contiguous destination address needs to be
      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of
      a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Address
      field.  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start
      Destination Address field is included.  When this field is
      included, the receiver will match all of the addresses between
      fields (C) and (D), inclusive of (C) and (D).

   (E)Start IPsec SPI - Security Parameter Index

      This field identifies the first 32-bit IPsec SPI value, from the
      range of SPI values to be matched, on data packets sent from a
      corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
      This field is defined in [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>].

   (F)End IPsec SPI - Security Parameter Index

      If more than one contiguous SPI value needs to be matched, then
      this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start IPsec SPI field.  This field
      MUST NOT be included unless the Start IPsec SPI field is included.
      When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the
      SPI values between fields (E) and (F), inclusive of (E) and (F).

   (G)Start Flow Label

      This field identifies the first flow label value, from the range
      of flow label values to be matched, on data packets sent from a
      corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
      According to [<a href="./rfc2460" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>], the flow label is 24 bits long.  For the
      purpose of this specification, the sender of this option MUST
      prefix the flow label value with 8 bits of "0" before inserting it
      in the (G)Start Flow Label field.  The receiver SHOULD ignore the
      first 8 bits of this field before using it in comparisons with
      flow labels in packets.

   (H)End Flow Label

      If more than one contiguous flow label value needs to be matched,
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Flow Label field.  This field
      MUST NOT be included unless the Start Flow Label field is
      included.  When this field is included, the receiver will match
      all of the flow label values between fields (G) and (H), inclusive
      of (G) and (H).  When this field is included, it MUST be coded the
      same way as defined for (G).

   (I)Start Source Port

      This field identifies the first 16-bit source port number, from
      the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets sent from
      a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.

   (J)End Source Port

      If more than one contiguous source port number needs to be
      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of
      a range starting from the value of the Start Source Port field.
      This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Port field
      is included.  When this field is included, the receiver will match
      all of the port numbers between fields (I) and (J), inclusive of
      (I) and (J).

   (K)Start Destination Port

      This field identifies the first 16-bit destination port number,
      from the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets sent
      from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home
      agent.

   (L)End Destination Port

      If more than one contiguous destination port number needs to be
      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of
      a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Port
      field.  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start
      Destination Port field is included.  When this field is included,
      the receiver will match all of the port numbers between fields (K)
      and (L), inclusive of (K) and (L).

   (M)Start TC - Traffic Class

      This field identifies the first traffic class value, from the
      range of traffic class values to be matched, on data packets sent
      from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home
      agent.  This field is equivalent to the Start DS field in the IPv4
      traffic selector in Figure 1.  As per [<a href="./rfc3260" title='"New Terminology and Clarifications for Diffserv"'>RFC3260</a>], the field is
      defined as a 6-bit DS field with 2 bits reserved, later claimed by
      Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [<a href="./rfc3168" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>RFC3168</a>].  For the purpose
      of this specification, the (M)Start TC field is 8 bits long, where
      the 6 most significant bits indicate the DS field to be matched
      and the 2 least significant bits' values MUST be ignored in any
      comparison.

   (N)End TC - Traffic Class

      If more than one contiguous TC value needs to be matched, then
      this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start TC field.  This field MUST
      NOT be included unless the Start TC field is included.  When this

      field is included, it MUST be coded the same way as defined for
      (M).  When this field is included, the receiver will match all of
      the values between fields (M) and (N), inclusive of (M) and (N).

   (O)Start NH - Next Header

      This field identifies the first 8-bit next header value, from the
      range of next header values to be matched, on data packets sent
      from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home
      agent.

   (P)End NH - Next Header

      If more than one contiguous next header value needs to be matched,
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start NH field.  This field MUST
      NOT be included unless the Start next header field is included.
      When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the
      values between fields (O) and (P), inclusive of (O) and (P).

   Reserved

      Reserved for future use.  These bits MUST be set to zero by the
      sender and ignored by the receiver.
