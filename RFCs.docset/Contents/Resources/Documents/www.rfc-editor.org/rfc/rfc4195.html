Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace that
   is engineered by the TV-Anytime Forum for naming persistent resources
   published by the TV-Anytime Forum including the TV-Anytime Forum
   Standards, XML (Extensible Markup Language) Document Type
   Definitions, XML Schemas, Namespaces, and other documents.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The TV-Anytime Forum produces many kinds of documents (i.e.,
   specifications, working documents, and schemas) that are currently
   being considered for adoption by many standardization bodies such as
   ETSI (European Telecommunication Standardization Institute), DVB
   (Digital Video Broadcasting), ARIB (Association of Radio Industries
   and Businesses), and ATSC (Advance Television Systems Committee).

   The TV-Anytime Forum wishes to provide global, distributed,
   persistent, location-independent names for these resources.

   Namespace ID:

      "tva"

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Name:        Wataru KAMEYAMA
      Title:       Vice Chairman and Secretary, The TV-Anytime Forum
      Affiliation: Graduate School of Global Information

   Declaration of structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs assigned by the
      TV-Anytime Forum will have the following hierarchical structure:

                  urn:tva:{category}:{string}

      where the "category" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to URN
      syntax requirements ([<a href="./rfc2141" title='"URN Syntax"'>RFC2141</a>]), and "{string}" is a string that
      confirms to URN syntax requirements ([<a href="./rfc2141" title='"URN Syntax"'>RFC2141</a>]).

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      The TV-Anytime Forum specifications have been publicly available
      at all stages during their development from
      "<a href="ftp://tva:tva@ftp.bbc.co.uk/Specifications/">ftp://tva:tva@ftp.bbc.co.uk/Specifications/</a>".  The final
      specifications are also available as formal ETSI (European
      Telecommunication Standardization Institute) technical
      specification documents, ETSI TS 102 822 series.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The TV-Anytime Forum shall establish unique identifiers as
      appropriate.

<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-3"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4195">RFC 4195</a>        A URN Namespace for the TV-Anytime Forum    October 2005</span>


      Uniqueness is guaranteed as long as the assigned "{category}" is
      never reassigned for other categories.  The TV-Anytime Forum is
      responsible for this.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      The TV-Anytime Forum is committed to maintaining the accessibility
      and persistence of all resources that are officially assigned URNs
      by the organization.  Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon
      suitable delegation at the level of "category"s, and persistence
      of category assignment.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      All the assignments of identifiers are fully controlled and
      managed by the TV-Anytime Forum.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The "{category}" is case-insensitive.  Thus, the portion of the
      URN:

                  urn:tva:{category}:

      is case-insensitive for matches.  The remainder of the identifier
      shall be considered case-sensitive; hence, URNs are only lexically
      equivalent if they are also lexically identical in the remaining
      {string} field.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      Validation shall be done by a syntax grammar corresponding to each
      "{category}".

   Scope:

      Global.

   The names in this namespace are to be used in any public
   implementations of the TV-Anytime Forum specifications so that
   anybody can benefit from the officially assigned namespace.

   Potential beneficiary communities include:

   a) Implementers of the TV-Anytime specifications.

      Resources that comply with the TV-Anytime Forum specifications
      (including TV-Anytime schemas, instance documents that comply with
      TV-Anytime schemas, and TV-Anytime default Classification Schemes)
      may, by means of the registered namespace, become exposed to the
      general Internet and gain from the interoperability benefits of
      the Internet at large.

   b) Implementers of other specifications that incorporate components
      of the TV-Anytime specifications.

      URNs used to identify TV-Anytime components may be used to enable
      their inclusion in, and enhancement of, other specifications while
      maintaining, to a certain degree, interoperability with the TV-
      Anytime community (see a) above).

   c) Implementers of other semantically related specifications that do
      not directly incorporate components of the TV-Anytime
      specifications.

      URNs used to identify components of the TV-Anytime specifications,
      such as identifiers of terms within default Classification
      Schemes, may enable interoperation with other semantically
      determined specifications (including present and future
      metadata/resource description and ontology specifications) of
      relevance to TV-Anytime implementation communities (see a) and b)
      above).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Namespace%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Namespace Considerations</span>

   This application requires a unique namespace because the assignment
   mechanism requires delegation to the TV-Anytime Forum.  As a
   namespace used to identify components of the TV-Anytime
   specifications, the TV-Anytime Forum will manage the inter-
   relationship of the components and the uniqueness of the identifiers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
