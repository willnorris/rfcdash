Request for Comments: 537                                       ILL-ANTS
NIC: 17498                                                  27 June 1973


                 <span class="h1">Announcement of NGG meeting-JULY 16-17</span>

   The proposed NGG meeting date of 16-JULY-73 has been confirmed.  The
   meeting will be held at the University of Illinois on July 16 and 17.
   An informal meeting will be held Sunday evening, July 15, to arrange
   the agenda.

      The initial meeting place will be:

         Room 201, Advanced Computation Building

         1101 W. Springfield

         Urbana, Ill.

   In the event that more space is needed, subsequent meetings may take
   place elsewhere.

   James Michener suggests that those attending be sure to have read his
   <a href="./rfc493">RFC 493</a> on graphics protocols.

   Local accommodations at Ramada Inn can be reserved by calling
   (800)648-5970(their tool-free number) or the local Inn, (217)352-
   7891.  If you wish to make other arrangements, contact me and I will
   try to help.

   Airline reservations can best be handled by your local airline
   office.  Jim suggested that I warn Ozark (the local service) of the
   upcoming surge of non-student, non-standby passengers in the hopes of
   getting better service. As Ozark is currently enjoying a pilot
   strike, I have been unable to do this.  Hopefully, it will be over in
   a few days, but if it isn't, I recommend that you get the closest
   flight you can and reserve a car for the rest of the way. This
   probably will be resolved in time to avoid any hassle, but I thought
   you would like to know about it just in case.

   So that I will have a rough idea how much space we will need, let me
   know, if possible, if you plan to attend.
