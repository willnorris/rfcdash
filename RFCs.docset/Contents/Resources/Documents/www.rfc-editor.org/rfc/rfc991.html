STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This memo is an official status report on the protocols used in the
   ARPA-Internet community.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

INTRODUCTION

   This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols
   used in the Internet.  Comments indicate any revisions or changes
   planned.

   To first order, the official protocols are those specified in the
   "DDN Protocol Handbook" (DPH), dated December 1985 (this is a three
   volume set with a total thickness of about 5 inches).

   Older collections that include many of these  specifications are the
   "Internet Protocol Transition Workbook" (IPTW), dated March 1982; the
   "Internet Mail Protocols", dated November 1982; and the "Internet
   Telnet Protocols and Options", dated June 1983.  There is also a
   volume of protocol related information called the "Internet Protocol
   Implementers Guide" (IPIG) dated August 1982.  An even older
   collection is the "ARPANET Protocol Handbook" (APH) dated
   January 1978.  Nearly all the relevant material from these
   collections has been reproduced in the current DPH.

   This document is organized as a sketchy outline.  The entries are
   protocols (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol).  In each entry there
   are notes on status, specification, comments, other references,
   dependencies, and contact.

      The STATUS is one of: required, recommended, elective,
      experimental, or none.

      The SPECIFICATION identifies the protocol defining documents.

      The COMMENTS describe any differences from the specification or
      problems with the protocol.

      The OTHER REFERENCES identify documents that comment on or expand
      on the protocol.

      The DEPENDENCIES indicate what other protocols are called upon by
      this protocol.

      The CONTACT indicates a person who can answer questions about the
      protocol.

      In particular, the status may be:

         required

            - all hosts must implement the required protocol,

         recommended

            - all hosts are encouraged to implement the recommended
            protocol,

         elective

            - hosts may implement or not the elective protocol,

         experimental

            - hosts should not implement the experimental protocol
            unless they are participating in the experiment and have
            coordinated their use of this protocol with the contact
            person, and

         none

            - this is not a protocol.

NETWORK LEVEL

   Internet Protocol  --------------------------------------------- (IP)

      STATUS:  Required

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc791">RFC 791</a> (in DPH)

      COMMENTS:

         This is the universal protocol of the Internet.  This datagram
         protocol provides the universal addressing of hosts in the
         Internet.

         A few minor problems have been noted in this document.

         The most serious is a bit of confusion in the route options.
         The route options have a pointer that indicates which octet of
         the route is the next to be used.  The confusion is between the
         phrases "the pointer is relative to this option" and "the
         smallest legal value for the pointer is 4".  If you are
         confused, forget about the relative part, the pointer begins
         at 4.  The MIL-STD description of source routing is wrong in
         some of the details.

         Another important point is the alternate reassembly procedure
         suggested in <a href="./rfc815">RFC 815</a>.

         Some changes are in the works for the security option.

         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You
         have not completed an implementation of IP if it does not
         include ICMP.

      COMMENTS:

         The control messages and error reports that go with the
         Internet Protocol.

         A few minor errors in the document have been noted.
         Suggestions have been made for additional types of redirect
         message and additional destination unreachable messages.

         Two additional ICMP message types are defined in <a href="./rfc950">RFC 950</a>
         "Internet Subnets", Address Mask Request (A1=17), and Address
         Mask Reply (A2=18).

   Internet Group Multicast Protocol  --------------------------- (IGMP)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc988">RFC 988</a>

      COMMENTS:

         This protocol specifies the extensions required of a host
         implementation of the Internet Protocol (IP) to support
         internetwork multicasting.  This specification supersedes that
         given in <a href="./rfc966">RFC 966</a>, and constitutes a proposed protocol standard
         for IP multicasting in the ARPA-Internet.  Reference <a href="./rfc966">RFC 966</a>
         for a discussion of the motivation and rationale behind the
         multicasting extension specified here.

HOST LEVEL

   User Datagram Protocol  --------------------------------------- (UDP)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc768">RFC 768</a> (in DPH)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides a datagram service to applications.  Adds port
         addressing to the IP services.

         The only change noted for the UDP specification is a minor
         clarification that if in computing the checksum a padding octet
         is used for the computation it is not transmitted or counted in
         the length.

   Transmission Control Protocol  -------------------------------- (TCP)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc793">RFC 793</a> (in DPH)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides reliable end-to-end data stream service.

         Many comments and corrections have been received for the TCP
         specification document.  These are primarily document bugs
         rather than protocol bugs.

         Event Processing Section:  There are many minor corrections and
         clarifications needed in this section.

         Push:  There are still some phrases in the document that give a
         "record mark" flavor to the push.  These should be further
         clarified.  The push is not a record mark.

Official ARPA-Internet Protocols


         Urgent:  Page 17 is wrong.  The urgent pointer points to the
         last octet of urgent data (not to the first octet of non-urgent
         data).

         Listening Servers:  Several comments have been received on
         difficulties with contacting listening servers.  There should
         be some discussion of implementation issues for servers, and
         some notes on alternative models of system and process
         organization for servers.

         Maximum Segment Size:  The maximum segment size option should
         be generalized and clarified.  It can be used to either
         increase or decrease the maximum segment size from the default.
         The TCP Maximum Segment Size is the IP Maximum Datagram Size
         minus forty.  The default IP Maximum Datagram Size is 576.  The
         default TCP Maximum Segment Size is 536.  For further
         discussion, see <a href="./rfc879">RFC 879</a>.

         Idle Connections:  There have been questions about
         automatically closing idle connections.  Idle connections are
         ok, and should not be closed.  There are several cases where
         idle connections arise, for example, in Telnet when a user is
         thinking for a long time following a message from the server
         computer before his next input.  There is no TCP "probe"
         mechanism, and none is needed.

         Queued Receive Data on Closing:  There are several points where
         it is not clear from the description what to do about data
         received by the TCP but not yet passed to the user,
         particularly when the connection is being closed.  In general,
         the data is to be kept to give to the user if he does a RECV
         call.

         Out of Order Segments:  The description says that segments that
         arrive out of order, that is, are not exactly the next segment
         to be processed, may be kept on hand.  It should also point out
         that there is a very large performance penalty for not doing
         so.

         User Time Out:  This is the time out started on an open or send
         call.  If this user time out occurs the user should be
         notified, but the connection should not be closed or the TCB
         deleted.  The user should explicitly ABORT the connection if he
         wants to give up.

         Defines a capability to combine several segments from different
         higher level protocols in one IP datagram.

         No current experiment in progress.  There is some question as
         to the extent to which the sharing this protocol envisions can
         actually take place.  Also, there are some issues about the
         information captured in the multiplexing header being (a)
         insufficient, or (b) over specific.

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc908">RFC 908</a> (in DPH)

      COMMENTS:

         This protocol is designed to efficiently support the bulk
         transfer of data for such host monitoring and control
         applications as loading/dumping and remote debugging.  The
         protocol is intended to be simple to implement but still be
         efficient in environments where there may be long transmission
         delays and loss or non-sequential delivery of message segments.

   File Transfer Protocol  --------------------------------------- (FTP)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc959">RFC 959</a> (in DPH)

      COMMENTS:

         The protocol for moving files between Internet hosts.  Provides
         for access control and negotiation of file parameters.

         The following new optional commands are included in this
         edition of the specification:  Change to Parent Directory
         (CDUP), Structure Mount (SMNT), Store Unique (STOU), Remove
         Directory (RMD), Make Directory (MKD), Print Directory (PWD),
         and System (SYST).  Note that this specification is compatible
         with the previous edition (<a href="./rfc765">RFC 765</a>).

         A discrepancy has been found in the specification in the
         examples of <a href="#appendix-I">Appendix I</a>I.  On page 63, a response code of 200 is
         shown as the response to a CWD command.  Under the list of
         Command-Reply Sequences cited on page 50, CWD is shown to only
         accept a 250 response code.  Therefore, if one would interpret
         a CWD command as being excluded from the File System functional
         category, one may assume that the response code of 200 is
         correct, since CDUP as a special case of CWD does use 200.

      COMMENTS:

         A very simple file moving protocol, no access control is
         provided.

         This is in use in several local networks.

         Ambiguities in the interpretation of several of the transfer
         modes should be  clarified, and additional transfer modes could
         be defined.  Additional error codes could be defined to more
         clearly identify problems.

         Note: The DPH contains IEN-133, which is an obsolete version of
         this protocol.

   Simple File Transfer Protocol  ------------------------------- (SFTP)

      STATUS:  Experimental

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="./rfc913">RFC 913</a> (in DPH)

      COMMENTS:

         SFTP is a simple file transfer protocol.  It fills the need of
         people wanting a protocol that is more useful than TFTP but
         easier to implement (and less powerful) than FTP.  SFTP
         supports user access control, file transfers, directory
         listing, directory changing, file renaming and deleting.

         SFTP can be implemented with any reliable 8-bit byte stream
         oriented protocol, this document describes its TCP
         specification.  SFTP uses only one TCP connection; whereas TFTP
         implements a connection over UDP, and FTP uses two TCP
         connections (one using the TELNET protocol).

         Please discuss any plans for implementation or use of this
         protocol with the contact.

      SPECIFICATION:  IEN 116 (in DPH)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides machine oriented procedure for translating a host name
         to an Internet Address.

         This specification has significant problems:  1) The name
         syntax is out of date.  2) The protocol details are ambiguous,
         in particular, the length octet either does or doesn't include
         itself and the op code.  3) The extensions are not supported by
         any known implementation.

         This protocol is now abandoned in favor of the DOMAIN protocol.
         Further implementations of this protocol are not advised.

         Please discuss any plans for implementation or use of this
         protocol with the contact.

   Internet Protocol on IEEE 802  ---------------------------- (IP-IEEE)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION: <a href="./rfc948">RFC 948</a> (in DPH)

      COMMENTS:

         A proposed protocol of two methods of encapsulating Internet
         Protocol (IP) datagrams on an IEEE 802.3 network.  Currently
         being revised to be generalized for all 802 networks.

         At an ad hoc special session on "IEEE 802 Networks and ARP"
         held during the TCP Vendors Workshop (August 1986), an approach
         to a consistent way to sent DOD-IP datagrams and other IP
         related protocols on 802 networks was developed.

         Due to some evolution of the IEEE 802.2 standards and the need
         to provide for a standard way to do additional DOD-IP related
         protocols (such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)) on IEEE
         802 networks, the following new policy is established, which
         will replace the current policy (see <a href="./rfc990">RFC-990</a> section on IEEE
         802 Numbers of Interest, and <a href="./rfc948">RFC-948</a>).

         The policy is for DDN and ARPA-Internet community to use IEEE
         802.2 encapsulation on 802.3, 802.4, and 802.5 networks by
         using the SNAP with an organization code indicating that the
         following 16 bits specify the Ethertype code (where IP = 2048
         (0800 hex), see <a href="./rfc990">RFC-990</a>  section on Ethernet Numbers of
         Interest).

                                                                  Header

            ...--------+--------+--------+
             MAC Header|      Length     |               802.{3/4/5} MAC
            ...--------+--------+--------+

            +--------+--------+--------+
            | Dsap=K1| Ssap=K1| control|                       802.2 SAP
            +--------+--------+--------+

            +--------+--------+---------+--------+--------+
            |protocol id or org code =K2|    Ether Type   |   802.2 SNAP
            +--------+--------+---------+--------+--------+

         The values of K1 and K2 must be assigned by the IEEE.  There is
         already assigned a value of K1 that indicates that the 5-octet


<span class="grey">Reynolds &amp; Postel                                              [Page 41]</span></pre>

         SNAP header follows.  We can use this value.  There may be a
         value of K2 that is already assigned that indicates that the
         last two octets of the SNAP header holds the EtherType.  If so
         we may be able to use this value.

         The total length of the SAP Header and the SNAP header is
         8-octets, making the 802.2 protocol overhead come out on a nice
         octet boundary.

         K1 is 170.  The IEEE like to talk about things in bit
         transmission order and specifies this value as 01010101.  In
         big-endian order, as used in Internet specifications, this
         becomes 10101010 binary, or AA hex, or 170 decimal.

         We believe that K2 is 0 (zero).  This must be further
         investigated, but as an interim measure use K2 = 0.

      COMMENTS:

         This paper specifies a protocol which allows two programs to
         reliably communicate over a communication link.  It ensures
         that the data entering one end of the link if received arrives
         at the other end intact and unaltered.  This proposed protocol
         is designed to operate over a full duplex point-to-point
         connection.  It contains some features which tailor it to the
         RS-232 links now in current use.
