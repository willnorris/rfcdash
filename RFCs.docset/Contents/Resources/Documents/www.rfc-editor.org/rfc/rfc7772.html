<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Routing information is communicated to IPv6 hosts by Router
   Advertisement (RA) messages [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  If these messages are sent
   too frequently, they can severely impact power consumption on
   battery-powered hosts.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   On links with a large number of battery-powered devices, sending
   solicited multicast Router Advertisements can severely impact host
   power consumption.  This is because every time a device joins the
   network, all devices on the network receive a multicast Router
   Advertisement.  In the worst case, if devices are continually joining
   and leaving the network, and the network is large enough, then all
   devices on the network will receive solicited Router Advertisements
   at the maximum rate specified by <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.2.6">Section 6.2.6 of [RFC4861]</a>, which is
   one every 3 seconds.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Frequent%20Periodic%20Router%20Advertisements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Frequent Periodic Router Advertisements</span>

   Some networks send periodic multicast Router Advertisements very
   frequently (e.g., once every few seconds).  This may be due to a
   desire to minimize customer impact of network renumbering events,
   which in some large residential networks occur relatively frequently.
   In the presence of hosts that ignore RAs or even all IPv6 packets
   when in sleep mode, such networks may see a need to send RAs
   frequently in order to avoid leaving devices with non-functional IPv6
   configurations for extended periods of time.  Unfortunately, this has
   severe impact on battery life.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Consequences"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Consequences</span>

   Observed effects of frequently sending Router Advertisement messages
   to battery-powered devices include:

   o  Some hosts simply experience bad battery life on these networks
      and otherwise operate normally.  This is frustrating for users of
      these networks.

   o  Some hosts react by dropping all Router Advertisement messages
      when in power-saving mode on any network, e.g.,
      &lt;<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=32662">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=32662</a>&gt;.  This
      causes devices to lose connectivity when in power-saving mode,
      potentially disrupting background network communications, because
      the device is no longer able to send packets or acknowledge
      received traffic.

   o  Some hosts react by dropping *all* IPv6 packets when in power-
      saving mode, &lt;<a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nsp/ipv6/54641">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nsp/</a>
      <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nsp/ipv6/54641">ipv6/54641</a>&gt;.  This disrupts network communications.

   Compounding the problem, when dealing with devices that drop Router
   Advertisements when in power saving mode, some network administrators
   work around the problem by sending RAs even more frequently.  This
   causes devices to engage in even more aggressive filtering.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Router%20Advertisement%20Frequency"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Router Advertisement Frequency</span>

   The appropriate frequency of periodic RAs depends on how constrained
   the network devices are.

   o  Laptop-class devices will likely experience no noticeable battery-
      life impact, even if RAs are sent every few seconds.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7772">RFC 7772</a>             Reducing RA Energy Consumption        February 2016</span>


   o  Tablets, phones, and watches experience it more noticeably.  At
      the time of writing, current-generation devices might consume on
      the order of 5 mA when the main processor is asleep.  Upon
      receiving a packet, they might consume on the order of 200 mA for
      250 ms, as the packet causes the main processor to wake up,
      process the RA, attend to other pending tasks, and then go back to
      sleep.  Thus, on such devices, the cost of receiving one RA will
      be approximately 0.014 mAh.

      In order to limit the amount of power used to receive Router
      Advertisements to, say, 2% of idle power (i.e., to impact idle
      battery life by no more than 2%), the average power budget for
      receiving RAs must be no more than 0.1 mA, or approximately 7 RAs
      per hour.  Due to background multicast loss and the tendency of
      current devices to rate-limit multicast when asleep, many of these
      RAs might not reach the device.  Thus, the minimum lifetimes for
      RA configuration parameters such as default router lifetime might
      reasonably be 5-10 times the RA period, or roughly 45-90 minutes.

      An impact of 2% relative to measured idle current is negligible,
      since on this sort of device average power consumption is
      typically much higher than idle power consumption.

   o  Specialized devices in non-general-purpose networks such as sensor
      networks might have tighter requirements.  In these environments,
      even longer RA intervals might be appropriate.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Network-Side%20Recommendations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Network-Side Recommendations</span>

   1.  Router manufacturers SHOULD allow network administrators to
       configure the routers to respond to Router Solicitations with
       unicast Router Advertisements if:

       *  The Router Solicitation's source address is not the
          unspecified address, and:

       *  The solicitation contains a valid Source Link-Layer Address
          option.

   2.  Administrators of networks that serve large numbers (tens or
       hundreds) of battery-powered devices SHOULD enable this behavior.

   3.  Networks that serve battery-powered devices SHOULD NOT send
       multicast RAs too frequently (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>) unless the
       information in the RA packet has substantially changed.  If there
       is a desire to ensure that hosts pick up configuration changes

       quickly, those networks MAY send frequent Router Advertisements
       for a limited period of time (e.g., not more than one minute)
       immediately after a configuration change.

   No protocol changes are required.  Responding to Router Solicitations
   with unicast Router Advertisements is already allowed by <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.2.6">Section</a>
   <a href="./rfc4861#section-6.2.6">6.2.6 of [RFC4861]</a>, and Router Advertisement intervals are already
   configurable by the administrator to a wide range of values.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Device-Side%20Recommendations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Device-Side Recommendations</span>

   1.  Maintaining IPv6 connectivity requires that hosts be able to
       receive periodic multicast RAs [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  Therefore, hosts that
       process unicast packets sent while they are asleep MUST also
       process multicast RAs sent while they are asleep.  Battery-
       powered hosts MAY rate-limit identical RAs if they are sent too
       frequently.

   2.  Battery-powered devices that do not intend to maintain IPv6
       connectivity while asleep SHOULD either disconnect from the
       network, abandoning all IPv6 configuration on that network, or
       perform Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6 (DNAv6) procedures
       [<a href="./rfc6059" title='"Simple Procedures for Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6"'>RFC6059</a>] when waking up.

   Misconfigured or malicious hosts sending rogue Router Advertisements
   [<a href="./rfc6104" title='"Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement Problem Statement"'>RFC6104</a>] can also severely impact power consumption on battery-
   powered hosts if they send a significant number of such messages.
   Any IPv6 network where there is potential for misconfigured or
   malicious hosts should take appropriate countermeasures to mitigate
   the problem.
