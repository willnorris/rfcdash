Abstract

   This document defines new RADIUS accounting Attributes and new values
   for the existing Acct-Status-Type Attribute [<a href="#ref-1" title='"RADIUS Accounting"'>1</a>] designed to support
   the provision of compulsory tunneling in dial-up networks.

Specification of Requirements

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>2</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Many applications of tunneling protocols such as PPTP [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)"'>5</a>] and L2TP
   [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol "'>4</a>] involve dial-up network access.  Some, such as the provision of
   secure access to corporate intranets via the Internet, are
   characterized by voluntary tunneling: the tunnel is created at the
   request of the user for a specific purpose.  Other applications
   involve compulsory tunneling: the tunnel is created without any
   action from the user and without allowing the user any choice in the
   matter, as a service of the Internet service provider (ISP).
   Typically, ISPs providing a service want to collect data regarding
   that service for billing, network planning, etc.  One way to collect
   usage data in dial-up networks is by means of RADIUS  Accounting [<a href="#ref-1" title='"RADIUS Accounting"'>1</a>].
   The use of RADIUS Accounting allows dial-up usage data to be
   collected at a central location, rather than stored on each NAS.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2867">RFC 2867</a>            RADIUS Tunnel Accounting Support           June 2000</span>


   In order to collect usage data regarding tunneling, new RADIUS
   attributes are needed; this document defines these attributes.  In
   addition, several new values for the Acct-Status-Type attribute are
   proposed.  Specific recommendations for, and examples of, the
   application of this attribute for the L2TP protocol can be found in
   <a href="./rfc2809">RFC 2809</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Implementation%20Notes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Implementation Notes</span>

   Compulsory tunneling may be part of a package of services provided by
   one entity to another.  For example, a corporation might contract
   with an ISP to provide remote intranet access to its employees via
   compulsory tunneling.  In this case, the integration of RADIUS and
   tunnel protocols allows the ISP and the corporation to synchronize
   their accounting activities so that each side receives a record of
   the user's resource consumption.  This provides the corporation with
   the means to audit ISP bills.

   In auditing, the User-Name, Acct-Tunnel-Connection, Tunnel-Client-
   Endpoint and Tunnel-Server-Endpoint attributes are typically used to
   uniquely identify the call, allowing the Accounting-Request sent by
   the NAS to be reconciled with the corresponding Accounting-Request
   sent by the tunnel server.

   When implementing RADIUS accounting for L2TP/PPTP tunneling, the
   Call-Serial-Number SHOULD be used in the Acct-Tunnel-Connection
   attribute.  In L2TP, the Call-Serial-Number is a 32-bit field and in
   PPTP it is a 16-bit field.  In PPTP the combination of IP Address and
   Call-Serial-Number SHOULD be unique, but this is not required.  In
   addition, no method for determining the Call-Serial-Number is
   specified, which leaves open the possibility of wrapping after a
   reboot.

   Note that a 16-bit Call-Serial-Number is not sufficient to
   distinguish a given call from all other calls over an extended time
   period.  For example, if the Call-Serial-Number is assigned
   monotonically, the NAS in question has 96 ports which are continually
   busy and the average call is of 20 minutes duration, then a 16-bit
   Call-Serial-Number will wrap within 65536/(96 * 3 calls/hour * 24
   hours/day) = 9.48 days.

      Value

         11

      Description

         This value MAY be used to mark the rejection of the
         establishment of a tunnel with another node.  If this value is
         used, the following attributes SHOULD also be included in the
         Accounting-Request packet:

            User-Name (1)
            NAS-IP-Address (4)
            Acct-Delay-Time (41)

      Value

         12

      Description

         This value MAY be used to mark the creation of a tunnel link.
         Only some tunnel types (e.g., L2TP) support multiple links per
         tunnel.  This Attribute is intended to mark the creation of a
         link within a tunnel that carries multiple links.  For example,
         if a mandatory tunnel were to carry M links over its lifetime,
         2(M+1) RADIUS Accounting messages might be sent: one each
         marking the initiation and destruction of the tunnel itself and
         one each for the initiation and destruction of each link within
         the tunnel.  If only a single link can be carried in a given
         tunnel (e.g., IPsec in the tunnel mode), this Attribute need
         not be included in accounting packets, since the presence of
         the Tunnel-Start Attribute will imply the initiation of the
         (only possible) link.

         included in the Accounting-Request packet:

      Value

         13

      Description

         This value MAY be used to mark the destruction of a tunnel
         link.  Only some tunnel types (e.g., L2TP) support multiple
         links per tunnel.  This Attribute is intended to mark the
         destruction of a link within a tunnel that carries multiple
         links.  For example, if a mandatory tunnel were to carry M
         links over its lifetime, 2(M+1) RADIUS Accounting messages
         might be sent: one each marking the initiation and destruction
         of the tunnel itself and one each for the initiation and
         destruction of each link within the tunnel.  If only a single
         link can be carried in a given tunnel (e.g., IPsec in the
         tunnel mode), this Attribute need not be included in accounting
         packets, since the presence of the Tunnel-Stop Attribute will
         imply the termination of the (only possible) link.

         If this value is used, the following attributes SHOULD also be
         included in the Accounting-Request packet:

            User-Name (1)
            NAS-IP-Address (4)
            NAS-Port (5)
            Acct-Delay-Time (41)

      Value

         14

      Description

         This value MAY be used to mark the rejection of the
         establishment of a new link in an existing tunnel.  Only some
         tunnel types (e.g., L2TP) support multiple links per tunnel.
         If only a single link can be carried in a given tunnel (e.g.,
         IPsec in the tunnel mode), this Attribute need not be included
         in accounting packets, since in this case the Tunnel-Reject
         Attribute has the same meaning.

         If this value is used, the following attributes SHOULD also be
         included in the Accounting-Request packet:

            User-Name (1)
            NAS-IP-Address (4)
            Acct-Delay-Time (41)

      Description

         This Attribute indicates the identifier assigned to the tunnel
         session.  It SHOULD be included in Accounting-Request packets
         which contain an Acct-Status-Type attribute having the value
         Start, Stop or any of the values described above.  This
         attribute, along with the Tunnel-Client-Endpoint and Tunnel-
         Server-Endpoint attributes [<a href="#ref-3" title='"RADIUS Attributes for Tunnel Protocol Support"'>3</a>], may be used to provide a means
         to uniquely identify a tunnel session for auditing purposes.

      A summary of the Acct-Tunnel-Connection Attribute format is shown
      below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      String

         The format of the identifier represented by the String field
         depends upon the value of the Tunnel-Type attribute [<a href="#ref-3" title='"RADIUS Attributes for Tunnel Protocol Support"'>3</a>].  For
         example, to fully identify an L2TP tunnel connection, the L2TP
         Tunnel ID and Call ID might be encoded in this field.  The
         exact encoding of this field is implementation dependent.

      Description

         This Attribute indicates the number of packets lost on a given
         link.  It SHOULD be included in Accounting-Request packets
         which contain an Acct-Status-Type attribute having the value
         Tunnel-Link-Stop.
