As many of you may know SRI is part of a team working on the National
Software Works project. In the course of our work we have developed a
Procedure Call Protocol to be used between the modules which make up
the NSW. We are interested in your comments on this protocol. Please
foreward your remarks to either:                                           2

This note announces the release of the second published version of
several National Software Works (NSW) and Procedure Call Protocol
(PCP) documents. Version 2 is SUBSTANTIALLY different than Version 1;
it and all intermediate, informally distributed PCP documents are
obsoleted by this release.                                                 3

Each of the following documents is available on-line in two forms: as
an NLS file and as a formatted text file.  The Journal number (e.g.
24459) refers to the former, of course, and the pathname (e.g.
[SRI-ARC]&lt;NLS&gt;PCP.TXT) to the latter, accessible via FTP using
USER=ANONYMOUS and PASSWORD=GUEST (no account required). Let it be
emphasised that files indicated by pathname of the form
[SRI-ARC]&lt;NLS&gt;name.TXT are ASCII text files not NLS files.                 4

The specifications are contained in the following documents:               5

   HOST      (24581,)  "NSW Host Protocol"                                5a

      This document describes the host level protocol used in the NSW.
      The protocol is a slightly constrained version of the standard
      ARPANET host to host protocol. The constraints  affect the
      allocation, RFNM wait, and retransmission policies.                5a1</pre>

      This document discusses the process of utilizing a batch
      processing facility to complete a programming task in the NSW
      environment. This same activity in another environment might
      utilize a remote job entry system.                                 5l1

   BOXES     (24584,)  "Black Boxes in PCP"                               5o

      This document describes the transliteration of the black boxes
      defined by Millstein and Warshall into the setting provided by
      PCP, especially the File Package and the Executive Package.        5o1

The document on the Host level protocol, HOST, is a suggestion for
some restrictions on the regular ARPANET host protocol for use in NSW,
this topic has little impact on the remainder of the NSW protocols.
The reader is urged to begin with the major Procedure Call Protocol
documents.                                                                 6

The document on PCP is the place the interested reader should start.
It gives the required motivation for the Protocol and states the
substance of the Protocol proper.                                          7

<a href="./rfc674">RFC 674</a>;                                              PCP Announcement



The reader may then proceed to the next three documents: PIP, PSP and
PMP. The latter has the most relavence to the casual reader; the
programmer faced with coding in the PCP environment should read all
three.                                                                     8

The three documents PCPFMT, PCPHST, and PCPFRK specify low level
details of the communication formats and are of interest only to PCP
implementers.                                                              9

The documents EXEC, FILE and BATCH describe procedure packages to be
implemented as appropriate to provide the services of the
accounting/status/usage statistics subsystem, the file subsystem or
batch processing subsystem respectively.                                  10

The document RJE-MODEL describes how a user would utilize various
tools in the NSW in the process of  carrying out tasks he might in the
absence of NSW achieve using a remote job entry system. This should be
read with the document on BATCH.
                                                                          11

The LLDBUG package specifies a debugging package that operates in the
PCP environment.                                                          12

The document called BOXES describes a mapping between the PCP
mechanisms and the File Package procedures and the Black Boxes needed
by the Works Manager.                                                     13

The document TBH speaks to the requirements placed on the Tool Bearing
Host. This document indicates how and where various PCP packages
interface to an operating system.                                         14
