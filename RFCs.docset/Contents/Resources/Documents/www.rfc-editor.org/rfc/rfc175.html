Request for Comments: 175                    E. Harslem - Rand

             Comments on "Socket Conventions Reconsidered"
             ---------------------------------------------

        We agree with the conclusions reached by Abhay, Bob, and Joel in
   RFC #167, "Socket Conventions Reconsidered," (see RFC #129, scheme #4)
   -- especially the necessity for a major NCP overhaul.

        Our main departure in thinking from RFC #167 concerns the socket
   length. (See RFC #164, page 21.)  Since there is an apparently serious
   TIP storage consideration, Rand- assigned sockets will have the
   high-order 16 bits zero.

        For the particular programs (current and pending) that Rand must
   access, repeatability of socket name (RFC #167, page 3) is not
   necessary for the user process and also not necessary for the server
   process except for initial contact (ICP) sockets.

   Our current use of socket names is diagrammed below.

   conventions).
