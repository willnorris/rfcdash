Abstract

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is primarily used to translate domain
   names into IPv4 addresses using A RRs (Resource Records).  Several
   approaches exist to describe networks or address ranges.  This
   document specifies a new DNS RR type "APL" for address prefix lists.

   The Domain Name System [<a href="./rfc1034" title='"Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities"'>RFC1034</a>], [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain Names - Implementation and Specification"'>RFC1035</a>] provides a mechanism to
   associate addresses and other Internet infrastructure elements with
   hierarchically built domain names.  Various types of resource records
   have been defined, especially those for IPv4 and IPv6 [<a href="./rfc2874" title='"DNS Extensions to Support IPv6 Address Aggregation and Renumbering"'>RFC2874</a>]
   addresses.  In [<a href="./rfc1101" title='"DNS Encoding of Network Names and Other Types"'>RFC1101</a>] a method is described to publish information
   about the address space allocated to an organisation.  In older BIND
   versions, a weak form of controlling access to zone data was
   implemented using TXT RRs describing address ranges.

   This document specifies a new RR type for address prefix lists.

   An APL record has the DNS type of "APL" and a numeric value of 42
   [<a href="#ref-IANA">IANA</a>].  The APL RR is defined in the IN class only.  APL RRs cause
   no additional section processing.

   The RDATA section consists of zero or more items (&lt;apitem&gt;) of the
   form

                        family dependent part (7 bit unsigned).

   This document defines the AFDPARTs for address families 1 (IPv4) and
   2 (IPv6).  Future revisions may deal with additional address
   families.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20AFDPART%20for%20IPv4"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>. AFDPART for IPv4</span>

   The encoding of an IPv4 address (address family 1) follows the
   encoding specified for the A RR by <a href="./rfc1035#section-3.4.1">[RFC1035], section 3.4.1</a>.

   PREFIX specifies the number of bits of the IPv4 address starting at
   the most significant bit.  Legal values range from 0 to 32.

   Trailing zero octets do not bear any information (e.g., there is no
   semantic difference between 10.0.0.0/16 and 10/16) in an address
   prefix, so the shortest possible AFDLENGTH can be used to encode it.
   However, for DNSSEC [<a href="./rfc2535" title='"Domain Name System Security Extensions"'>RFC2535</a>] a single wire encoding must be used by



<span class="grey">Koch                          Experimental                      [Page 2]</span></pre>

   all.  Therefore the sender MUST NOT include trailing zero octets in
   the AFDPART regardless of the value of PREFIX.  This includes cases
   in which AFDLENGTH times 8 results in a value less than PREFIX.  The
   AFDPART is padded with zero bits to match a full octet boundary.

   An IPv4 AFDPART has a variable length of 0 to 4 octets.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20AFDPART%20for%20IPv6"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>. AFDPART for IPv6</span>

   The 128 bit IPv6 address (address family 2) is encoded in network
   byte order (high-order byte first).

   PREFIX specifies the number of bits of the IPv6 address starting at
   the most significant bit.  Legal values range from 0 to 128.

   With the same reasoning as in 4.1 above, the sender MUST NOT include
   trailing zero octets in the AFDPART regardless of the value of
   PREFIX.  This includes cases in which AFDLENGTH times 8 results in a
   value less than PREFIX.  The AFDPART is padded with zero bits to
   match a full octet boundary.

   An IPv6 AFDPART has a variable length of 0 to 16 octets.

   The textual representation of an APL RR in a DNS zone file is as
   follows:

   &lt;owner&gt;   IN   &lt;TTL&gt;   APL   {[!]afi:address/prefix}*

   The data consists of zero or more strings of the address family
   indicator &lt;afi&gt;, immediately followed by a colon ":", an address,
   immediately followed by the "/" character, immediately followed by a
   decimal numeric value for the prefix length.  Any such string may be
   preceded by a "!" character.  The strings are separated by
   whitespace.  The &lt;afi&gt; is the decimal numeric value of that
   particular address family.

   An IPv4 address in the &lt;address&gt; part of an &lt;apitem&gt; is in dotted
   quad notation, just as in an A RR.  The &lt;prefix&gt; has values from the
   interval 0..32 (decimal).

   The representation of an IPv6 address in the &lt;address&gt; part of an
   &lt;apitem&gt; follows <a href="./rfc2373#section-2.2">[RFC2373], section 2.2</a>.  Legal values for &lt;prefix&gt;
   are from the interval 0..128 (decimal).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20APL%20RR%20usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>. APL RR usage</span>

   An APL RR with empty RDATA is valid and implements an empty list.
   Multiple occurrences of the same &lt;apitem&gt; in a single APL RR are
   allowed and MUST NOT be merged by a DNS server or resolver.
   &lt;apitems&gt; MUST be kept in order and MUST NOT be rearranged or
   aggregated.

   A single APL RR may contain &lt;apitems&gt; belonging to different address
   families.  The maximum number of &lt;apitems&gt; is upper bounded by the
   available RDATA space.

   RRSets consisting of more than one APL RR are legal but the
   interpretation is left to the particular application.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20Applicability%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>. Applicability Statement</span>

   The APL RR defines a framework without specifying any particular
   meaning for the list of prefixes.  It is expected that APL RRs will
   be used in different application scenarios which have to be
   documented separately.  Those scenarios may be distinguished by
   characteristic prefixes placed in front of the DNS owner name.

   An APL application specification MUST include information on

   o  the characteristic prefix, if any

   o  how to interpret APL RRSets consisting of more than one RR

   o  how to interpret an empty APL RR

   o  which address families are expected to appear in the APL RRs for
      that application

   o  how to deal with APL RR list elements which belong to other
      address families, including those not yet defined

   o  the exact semantics of list elements negated by the "!" character

   Possible applications include the publication of address ranges
   similar to [<a href="./rfc1101" title='"DNS Encoding of Network Names and Other Types"'>RFC1101</a>], description of zones built following [<a href="./rfc2317" title='"Classless IN- ADDR.ARPA delegation"'>RFC2317</a>]
   and in-band access control to limit general access or zone transfer
   (AXFR) availability for zone data held in DNS servers.

   The specification of particular application scenarios is out of the
   scope of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>. Examples</span>

   The following examples only illustrate some of the possible usages
   outlined in the previous section.  None of those applications are
   hereby specified nor is it implied that any particular APL RR based
   application does exist now or will exist in the future.

  ; <a href="./rfc1101">RFC 1101</a>-like announcement of address ranges for foo.example
  foo.example.             IN APL 1:192.168.32.0/21 !1:192.168.38.0/28

  ; CIDR blocks covered by classless delegation
  42.168.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA. IN APL ( 1:192.168.42.0/26 1:192.168.42.64/26
                                  1:192.168.42.128/25 )

  ; Zone transfer restriction
  _axfr.sbo.example.       IN APL 1:127.0.0.1/32 1:172.16.64.0/22

  ; List of address ranges for multicast
  multicast.example.       IN APL 1:224.0.0.0/4  2:FF00:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/8

   Note that since trailing zeroes are ignored in the first APL RR the
   AFDLENGTH of both &lt;apitems&gt; is three.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   Any information obtained from the DNS should be regarded as unsafe
   unless techniques specified in [<a href="./rfc2535" title='"Domain Name System Security Extensions"'>RFC2535</a>] or [<a href="./rfc2845" title='"Secret Key Transaction Authentication for DNS (TSIG)"'>RFC2845</a>] were used.  The
   definition of a new RR type does not introduce security problems into
   the DNS, but usage of information made available by APL RRs may
   compromise security.  This includes disclosure of network topology
   information and in particular the use of APL RRs to construct access
   control lists.
