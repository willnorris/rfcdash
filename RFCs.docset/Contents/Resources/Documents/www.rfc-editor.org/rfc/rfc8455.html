     <span class="h1">Terminology for Benchmarking Software-Defined Networking (SDN)</span>
                         <span class="h1">Controller Performance</span>

Abstract

   This document defines terminology for benchmarking a Software-Defined
   Networking (SDN) controller's control-plane performance.  It extends
   the terminology already defined in <a href="./rfc7426">RFC 7426</a> for the purpose of
   benchmarking SDN Controllers.  The terms provided in this document
   help to benchmark an SDN Controller's performance independently of
   the controller's supported protocols and/or network services.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a networking architecture in
   which network control is decoupled from the underlying forwarding
   function and is placed in a centralized location called the SDN
   Controller.  The SDN Controller provides an abstraction of the
   underlying network and offers a global view of the overall network to
   applications and business logic.  Thus, an SDN Controller provides
   the flexibility to program, control, and manage network behavior
   dynamically through northbound and southbound interfaces.  Since the
   network controls are logically centralized, the need to benchmark the
   SDN Controller's performance becomes significant.  This document
   defines terms to benchmark various controller designs for
   performance, scalability, reliability, and security, independently of
   northbound and southbound protocols.  A mechanism for benchmarking
   the performance of SDN Controllers is defined in the companion
   methodology document [<a href="./rfc8456" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Software- Defined Networking (SDN) Controller Performance"'>RFC8456</a>].  These two documents provide methods
   for measuring and evaluating the performance of various controller
   implementations.

   Definition:
      A controller Forwarding Table contains flow entries learned in one
      of two ways: first, entries can be learned from traffic received
      through the data plane, or second, these entries can be statically
      provisioned on the controller and distributed to devices via the
      southbound interface.

   Definition:
      Controller programming flows in Network Devices based on the
      traffic received from Network Devices through the controller's
      southbound interface.

   Discussion:
      The SDN Controller dynamically decides the forwarding behavior
      based on the incoming traffic from the Network Devices.  The
      controller then programs the Network Devices, using Reactive Flow
      Provisioning.

   Definition:
      In this mode, a group of two or more controllers handles all
      control-plane functionalities.

   Discussion:
      In cluster mode, multiple controllers are teamed together for the
      purpose of load sharing and/or high availability.  The controllers
      in the group may operate in active/standby (master/slave) or
      active/active (equal) mode, depending on the intended purpose.

   Definition:
      Any message from the Network Device that is generated for network
      events.

   Discussion:
      Control messages like flow setup request and response messages are
      classified as asynchronous messages.  The controller has to return
      a response message.  Note that the Network Device will not be in
      blocking mode and continues to send/receive other control
      messages.

      current network state.  This benchmark is obtained by presenting a
      network topology (tree, mesh, or linear) with a specified number
      of nodes to the controller and waiting for the discovery process
      to complete.  It is expected that the controller supports a
      network discovery mechanism and uses protocol messages for its

   Definition:
      The time taken by the controller(s) to process an asynchronous
      message, defined as the interval starting with an asynchronous
      message from a Network Device after the discovery of all the
      devices by the controller(s) and ending with a response message
      from the controller(s) at its southbound interface.

   Discussion:
      For SDN to support dynamic network provisioning, it is important
      to measure how quickly the controller responds to an event
      triggered from the network.  The event can be any notification
      messages generated by a Network Device upon arrival of a new flow,
      link down, etc.  This benchmark is obtained by sending
      asynchronous messages from every connected Network Device one at a
      time for the defined Trial Duration.  This test assumes that the
      controller will respond to the received asynchronous messages.

   Measurement Units:
      Milliseconds.

   Definition:
      The number of responses to asynchronous messages per second (a new
      flow arrival notification message, link down, etc.) for which the
      controller(s) performed processing and replied with a valid and
      productive (non-trivial) response message.

   Discussion:
      As SDN assures a flexible network and agile provisioning, it is
      important to measure how many network events (a new flow arrival
      notification message, link down, etc.) the controller can handle
      at a time.  This benchmark is measured by sending asynchronous
      messages from every connected Network Device at the rate that the
      controller processes (without dropping them).  This test assumes




<span class="grey">Bhuvaneswaran, et al.         Informational                    [Page 10]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8455">RFC 8455</a>         SDN Controller Benchmarking Terminology    October 2018</span>


      that the controller responds to all the received asynchronous
      messages (the messages can be designed to elicit individual
      responses).

      When sending asynchronous messages to the controller(s) at high
      rates, some messages or responses may be discarded or corrupted
      and require retransmission to controller(s).  Therefore, a useful
      qualification on the Asynchronous Message Processing Rate is
      whether the incoming message count equals the response count in
      each trial.  This is called the Loss-Free Asynchronous Message
      Processing Rate.

      Note that several of the early controller benchmarking tools did
      not consider lost messages and instead report the maximum response
      rate.  This is called the Maximum Asynchronous Message Processing
      Rate.

      To characterize both the Loss-Free Asynchronous Message Processing
      Rate and the Maximum Asynchronous Message Processing Rate, a test
      can begin the first trial by sending asynchronous messages to the
      controller(s) at the maximum possible rate and can then record the
      message reply rate and the message loss rate.  The message-sending
      rate is then decreased by the STEP size.  The message reply rate
      and the message loss rate are recorded.  The test ends with a
      trial where the controller(s) processes all of the asynchronous
      messages sent without loss.  This is the Loss-Free Asynchronous
      Message Processing Rate.

      The trial where the controller(s) produced the maximum response
      rate is the Maximum Asynchronous Message Processing Rate.  Of
      course, the first trial can begin at a low sending rate with zero
      lost responses and then increase the rate until the Loss-Free
      Asynchronous Message Processing Rate and the Maximum Asynchronous
      Message Processing Rate are discovered.

   Measurement Units:
      Messages processed per second.

      For SDN to support pre-provisioning of the traffic path for a
      larger network from the application, it is important to measure
      how many end-to-end flows the controller can set up in the
      data plane.  This benchmark is obtained by sending each traffic
      flow with unique source and destination pairs from the source

      In order for the controller to support fast network failure
      recovery, it is critical to measure how fast the controller is

   Discussion:
      Measuring the controller's Control Sessions Capacity is important
      for determining the controller's system and bandwidth resource
      requirements.  This benchmark is obtained by establishing a

   The benchmarking tests described in this document are limited to the
   performance characterization of controllers in a lab environment with
   isolated networks.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the controller.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the controller specifically
   for benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security
   arising from the controller SHOULD be identical in the lab and in
   production networks.
