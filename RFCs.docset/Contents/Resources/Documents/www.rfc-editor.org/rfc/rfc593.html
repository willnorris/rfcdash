             Telnet and FTP Implementation Schedule Change

Telnet and FTP Implementation Schedule Change

   We have been contacted by several Telnet implementers and concerned
   users regarding the scheduled changeover from old to new Telnet.
   There is a good deal of concern about accomplishing a coordinated
   changeover especially in light of the potential incompatibilities
   (<a href="./rfc559">RFC 559</a>, NIC18482).  Therefore the changeover is reformulated as
   follows.

   New Telnet implementations are to be ready 1 Jan 74 (as before), but
   are to use ICP socket 23 (decimal).  That is the server Telnet will
   listen on socket 23, and user Telnet programs will connect to socket
   23.  It will also be useful for the user program to let the user
   optionally select the server socket, as many user Telnet programs
   currently do.  It will also be useful for implementers to consider a
   server Telnet program capable of dealing with both protocols as MIT-
   DMCG has done (<a href="./rfc559">RFC 559</a>).  This will provide an opportunity for
   testing and debugging the new programs in a way that does not
   interfere with normal use.

   During January we will survey the technical liaisons to determine the
   status of the Telnet implementations.  As soon as we determine that
   the Telnet implementations have reached a point where the changeover
   can be made without disruption of user services the technical
   liaisons will be notified.

   In light of this change in the Telnet implementation schedule, the
   FTP schedule is also modified.  New FTP implementations are to be
   ready by 1 Feb 74 (as before), but will continue to use ICP socket 21
   (decimal) until we can determine that a changeover is appropriate.
