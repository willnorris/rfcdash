RFC # 449                                                   BBN-NET
NIC # 14133                                                 Jan. 6, 1973
Updates <a href="./rfc442">RFC 442</a>


              The Current Flow-control Scheme for IMPSYS.


    While Vint's notes on IMPSYS flow-control from the March 16, 1972,
meeting (<a href="./rfc442">RFC 442</a>) seem reasonably accurate and while he does cite our
Quarterly Technical Report #13, he might have done better to cite BBN's
two formal publications relevant to the IMPSYS flow-control scheme:

    1.  McQuillan et al, Improvements in the Design and Performance of
        the ARPA Network, Proceedings AFIPS 1972 FJCC, pp. 741-754.

    2.  BBN Report 1822, Specifications for the Interconnection of a
        Host and an IMP, December 1972 Revision, <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>, pp. 17-35.

Reference 2 is particularly important reading for NCP programmers -
things have recently changed somewhat.

    The inter-IMP acknowledgement mechanism, described in the last
section of Vint's <a href="./rfc442">RFC 442</a>, is also described in reference 1 and an
almost identical mechanism is described in <a href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a> of reference 2.
The acknowledgement is of only intellectual interest to most Hosts as it
is transparent to network users.  However, the description in reference
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2%20is%20of%20vital%20interest%20to%20so-called%20Very%20Distant%20Hosts."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a> is of vital interest to so-called Very Distant Hosts.</span>
