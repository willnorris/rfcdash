Abstract

   This document gives a more concrete definition of "the IETF" as it
   understood today.  Many RFCs refer to "the IETF".  Many important
   IETF documents speak of the IETF as if it were an already-defined
   entity.  However, no IETF document correctly defines what the IETF
   is.

   Many RFCs refer to "the IETF".  Many important IETF documents speak
   of the IETF as if it were an already-defined entity.  However, no
   IETF document correctly defines what the IETF is.  This document
   gives a more concrete definition of "the IETF" as it understood
   today.

   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp9">BCP 9</a> ("The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3") [BCP 9], the
   primary document that describes the Internet standards process, never
   defines the IETF.  As described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp11">BCP 11</a> ("The Organizations
   Involved in the IETF Standards Process") [BCP 11], the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open global community of network
   designers, operators, vendors, and researchers producing technical
   specifications for the evolution of the Internet architecture and the
   smooth operation of the Internet.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3233">RFC 3233</a>                   Defining the IETF               February 2002</span>


   It is important to note that the IETF is not a corporation: it is an
   unincorporated, freestanding organization.  The IETF is partially
   supported by the Internet Society (ISOC).  ISOC is an international
   non-profit organization incorporated in the US with thousands of
   individual and corporate members throughout the world who pay
   membership fees to join.  The Internet Society provides many services
   to the IETF, including insurance and some financial and logistical
   support.

   As described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp11">BCP 11</a>, Internet standardization is an organized
   activity of the ISOC, with the ISOC Board of Trustees being
   responsible for ratifying the procedures and rules of the Internet
   standards process.  However, the IETF is not a formal subset of ISOC;
   for example, one does not have to join ISOC to be a member of the
   IETF.

   There is no board of directors for the IETF, no formally signed
   bylaws, no treasurer, and so on.  The structure of the IETF (its
   leadership, its working groups, the definition of IETF membership,
   and so on) are described in detail in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp11">BCP 11</a>.  Procedures for
   choosing leadership are described in detail in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp10">BCP 10</a>.

   Thus, when RFCs say "the IETF", they are describing the group that
   acts in accordance with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp9">BCP 9</a>, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp10">BCP 10</a>, and <a href="./bcp11">BCP 11</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   All IETF protocols must describe the security aspects of the
   environment in which they will be used.  Also, the IETF has a
   Security Area which discusses the security aspects of IETF protocols.
   However, descriptive documents such as this one do not affect the
   security of the Internet.
