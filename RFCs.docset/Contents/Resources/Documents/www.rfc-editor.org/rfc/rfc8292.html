    <span class="h1">Voluntary Application Server Identification (VAPID) for Web Push</span>

Abstract

   An application server can use the Voluntary Application Server
   Identification (VAPID) method described in this document to
   voluntarily identify itself to a push service.  The "vapid"
   authentication scheme allows a client to include its identity in a
   signed token with requests that it makes.  The signature can be used
   by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same
   application server to a single entity.  The identification
   information can allow the operator of a push service to contact the
   operator of the application server.  The signature can be used to
   restrict the use of a push message subscription to a single
   application server.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Web Push protocol [<a href="./rfc8030" title='"Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push"'>RFC8030</a>] describes how an application server
   is able to request that a push service deliver a push message to a
   user agent.

   As a consequence of the expected deployment architecture, there is no
   basis for an application server to be known to a push service prior
   to requesting delivery of a push message.  Requiring that the push
   service be able to authenticate application servers places an
   unwanted constraint on the interactions between user agents and
   application servers, who are the ultimate users of a push service.
   That constraint would also degrade the privacy-preserving properties
   the protocol provides.  For these reasons, [<a href="./rfc8030" title='"Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push"'>RFC8030</a>] does not define
   a mandatory system for authentication of application servers.

   An unfortunate consequence of the design of [<a href="./rfc8030" title='"Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push"'>RFC8030</a>] is that a push
   service is exposed to a greater risk of denial-of-service attacks.
   While requests from application servers can be indirectly attributed
   to user agents, this is not always efficient or even sufficient.
   Providing more information about the application server directly to a
   push service allows the push service to better distinguish between
   legitimate and bogus requests.

   Additionally, the design of [<a href="./rfc8030" title='"Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push"'>RFC8030</a>] relies on maintaining the
   secrecy of push message subscription URIs.  Any application server in
   possession of a push message subscription URI is able to send
   messages to the user agent.  If use of a subscription could be
   limited to a single application server, this would reduce the impact
   of the push message subscription URI being learned by an unauthorized
   party.

   This document describes a system whereby an application server can
   volunteer information about itself to a push service.  At a minimum,
   this provides a stable identity for the application server, though
   this could also include contact information, such as an email
   address.

   A consistent identity can be used by a push service to establish
   behavioral expectations for an application server.  Significant
   deviations from an established norm can then be used to trigger
   exception-handling procedures.

   Voluntarily provided contact information can be used to contact an
   application server operator in the case of exceptional situations.

   Experience with push service deployment has shown that software
   errors or unusual circumstances can cause large increases in push
   message volume.  Contacting the operator of the application server
   has proven to be valuable.

   Even in the absence of usable contact information, an application
   server that has a well-established reputation might be given
   preference over an unidentified application server when choosing
   whether to discard a push message.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20Notational%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Notational Conventions</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms "push message", "push service", "push message
   subscription", "application server", and "user agent" are used as
   defined in [<a href="./rfc8030" title='"Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push"'>RFC8030</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Application%20Server%20Self-Identification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Application Server Self-Identification</span>

   Application servers that wish to self-identify generate and maintain
   a signing key pair.  This key pair MUST be usable with the Elliptic
   Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) over the P-256 curve
   [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title='"Digital Signature Standard (DSS)"'>FIPS186</a>].  Use of this key when sending push messages establishes an
   identity for the application server that is consistent across
   multiple messages.

   When requesting delivery of a push message, the application includes
   a JSON Web Token (JWT) [<a href="./rfc7519" title='"JSON Web Token (JWT)"'>RFC7519</a>], signed using its signing key.  The
   token includes a number of claims as follows:

   o  An "aud" (Audience) claim in the token MUST include the Unicode
      serialization of the origin (<a href="./rfc6454#section-6.1">Section 6.1 of [RFC6454]</a>) of the push
      resource URL.  This binds the token to a specific push service and
      ensures that the token is reusable for all push resource URLs that
      share the same origin.

   o  An "exp" (Expiry) claim MUST be included with the time after which
      the token expires.  This limits the time over which a token is
      valid.  An "exp" claim MUST NOT be more than 24 hours from the

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8292">RFC 8292</a>                   VAPID for Web Push              November 2017</span>


      time of the request.  Limiting this to 24 hours balances the need
      for reuse against the potential cost and likelihood of theft of a
      valid token.

   This JWT is included in an Authorization header field, using an
   authentication scheme of "vapid".  A push service MAY reject a
   request with a 403 (Forbidden) status code [<a href="./rfc7231" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content"'>RFC7231</a>] if the JWT
   signature or its claims are invalid.  A push service MUST NOT use
   information from an invalid token.

   The JWT MUST use a JSON Web Signature (JWS) [<a href="./rfc7515" title='"JSON Web Signature (JWS)"'>RFC7515</a>].  The signature
   MUST use ECDSA on the NIST P-256 curve [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title='"Digital Signature Standard (DSS)"'>FIPS186</a>], which is identified
   as "ES256" [<a href="./rfc7518" title='"JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)"'>RFC7518</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Application%20Server%20Contact%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Application Server Contact Information</span>

   If the application server wishes to provide contact details, it MAY
   include a "sub" (Subject) claim in the JWT.  The "sub" claim SHOULD
   include a contact URI for the application server as either a
   "mailto:" (email) [<a href="./rfc6068" title="&quot;The 'mailto' URI Scheme&quot;">RFC6068</a>] or an "https:" [<a href="./rfc2818" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>RFC2818</a>] URI.

   An application server MAY include additional claims using public or
   private names (see Sections <a href="#section-4.2">4.2</a> and <a href="#section-4.3">4.3</a> of [<a href="./rfc7519" title='"JSON Web Token (JWT)"'>RFC7519</a>]).  Since the JWT
   is in a header field, the size of additional claims SHOULD be kept as
   small as possible.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Cryptographic%20Agility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Cryptographic Agility</span>

   The "vapid" HTTP authentication scheme (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) is used to
   identify the specific profile of JWT defined in this document.  A
   different authentication scheme is needed to update the signature
   algorithm or other parameters.  This ensures that existing mechanisms
   for negotiating authentication schemes can be used rather than
   defining new parameter negotiation mechanisms.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Example</span>

   An application server requests the delivery of a push message as
   described in [<a href="./rfc8030" title='"Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push"'>RFC8030</a>].  If the application server wishes to self-
   identify, it includes an Authorization header field with credentials
   that use the "vapid" authentication scheme.

   This document defines a new HTTP authentication scheme [<a href="./rfc7235" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication"'>RFC7235</a>]
   named "vapid".  This authentication scheme carries a signed JWT, as
   described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, plus the key that signed that JWT.

   This authentication scheme is for origin-server authentication only.
   Therefore, this authentication scheme MUST NOT be used with the
   Proxy-Authenticate or Proxy-Authorization header fields.





<span class="grey">Thomson &amp; Beverloo           Standards Track                    [Page 6]</span></pre>

   The challenge for the "vapid" authentication scheme contains only the
   "auth-scheme" production.  No parameters are currently defined.

   Two parameters are defined for this authentication scheme: "t" and
   "k".  All unknown or unsupported parameters to "vapid" authentication
   credentials MUST be ignored.  The "realm" parameter is ignored for
   this authentication scheme.

   This authentication scheme is intended for use by an application
   server when using the Web Push protocol [<a href="./rfc8030" title='"Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push"'>RFC8030</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Token%20Parameter%20%28%22t%22%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Token Parameter ("t")</span>

   The "t" parameter of the "vapid" authentication scheme carries a JWT
   as described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Public%20Key%20Parameter%20%28%22k%22%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Public Key Parameter ("k")</span>

   In order for the push service to be able to validate the JWT, it
   needs to learn the public key of the application server.  A "k"
   parameter is defined for the "vapid" authentication scheme to carry
   this information.

   The "k" parameter includes an ECDSA public key [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title='"Digital Signature Standard (DSS)"'>FIPS186</a>] in
   uncompressed form [<a href="#ref-X9.62" title='"Public Key Cryptography for the Financial Services Industry: the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>X9.62</a>] that is encoded using base64url encoding
   [<a href="./rfc7515" title='"JSON Web Signature (JWS)"'>RFC7515</a>].

   Note:  X9.62 encoding is used over JWK [<a href="./rfc7517" title='"JSON Web Key (JWK)"'>RFC7517</a>] for two reasons.  A
      JWK does not have a canonical form, so X9.62 encoding makes it
      easier for the push service to handle comparison of keys from
      different sources.  Secondarily, the X9.62 encoding is also
      considerably smaller.

   Some elliptic curve implementations permit the same P-256 key to be
   used for signing and key exchange.  An application server MUST select
   a different private key for the key exchange [<a href="./rfc8291" title='"Message Encryption for Web Push"'>RFC8291</a>] and signing
   the authentication token.  Though a push service is not obligated to
   check either parameter for every push message, a push service SHOULD
   reject push messages that have identical values for these parameters
   with a 400 (Bad Request) status code.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Subscription%20Restriction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Subscription Restriction</span>

   The public key of the application server serves as a stable
   identifier for the server.  This key can be used to restrict a push
   message subscription to a specific application server.

   Subscription restriction reduces the reliance on endpoint secrecy by
   requiring that an application server provide a signed token when
   requesting delivery of a push message.  This provides an additional
   level of protection against leaking of the details of the push
   message subscription.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Creating%20a%20Restricted%20Push%20Message%20Subscription"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Creating a Restricted Push Message Subscription</span>

   A user agent that wishes to create a restricted subscription includes
   the public key of the application server when requesting the creation
   of a push message subscription.  This restricts use of the resulting
   subscription to application servers that are able to provide a valid
   JWT signed by the corresponding private key.

   The user agent then adds the public key to the request to create a
   push message subscription.  The push message subscription request is
   extended to include a body.  The body of the request is a JSON object
   as described in [<a href="./rfc7159" title='"The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format"'>RFC7159</a>].  The user agent adds a "vapid" member to
   this JSON object that contains a public key on the P-256 curve,
   encoded in the uncompressed form [<a href="#ref-X9.62" title='"Public Key Cryptography for the Financial Services Industry: the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>X9.62</a>] and base64url encoded

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Using%20Restricted%20Subscriptions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Using Restricted Subscriptions</span>

   When a push message subscription has been restricted to an
   application server, the request for push message delivery MUST
   include a JWT signed by the private key that corresponds to the
   public key used when creating the subscription.

   A push service MUST reject a message sent to a restricted push
   message subscription if that message includes no "vapid"
   authentication or invalid "vapid" authentication.  A 401
   (Unauthorized) status code might be used if the authentication is
   absent; a 403 (Forbidden) status code might be used if authentication
   is invalid.

   "vapid" authentication is invalid if:

   o  either the authentication token or public key is not included in
      the request,

   o  the signature on the JWT cannot be successfully verified using the
      included public key,

   o  the current time is later than the time identified in the "exp"
      (Expiry) claim or more than 24 hours before the expiry time,

   o  the origin of the push resource is not included in the "aud"
      (Audience) claim, or

   o  the public key used to sign the JWT doesn't match the one that was
      included in the creation of the push message subscription.

   A push service MUST NOT forward the JWT or public key to the user
   agent when delivering the push message.

   An application server that needs to replace its signing key needs to
   request the creation of a new subscription by the user agent that is
   restricted to the updated key.  Application servers need to remember
   the key that was used when requesting the creation of a subscription.

   This authentication scheme is vulnerable to replay attacks if an
   attacker can acquire a valid JWT.  Sending requests using HTTPS as
   required by [<a href="./rfc8030" title='"Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push"'>RFC8030</a>] provides confidentiality.  Additionally,
   applying narrow limits to the period over which a replayable token
   can be reused limits the potential value of a stolen token to an
   attacker and can increase the difficulty of stealing a token.

   An application server might offer falsified contact information.  The
   application server asserts its email address or contact URI without
   any evidence to support the claim.  A push service operator cannot
   use the presence of unvalidated contact information as input to any
   security-critical decision-making process.

   Validation of a signature on the JWT requires a non-trivial amount of
   computation.  For something that might be used to identify legitimate
   requests under denial-of-service attack conditions, this is not
   ideal.  Application servers are therefore encouraged to reuse tokens,
   which permits the push service to cache the results of signature
   validation.

   An application server that changes its signing key breaks linkability
   between push messages that it sends under different keys.  A push
   service that relies on a consistent identity for application servers
   might categorize requests made with new keys differently.  Gradual
   migration to a new signing key reduces the chances that requests that
   use the new key will be categorized as abusive.

   This document creates a "VAPID Authentication Scheme Parameters"

   The registry operates on the "Specification Required" policy
