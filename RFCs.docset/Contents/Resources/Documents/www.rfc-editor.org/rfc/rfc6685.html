   IODEF extensions via class extension through AdditionalData and
   RecordItem elements, per <a href="./rfc5070#section-5.2">Section 5.2 of [RFC5070]</a>, generally register
   their namespaces and schemas with the IANA XML Namespace registry at
   <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/ns.html">http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/ns.html</a> and the IANA XML
   Schema registry at
   <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html">http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html</a>,
   respectively [<a href="./rfc3688" title='"The IETF XML Registry"'>RFC3688</a>].

   In addition to schema reviews required by IANA, these registry
   requests should be accompanied by a review by IODEF experts to ensure
   the specified AdditionalData and/or RecordItem contents are
   compatible with IODEF and with other existing IODEF extensions.  This
   document specifies that review.

   Changes to the XML Schema registry for schema names beginning with
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef" are subject to an additional IODEF
   Expert Review [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>] for IODEF correctness and appropriateness.

   The IODEF expert(s) for these reviews will be designated by the IETF
   Security Area Directors.
