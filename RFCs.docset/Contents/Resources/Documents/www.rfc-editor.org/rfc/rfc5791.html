   [<a id="ref-RFC2731">RFC2731</a>] defines "Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML".  Newer
   specifications published by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
   (<a href="http://dublincore.org/">http://dublincore.org/</a>) over the last decade, in particular
   "Expressing Dublin Core metadata using HTML/XHTML meta and link
   elements" ([<a href="#ref-DC-HTML" title='"Expressing Dublin Core metadata using HTML/XHTML meta and link elements"'>DC-HTML</a>]), have obsoleted this work.

      Note: Implementers of <a href="./rfc2731">RFC 2731</a> should note that DC-HTML introduces
      a new requirement with respect to the use of the "head" element's
      "profile" attribute.

   This document is of administrative nature only and therefore there
   are no security relations related to it.
