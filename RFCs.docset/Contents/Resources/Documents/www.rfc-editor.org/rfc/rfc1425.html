Status of this Memo

   This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Abstract"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Abstract</span>

   This memo defines a framework for extending the SMTP service by
   defining a means whereby a server SMTP can inform a client SMTP as to
   the service extensions it supports. Standard extensions to the SMTP
   service are registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA).  This framework does not require modification of existing
   SMTP clients or servers unless the features of the service extensions
   are to be requested or provided.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>1</a>] has provided a stable,
   effective basis for the relay function of message transfer agents.
   Although a decade old, SMTP has proven remarkably resilient.
   Nevertheless, the need for a number of protocol extensions has become
   evident. Rather than describing these extensions as separate and
   haphazard entities, this document enhances SMTP in a straightforward
   fashion that provides a framework in which all future extensions can
   be built in a single consistent way.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Framework%20for%20SMTP%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Framework for SMTP Extensions</span>

   For the purpose of service extensions to SMTP, SMTP relays a mail
   object containing an envelope and a content.



<span class="grey">Klensin, Freed, Rose, Stefferud &amp; Crocker                       [Page 1]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1425">RFC 1425</a>                SMTP Service Extensions            February 1993</span>


          (1)  The SMTP envelope is straightforward, and is sent as a
               series of SMTP protocol units: it consists of an
               originator address (to which error reports should be
               directed); a delivery mode (e.g., deliver to recipient
               mailboxes); and, one or more recipient addresses.

          (2)  The SMTP content is sent in the SMTP DATA protocol unit
               and has two parts: the headers and the body. The headers
               form a collection of field/value pairs structured
               according to <a href="./rfc822">RFC 822</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>2</a>], whilst the body, if structured,
               is defined according to MIME [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"'>3</a>]. The content is textual
               in nature, expressed using the US ASCII repertoire (ANSI
               X3.4-1986). Although extensions (such as MIME) may relax
               this restriction for the content body, the content
               headers are always encoded using the US ASCII repertoire.
               The algorithm defined in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Representation of Non-ASCII Text in Internet Message Headers"'>4</a>] is used to represent header
               values outside the US ASCII repertoire, whilst still
               encoding them using the US ASCII repertoire.

   Although SMTP is widely and robustly deployed, some parts of the
   Internet community might wish to extend the SMTP service.  This memo
   defines a means whereby both an extended SMTP client and server may
   recognize each other as such and the server can inform the client as
   to the service extensions that it supports.

   It must be emphasized that any extension to the SMTP service should
   not be considered lightly. SMTP's strength comes primarily from its
   simplicity.  Experience with many protocols has shown that:

               protocols with few options tend towards ubiquity, whilst
               protocols with many options tend towards obscurity.

   This means that each and every extension, regardless of its benefits,
   must be carefully scrutinized with respect to its implementation,
   deployment, and interoperability costs. In many cases, the cost of
   extending the SMTP service will likely outweigh the benefit.

   Given this environment, the framework for the extensions described in
   this memo consists of:

          (1)  a new SMTP command (<a href="#section-4">section 4</a>)

          (2)  a registry of SMTP service extensions (<a href="#section-5">section 5</a>)

          (3)  additional parameters to the SMTP MAIL FROM and RCPT TO
               commands (<a href="#section-6">section 6</a>).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1425">RFC 1425</a>                SMTP Service Extensions            February 1993</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20EHLO%20command"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The EHLO command</span>

   A client SMTP supporting SMTP service extensions should start an SMTP
   session by issuing the EHLO command instead of the HELO command. If
   the SMTP server supports the SMTP service extensions it will give a
   successful response (see <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>), a failure response (see 4.2),
   or an error response (4.3). If the SMTP server does not support any
   SMTP service extensions it will generate an error response (see
   <a href="#section-4.4">section 4.4</a>).

   The syntax for this command, using the ABNF notation of [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>2</a>], is:

               ehlo-cmd ::= "EHLO" SP domain CR LF

   If successful, the server SMTP responds with code 250.  On failure,
   the server SMTP responds with code 550.  On error, the server SMTP
   responds with one of codes 500, 501, 502, 504, or 421.

   This command is issued instead of the HELO command, and may be issued
   at any time that a HELO command would be appropriate.  That is, if
   the EHLO command is issued, and a successful response is returned,
   then a subsequent HELO or EHLO command will result in the server SMTP
   replying with code 503.  A client SMTP must not cache any information
   returned if the EHLO command succeeds. That is, a client SMTP must
   issue the EHLO command at the start of each SMTP session if
   information about extended facilities is needed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Successful%20response"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Successful response</span>

   If the server SMTP implements and is able to perform the EHLO
   command, it will return code 250.  This indicates that both the
   server and client SMTP are in the initial state, that is, there is no
   transaction in progress and all state tables and buffers are cleared.

   Normally, this response will be a multiline reply. Each line of the
   response contains a keyword and, optionally, one or more parameters.
   The syntax for a positive response, using the ABNF notation of [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>2</a>],
   is:

                        / (    "250-"   domain [ SP greeting ] CR LF

         ehlo-param   ::= 1*&lt;any CHAR excluding SP and all
                             control characters (US ASCII 0-31
                             inclusive)&gt;

         ALPHA        ::= &lt;any one of the 52 alphabetic characters
                           (A through Z in upper case, and,
                            a through z in lower case)&gt;

         DIGIT        ::= &lt;any one of the 10 numeric characters
                           (0 through 9)&gt;

         CR           ::= &lt;the carriage-return character
                           (ASCII decimal code 13)&gt;
         LF           ::= &lt;the line-feed character
                           (ASCII decimal code 10)&gt;
         SP           ::= &lt;the space character
                           (ASCII decimal code 32)&gt;

   Although EHLO keywords may be specified in upper, lower, or mixed
   case, they must always be recognized and processed in a case-
   insensitive manner. This is simply an extension of practices begun in
   <a href="./rfc821">RFC 821</a>.

   The IANA maintains a registry of standard SMTP service extensions.
   Associated with each such extension is a corresponding EHLO keyword
   value. Each service extension registered with the IANA is defined by
   a standards-track RFC, and such a definition includes:

          (1)  the textual name of the SMTP service extension;

          (2)  the EHLO keyword value associated with the extension;

          (3)  the syntax and possible values of parameters associated
               with the EHLO keyword value;




<span class="grey">Klensin, Freed, Rose, Stefferud &amp; Crocker                       [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1425">RFC 1425</a>                SMTP Service Extensions            February 1993</span>


          (4)  any additional SMTP verbs associated with the extension
               (additional verbs will usually be, but are not required
               to be, the same as the EHLO keyword value);

          (5)  any new parameters the extension associates with the MAIL
               FROM or RCPT TO verbs; and,

          (6)  how support for the extension affects the behavior of a
               server and client SMTP.

   In addition, any EHLO keyword value that starts with an upper or
   lower case "X" refers to a local SMTP service extension, which is
   used through bilateral, rather than standardized, agreement. Keywords
   beginning with "X" may not be used in a registered service extension.

   Any keyword values presented in the EHLO response that do not begin
   with "X" must correspond to an SMTP service extension registered with
   IANA.  A conforming server must not offer non "X" prefixed keyword
   values that are not described in a registered extension.

   Additional verbs are bound by the same rules as EHLO keywords;
   specifically, verbs begining with "X" are local extensions that may
   not be standardized and verbs not beginning with "X" must always be
   registered.

   If for some reason the server SMTP is unable to list the service
   extensions it supports, it will return code 554.

   In the case of a failure response, the client SMTP should issue
   either the HELO or QUIT command.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20Error%20responses%20from%20extended%20servers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Error responses from extended servers</span>

   If the server SMTP recognizes the EHLO command, but the command
   argument is unacceptable, it will return code 501.

   If the server SMTP recognizes, but does not implement, the EHLO
   command, it will return code 502.

   If the server SMTP determines that the SMTP service is no longer
   available (e.g., due to imminent system shutdown), it will return
   code 421.

   In the case of any error response, the client SMTP should issue
   either the HELO or QUIT command.

   A server SMTP that conforms to <a href="./rfc821">RFC 821</a> but does not support the
   extensions specified here will not recognize the EHLO command and
   will consequently return code 500, as specified in <a href="./rfc821">RFC 821</a>.

   The IANA's initial registry of SMTP service extensions consists of
   these entries:

   which correspond to those SMTP commands which are defined as optional
   in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support"'>5</a>].  (The mandatory SMTP commands, according to [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support"'>5</a>], are HELO,

   It is recognized that several of the extensions planned for SMTP will
   make use of additional parameters associated with the MAIL FROM and
   RCPT TO command. The syntax for these commands, again using the ABNF
   notation of [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>2</a>] as well as underlying definitions from [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>1</a>], is:

   If the server SMTP does not recognize or cannot implement one or more
   of the parameters associated with a particular MAIL FROM or RCPT TO
   command, it will return code 555.

   If for some reason the server is temporarily unable to accomodate one
   or more of the parameters associated with a MAIL FROM or RCPT TO
   command, and if the definition of the specific parameter does not
   mandate the use of another code, it should return code 455.

   Errors specific to particular parameters and their values will be
   specified in the parameter's defining RFC.

   SMTP servers are required to add an appropriate Received: field to
   the headers of all messages they receive. A "with ESMTP" clause
   should be added to this field when any SMTP service extensions are
   used. "ESMTP" is hereby added to the list of standard protocol names
   registered with IANA.

               indicates that the server SMTP also implements the SMTP
               EXPN and HELP commands, one standard service extension
               (8BITMIME), and two non-standard service extensions (XONE
               and XVRB).

          (3)  Finally, a server that does not support SMTP service
               extensions would act as follows:

               S: &lt;wait for connection on TCP port 25&gt;
               C: &lt;open connection to server&gt;
               S: 220 dbc.mtview.ca.us SMTP service ready
               C: EHLO ymir.claremont.edu
               S: 500 Command not recognized: EHLO
                ...

               The 500 response indicates that the server SMTP does not
               implement the extensions specified here.  The client
               would normally send RSET to reset the connection, and,
               after getting a successful reply, send a HELO command and
               proceed as specified in <a href="./rfc821">RFC 821</a>.

   This RFC does not discuss security issues and is not believed to
   raise any security issues not already endemic in electronic mail and
   present in fully conforming implementations of <a href="./rfc821">RFC-821</a>.  It does
   provide an announcement of server mail capabilities via the response
   to the EHLO verb. However, all information provided by announcement
   of any of the initial set of service extensions defined by this RFC
   can be readily deduced by selective probing of the verbs required to
   transport and deliver mail. The security implications of service
   extensions described in other RFCs should be dealt with in those
   RFCs.

   contributions of the entire IETF SMTP Working Group. Of course, none
   of the individuals are necessarily responsible for the combination of
   ideas represented here. Indeed, in some cases, the response to a
   particular criticism was to accept the problem identification but to
   include an entirely different solution from the one originally
   proposed.
