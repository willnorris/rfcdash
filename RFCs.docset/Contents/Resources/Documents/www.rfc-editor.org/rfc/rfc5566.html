Abstract

   The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI)
   provides a method for the dynamic exchange of encapsulation
   information and for the indication of encapsulation protocol types to
   be used for different next hops.  Currently, support for Generic
   Routing Encapsulation (GRE), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TPv3), and
   IP in IP tunnel types are defined.  This document defines support for
   IPsec tunnel types.

   The BGP [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier
   (SAFI) allows for the communication of tunnel information and for the
   association of this information to a BGP next hop.  The Encapsulation
   SAFI can be used to support the mapping of prefixes to next hops and
   tunnels of the same address family, IPv6 prefixes to IPv4 next hops
   and tunnels using [<a href="./rfc4798" title='"Connecting IPv6 Islands over IPv4 MPLS Using IPv6 Provider Edge Routers (6PE)"'>RFC4798</a>], and IPv4 prefixes to IPv6 next hops and
   tunnels using [<a href="./rfc5549" title='"Advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information with an IPv6 Next Hop"'>RFC5549</a>].  The Encapsulation SAFI can also be used to
   support the mapping of VPN prefixes to tunnels when VPN prefixes are
   advertised per [<a href="./rfc4364" title='"BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4364</a>] or [<a href="./rfc4659" title='"BGP-MPLS IP Virtual Private Network (VPN) Extension for IPv6 VPN"'>RFC4659</a>].  [<a href="./rfc5565" title='"Softwire Mesh Framework"'>RFC5565</a>] provides useful
   context for the use of the Encapsulation SAFI.

   The Encapsulation SAFI is defined in [<a href="./rfc5512" title='"The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute"'>RFC5512</a>].  [<a href="./rfc5512" title='"The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute"'>RFC5512</a>] also
   defines support for the GRE [<a href="./rfc2784" title='"Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)"'>RFC2784</a>], L2TPv3 [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>], and IP in IP
   [<a href="./rfc2003" title='"IP Encapsulation within IP"'>RFC2003</a>] tunnel types.  This document builds on [<a href="./rfc5512" title='"The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute"'>RFC5512</a>] and
   defines support for IPsec tunnels.  Support is defined for IP
   Authentication Header (AH) in tunnel mode [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>] and for IP
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) in tunnel mode [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>].  The
   IPsec architecture is defined in [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>].  Support for IP in IP
   [<a href="./rfc2003" title='"IP Encapsulation within IP"'>RFC2003</a>] and MPLS-in-IP [<a href="./rfc4023" title='"Encapsulating MPLS in IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)"'>RFC4023</a>] protected by IPsec Transport Mode
   is also defined.

   The Encapsulation Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
   Format is not modified by this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Tunnel%20Encapsulation%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Tunnel Encapsulation Types</span>

   Per [<a href="./rfc5512" title='"The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute"'>RFC5512</a>], tunnel type is indicated in the Tunnel Encapsulation
   attribute.  This document defines the following tunnel type values:

     - Transmit tunnel endpoint: Tunnel Type = 3

     - IPsec in Tunnel-mode: Tunnel Type = 4 [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>], [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>]

     - IP in IP Tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode: Tunnel Type = 5
       [<a href="./rfc2003" title='"IP Encapsulation within IP"'>RFC2003</a>], [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>]

     - MPLS-in-IP Tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode: Tunnel Type = 6
       [<a href="./rfc4023" title='"Encapsulating MPLS in IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)"'>RFC4023</a>]

       Note, see <a href="./rfc5512#section-4.3">SectionÂ 4.3 of [RFC5512]</a> for a discussion on the
       advertisement and use of multiple tunnel types.

       Note, the specification in [<a href="./rfc4023" title='"Encapsulating MPLS in IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)"'>RFC4023</a>] for MPLS-in-IP tunnels with
       IPsec Transport mode applies as well to IP in IP tunnels.

   This document does not specify the use of the sub-TLV types defined
   in [<a href="./rfc5512" title='"The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute"'>RFC5512</a>] with these tunnel types.  See below for the definition
   of a specific sub-TLV for use with the defined tunnel types.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Use%20of%20IPsec%20Tunnel%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Use of IPsec Tunnel Types</span>

   The IPsec tunnel types are defined above with the values 4, 5, and 6.
   If R1 is a BGP speaker that receives an Encapsulation SAFI update
   from another BGP speaker, R2, then if R1 has any data packets for
   which R2 is the BGP next hop, R1 MUST initiate an IPsec SA (security
   association) of the specified "tunnel type", and all such data
   packets MUST be sent through that SA.

   Let R1 and R2 be two BGP speakers that may send data packets through
   R3, such that the data packets from R1 and from R2 may be received by
   R3 over the same interface.  In this case, when R3 sends an
   Encapsulation SAFI that indicates an IPsec tunnel type to R2, then R3
   SHOULD also send an update specifying an Encapsulation SAFI with an
   IPsec tunnel type to R1.  That is, on a given interface, if IPsec is
   required for any data packets, it SHOULD be required for all.  This
   eliminates dependence on the IPsec selector mechanisms to correctly
   distinguish traffic that needs to be protected from traffic that does
   not.

   Security policy has the granularity of BGP speaker to BGP speaker.
   The required security policies must be configured into the BGP
   speakers.  Policies for each SA will typically be established using

   IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange) [<a href="./rfc4306" title='"Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol"'>RFC4306</a>], with either public-key or
   pre-shared key authentication.  The SA MAY also be configured via
   manual techniques.  Manual configuration specification and
   considerations are defined in [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>], [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>], and [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>]
   (and includes keys, Security Parameter Index (SPI) numbers, IPsec
   protocol, integrity/encryption algorithms, and sequence number mode).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20IPsec%20Tunnel%20Authenticator%20sub-TLV"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV</span>

   This document defines a new sub-TLV for use with the Tunnel
   Encapsulation attribute defined in [<a href="./rfc5512" title='"The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute"'>RFC5512</a>].  The new sub-TLV is
   referred to as the "IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV", and one or
   more of the sub-TLVs MAY be included in any Encapsulation SAFI NLRI
   [<a href="./rfc5512" title='"The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute"'>RFC5512</a>] indicating a tunnel type defined in this document.  Support
   for the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV MUST be implemented
   whenever the tunnel types defined in this document are implemented.
   However, its use is OPTIONAL, and is a matter of policy.

   The sub-TLV type of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV is 3.  The
   sub-TLV length is variable.  The structure of the sub-TLV is as
   follows:

     - Authenticator Type: two octets

       This document defines authenticator type 1, "SHA-1 hash of public
       key", as defined in <a href="./rfc4306#section-3.7">SectionÂ 3.7 of RFC 4306</a>.

     - Value: (variable)

       A value used to authenticate the BGP speaker that generated this
       NLRI.  The length of this field is not encoded explicitly, but
       can be calculated as (sub-TLV length - 2).

       In the case of authenticator type 1, this field contains the
       20-octet value of the hash.

   A BGP speaker that sends the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV with
   authenticator type 1 MUST be configured with a private key / public
   key pair, the public key being the key whose hash is sent in the
   value field of the sub-TLV.  The BGP speaker MUST either (a) be able
   to generate a self-signed certificate for the public key, or else (b)
   be configured with a certificate for the public key.

   When the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV is used, it is highly
   RECOMMENDED that the integrity of the BGP session itself be
   protected.  This is usually done by using the TCP MD5 option
   [<a href="./rfc2385" title='"Protection of BGP Sessions via the TCP MD5 Signature Option"'>RFC2385</a>].

   If an IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV with authenticator type 1 is
   present in the Encapsulation SAFI update, then R1 (as defined above
   in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) MUST use IKEv2 [<a href="./rfc4306" title='"Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol"'>RFC4306</a>] to obtain a certificate from
   R2 (as defined above in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>), and R2 MUST send a certificate
   for the public key whose hash occurred in the value field of the
   IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV.  R1 MUST NOT attempt to establish
   an SA to R2 UNLESS the public key in the certificate hashes to the
   same value that occurs in one of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-
   TLVs.

   R2 MUST also perform the reciprocal processing.  Specifically, when
   establishing an SA from R1 and R1 has advertised the IPsec Tunnel
   Authenticator sub-TLV with authenticator type 1, R2 MUST use IKEv2
   [<a href="./rfc4306" title='"Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol"'>RFC4306</a>] to obtain a certificate from R1, and R1 MUST send a
   certificate for the public key whose hash occurred in the value field
   of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV.  R2 MUST NOT attempt to
   establish an SA to R1 UNLESS the public key in the certificate hashes
   to the same value that occurs in one of the IPsec Tunnel
   Authenticator sub-TLVs.

   Note that the "Transmit tunnel endpoint" tunnel type (value = 3) may
   be used by a BGP speaker that does not want to be the receiving
   endpoint of an IPsec tunnel but only the transmitting endpoint.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document uses IP-based tunnel technologies to support data plane
   transport.  Consequently, the security considerations of those tunnel
   technologies apply.  This document defines support for IPsec AH
   [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>] and ESP [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>].  The security considerations from those
   documents as well as [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>] apply to the data plane aspects of
   this document.

   As with [<a href="./rfc5512" title='"The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute"'>RFC5512</a>], any modification of the information that is used
   to form encapsulation headers, to choose a tunnel type, or to choose
   a particular tunnel for a particular payload type may lead to user
   data packets getting misrouted, misdelivered, and/or dropped.
   Misdelivery is less of an issue when IPsec is used, as such
   misdelivery is likely to result in a failure of authentication or
   decryption at the receiver.  Furthermore, in environments where
   authentication of BGP speakers is desired, the IPsec Tunnel
   Authenticator sub-TLV defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> may be used.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5566">RFC 5566</a>             BGP IPsec Tunnel Encapsulation            June 2009</span>


   More broadly, the security considerations for the transport of IP
   reachability information using BGP are discussed in [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc4272" title='"BGP Security Vulnerabilities Analysis"'>RFC4272</a>], and are equally applicable for the extensions described in
   this document.

   If the integrity of the BGP session is not itself protected, then an
   imposter could mount a denial-of-service attack by establishing
   numerous BGP sessions and forcing an IPsec SA to be created for each
   one.  However, as such an imposter could wreak havoc on the entire
   routing system, this particular sort of attack is probably not of any
   special importance.

   It should be noted that a BGP session may itself be transported over
   an IPsec tunnel.  Such IPsec tunnels can provide additional security
   to a BGP session.  The management of such IPsec tunnels is outside
   the scope of this document.
