     <span class="h1">Definition of Events for Channel-Oriented Telephony Signalling</span>

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo updates <a href="./rfc4733">RFC 4733</a> to add event codes for telephony signals
   used for channel-associated signalling when carried in the telephony
   event RTP payload.  It supersedes and adds to the original assignment
   of event codes for this purpose in <a href="./rfc2833#section-3.14">Section 3.14 of RFC 2833</a>.  As
   documented in <a href="./rfc4733#appendix-A">Appendix A of RFC 4733</a>, some of the <a href="./rfc2833">RFC 2833</a> events
   have been deprecated because their specification was ambiguous,
   erroneous, or redundant.  In fact, the degree of change from <a href="./rfc2833#section-3.14">Section</a>
   <a href="./rfc2833#section-3.14">3.14 of RFC 2833</a> is such that implementations of the present document
   will be fully backward compatible with <a href="./rfc2833">RFC 2833</a> implementations only
   in the case of full ABCD-bit signalling.  This document expands and
   improves the coverage of signalling systems compared to <a href="./rfc2833">RFC 2833</a>.

   This document extends the set of telephony events defined within the
   framework of <a href="./rfc4733">RFC 4733</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals"'>4</a>] to include signalling events that can
   appear on a circuit in the telephone network.  Most of these events
   correspond to signals within one of several channel-associated
   signalling systems still in use in the PSTN.

   Trunks (or circuits) in the PSTN are the media paths between
   telephone switches.  A succession of protocols have been developed
   using tones and electrical conditions on individual trunks to set up
   telephone calls using them.  The events defined in this document
   support an application where such PSTN signalling is carried between
   two gateways without being signalled in the IP network: the "RTP
   trunk" application.

   In the "RTP trunk" application, RTP is used to replace a normal
   circuit-switched trunk between two nodes.  This is particularly of
   interest in a telephone network that is still mostly
   circuit-switched.  In this case, each end of the RTP trunk encodes

   audio channels into the appropriate encoding, such as G.723.1 [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Speech coders : Dual rate speech coder for multimedia communications transmitting at 5.3 and 6.3 kbit/s"'>13</a>] or
   G.729 [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Coding of speech at 8 kbit/s using conjugate-structure algebraic-code-excited linear- prediction (CS-ACELP)"'>14</a>].  However, this encoding process destroys in-band
   signalling information that is carried using the least-significant
   bit ("robbed bit signalling") and may also interfere with in-band
   signalling tones, such as the MF (multi-frequency) digit tones.

   In a typical application, the gateways may exchange roles from one
   call to the next: they must be capable of either sending or receiving
   each implemented signal in Table 1.

   This document defines events related to four different signalling
   systems.  Three of these are based on the exchange of multi-frequency
   tones.  The fourth operates on digital trunks only, and makes use of
   low-order bits stolen from the encoded media.  In addition, this
   document defines tone events for supporting tasks such as continuity
   testing of the media path.

      Implementors are warned that the descriptions of signalling
      systems given below are incomplete.  They are provided to give
      context to the related event definitions, but omit many details
      important to implementation.

   Table 1 lists all of the events defined in this document.  As
   indicated in Table 8 (Appendix A) of <a href="./rfc4733">RFC 4733</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals"'>4</a>], use of some of the
   <a href="./rfc2833">RFC 2833</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones and Telephony Signals"'>11</a>] event codes has been deprecated because their
   specification was ambiguous, erroneous, or redundant.  In fact, the
   degree of change from <a href="./rfc2833#section-3.14">Section 3.14 of RFC 2833</a> is such that
   implementations of the present document will be fully backward
   compatible with <a href="./rfc2833">RFC 2833</a> implementations only in the case of full
   ABCD-bit signalling.  This document expands and improves the coverage
   of signalling systems compared to <a href="./rfc2833">RFC 2833</a>.

   Note that the IANA registry for telephony event codes was set up by
   <a href="./rfc4733">RFC 4733</a>, not by <a href="./rfc2833">RFC 2833</a>.  Thus, event code assignments originally
   made in <a href="./rfc2833">RFC 2833</a> appear in the registry only if reaffirmed in <a href="./rfc4733">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc4733">4733</a> or an update to <a href="./rfc4733">RFC 4733</a>, such as the present document.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5244">RFC 5244</a>           Channel-Oriented Signalling Events          June 2008</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Signalling%20System%20No.%205"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Signalling System No. 5</span>

   Signalling System No. 5 (SS No. 5) is defined in ITU-T
   Recommendations Q.140 through Q.180 [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Specifications for signalling system no. 5"'>5</a>].  It has two systems of
   signals: "line" signalling to acquire and release the trunk, and
   "register" signalling to pass digits forward from one switch to the
   next.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.1.%20%20Signalling%20System%20No.%205%20Line%20Signals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.1" id="section-2.1.1">2.1.1</a>.  Signalling System No. 5 Line Signals</span>

   No. 5 line signalling uses tones at two frequencies: 2400 and 2600
   Hz.  The tones are used singly for most signals, but together for the
   Clear-forward and Release-guard.  (This reduces the chance of an
   accidental call release due to carried media content duplicating one
   of the frequencies.)  The specific signal indicated by a tone depends
   on the stage of call set-up at which it is applied.

   No events are defined in support of No. 5 line signalling.  However,
   implementations MAY use the AB bit events described in <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>
   and shown in Table 1 to propagate SS No. 5 line signals.  If they do
   so, they MUST use the following mappings.  These mappings are based
   on an underlying mapping equating A=0 to presence of 2400 Hz signal
   and B=0 to presence of 2600 Hz signal in the indicated direction.

   o  both 2400 and 2600 Hz present: event code 208;

   o  2400 Hz present: event code 210;

   o  2600 Hz present: event code 209;

   o  neither signal present: event code 211.

   The initial event report for each signal SHOULD be generated as soon
   as the signal is recognized, and in any case no later than the time
   of recognition as indicated in ITU-T Recommendation Q.141, Table 1
   (i.e., 40 ms for "seizing" and "proceed-to-send", 125 ms for all
   other signals).  The packetization interval following the initial
   report SHOULD be chosen with considerations of reliable transmission
   given first priority.  Note that the receiver must supply its own
   volume values for converting these events back to tones.  Moreover,
   the receiver MAY extend the playout of "seizing" until it has
   received the first report of a KP event (see below), so that it has
   better control of the interval between ending of the seizing signal
   and start of KP playout.

      The KP has to be sent beginning 80 +/- 20 ms after the SS No. 5
      "seizing" signal has stopped.

   No. 5 register signalling uses pairs of tones to convey digits and
   signals framing them.  The tone combinations and corresponding
   signals are shown in the Table 2.  All signals except KP1 and KP2 are
   sent for a duration of 55 ms.  KP1 and KP2 are sent for a duration of
   100 ms.  Inter-signal pauses are always 55 ms.

                    Table 2: SS No. 5 Register Signals

   The KP signals are used to indicate the start of digit signalling.
   KP1 indicates a call expected to terminate in a national network
   served by the switch to which the signalling is being sent.  KP2
   indicates a call that is expected to transit through the switch to
   which the signalling is being sent, to another international
   exchange.  The end of digit signalling is indicated by the ST signal.
   Code 11 or Code 12 following a country code (and possibly another
   digit) indicates a call to be directed to an operator position in the
   destination country.  A Code 12 may be followed by other digits
   indicating a particular operator to whom the call is to be directed.

   Implementations using the telephone-events payload to carry SS No. 5
   register signalling MUST use the following events from Table 1 to
   convey the register signals shown in Table 2:

   o  event code 128 to convey Digit 0;

   o  event codes 129-137 to convey Digits 1 through 9, respectively;

   o  event code 123 to convey Code 11;

   Signalling System R1 is mainly used in North America, as is the more
   common variant designated simply as "MF".  R1 is defined in ITU-T
   Recommendations Q.310-Q.332 [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Specifications of Signalling System R1"'>6</a>], while MF is defined in [<a href="#ref-9" title='"LSSGR: signalling for Analog Interfaces"'>9</a>].

   Like SS No. 5, R1/MF has both line and register signals.  The line
   signals (not counting Busy and Reorder) are implemented on analog
   trunks through the application of a 2600 Hz tone, and on digital
   trunks by using ABCD signalling.  Interpretation of the line signals
   is state-dependent (as with SS No. 5).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.1.%20%20Signalling%20System%20R1%20Line%20Signals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" id="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  Signalling System R1 Line Signals</span>

   In accordance with Table 1/Q.311, implementations MAY use the A bit
   events described in <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a> and shown in Table 1 to propagate R1
   line signals.  If they do so, they MUST use the following mappings.
   These mappings are based on an underlying mapping equating A=0 to the
   presence of a 2600 Hz signal in the indicated direction and A=1 to
   the absence of that signal.

   o  2600 Hz present: event code 206;

   o  no signal present: event code 207.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.2.%20%20Signalling%20System%20R1%20Register%20Signals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2" id="section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  Signalling System R1 Register Signals</span>

   R1 has a signal capacity of 15 codes for forward inter-register
   signals but no backward inter-register signals.  Each code or digit
   is transmitted by a tone pair from a set of 6 frequencies.  The R1
   register signals consist of KP, ST, and the digits "0" through "9".
   The frequencies allotted to the signals are shown in Table 3.  Note

   similarly named SS No. 5 register signals, except that KP uses the
   frequency combination corresponding to KP1 in SS No. 5.  Table 3 also
   shows additional signals used in North American practice: KP', KP2P,
   KP3P, STP or ST', ST2P, and ST3P [<a href="#ref-9" title='"LSSGR: signalling for Analog Interfaces"'>9</a>].

                      Table 3: R1/MF Register Signals

   Implementations using the telephone-events payload to carry North
   American R1 register signalling MUST use the following events from
   Table 1 to convey the register signals shown in Table 3:

   o  event code 128 to convey Digit 0;

   o  event codes 129-137 to convey Digits 1 through 9, respectively;

   o  event code 123 to convey KP3P or ST3P;

   o  event code 124 to convey KP;

   o  event code 125 to convey KP2P or ST2P;

   o  event code 126 to convey ST;

   o  event code 127 to convey KP' or STP.

      As with the original telephony signals, the receiver interprets
      codes 123, 125, and 127 as KPx or STx signals based on their
      position in the signalling sequence.

   Unlike SS No. 5, R1 allows a large tolerance for the time of onset of
   register signalling following the recognition of start-dialling line
   signal.  This means that sending implementations MAY wait to send a
   KP event report until the KP has completed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Signalling%20System%20R2"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Signalling System R2</span>

   The International Signalling System R2 is described in ITU-T
   Recommendations Q.400-Q.490 [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Specifications of Signalling System R2"'>7</a>], but there are many national
   variants.  R2 line signals are continuous, out-of-band, link by link,
   and channel associated.  R2 (inter)register signals are multi-
   frequency, compelled, in-band, end-to-end, and also channel
   associated.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.1.%20%20Signalling%20System%20R2%20Line%20Signals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.1" id="section-2.3.1">2.3.1</a>.  Signalling System R2 Line Signals</span>

   R2 line signals may be analog, one-bit digital using the A bit in the
   16th channel, or digital using both A and B bits.  Implementations
   MAY use the A bit or AB bit events described in <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a> and shown
   in Table 1 to propagate these signals.  If they do so, they MUST use
   the following mappings.

   1.  For the analog R2 line signals shown in Table 1 of ITU-T
       Recommendation Q.411, implementations MUST map as follows.  This
       mapping is based on an underlying mapping of A bit = 0 when tone
       is present.

      *  event code 206 (Table 1) is used to indicate the Q.411 "tone-
         on" condition;

      *  event code 207 (Table 1), is used to indicate the Q.411 "tone-
         off" condition.

   2.  The digital R2 line signals, as described by ITU-T Recommendation
       Q.421, are carried in two bits, A and B.  The mapping between A
       and B bit values and event codes SHALL be the same in both
       directions and SHALL follow the principles for A and B bit
       mapping specified in <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.2.%20%20Signalling%20System%20R2%20Register%20Signals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.2" id="section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a>.  Signalling System R2 Register Signals</span>

   In R2 signalling, the signalling sequence is initiated from the
   outgoing exchange by sending a line "seizing" signal.  After the line
   "seizing" signal (and "seizing acknowledgment" signal in R2D), the
   signalling sequence continues using MF register signals.  ITU-T
   Recommendation Q.441 classifies the forward MF register signals





<span class="grey">Schulzrinne &amp; Taylor        Standards Track                    [Page 10]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-11"></span>

   (upper frequencies) into Groups I and II, the backward MF register
   signals (lower frequencies) into Groups A and B.  These groups are
   significant with respect both to what sort of information they convey
   and where they can occur in the signalling sequence.

   The tones used in R2 register signalling are combinations of two out
   of six frequencies.  National versions may be reduced to 10 signals
   (two out of five frequencies) or 6 signals (two out of four
   frequencies).

   R2 register signalling is a compelled tone signalling protocol,
   meaning that one tone is played until an "acknowledgment or directive
   for the next tone" is received that indicates that the original tone
   should cease.  A R2 forward register signal is acknowledged by a
   backward signal.  A backward signal is acknowledged by the end of the
   forward signal.  In exceptional circumstances specified in ITU-T Rec.
   Q.442, the downstream entity may send backward signals autonomously
   rather than in response to specific forward signals.

   In R2 signalling, the signalling sequence is initiated from the
   outgoing exchange by sending a forward Group I signal.  The first
   forward signal is typically the first digit of the called number.
   The incoming exchange typically replies with a backward Group A-1
   indicating to the outgoing exchange to send the next digit of the
   called number.

   The tones have meaning; however, the meaning varies depending on
   where the tone occurs in the signalling.  The meaning may also depend
   on the country.  Thus, to avoid an unmanageable number of events,
   this document simply provides means to indicate the 15 forward and 15
   backward MF R2 tones (i.e., using event codes 176-190 and 191-205,
   respectively, as shown in Table 1).  The frequency pairs for these
   tones are shown in Table 4 and Table 5.

   Note that a naive strategy for onward relay of R2 inter-register
   signals may result in unacceptably long call setup times and timeouts
   when the call passes through several exchanges as well as a gateway
   before terminating.  Several strategies are available for speeding up
   the transfer of signalling information across a given relay point.
   In the worst case, the relay point has to act as an exchange,
   terminating the signalling on one side and reoriginating the call on
   the other.

   ABCD is a 4-bit signalling system used by digital trunks, where A, B,
   C, and D are the designations of the individual bits.  Signalling may
   be 16-state (all four bits used), 4-state (A and B bits used), or
   2-state (A-bit only used).  ABCD signalling events are all mutually
   exclusive states.  The most recent state transition determines the
   current state.






<span class="grey">Schulzrinne &amp; Taylor        Standards Track                    [Page 12]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5244">RFC 5244</a>           Channel-Oriented Signalling Events          June 2008</span>


   When using Extended Super Frame (ESF) T1 framing, signalling
   information is sent as robbed bits in frames 6, 12, 18, and 24.  A D4
   superframe only transmits 4-state signalling with A and B bits.  On
   the Conference of European Postal and Telecommunications (CEPT) E1
   frame, all signalling is carried in timeslot 16, and two channels of
   16-state (ABCD) signalling are sent per frame.  ITU-T Recommendation
   G.704 [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Synchronous frame structures used at 1544, 6312, 2048, 8448 and 44 736 kbit/s hierarchical levels"'>10</a>] gives the details of ABCD bit placement within the various
   framing arrangements.

   The meaning of ABCD signals varies with the application.  One example
   of a specification of ABCD signalling codes is T1.403.02 [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Network and Customer Installation Interfaces -- DS1 Robbed-Bit signalling State Definitions"'>16</a>], which
   reflects North American practice for "loop" signalling as opposed to
   the trunk signalling discussed in previous sections.

   Since ABCD information is a state rather than a changing signal,
   implementations SHOULD use the following triple-redundancy mechanism,
   similar to the one specified in ITU-T Rec. I.366.2 [<a href="#ref-15" title='"AAL type 2 service specific convergence sublayer for trunking"'>15</a>], Annex L.  At
   the time of a transition, the same ABCD information is sent 3 times
   at an interval of 5 ms.  If another transition occurs during this
   time, then this continues.  After a period of no change, the ABCD
   information is sent every 5 seconds.

   As shown in Table 1, the 16 possible states are represented by event
   codes 144 to 159, respectively.  Implementations using these event
   codes MUST map them to and from the ABCD information based on the
   following principles:

   1.  State numbers are derived from the used subset of ABCD bits by
       treating them as a single binary number, where the A bit is the
       high-order bit.

   2.  State numbers map to event codes by order of increasing value
       (i.e., state number 0 maps to event code 144, ..., state number
       15 maps to event code 159).

   If only the A and B bits are being used, then the mapping to event
   codes shall be as follows:

   o  A=0, B=0 maps to event code 208;

   o  A=0, B=1 maps to event code 209;

   o  A=1, B=0 maps to event code 210;

   o  A=1, B=1 maps to event code 211;

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5244">RFC 5244</a>           Channel-Oriented Signalling Events          June 2008</span>


   Finally, if only the A bit is used,

   o  A = 0 maps to event code 206;

   o  A = 1 maps to event code 207;

      Separate event codes are assigned to A-bit and AB-bit signalling
      because, as indicated in Rec. G.704 [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Synchronous frame structures used at 1544, 6312, 2048, 8448 and 44 736 kbit/s hierarchical levels"'>10</a>], when the B, C, and D
      bits are unused, their default values differ between transmission
      systems.  By specifying codes for only the used bits, this memo
      allows the receiving gateway to fill in the remaining bits
      according to local configuration.

   Continuity tones are used for testing circuit continuity during call
   setup.  Two basic procedures are used.  In international practice,
   clause 7 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.724 [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Telephone user part signalling procedures"'>8</a>] describes a procedure
   applicable to four-wire trunk circuits, where a single 2000 +/- 20 Hz
   check-tone is transmitted from the initiating telephone switch.  The
   remote switch sets up a loopback, and the continuity check passes if
   the sending switch can detect the tone on the return path.  Clause 8
   of Q.724 describes the procedure for two-wire trunk circuits.  The
   two-wire procedure involves two tones: a 2000 Hz tone sent in the
   forward direction and a 1780 +/- 20 Hz tone sent in response.

   Note that implementations often send a slightly different check-tone,
   e.g., 2010 Hz, because of undesirable aliasing properties of 2000 Hz.

   If implementations use the telephone-events payload type to propagate
   continuity check-tones, they MUST map these tones to event codes as
   follows:

   o  For four-wire continuity testing, the 2000 Hz check-tone is mapped
      to event code 121.

   o  For two-wire continuity testing, the initial 2000 Hz check-tone Hz
      tone is mapped to event code 121.  The 1780 Hz continuity
      verify-tone is mapped to event code 122.

   This event indicates that the trunk is unavailable for service.  The
   length of the downtime is indicated in the duration field.  The
   duration field is set to a value that allows adequate granularity in
   describing downtime.  A value of 1 second is RECOMMENDED.  When the

   trunk becomes unavailable, this event is sent with the same timestamp
   three times at an interval of 20 ms.  If the trunk persists in the
   unavailable state at the end of the indicated duration, then the
   event is retransmitted, preferably with the same redundancy scheme.

   Unavailability of the trunk might result from a failure or an
   administrative action.  This event is used in a stateless manner to
   synchronize trunk unavailability between equipment connected through
   provisioned RTP trunks.  It avoids the unnecessary consumption of
   bandwidth in sending a continuous stream of RTP packets with a fixed
   payload for the duration of the downtime, as would be required in
   certain E1-based applications.  In T1-based applications, trunk
   conditioning via the ABCD transitional events can be used instead.

   The metering pulse event may be used to transmit meter pulsing for
   billing purposes.  For background information, one possible reference
   is <a href="http://www.seg.co.uk/telecomm/automat3.htm">http://www.seg.co.uk/telecomm/automat3.htm</a>.  Since the metering
   pulse is a discrete event, each metering pulse event report MUST have
   both the 'M' and 'E' bits set.  Meter pulsing is normally transmitted
   by out-of-band means while conversation is in progress.  Senders MUST
   therefore be prepared to transmit both the telephone-event and audio
   payload types simultaneously.  Metering pulse events MUST be
   retransmitted as recommended in <a href="./rfc4733#section-2.5.1.4">Section 2.5.1.4 of RFC 4733</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals"'>4</a>].  It
   is RECOMMENDED that the retransmission interval be the lesser of 50
   ms and the pulsing rate but no less than audio packetization rate.

   The ability to adapt to congestion varies with the signalling system
   being used and also differs between line and register signals.

   With the specific exception of register signalling for S.S. No. 5 and
   R1/MF, the signals described in this document are fairly tolerant of
   lengthened durations, should these be necessary.  Thus in congested
   conditions, the sender may adapt by lengthening the reporting
   interval for the tones concerned.  At the receiving end, if a tone is
   being played out and an under-run occurs due to delayed or lost
   packets, it is best to continue playing the tone until the next
   packet arrives.  Interrupting a tone prematurely, with or without
   resumption, can cause the call setup attempt to fail, whereas
   extended playout just increases the call setup time.

   Register signalling for S.S. No. 5 and R1/MF is subject to time
   constraints.  Both the tone signals and the silent periods between
   them have specified durations and tolerances of the order of 5 to 10
   ms.  The durations of the individual tones are of the order of two to

   three packetization intervals (55/68 ms, with the initial KP lasting
   100 ms).  The critical requirement for transmission of the
   telephony-event payload is that the receiver knows which signal to
   play out at a given moment.  It is less important that the receiver
   receive timely notification of the end of each tone.  Rather, it
   should play out the sequence with the durations specified by the
   signalling standard instead of the actual durations reported.

   These considerations suggest that as soon as a register signal has
   been reliably identified, the sender should emit a report of that
   tone.  It should then provide an update within 5 ms for reliability
   and no more updates until reporting the end of the tone.

   Increasing the playout buffer at the receiver during register
   signalling will increase reliability.  This has to be weighed against
   the implied increase in call setup time.

   The events for which event codes are provided in this document relate
   directly to the setup, billing, and takedown of telephone calls.  As
   such, they are subject, using the terminology of <a href="./rfc3552">RFC 3552</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations"'>12</a>], to
   threats to both communications and system security.  The attacks of
   concern are:

   o  confidentiality violations (monitoring of calling and called
      numbers);

   o  establishment of unauthorized telephone connections through
      message insertion;

   o  hijacking of telephone connections through message insertion or
      man-in-the-middle modification of messages;

   o  denial of service to individual telephone calls through message
      insertion, modification, deletion, or delay.

   These attacks can be prevented by the use of appropriate
   confidentiality, authentication, or integrity protection.  If
   confidentiality, authentication, or integrity protection are needed,
   then Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>3</a>] SHOULD be used
   with automated key management.

   Additional security considerations are described in <a href="./rfc4733">RFC 4733</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals"'>4</a>].
