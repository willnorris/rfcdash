    <span class="h1">IPv4 Multicast over an IPv6 Multicast in Softwire Mesh Networks</span>

Abstract

   During the transition to IPv6, there are scenarios where a backbone
   network internally running one IP address family (referred to as the
   internal IP or I-IP family) connects client networks running another
   IP address family (referred to as the external IP or E-IP family).
   In such cases, the I-IP backbone needs to offer both unicast and
   multicast transit services to the client E-IP networks.

   This document describes a mechanism for supporting multicast across
   backbone networks where the I-IP and E-IP protocol families differ.
   The document focuses on the IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario, due to lack of
   real-world use cases for the IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   During the transition to IPv6, there are scenarios where a backbone
   network internally running one IP address family (referred to as the
   internal IP or I-IP family) connects client networks running another
   IP address family (referred to as the external IP or E-IP family).

   One solution is to leverage the multicast functions inherent in the
   I-IP backbone to efficiently forward client E-IP multicast packets
   inside an I-IP core tree.  The I-IP tree is rooted at one or more
   ingress Address Family Border Routers (AFBRs) [<a href="./rfc5565" title='"Softwire Mesh Framework"'>RFC5565</a>] and branches
   out to one or more egress AFBRs.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4925">RFC4925</a>] outlines the requirements for the softwire mesh scenario
   and includes support for multicast traffic.  It is likely that client
   E-IP multicast sources and receivers will reside in different client
   E-IP networks connected to an I-IP backbone network.  This requires
   the source-rooted or shared tree of the client E-IP to traverse the
   I-IP backbone network.

   This could be accomplished by reusing the multicast VPN (MVPN)
   approach outlined in [<a href="./rfc6513" title='"Multicast in MPLS/ BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6513</a>].  MVPN-like schemes can support the
   softwire mesh scenario and achieve a "many-to-one" mapping between
   the E-IP client multicast trees and the transit-core multicast trees.
   The advantage of this approach is that the number of trees in the
   I-IP backbone network scales less than linearly with the number of
   E-IP client trees.  Corporate enterprise networks, and by extension
   multicast VPNs, have been known to run applications that create too
   many (S,G) states, which are source-specific states related to a
   specified multicast group [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>] [<a href="./rfc7899" title='"Multicast VPN State Damping"'>RFC7899</a>].  Aggregation at the
   edge contains the (S,G) states for customers' VPNs and these need to
   be maintained by the network operator.  The disadvantage of this
   approach is the possibility of inefficient bandwidth and resource
   utilization when multicast packets are delivered to a receiving AFBR
   with no attached E-IP receivers.

   [<a id="ref-RFC8114">RFC8114</a>] provides a solution for delivering IPv4 multicast services
   over an IPv6 network, but it mainly focuses on the DS-Lite scenario
   [<a href="./rfc6333" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>], where IPv4 addresses assigned by a broadband service
   provider are shared among customers.  This document describes a
   detailed solution for the IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mesh scenario,
   where client networks run IPv4 and the backbone network runs IPv6.

   Internet-style multicast is somewhat different from the scenario in
   [<a href="./rfc8114" title='"Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over an IPv6 Multicast Network"'>RFC8114</a>] in that the trees are source-rooted and relatively sparse.
   The need for multicast aggregation at the edge (where many customer

   multicast trees are mapped to one or more backbone multicast trees)
   does not exist and to date has not been identified.  Thus, the need
   for alignment between the E-IP and I-IP multicast mechanisms emerges.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5565">RFC5565</a>] describes the "Softwire Mesh Framework".  This document
   provides a more detailed description of how one-to-one mapping
   schemes (<a href="./rfc5565#section-11.1">[RFC5565], SectionÂ 11.1</a>) for IPv4-over-IPv6 multicast can be
   achieved.

   Figure 1 shows an example of how a softwire mesh network can support
   multicast traffic.  A multicast source S is located in one E-IP
   client network, while candidate E-IP group receivers are located in
   the same or different E-IP client networks that all share a common
   I-IP transit network.  When E-IP sources and receivers are not local
   to each other, they can only communicate with each other through the
   I-IP core.  There may be several E-IP sources for a single multicast
   group residing in different client E-IP networks.  In the case of
   shared trees, the E-IP sources, receivers, and rendezvous points
   (RPs) might be located in different client E-IP networks.  In the
   simplest case, a single operator manages the resources of the I-IP
   core, although the inter-operator case is also possible and so not
   precluded.

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   o  Address Family Border Router (AFBR) - A router interconnecting two
      or more networks using different IP address families.
      Additionally, in the context of softwire mesh multicast, the AFBR
      runs E-IP and I-IP control planes to maintain E-IP and I-IP
      multicast states respectively and performs the appropriate
      encapsulation/decapsulation of client E-IP multicast packets for
      transport across the I-IP core.  An AFBR will act as a source and/
      or receiver in an I-IP multicast tree.

   o  Upstream AFBR: An AFBR that is closer to the source of a multicast
      data flow.

   o  Downstream AFBR: An AFBR that is closer to a receiver of a
      multicast data flow.

   o  I-IP (Internal IP): This refers to the IP address family that is
      supported by the core network.  In this document, the I-IP is
      IPv6.

   o  E-IP (External IP): This refers to the IP address family that is
      supported by the client network(s) attached to the I-IP transit
      core.  In this document, the E-IP is IPv4.

   o  I-IP core tree: A distribution tree rooted at one or more AFBR
      source nodes and branched out to one or more AFBR leaf nodes.  An
      I-IP core tree is built using standard IP or MPLS multicast
      signaling protocols (in this document, we focus on IP multicast)
      operating exclusively inside the I-IP core network.  An I-IP core
      tree is used to forward E-IP multicast packets belonging to E-IP
      trees across the I-IP core.  Another name for an I-IP core tree is
      multicast or multipoint softwire.

   o  E-IP client tree: A distribution tree rooted at one or more hosts
      or routers located inside a client E-IP network and branched out
      to one or more leaf nodes located in the same or different client
      E-IP networks.

   o  uPrefix64: The /96 unicast IPv6 prefix for constructing an
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 unicast address [<a href="./rfc8114" title='"Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over an IPv6 Multicast Network"'>RFC8114</a>].

      IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address [<a href="./rfc8114" title='"Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over an IPv6 Multicast Network"'>RFC8114</a>].

   o  PIMv4, PIMv6: Refer to [<a href="./rfc8114" title='"Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over an IPv6 Multicast Network"'>RFC8114</a>].

   o  Inter-AFBR signaling: A mechanism used by downstream AFBRs to send
      PIMv6 messages to the upstream AFBR.

   In Figure 2, the E-IP client networks run IPv4, and the I-IP core
   runs IPv6.

   Because of the much larger IPv6 group address space, the client E-IP
   tree can be mapped to a specific I-IP core tree.  This simplifies
   operations on the AFBR because it becomes possible to algorithmically

   map an IPv4 group/source address to an IPv6 group/source address and
   vice versa.

   The IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario is an emerging requirement as network
   operators build out native IPv6 backbone networks.  These networks
   support native IPv6 services and applications, but, in many cases,
   support for legacy IPv4 unicast and multicast services will also need
   to be accommodated.

   Routers in the client E-IP networks have routes to all other client
   E-IP networks.  Through PIMv4 messages, E-IP hosts and routers have
   discovered or learnt of IPv4 addresses that are in (S,G) or (*,G)
   state [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>].  Any I-IP multicast state instantiated in the core
   is referred to as (S',G') or (*,G') and is separated from E-IP
   multicast state.

   Suppose a downstream AFBR receives an E-IP PIM Join/Prune message
   from the E-IP network for either an (S,G) tree or a (*,G) tree.  The
   AFBR translates the PIMv4 message into a PIMv6 message with the
   latter being directed towards the I-IP IPv6 address of the upstream
   AFBR.  When the PIMv6 message arrives at the upstream AFBR, it is
   translated back into a PIMv4 message.  The result of these actions is
   the construction of E-IP trees and a corresponding I-IP tree in the
   I-IP network.  An example of the packet format and translation is
   provided in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   In this case, it is incumbent upon the AFBRs to perform PIM message
   conversions in the control plane and IP group address conversions or
   mappings in the data plane.  The AFBRs perform an algorithmic, one-
   to-one mapping of IPv4 to IPv6.

   A simple algorithmic mapping between IPv4 multicast group addresses
   and IPv6 group addresses is performed.  Figure 3 is provided as a
   reminder of the format:

   An IPv6 multicast prefix (mPrefix64) is provisioned on each AFBR.
   AFBRs will prepend the prefix to an IPv4 multicast group address when
   translating it to an IPv6 multicast group address.

   The construction of the mPrefix64 for Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)
   is the same as the construction of the mPrefix64 described in
   <a href="./rfc8114#section-5">SectionÂ 5 of [RFC8114]</a>.

   With this scheme, each IPv4 multicast address can be mapped to an
   IPv6 multicast address (with the assigned prefix), and each IPv6
   multicast address with the assigned prefix can be mapped to an IPv4
   multicast address.  The group address translation algorithm is
   specified in <a href="./rfc8114#section-5.2">SectionÂ 5.2 of [RFC8114]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.%20%20Source%20Address%20Mapping"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Source Address Mapping</span>

   There are two kinds of multicast: Any-Source Multicast (ASM) and SSM.
   Considering that the I-IP network and E-IP network may support
   different kinds of multicast, the source address translation rules
   needed to support all possible scenarios may become very complex.
   But since SSM can be implemented with a strict subset of the PIM-SM
   protocol mechanisms [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>], we can treat the I-IP core as SSM-only
   to make it as simple as possible.  There then remain only two
   scenarios to be discussed in detail:

   o  E-IP network supports SSM

      One possible way to make sure that the translated PIMv6 message
      reaches the upstream AFBR is to set S' to a virtual IPv6 address
      that leads to the upstream AFBR.  The unicast address translation
      should be achieved according to [<a href="./rfc6052" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>].

   o  E-IP network supports ASM

      The (S,G) source list entry and the (*,G) source list entry differ
      only in that the latter has both the WildCard (WC) and RPT bits of
      the Encoded-Source-Address set, while with the former, the bits
      are cleared.  (See <a href="./rfc7761#section-4.9.5.1">SectionÂ 4.9.5.1 of [RFC7761]</a>.)  As a result,
      the source list entries in (*,G) messages can be translated into
      source list entries in (S',G') messages by clearing both the WC
      and RPT bits at downstream AFBRs, and vice versa for the reverse
      translation at upstream AFBRs.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.4.%20%20Routing%20Mechanism"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" id="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Routing Mechanism</span>

   With mesh multicast, PIMv6 messages originating from a downstream
   AFBR need to be propagated to the correct upstream AFBR, and every
   AFBR needs the /96 prefix in the IPv4-embedded IPv6 source address
   format [<a href="./rfc6052" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>].

   To achieve this, every AFBR MUST announce the address of one of its
   E-IPv4 interfaces in the "v4" field [<a href="./rfc6052" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>] alongside the
   corresponding uPrefix46.  The announcement MUST be sent to the other
   AFBRs through Multiprotocol BGP (MBGP) [<a href="./rfc4760" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>RFC4760</a>].  Every uPrefix64
   that an AFBR announces MUST be unique.  "uPrefix64" is an IPv6
   prefix, and the distribution mechanism is the same as the traditional
   mesh unicast scenario.

   As the "v4" field is an E-IP address, and BGP messages are not
   tunneled through softwires or any other mechanism specified in
   [<a href="./rfc5565" title='"Softwire Mesh Framework"'>RFC5565</a>], AFBRs MUST be able to transport and encode/decode BGP
   messages that are carried over the I-IP, and whose Network Layer
   Reachability Information (NLRI) and next hop (NH) are of the E-IP
   address family.

   In this way, when a downstream AFBR receives an E-IP PIM (S,G)
   message, it can translate this message into (S',G') by looking up the
   IP address of the corresponding AFBR's E-IP interface.  Since the
   uPrefix64 of S' is unique and is known to every router in the I-IP
   network, the translated message will be forwarded to the
   corresponding upstream AFBR, and the upstream AFBR can translate the
   message back to (S,G).

   When a downstream AFBR receives an E-IP PIM (*,G) message, S' can be
   generated with the "source address" field set to * (the wildcard
   value).  The translated message will be forwarded to the
   corresponding upstream AFBR.  Every PIM router within a PIM domain
   MUST be able to map a particular multicast group address to the same
   RP when the source address is set to the wildcard value.  (See
   <a href="./rfc7761#section-4.7">SectionÂ 4.7 of [RFC7761]</a>.)  So, when the upstream AFBR checks the
   "source address" field of the message, it finds the IPv4 address of
   the RP and ascertains that this was originally a (*,G) message.  This
   is then translated back to the (*,G) message and processed.

   AFBRs are responsible for the functions detailed in the subsections
   that follow.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20E-IP%20%28%2A%2CG%29%20and%20%28S%2CG%29%20State%20Maintenance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  E-IP (*,G) and (S,G) State Maintenance</span>

   E-IP (*,G) and (S,G) state maintenance for an AFBR is the same as
   E-IP (*,G) and (S,G) state maintenance for a multicast AFTR (mAFTR)
   described in <a href="./rfc8114#section-7.2">SectionÂ 7.2 of [RFC8114]</a>.

   It is possible that the I-IP transit core runs another, non-transit,
   I-IP PIM-SSM instance.  Since the translated source address starts
   with the unique "Well-Known" prefix or the ISP-defined prefix that
   MUST NOT be used by another service provider, mesh multicast will not
   influence non-transit PIM-SSM multicast at all.  When an AFBR
   receives an I-IP (S',G') message, it MUST check S'.  If S' starts
   with the unique prefix, then the message is actually a translated
   E-IP (S,G) or (*,G) message, and the AFBR translates this message
   back to a PIMv4 message and processes it.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.3.%20%20E-IP%20%28S%2CG%2Crpt%29%20State%20Maintenance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" id="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  E-IP (S,G,rpt) State Maintenance</span>

   When an AFBR wishes to propagate a Join/Prune(S,G,rpt) message
   [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>] to an I-IP upstream router, the AFBR MUST operate as
   specified in Sections <a href="#section-6.5">6.5</a> and <a href="#section-6.6">6.6</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.4.%20%20Inter-AFBR%20Signaling"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.4" id="section-6.4">6.4</a>.  Inter-AFBR Signaling</span>

   Assume that one downstream AFBR has joined an RPT of (*,G) and a
   shortest path tree (SPT) of (S,G) and decided to perform an SPT
   switchover.  (See <a href="./rfc7761#section-4.2.1">SectionÂ 4.2.1 of [RFC7761]</a>.)  According to
   [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>], it should propagate a Prune(S,G,rpt) message along with
   the periodic Join(*,G) message upstream towards the RP.  However,
   routers in the I-IP transit core do not process (S,G,rpt) messages
   since the I-IP transit core is treated as SSM only.  As a result, the
   downstream AFBR is unable to prune S from this RPT, so it will
   receive two copies of the same data for (S,G).  In order to solve
   this problem, we introduce a new mechanism for downstream AFBRs to
   inform upstream AFBRs of pruning any given S from an RPT.

   When a downstream AFBR wishes to propagate an (S,G,rpt) message
   upstream, it SHOULD encapsulate the (S,G,rpt) message, then send the
   encapsulated unicast message to the corresponding upstream AFBR,
   which we call "RP'".




<span class="grey">Xu, et al.                   Standards Track                   [Page 10]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8638">RFC 8638</a>                 Softwire Mesh Multicast          September 2019</span>


   When RP' receives this encapsulated message, it MUST decapsulate the
   message as in the unicast scenario and retrieve the original
   (S,G,rpt) message.  The incoming interface of this message may be
   different from the outgoing interface that propagates multicast data
   to the corresponding downstream AFBR, and there may be other
   downstream AFBRs that need to receive multicast data for (S,G) from
   this incoming interface, so RP' should not simply process this
   message as specified in [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>] on the incoming interface.

   To solve this problem, we introduce an "interface agent" to process
   all the encapsulated (S,G,rpt) messages the upstream AFBR receives.
   The interface agent's RP' should prune S from the RPT of group G when
   no downstream AFBR is subscribed to receive multicast data for (S,G)
   along the RPT.

   In this way, we ensure that downstream AFBRs will not miss any
   multicast data that they need.  The cost of this is that multicast
   data for (S,G) will be duplicated along the RPT received by AFBRs
   affected by the SPT switchover, if at least one downstream AFBR
   exists that has not yet sent Prune(S,G,rpt) messages to the upstream
   AFBR.

   In certain deployment scenarios (e.g., if there is only a single
   downstream router), the interface agent function is not required.

   The mechanism used to achieve this is left to the implementation.

             Figure 4: Interface Agent Implementation Example

   Figure 4 shows an example of an interface agent implementation using
   UDP encapsulation.  The interface agent has two responsibilities: In
   the control plane, it should work as a real interface that has joined
   (*,G), representing all the I-IP interfaces that are outgoing
   interfaces of the (*,G) state machine, and it should process the
   (S,G,rpt) messages received from all the I-IP interfaces.

   The interface agent maintains downstream (S,G,rpt) state machines for
   every downstream AFBR, and it submits Prune(S,G,rpt) messages to the
   PIM-SM module only when every (S,G,rpt) state machine is in the
   Prune(P) or PruneTmp(P') state, which means that no downstream AFBR
   is subscribed to receive multicast data for (S,G) along the RPT of G.
   Once a (S,G,rpt) state machine changes to NoInfo (NI) state, which
   means that the corresponding downstream AFBR has switched to receive
   multicast data for (S,G) along the RPT again, the interface agent
   MUST send a Join(S,G,rpt) to the PIM-SM module immediately.





<span class="grey">Xu, et al.                   Standards Track                   [Page 12]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8638">RFC 8638</a>                 Softwire Mesh Multicast          September 2019</span>


   In the data plane, upon receiving a multicast data packet, the
   interface agent MUST encapsulate it at first, then propagate the
   encapsulated packet from every I-IP interface.

   NOTICE: It is possible that an E-IP neighbor of RP' has joined the
   RPT of G, so the per-interface state machine for receiving E-IP Join/
   Prune(S,G,rpt) messages should be preserved.

   After a new AFBR requests the receipt of traffic destined for a
   multicast group, it will receive all the data from the RPT at first.
   At this time, every downstream AFBR will receive multicast data from
   any source from this RPT, in spite of whether they have switched over
   to an SPT or not.

   To minimize this redundancy, it is recommended that every AFBR's
   SwitchToSptDesired(S,G) function employs the "switch on first packet"
   policy.  In this way, the delay in switchover to SPT is kept as small
   as possible, and after the moment that every AFBR has performed the
   SPT switchover for every S of group G, no data will be forwarded in
   the RPT of G, thus no more unnecessary duplication will be produced.

   In addition to Join or Prune, other message types exist, including
   Register, Register-Stop, Hello and Assert.  Register and Register-
   Stop messages are sent by unicast, while Hello and Assert messages
   are only used between directly linked routers to negotiate with each
   other.  It is not necessary to translate these for forwarding, thus
   the processing of these messages is out of scope for this document.

   In addition to states mentioned above, other states exist, including
   (*,*,RP) and I-IP (*,G') state.  Since we treat the I-IP core as SSM
   only, the maintenance of these states is out of scope for this

   mPrefix64-derived and uPrefix64-derived IPv6 addresses to form an
   IPv6 multicast packet.

   The encapsulation performed by an upstream AFBR will increase the
   size of packets.  As a result, the outgoing I-IP link MTU may not
   accommodate the larger packet size.  It is not always possible for
   core operators to increase the MTU of every link, thus source
   fragmentation after encapsulation and reassembling of encapsulated
   packets MUST be supported by AFBRs [<a href="./rfc5565" title='"Softwire Mesh Framework"'>RFC5565</a>].  Path MTU Discovery
   (PMTUD) [<a href="./rfc8201" title='"Path MTU Discovery for IP version 6"'>RFC8201</a>] SHOULD be enabled, and ICMPv6 packets MUST NOT be
   filtered in the I-IP network.  Fragmentation and tunnel configuration
   considerations are provided in <a href="./rfc5565#section-8">SectionÂ 8 of [RFC5565]</a>.  The detailed
   procedure can be referred in <a href="./rfc2473#section-7.2">SectionÂ 7.2 of [RFC2473]</a>.

   Because the PIM-SM specification is independent of the underlying
   unicast routing protocol, the packet format in <a href="./rfc7761#section-4.9">SectionÂ 4.9 of
   [RFC7761]</a> remains the same, except that the group address and source
   address MUST be translated when traversing an AFBR.

   For example, Figure 5 shows the register-stop message format in the
   IPv4 and IPv6 address families.

   Softwire mesh multicast encapsulation does not require the use of any
   one particular encapsulation mechanism.  Rather, it MUST accommodate
   a variety of different encapsulation mechanisms and allow the use of
   encapsulation mechanisms mentioned in [<a href="./rfc4925" title='"Softwire Problem Statement"'>RFC4925</a>].  Additionally, all
   of the AFBRs attached to the I-IP network MUST implement the same
   encapsulation mechanism and follow the requirements mentioned in
   <a href="./rfc5565#section-8">SectionÂ 8 of [RFC5565]</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" id="section-10">10</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security concerns raised in [<a href="./rfc4925" title='"Softwire Problem Statement"'>RFC4925</a>] and [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>] are
   applicable here.

   The additional workload associated with some schemes, such as
   interface agents, could be exploited by an attacker to perform a DDoS
   attack.

   Compared with [<a href="./rfc4925" title='"Softwire Problem Statement"'>RFC4925</a>], the security concerns should be considered
   more carefully: An attacker could potentially set up many multicast
   trees in the edge networks, causing too many multicast states in the
   core network.  To defend against these attacks, BGP policies SHOULD
   be carefully configured, e.g., AFBRs only accept Well-Known prefix
   advertisements from trusted peers.  Besides, cryptographic methods
   for authenticating BGP sessions [<a href="./rfc7454" title='"BGP Operations and Security"'>RFC7454</a>] could be used.
