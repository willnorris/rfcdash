Abstract

   SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) can cause unending SIP request
   routing loops because, as User Agent Clients, they can generate SIP
   requests with new Max-Forwards values.  This document discusses the
   difficulties associated with loop detection for B2BUAs and the
   requirements for them to prevent infinite loops.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   SIP provides a means of preventing infinite request forwarding loops
   in [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>], and a means of mitigating parallel forking
   amplification floods in [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>].  Neither document normatively
   defines specific behavior for B2BUAs, however.

   Unbounded SIP request loops have actually occurred in SIP deployments
   numerous times.  The cause of loops is usually misconfiguration, but
   the reason they have been unbounded/unending is they crossed B2BUAs
   that reset the Max-Forwards value in the SIP requests they generated
   on their User Agent Client (UAC) side.  Although such behavior is
   technically legal per [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] because a B2BUA is a UAC, the
   resulting unbounded loops have caused service outages and make
   troubleshooting difficult.

   Furthermore, [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>] also provides a mechanism to mitigate the
   impact of parallel forking amplification issues, through the use of a
   "Max-Breadth" header field.  If a B2BUA does not pass this header
   field on, parallel forking amplification is not mitigated with the
   [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>] mechanism.

   This document defines normative requirements for Max-Forwards and
   Max-Breadth header field behaviors of B2BUAs, in order to mitigate
   the effect of loops and parallel forking amplification.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7332">RFC 7332</a>                Loop Detection for B2BUAs            August 2014</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Background</span>

   Within the context of B2BUAs, the scope of the SIP protocol ends at
   the User Agent Server (UAS) side of the B2BUA, and a new one begins
   on the UAC side.  A B2BUA is thus capable of choosing what it wishes
   to do on its UAC side independently of its UAS side, and still
   remains compliant with [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and its extensions.  For example,
   any B2BUA type defined in [<a href="./rfc7092" title='"A Taxonomy of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back User Agents"'>RFC7092</a>] other than Proxy-B2BUA may create
   the SIP request on its UAC side without copying any of the Via header
   field values received on its UAS side.  Indeed there are valid
   reasons for it to do so; however, this prevents the Via-based loop-
   detection mechanism defined in [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and updated by [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>]
   from detecting SIP request loops any earlier than by reaching a Max-
   Forwards limit.

   Some attempts have been made by B2BUA vendors to detect request loops
   in other ways: by keeping track of the number of outstanding dialog-
   forming requests for a given caller/called URI pair; or by detecting
   when they receive and send their own media addressing information too
   many times in certain cases when they are a signaling/media-plane
   B2BUA; or by encoding a request instance identifier in some field
   they believe will pass through other nodes, and detecting when they
   see the same value too many times.

   All of these methods are brittle and prone to error, however.  They
   are brittle because it is very hard to accurately define when a value
   has been seen "too many times".  Requests can and do fork before and
   after B2BUAs process them, and requests legitimately spiral in some
   cases, leading to incorrect determination of loops.  The mechanisms
   are prone to error because there can be other B2BUAs in the loop's
   path that interfere with the particular mechanism being used.

   Ultimately, the last defense against loops becoming unbounded is to
   limit how many SIP hops any request can traverse, which is the
   purpose of the SIP Max-Forwards field value.  If B2BUAs were to at
   least copy and decrement the Max-Forwards header field value from
   their UAS to the UAC side, loops would not continue indefinitely.

   It is RECOMMENDED that B2BUAs implement the loop-detection mechanism
   for the Via header field, as defined for a proxy in [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7332">RFC 7332</a>                Loop Detection for B2BUAs            August 2014</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20B2BUA%20Max-Forwards%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  B2BUA Max-Forwards Behavior</span>

   This section applies for dialog-forming and out-of-dialog SIP
   requests.  B2BUAs MAY perform the same actions for in-dialog
   requests, but doing so may cause issues with devices that set Max-
   Forwards values based upon the number of received Via or Record-Route
   headers.

   All B2BUA types MUST copy the received Max-Forwards header field from
   the received SIP request on their UAS side, to any request(s) they
   generate on their UAC side, and decrement the value, as if they were
   a proxy following the requirements described in [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>].

   Being a UAS, B2BUAs MUST also check the received Max-Forwards header
   field and reject or respond to the request if the value is zero, as
   defined in [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>].

   If the received request did not contain a Max-Forwards header field,
   one MUST be created in any request generated in the UAC side, as
   described for proxies in <a href="#section-16.6">Section 16.6</a>, Step 3 of [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>].  As in
   that specification, the value of the new Max-Forwards header SHOULD
   be 70.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20B2BUA%20Max-Breadth%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  B2BUA Max-Breadth Behavior</span>

   All B2BUA types MUST copy the received Max-Breadth header field from
   the received SIP request on their UAS side, to any request(s) they
   generate on their UAC side, as if they were a proxy following the
   requirements described in [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>].

   B2BUAs of all types MUST follow the requirements imposed on Proxies
   as described in <a href="./rfc5393#section-5.3.3">SectionÂ 5.3.3 of [RFC5393]</a>, including generating the
   header field if none is received, limiting its maximum value, etc.

   B2BUAs that generate parallel requests on their UAC side for a single
   incoming request on the UAS side MUST also follow the rules for Max-
   Breadth handling in [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>] as if they were a parallel forking
   proxy.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security implications for parallel forking amplification are
   documented in <a href="./rfc5393#section-7">SectionÂ 7 of [RFC5393]</a>.  This document does not
   introduce any additional issues beyond those discussed in [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>].

   Some B2BUAs reset the Max-Forwards and Max-Breadth header field
   values in order to obfuscate the number of hops a request has already
   traversed, as a privacy or security concern.  Such goals are at odds
