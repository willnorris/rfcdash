                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from March 27 to
April 7.  During this interval the PDP-10 at Ames which acts as a
front-end to the Illiac (Network address 15) became a server.
However, this Host will not be available to general use for several
months.  Also a Terminal IMP was installed at the University of
Southern California (Network Address 23) on March 29.

Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These
Host fall into two categories:

1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as
servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis for at
least two weeks.  Included here are:
         Network
         Address              Site                Computer
         -------              ----                --------
           134               MIT-AI               PDP-10
            13               Case                 PDP-10

2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here
are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,
MITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, and BBN*).  This category also includes the
Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is used
solely for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included
among these Hosts are the following:
         Network
         Address              Site                Computer
         -------              ----                --------
             7              Rand                  IBM-360/65
            73              Harvard               PDP-1
            12              Illinois              PDP-11
            19              NBS                   PDP-11

The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this
period.

*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as
such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to
refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

where
D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)

H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)

R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
    connection within 60 seconds.)
________________
*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a Network
 Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to
 test NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection to the NETRJS
 logger indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
#These sites advertise that they may not have their system available at
 these times.
