Abstract

   This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) bind operation with a mechanism for requesting and returning
   the authorization identity it establishes.  Specifically, this
   document defines the Authorization Identity Request and Response
   controls for use with the Bind operation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document defines support for the Authorization Identity Request
   Control and the Authorization Identity Response Control for
   requesting and returning the authorization established in a bind
   operation.  The Authorization Identity Request Control may be
   submitted by a client in a bind request if authenticating with
   version 3 of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
   protocol [<a href="#ref-LDAPv3" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Technical Specification"'>LDAPv3</a>].  In the LDAP server's bind response, it may then
   include an Authorization Identity Response Control.  The response
   control contains the identity assumed by the client.  This is useful
   when there is a mapping step or other indirection during the bind, so
   that the client can be told what LDAP identity was granted.  Client
   authentication with certificates is the primary situation where this
   applies.  Also, some Simple Authentication and Security Layer [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>]
   authentication mechanisms may not involve the client explicitly
   providing a DN, or may result in an authorization identity which is
   different from the authentication identity provided by the client
   [<a href="#ref-AUTH" title='"Authentication Methods for LDAP"'>AUTH</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   used in this document are to be interpreted as described in

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Publishing%20support%20for%20the%20Authorization%20Identity%20Request%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Publishing support for the Authorization Identity Request Control</span>
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/and%20the%20Authorization%20Identity%20Response%20Control"></a>    and the Authorization Identity Response Control</span>

   Support for the Authorization Identity Request Control and the
   Authorization Identity Response Control is indicated by the presence
   of the Object Identifiers (OIDs) 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.16 and
   2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.15, respectively, in the supportedControl
   attribute [<a href="#ref-LDAPATTRS" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Attribute Syntax Definitions"'>LDAPATTRS</a>] of a server's root DSA-specific Entry (DSE).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Authorization%20Identity%20Request%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Authorization Identity Request Control</span>

   This control MAY be included in any bind request which specifies
   protocol version 3, as part of the controls field of the LDAPMessage
   as defined in [<a href="#ref-LDAPPROT" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)"'>LDAPPROT</a>].  In a multi-step bind operation, the client
   MUST provide the control with each bind request.

   The controlType is "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.16" and the controlValue is
   absent.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Authorization%20Identity%20Response%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Authorization Identity Response Control</span>

   This control MAY be included in any final bind response where the
   first bind request of the bind operation included an Authorization
   Identity Request Control as part of the controls field of the
   LDAPMessage as defined in [<a href="#ref-LDAPPROT" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)"'>LDAPPROT</a>].

   The controlType is "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.15".  If the bind request
   succeeded and resulted in an identity (not anonymous), the
   controlValue contains the authorization identity (authzId), as
   defined in [<a href="#ref-AUTH" title='"Authentication Methods for LDAP"'>AUTH</a>] <a href="#section-9">section 9</a>, granted to the requestor.  If the bind
   request resulted in an anonymous association, the controlValue field
   is a string of zero length.  If the bind request resulted in more
   than one authzId, the primary authzId is returned in the controlValue
   field.

   The control is only included in a bind response if the resultCode for
   the bind operation is success.

   If the server requires confidentiality protections to be in place
   prior to use of this control (see Security Considerations), the
   server reports failure to have adequate confidentiality protections
   in place by returning the confidentialityRequired result code.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3829">RFC 3829</a>          Authorization Identity Bind Control          July 2004</span>


   If the client has insufficient access rights to the requested
   authorization information, the server reports this by returning the
   insufficientAccessRights result code.

   Identities presented by a client as part of the authentication
   process may be mapped by the server to one or more authorization
   identities.  The bind response control can be used to retrieve the
   primary authzId.

   For example, during client authentication with certificates [<a href="#ref-AUTH" title='"Authentication Methods for LDAP"'>AUTH</a>], a
   client may possess more than one certificate and may not be able to
   determine which one was ultimately selected for authentication to the
   server.  The subject DN field in the selected certificate may not
   correspond exactly to a DN in the directory, but rather have gone
   through a mapping process controlled by the server.  Upon completing
   the certificate-based authentication, the client may issue a SASL
   [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] bind request, specifying the EXTERNAL mechanism and including
   an Authorization Identity Request Control.  The bind response MAY
   include an Authorization Identity Response Control indicating the DN
   in the server's Directory Information Tree (DIT) which the
   certificate was mapped to.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Alternative%20Approach%20with%20Extended%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Alternative Approach with Extended Operation</span>

   The LDAP "Who am I?" [<a href="#ref-AUTHZID" title="&quot;LDAP 'Who am I?' Operation&quot;">AUTHZID</a>] extended operation provides a
   mechanism to query the authorization identity associated with a bound
   connection.  Using an extended operation, as opposed to a bind
   response control, allows a client to learn the authorization identity
   after the bind has established integrity and data confidentiality
   protections.  The disadvantages of the extended operation approach
   are coordination issues between "Who am I?" requests, bind requests,
   and other requests, and that an extra operation is required to learn
   the authorization identity.  For multithreaded or high bandwidth
   server application environments, the bind response approach may be
   preferable.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The Authorization Identity Request and Response Controls are subject
   to standard LDAP security considerations.  The controls may be passed
   over a secure as well as over an insecure channel.  They are not
   protected by security layers negotiated by the bind operation.

   The response control allows for an additional authorization identity
   to be passed.  In some deployments, these identities may contain
   confidential information which require privacy protection.  In such
   deployments, a security layer should be established prior to issuing
   a bind request with an Authorization Identity Request Control.

   Controls, respectively.  The Authorization Identity Request Control
