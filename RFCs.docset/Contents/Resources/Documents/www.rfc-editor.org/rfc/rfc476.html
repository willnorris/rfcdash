RFC # 476                                             BBN-NET

             <span class="h1">IMP/TIP Memory Retrofit Schedule (Revision 2)</span>


This revision contains two types of changes to RFC #447.  First, the
retrofits to Utah, Belvoir, NOAA, USC, Stanford, ISI, Case, and CCA have
been completed and are therefore removed from the schedule.  Second, the
retrofits to UCSB, ETAC, Aberdeen, and Rome have been rescheduled.

The revised text of RFC #447 follows:

During the first several months of 1973 we will be retrofitting each IMP
and TIP with additional core memory.  At the end of the retrofit
program, the memory sizes of the various machines will be as follows:

    IMP (516 or 316) - 16K words

    TIP - 28K words

    TIP with Magnetic Tape Option - 32K words

In addition, the expansion of the TIP core memory will necessitate
enlarging the TIP to two cabinets.

Listed below is the schedule for the remaining retrofits.  We have
arranged this schedule to coincide with the usual monthly Preventive
Maintenance at each site so as to minimize user inconvenience, but the
work required will frequently require the machines to be down longer
than normal.  I will issue additional RFC's updating this schedule as
necessary.

Any site which anticipates difficulty with the expansion of TIP size,
and thus the floor space requirement, should contact Hawley Rising (BBN)
