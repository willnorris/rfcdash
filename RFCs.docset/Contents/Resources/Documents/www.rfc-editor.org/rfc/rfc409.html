          TENEX Interface To UCSB's Simple-Minded File System

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/I.%20%20PREFACE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-I" id="appendix-I">I</a>.  PREFACE</span>

   A subsystem for TENEX called SMFS has been written to interface
   ARPANET TENEX users to the Simple-Minded File System at UCSB-MOD75
   (see NIC 5834 / <a href="./rfc122">RFC 122</a> and NIC 11917 / <a href="./rfc399">RFC 399</a>).  The Simple-Minded
   File System is a resident server process at UCSB which currently
   manages approximately 10K pages of on-line, direct-access storage.

   Using the simple command language or the subsystem here described,
   the user can transfer files to and from UCSB, and delete and rename
   them while they reside at Santa Barbara.  Files stored at UCSB may be
   read and/or write protected, and a file archived to UCSB from the
   TENEX system can be retrieved from another.

   This document is intended to provide users with the information
   necessary to use SMFS from a terminal; the reader is assumed familiar
   with TENEX.

   SMFS is currently installed at SRI-ARC (note in particular that the
   ARC EXEC WILL NOT give the user any 'GENERAL SUBSYSTEMS NOT AVAILABLE
   FOR NIC USE' flack about invoking SMFS).

   Copies of the source file are available upon request from the NIC.
   Bug reports and comments upon the code and documentation are
   solicited by the author, and may be sent to JEW through the Journal.

II.  LIMITATIONS

   SMFS can archive at Santa Barbara any file resident in a TENEX file
   system except:

      (1) Long files (in the strict, TENEX sense), and

      (2) Files whose directory name, filename, or extension contains
          other than alphameric characters, or whose combined length
          exceeds 32 characters (this limitation arises because of
          naming restrictions imposed at UCSB).

III.  OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

   SMFs is invoked like any other subsystem --- by typing its name
   followed by a carriage return (CR).  SMFS responds with the herald
   'UCSB Archival System (ver n date)' followed by its prompt character
   '#'.  Whenever SMFS types its prompt character, it expects the user
   to respond with a command ('?' will generate a list of all valid
   commands).

   The user selects a command by typing its first letter (here and
   throughout the exchange, upper- and lower-case alphabetics are
   interchangeable).  SMFS acknowledges a command it recognizes by
   typing the remaining characters of the keyword, and rejects those it
   doesn't by typing '?'.

   If the command requires arguments, SMFS prompts the user for each one
   in turn by describing it in parentheses.  If the argument is a
   keyword, SMFS will list the set of alternatives (separated by
   slashes).  The user selects one by typing its first letter.  Again,
   SMFS acknowledges a valid selection by completing it; if the user's
   response is in error, SMFS prompts for the parameter a second time.
   If the argument is not a keyword (e.g., a filename), the user enters
   an appropriate character string terminated by a CR.  Commands with no
   predicate are simply confirmed by the user with a CR.

   Entering the last argument initiates execution of the command.  In
   most cases, successfully executed commands illicit no explicit
   response (SMFS simply prompts for the next command).  Unsuccessful
   commands illicit a diagnostic.

IV.  COMMAND EDITING

   Anytime a character string is called for, the following editing
   features are available to the user:

      control-A     deletes the previous character
      control-X     deletes the entire string
      Control-R     retypes the string

   Anytime a filename (see Section V) is called for, the following
   additional editing features are available:

      control-W     deletes the current field
      control-F     recognizes the current field
      ESC           recognizes all remaining fields

   Control-O aborts a command during specification or execution (some
   commands cannot be aborted once the final CR has been typed).



<span class="grey">White                                                           [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc409">RFC 409</a>       TENEX INTERFACE TO SIMPLE-MINDED FILE SYSTEM December 1972</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/V.%20%20FILE%20SPECIFICATION"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-V" id="appendix-V">V</a>.  FILE SPECIFICATION</span>

   Whenever SMFS solicits a filename from the user, either of the
   following is acceptable:

      (1) hostname  :  filename

          'Hostname' is a standard host name or decimal host address
          identifying the host to which the file at UCSB belongs (to
          distinguish, for example, the directory &lt;SUBSYS&gt; at SRI-ARC
          from the directory &lt;SUBSYS&gt; at USC-ISI).

          If unspecified, the host name defaults to that of the TENEX
          system from which SMFS is invoked (and in this case the
          delimiting ':' must be dropped).

          Note that 'hostname' need be specified only in connection with
          inter-TENEX file transfers, and CANNOT be specified as part of
          the local filename in a MOVE or COPY command.

          'Filename' is a standard TENEX filename (subject to the
          constraints of Section II).

          If no directory is specified, that to which the user is
          currently connected is taken as the default.

          If name, extension, or version number is left unspecified, it
          defaults to the one most recently specified.

      (2) ESC (i.e.,  Altmode)

          ESC in this context denotes the most recent file
          specification, which SMFS will retype for the user.

VI.  SYNTAX CONVENTIONS

   In the description which follows, the following syntax conventions
   are employed:

      Characters which must be entered literally by the user are
      represented in upper-case (although they may be either in upper-
      or lower-case when typed by the user).

      Variables (like filenames) which must be entered by the user are
      represented by their generic names in lower case (although they
      may be either in upper- or lower-case when typed by the user).





<span class="grey">White                                                           [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc409">RFC 409</a>       TENEX INTERFACE TO SIMPLE-MINDED FILE SYSTEM December 1972</span>


      The following special symbols represent control characters entered
      by the user:

         CR  --carriage return or Telnet new-line
         SP  --space
         ESC --alt mode or escape

      Output from the system is distinguished by enclosing it in square
      brackets.

      Whenever an element in the user-system exchange can take more than
      one value, the alternatives are listed vertically in a column.

VII.  COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.%20USER%20NAME%20AND%20ACCOUNT"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">A</a>. USER NAME AND ACCOUNT</span>

      UCSB identifies users of its Simple-Minded File System by:

      (1) user name --

          a character string of from one to eight alphameric characters
          of SP, and

      (2) account --

          a character string of from one to four alphameric characters
          or SP.

   SMFS maintains internally a pair of accumulators.  One contains a
   user name, the other an account, each either a character string
   specified explicitly by the user or an SMFS-supplied default (the
   user's TENEX login directory name and 'l', respectively).  Both
   accumulators are set initially to their default values.

   Note:  If the user's login directory name exceeds eight characters in
   length, the user must explicitly supply a user name; no default is
   available.

   Whenever SMFS interacts with the server process at Santa Barbara on
   the user's behalf, it does so with the accounting parameters then in
   the accumulators.









<span class="grey">White                                                           [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc409">RFC 409</a>       TENEX INTERFACE TO SIMPLE-MINDED FILE SYSTEM December 1972</span>


   The user sets and inspects the user name and account with the USER
   NAME and ACCOUNT commands:

      U[ser name]
      [[currentusername]]  newusername CR
                           SP [logindirectoryname]
                           CR

      A[ccount]
      [[currentaccount]]   newaccount CR
                           SP [1]
                           CR

   USER NAME and ACCOUNT display and optionally change the contents of
   the user name and account accumulators, respectively:

      If 'newusername' or 'newaccount' is specified, it replaces the
      current contents of the appropriate accumulator.

      If SP is specified, the accumulator is set to the appropriate
      default.

      If CR is typed, the user name or account is left unchanged.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/B.%20COPY"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B" id="appendix-B">B</a>. COPY</span>

   The COPY command effects the transfer of a copy of a file to or from
   UCSB.  The file which is the source of the copy remains unmodified;
   the user must have read access to it.  The syntax of the command is
   one of the following, depending upon the direction of transfer:

      C[opy]
      [(to/from UCSB] T[o]
      [(file)] localfilespec CR
      [(store as file)] remotefilespec CR
      [(create/replace)] C[reate]
                         R(eplace]

      C[opy]
      [to/from UCSB] F[rom]
      [(file)] remotefilespec CR
      [(store as file)] localfilespec CR

      where 'localfilespec' and 'remotefilespec' are as defined in
      Section V.






<span class="grey">White                                                           [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc409">RFC 409</a>       TENEX INTERFACE TO SIMPLE-MINDED FILE SYSTEM December 1972</span>


   Note that a file can effectively be renamed in transit between TENEX
   and UCSB by specifying 'localfilespec' different from
   'remotefilespec'.  The more common  situation is that in which the
   second of the two filespec's is simply ESC.  In 'localfilespec', the
   field-defaulting algorithms of Section V are not applied; the normal
   TENEX defaults are applicable.

   If in a copy to UCSB the user specifies 'create'; SMFS will ignore
   the command (and so inform the user) if a file of the same name
   already exists at UCSB.  If 'replace' is specified, the command will
   be ignored if a file of the same name DOESN'T  already exist at UCSB.
   Also, if 'replace' is specified, the user must have write access to
   the existing file at UCSB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/C.%20MOVE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C" id="appendix-C">C</a>. MOVE</span>

   The MOVE command functions like COPY except that the source file for
   the operation is deleted once it has been transferred successfully.
   The user must have both read and write access to the source file.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/D.%20LOCATE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-D" id="appendix-D">D</a>. LOCATE</span>

   The LOCATE command verifies the existence of a file at UCSB.  Its
   syntax is

      L[ocate (file)] filespec CR
        [Archived at UCSB]
        [Not Archived at UCSB]

   Neither read nor write access to the designated file is required.

   Note:  LOCATE is the nearest thing to a TENEX DIRECTORY command
   available.  A full DIRECTORY command cannot currently be implemented
   because of restrictions imposed at UCSB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/E.%20DELETE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-E" id="appendix-E">E</a>. DELETE</span>

   The DELETE command deletes and releases all secondary storage
   assigned to a file previously copied or moved to UCSB:

      D[elete (file)] filespec CR

   The user must have write access to the file at UCSB.








<span class="grey">White                                                           [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-7"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc409">RFC 409</a>       TENEX INTERFACE TO SIMPLE-MINDED FILE SYSTEM December 1972</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/F.%20RENAME"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-F" id="appendix-F">F</a>. RENAME</span>

   The RENAME command changes the name of a file residing at UCSB as the
   result of a previous move or copy operation:

      R[ename (file)] filespec CR
      [(new file)] newfilespec CR

   The user must have write access to the file at UCSB, and no file may
   already exist there with the name 'newfilespec'.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/G.%20PASSWORD"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-G" id="appendix-G">G</a>. PASSWORD</span>

   While files reside at UCSB, they may be protected from unauthorized
   access or modification by the assignment of a read and/or write
   password, respectively.  Each is a character string of from one to 36
   alphameric characters or SP.

   SMFS maintains internally a pair of accumulators.  One is always
   either empty or containing a read password, the other empty or
   containing a write password (both accumulators are initially empty).
   Whenever a command issued by the user requires (always implicitly) a
   password(s), the one then contained in the appropriate accumulator is
   applied.  An empty accumulator implies 'no password'.

   The user sets and inspects the two passwords with the PASSWORD
   command:

      P[assword]
      [(read/write)] R[ead]
                     W[rite]
      [[currentpassword]] newpassword CR
                           SP [none]
                           CR

   PASSWORD displays and optionally changes the contents of one of the
   two password accumulators:

      If 'new password' is specified, it replaces the current contents
      of the accumulator.

      If SP is specified, the accumulator is made empty.

      If CR is typed, the password is left unchanged.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/H.%20NEWS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-H" id="appendix-H">H</a>. NEWS</span>

   The NEWS command prints at the user's terminal the contents of the
   file:

      SRI-ARC: &lt;SYSTEM &gt;SMFS.NEWS1

   residing at UCSB.  SRI-ARC maintains this file, and as necessary
   places in it information (e.g., command syntax changes) of concern to
   users of UCSB's archiving service.  Should the user, for example,
   have difficulty with any of the commands described in this document,
   NEWS is a good starting point for obtaining help.

   The command has the syntax:

      N[ews] CR

   If the news file is long, SMFS will periodically pause and type
   'Continue?'.  The user may then respond 'N' to halt printout, or 'Y'
   or CR to continue (of course, control-O will abort printout at any
   time).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/I.%20QUIT"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-I" id="appendix-I">I</a>. QUIT</span>

   The QUIT command causes SMFS to return to the EXEC:

      Q[uit] CR
