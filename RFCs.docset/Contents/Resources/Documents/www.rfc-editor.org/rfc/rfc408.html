NIC #12390                                         Jon Postel  (UCLA-NMC)
                                                   25 October 1972

                                <span class="h1">NETBANK</span>

The following idea for a protocol (or service) is offered as an
aid to network use for new users:

   a single billing and account creation and validation system,
   so that a manager of a "goal oriented project" could:

      authorize a set of user's ids to gain access to and utilize
      resources at the entire or a specified subset of the server
      hosts.

      create a set of accounts which the users will expend, and
      which will be used as the breakdown for a single bill to be
      presented to the project manager.

   the idea is that the project manager would be required to go
   through the initialization process of introducing himself,
   verifying the existence of funding, etc. only once, and,

   the idea would also encourage server hosts to implement
   systems for which usage might be projected to start at low
   levels and grow, by allowing funded hacking by project members
   in a controlled manner.

   this would require an option at login for the prospective user
   to indicate the server should check the "netbank" facility at
   the system currently hosting it.
