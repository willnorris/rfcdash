                        DOCUMENTATION CONVENTIONS



This note is a revision of NWG/RFC 10, 16, 24, and 27.

The Network Working Group consists of interested pleople from existing or
potential ARPA network sites.  Membership is not closed.

The Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software, the
strategies for using the network, and initial experience with the network.

Documentation of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.  Notes
may be produced at any site by anybody and included in this series.

CONTENT

The content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related
to the HOST software or other aspect of the network.  Notes are encouraged
to be timely rather than polished.  Philosophical positions without examples
or other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques
without introductory or background explication, and explicit questions
without any attempted answers are all acceptable.  The minimum length for
a NWG note is one sentence.

These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto
authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of
considerably less than authoritative ideas.  Second, there is a natural
hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this
inhibition.

FORM

Every NWG note should bear the following information:

        1.  "Network Working Group"
            "Request for Comments: X" (X underscored)
              where X is a serial number.  Serial numbers are assigned
              by Steve Crocker at UCLA.

        2.  Author and affiliation

        3.  Date

        4.  Title
            The title need not be unique.
