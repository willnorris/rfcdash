Abstract

   This memorandum provides guidelines for using the United States
   Department of Defense Military Standard MIL-STD-1840, "Automated
   Interchange of Technical Information," with the Internet electronic
   mail standards, <a href="./rfc822">RFC 822</a> and <a href="./rfc1521">RFC 1521</a>.  Electronic mail provides a
   more convenient mechanism that delivery via physical media for
   certain types and quantities of data.  Software already exists to
   support data exchanges based on MIL-STD-1840 and it can continue to
   be used in conjunction with electronic mail exchanges defined in this
   document.  This document defines a new media type and a MIME message
   structure for exchanging data in conformance with MIL-STD-1840.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The United States Department of Defense (DOD) has defined a standard,
   MIL-STD-1840 [<a href="#ref-1840" title='"Automated Interchange of Technical Information"'>1840</a>], for the exchange of digital data.  Most
   applications of that standard use 9-track tape as the transport
   medium.  The Application/CALS-1840 media-type is proposed to
   facilitate such exchanges using the Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions): Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME</a>] and network based transport media, i.e. electronic
   mail [<a href="#ref-822" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>822</a>].

   This memo has been reviewed and authorized by the Continuous
   Acquistion and Life-cycle Support (CALS) Industry Steering Group
   (ISG).  CALS is a US DOD initiative for the use and exchange of
   digital data.  The Industry Steering Group, which consists of members
   drawn from government and industry, guides the development of CALS
   standards such as [<a href="#ref-1840" title='"Automated Interchange of Technical Information"'>1840</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Definition</span>

   An [<a href="#ref-1840" title='"Automated Interchange of Technical Information"'>1840</a>] exchange consists of a set of files with well defined file
   names (see below).  Each set consists of a declaration file and one
   or more data files.  The data files, in turn, consist of header

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1895">RFC 1895</a>                       CALS-1840                   February 1996</span>


   records immediately followed by the data.  The data itself may be
   formatted in accordance with a published specification or a
   contractual agreement.

   MIL-STD-1840 encodes the file's data type in the file name.

   It might seem appropriate to transform the 1840 headers into MIME
   headers and use the appropriate media type, essentially transforming
   the 1840 files into MIME body parts.  There are three reasons for not
   doing that.  First, not all of the "types" used in [<a href="#ref-1840" title='"Automated Interchange of Technical Information"'>1840</a>] are
   registered MIME types.  Second, there exists an installed base of
   software capable of reading the 1840 formatted files and processing
   the data appropriately.  Finally the three existing revisions to the
   standard have maintained the same file structure.  Consequently, a
   processor for the data may be able to handle any one of the
   standard's revisions.  Thus, a single Application/CALS-1840 is being
   proposed and its body part body contains headers and data in the
   [<a href="#ref-1840" title='"Automated Interchange of Technical Information"'>1840</a>] format.

   A set of related files constitutes a "transfer unit" in 1840 and each
   transfer unit shall correspond to a Multipart/Mixed MIME entity.
   Included in each transfer unit is a declaration file which shall be
   the first body part in the Multipart/Mixed entity.  Several transfer
   units may be included in a single MIME message.

   The filename parameter gives the transfer unit filename as defined by
   [<a href="#ref-1840" title='"Automated Interchange of Technical Information"'>1840</a>].  The parameter's value, called &lt;1840-name&gt;, has the syntax

   All Application/CALS-1840 body parts in a single Multipart/Mixed MIME
   entity shall have the same &lt;1840-tuseq&gt;.  Within a single message all
   filename values shall be unique.

   Notes: 1) Tuseq and dfseq correspond to transfer unit sequence number
   and data file sequence number respectively.  2) The filename for a
   declaration file has the form "D" 1840-tuseq and for data files, the
   form "D" 1840-tuseq &lt;letter&gt; 1840-dfseq.

   The specversion parameter's value shall indicate the particular
   version of MIL-STD-1840 to which the data conforms.  Valid values
   are:

        MIL-STD-1840C, 0, 199XXXXX
        MIL-STD-1840B, 0, 19921103
        MIL-STD-1840A, 0, 19871222

   Notes: (1) The value "199XXXXX" is to be replaced with the actual
   issue date for MIL-STD-1840C. (2) The embedded blanks in the above
   strings are required, hence the value must be enclosed in quote marks
   (").

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Example</span>

   In the example below a single transfer unit is provided.  It consists
   of three data files, the declaration, a contract defined file and an
   IGES file.  The headers and data are in accordance with MIL-STD-
   1840B.  The content-transfer-encoding perserves the data file's fixed
   record length.

   None of the body parts, as constitued, represent executable data.
   When the 1840 file format is processed the resultant data may be
   executable.  Processing will be under the control of the process
   associated with Application/CALS-1840.
