Abstract

   This text documents the current usage of P-Charge-Info, an existing
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) private header field (P-Header)
   used to convey billing information about the party to be charged.
   This P-Header is currently used in production by several equipment
   vendors and carriers and has been in use since at least 2007.  This
   document details the registration of this header field with IANA.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Overview</span>

   In certain network configurations, several network entities have
   found it useful to decouple the identity of the caller (what is
   normally thought of as "Caller ID") from the identity/number used for
   billing purposes.  This document records the current usage of
   P-Charge-Info, a private SIP header field, to provide simple billing
   information and details the registration of this header field with
   IANA as required by <a href="./rfc5727#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC5727]</a>.

   In a typical configuration, the identity of the caller, commonly
   referred to as "Caller ID" by end users, is derived from one of the
   following SIP header fields:

   o  P-Asserted-Identity

   o  From (in the absence of P-Asserted-Identity)

   (NOTE: Some service providers have also used the Remote-Party-ID
   header field, but this was never standardized and was replaced by
   P-Asserted-Identity in [<a href="./rfc3325" title='"Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks"'>RFC3325</a>].)

   This identity/number is typically presented to the receiving user
   agent (UA), where it is usually displayed for the end user.  It is
   also typically used for billing purposes by the network entities
   involved in carrying the session.

   However, in some network configurations, the "Caller ID" presented to
   the receiving UA may be different from the number to be used for
   billing purposes.

   In this case, there exists a need for a way to pass an additional
   billing identifier that can be used between network entities in order
   to correctly bill for services.

   Several carriers, application providers, and equipment providers have
   been using the P-Charge-Info header field since at least 2007 as a
   simple mechanism to exchange this billing identifier.

   This document specifies the use of the P-Charge-Info header field in
   INVITE requests.  The header field might be useful in other SIP
   messages, but such use is beyond the scope of this document.

   This document has been prepared to document the existing deployed
   usage of the P-Charge-Info header field and to comply with <a href="./rfc5727#section-4">Section 4
   of [RFC5727]</a> in registering this header field with IANA.  It is noted
   that <a href="./rfc5727">RFC 5727</a> specifically deprecates new usage of "P-" header
   fields, but P-Charge-Info has been in deployment since before 2007
   and predates <a href="./rfc5727">RFC 5727</a>.  Given this, the authors believe that
   P-Charge-Info is a "grandfathered case" per <a href="./rfc5727#section-4">Section 4 of RFC 5727</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Use%20Cases"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Use Cases</span>

   The simplest use case for P-Charge-Info is an enterprise environment
   where each SIP endpoint has a direct number that is passed by the
   enterprise SIP proxy across to a SIP proxy at a SIP service provider
   who provides connectivity to the Public Switched Telephone Network
   (PSTN).  Rather than cause the SIP service provider to have to track
   each individual direct number for billing purposes, the enterprise
   SIP proxy sends, in the P-Charge-Info header field, a single billing
   identifier that the SIP service provider uses for billing purposes.

   As another example, a hosted telephony provider or hosted voice-
   application provider may have a large SIP network with customers who
   are distributed over a very large geographic area and use local-
   market PSTN numbers, although the network has only a very few actual
   PSTN interconnection points.

   The customers may all have local phone numbers, yet outgoing calls
   are actually routed across a SIP network and out specific PSTN
   gateways or across specific SIP connections to other SIP service
   providers.  The hosted provider may want to pass a billing identifier
   to its SIP service providers either for the purpose of simplicity in
   billing or to obtain better rates from the SIP service providers.

   The P-Charge-Info header field is applicable within a single private
   administrative domain or between different administrative domains
   where there is a trust relationship between the domains.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Usage%20of%20the%20P-Charge-Info%20Header%20Field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Usage of the P-Charge-Info Header Field</span>

   The P-Charge-Info header field is used to convey information about
   the identity of the party to be charged.  The P-Charge-Info header
   field is typically inserted into a SIP request, usually an INVITE, by
   one of the following:

   o  the SIP proxy on the originating network;

   o  a PSTN gateway acting as a SIP UA; or

   o  an application server generating billing information.

   P-Charge-Info is to be used by the SIP entity that provides billing
   services for a session.  This could be an entity that is generating
   billing records or another entity interacting with it.  Upon receipt
   of an INVITE request with the P-Charge-Info header field, such an
   entity MAY use the value present in P-Charge-Info as indicating the
   party responsible for the charges associated with the session.  This
   decision, for example, could be based on local policy.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.1.%20%20Procedures%20at%20the%20UA"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.1" id="section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  Procedures at the UA</span>

   The P-Charge-Info header field may be inserted by PSTN gateways or
   application servers acting as a SIP UA.

   The P-Charge-Info header field is ignored by an end-user UA and
   should not normally be received by such a UA.  It MUST NOT be sent to
   an end-user UA, as this would provide information to the UA about the
   party to be charged; providing such information may cause security-
   related issues; for example, calling-party information would be known
   by the UA for an otherwise anonymous call.  A UA SHOULD ignore it if
   it receives this header.  Similarly, an end-user UA originating a SIP
   message SHOULD NOT insert this header field.

   A PSTN gateway or application server acting as a UA MAY use the
   content of the P-Charge-Info header field present in an INVITE
   request it received as the identity to be charged for the session for
   billing-related procedures, e.g., in a billing record or during
   interaction with another entity generating billing records.  A PSTN

   gateway or application server acting as a UA MAY use the content of
   the P-Charge-Info header field to populate information about the
   identity of the party to charge in another type of signaling, such as
   ISDN User Part (ISUP).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.2.%20%20Procedures%20at%20the%20Proxy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.2" id="section-5.2.2">5.2.2</a>.  Procedures at the Proxy</span>

   A SIP proxy that supports this extension and receives a request,
   typically a SIP INVITE, MAY insert a P-Charge-Info header field.  The
   contents of the inserted header field may be decided based on local
   policy or by querying an external entity to determine the identity of
   the party to be charged.

   When a proxy receives an INVITE request, it MAY use the content of
   the P-Charge-Info header field contained in the request for billing-
   related procedures, e.g., in a billing record or during interaction
   with another entity that is generating billing records.

   A SIP proxy that does not support this extension will pass any
   received P-Charge-Info header field unmodified, in compliance with
   <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.

   A proxy supporting this extension MUST remove the P-Charge-Info
   header field before sending a request to a UA that is not acting as a
   PSTN gateway or appropriate application server, if the role of the UA
   is known.

   The content of the P-Charge-Info header field is typically just a
   SIP/tel URI used as a billing indicator.  An example could be as
   simple as one of:

   P-Charge-Info: &lt;sip:+14075550134@example.net;user=phone&gt;

   P-Charge-Info: &lt;sip:+12345550167@example.com&gt;

   P-Charge-Info: &lt;sips:1234@example.com&gt;

   P-Charge-Info: &lt;tel:+14075551234&gt;

   Any other applicable SIP URI could be used.

   This RFC contains the definition of one or more SIP header fields
   that allow choosing between addr-spec and name-addr when constructing
   header-field values.  [<a href="./rfc8217" title='"Clarifications for When to Use the name-addr Production in SIP Messages"'>RFC8217</a>] prohibits the use of addr-spec if its
   value would contain a comma, semicolon, or question mark.

   The private header field specified here is described in both prose
   and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defined in [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].
   Further, several BNF definitions are inherited from SIP and are not
   repeated here.  Implementors need to be familiar with the notation
   and contents of [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] to understand this document.

   The syntax of the P-Charge-Info header field is described as follows:

         P-Charge-Info = "P-Charge-Info" HCOLON (name-addr / addr-spec)
                 ; name-addr and addr-spec are specified in <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>

   The SIP URI contained in the name-addr/addr-spec is the billing
   indicator that is passed between the parties.

   This specification registers a new proprietary SIP header field
   according to the procedures defined in [<a href="./rfc5727" title='"Change Process for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Real- time Applications and Infrastructure Area"'>RFC5727</a>].

   The P-Charge-Info private header field has been registered in the
   "Header Fields" subregistry of the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Parameters" registry as follows:

   Header Field Name: P-Charge-Info

   Compact Form: none

   Reference: <a href="./rfc8496">RFC 8496</a>

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Given that the information contained in the P-Charge-Info header
   field will be used for billing purposes, the proxies and other SIP
   entities that share this information MUST have a trust relationship.

   If an untrusted entity were inserted between the trusted entities, it
   could potentially interfere with the billing records for the call.
   If the SIP connections are not made over a private network, a
   mechanism for securing the confidentiality and integrity of the SIP
   connection MUST be used to protect the information.  One such
   mechanism could be TLS encryption of the SIP signaling stream.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.2.%20%20Untrusted%20Peers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" id="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Untrusted Peers</span>

   If the P-Charge-Info header field was accepted by a SIP entity from
   an untrusted peer, there is the potential for fraud if the untrusted
   entity sent incorrect information, either inadvertently or
   maliciously.

   Therefore, a SIP entity MUST remove and ignore the P-Charge-Info
   header field when it is received from an untrusted entity.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.2.2.%20%20Egress%20to%20Untrusted%20Peers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2.2" id="section-8.2.2">8.2.2</a>.  Egress to Untrusted Peers</span>

   If the P-Charge-Info header field was sent by a SIP entity to an
   untrusted peer, there is potential for exposure of network
   information that is internal to a trust domain.  For instance, the
   untrusted entity may learn the identities of public SIP proxies used
   within the trust domain, which could then potentially be directly
   attacked.

   If an implementation does not strip P-Charge-Info from the message
   where specified in this document, it introduces serious privacy
   risks.  Examples include revealing third-party billing relationships
   that might be sensitive, as well as unmasking the identity of callers
   who wish to remain anonymous.  Depending on circumstances, the latter
   case may result in unwanted harassment and even physical harm to the
   calling party.

   Therefore, a SIP entity MUST remove the P-Charge-Info header field
   when it is sent to an untrusted entity.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Alternatives"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Alternatives</span>

   P-Charging-Vector is defined in <a href="./rfc7315#section-4.6">Section 4.6 of [RFC7315]</a> and used by
   the 3GPP to carry information related to the charging of a session.
   There are, however, some differences in the semantics associated with
   P-Charging-Vector and P-Charge-Info.  P-Charging-Vector is mainly
   used to carry information for correlation of multiple charging
   records generated for a single session.  On the other hand,
   P-Charge-Info is used to convey information about the party to be
   billed for a call.  Furthermore, P-Charging-Vector has a mandatory
   icid-value parameter that is a globally unique value to identify the
   session for which the charging information is generated.  Such a
   globally unique identifier is not necessary when carrying information
   about the user to be billed when it is attached to the corresponding
   session-related signaling.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.2.%20%20P-DCS-Billing-Info"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2" id="appendix-A.2">A.2</a>.  P-DCS-Billing-Info</span>

   P-DCS-Billing-Info is defined in <a href="./rfc5503#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC5503]</a> and used for
   passing billing information between trusted entities in the
   PacketCable Distributed Call Signaling Architecture.  For many
   billing situations, particularly the very large-scale residential
   telephone networks for which this header field is designed,
   P-DCS-Billing-Info is an excellent solution.  However, this ability
   to address a range of situations adds complexity.  According to <a href="./rfc5503">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc5503">5503</a>, the following information is mandatory to include in each use
   of the P-DCS-Billing-Info header field:

   o  Billing-Correlation-ID, a globally unique identifier

   o  Financial-Entity-ID

   o  RKS-Group-ID (record-keeping server)

   The P-DCS-Billing-Info header field may also include a variety of
   additional parameters.

   While this may work well in many billing scenarios, there are other
   billing scenarios that do not need this level of complexity.  In
   those simpler scenarios, all that is needed is a number to use for
   billing.  P-Charge-Info provides this simple solution for simple
   billing scenarios.

   Additionally, according to <a href="./rfc5503#section-7.3">Section 7.3 of RFC 5503</a>, it is mandatory
   for a UA to create a Billing-Correlation-ID and insert this into the
   P-DCS-Billing-Info header field (along with the other required

   information) sent in the initial SIP INVITE.  This again makes sense
   for the residential-telephone-service environment for which this
   header field is designed.  In contrast, P-Charge-Info is designed to
   be used among proxies and not at all by normal user agents.
   (P-Charge-Info may, though, be used by user agents associated with
   PSTN gateways.)

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.3.%20%20P-Asserted-Identity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3" id="appendix-A.3">A.3</a>.  P-Asserted-Identity</span>

   Early reviewers of this document asked why the P-Asserted-Identity
   header field documented in [<a href="./rfc3325" title='"Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks"'>RFC3325</a>] could not be used.  As mentioned
   in the use-case example above, P-Asserted-Identity is used to
   indicate the identity of the calling party.  However, in this
   instance, the requirement is to provide an additional identity of the
   SIP-to-PSTN interconnect point.

   It would be typical to find both P-Asserted-Identity and
   P-Charge-Info used in a SIP exchange.  P-Asserted-Identity would be
   used to provide the caller identity that would be displayed to the
   end user as "Caller ID", while P-Charge-Info would provide the
   billing identifier used for the billing associated with the call.
