          <span class="h1">Updates to the Special-Purpose IP Address Registries</span>

Abstract

   This memo updates the IANA IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address
   Registries to address issues raised by the definition of a "global"
   prefix.  It also corrects several errors in registry entries to
   ensure the integrity of the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries.

   This memo updates <a href="./rfc6890">RFC 6890</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8190">RFC 8190</a>           Special-Purpose Address Registries          June 2017</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   In order to support new protocols and practices, the IETF
   occasionally reserves an address block for a special purpose.  For
   example, [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>] reserves an IPv4 address block (0.0.0.0/8) to
   represent the local (i.e., "this") network.  Likewise, [<a href="./rfc4291" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>]
   reserves an IPv6 address block (fe80::/10) for link-local unicast
   addresses.

   Several issues have been raised with the documentation of some of the
   special-purpose address blocks in [<a href="./rfc6890" title='"Special-Purpose IP Address Registries"'>RFC6890</a>].  Specifically, the
   definition of "global" provided in [<a href="./rfc6890" title='"Special-Purpose IP Address Registries"'>RFC6890</a>] was misleading as it
   slightly differed from the generally accepted definition of "global
   scope" (i.e., the ability to forward beyond the boundaries of an
   administrative domain, described as "global unicast" in the IPv6
   addressing architecture [<a href="./rfc4291" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>]).

   This memo updates the definition of "global" from [<a href="./rfc6890" title='"Special-Purpose IP Address Registries"'>RFC6890</a>] for the
   IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries, augments the fields
   contained within the registries in order to address the confusion
   raised by the definition of "global", and corrects some errors in
   some of the entries in the Special-Purpose Address Registries.

   This memo updates [<a href="./rfc6890" title='"Special-Purpose IP Address Registries"'>RFC6890</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Definition%20of%20Globally%20Reachable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Definition of Globally Reachable</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC6890">RFC6890</a>] defined the term "global" without taking into consideration
   the multiple uses of the term.  Specifically, IP addresses can be
   global in terms of allocation scope as well as global in terms of
   routing/reachability.  To address this ambiguity, the use of the term
   "global" defined in [<a href="./rfc6890" title='"Special-Purpose IP Address Registries"'>RFC6890</a>] is replaced with "globally reachable".
   The following definition replaces the definition of "global" in the
   IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries:

   o  Globally Reachable - A boolean value indicating whether an IP
      datagram whose destination address is drawn from the allocated
      special-purpose address block is forwardable beyond a specified
      administrative domain.

   The same relationship between the value of "Destination" and the
   values of "Forwardable" and "Global" described in [<a href="./rfc6890" title='"Special-Purpose IP Address Registries"'>RFC6890</a>] holds for
   "Globally Reachable".  If the value of "Destination" is FALSE, the
   values of "Forwardable" and "Globally Reachable" must also be FALSE.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8190">RFC 8190</a>           Special-Purpose Address Registries          June 2017</span>


   The "Global" columns in the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry
   (<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry">https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry</a>) and the
   IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry
   (<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry">https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry</a>) have
   been renamed to "Globally Reachable".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Updates%20to%20the%20IPv4%20Special-Purpose%20Address%20Registry"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Updates to the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry</span>

   o  Limited Broadcast prefix (255.255.255.255/32) - The Reserved-by-
      Protocol value has changed from False to True.  This change was
      made to align the registry with reservation of the limited
      broadcast address with <a href="./rfc919#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC919]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Updates%20to%20the%20IPv6%20Special-Purpose%20Address%20Registry"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Updates to the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry</span>

   The following changes to the "IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry"
   involved the insertion of two new footnotes.  These additions
   required that the footnotes be renumbered.

   o  TEREDO prefix (2001::/32) - The Globally Reachable value has
      changed from False to "N/A [2]".  The [2] footnote now states:

      *  See <a href="./rfc4380#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC4380]</a> for details.

   o  EID Space for LISP (2001:5::/32) - All footnotes have been
      incremented by 1.

   o  6to4 (2002::/16) - All footnotes have been incremented by 1.

   o  Unique-Local (fc00::/7) - The Globally Reachable value has changed
      from False to "False [7]".  The [7] footnote now states:

      *  See [<a href="./rfc4193" title='"Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses"'>RFC4193</a>] for more details on the routability of Unique-
         Local addresses.  The Unique-Local prefix is drawn from the
         IPv6 Global Unicast Address range but is specified as not
         globally routed.

   This document does not raise any security issues beyond those
   discussed in [<a href="./rfc6890" title='"Special-Purpose IP Address Registries"'>RFC6890</a>].
