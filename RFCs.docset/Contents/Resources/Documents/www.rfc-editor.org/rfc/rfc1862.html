Abstract

   This document is a report on an Internet architecture workshop,
   initiated by the IAB and held at MCI on October 12-14, 1994.  This
   workshop generally focused on aspects of the information
   infrastructure on the Internet.

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
   groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), under the
   leadership of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and area
   directorates.

   An IAB-initiated workshop on the architecture of the "information
   infrastructure" of the Internet was held on October 12-14, 1994 at
   MCI in Tysons Corner, Virginia.

   In addition to the IAB members, attendees at this meeting included
   the IESG Area Directors for the relevant areas (Applications, User
   Services) and a group of other experts in the following areas:

   gopher, the World Wide Web, naming, WAIS, searching, indexing, and
   library services.  The IAB explicitly tried to balance the number of
   attendees from each area of expertise.  Logistics limited the
   attendance to about 35, which unfortunately meant that many highly
   qualified experts were omitted from the invitation list.

   The objectives of the workshop were to explore the architecture of
   "information" applications on the Internet, to provide the IESG with
   a solid set of recommendations for further work, and to provide a
   place for communication between the communities of people associated
   with the lower and upper layers of the Internet protocol suite, as
   well as allow experience to be exchanged between the communities.

   The 34 attendees divided into three "breakout groups" which met for
   the second half of the first day and the entire second day. Each
   group wrote a report of its activities. The reports are contained in
   this document, in addition to a set of specific recommendations to
   the IESG and IETF community.

   Although there were some disagreements between the groups on specific
   functionalities for architectural components, there was broad
   agreement on the general shape of an information architecture and on
   general principles for constructing the architecture. The discussions
   of the architecture generalized a number of concepts that are
   currently used in deployed systems such as the World Wide Web, but
   the main thrust was to define general architectural components rather
   than focus on current technologies.

   Research recommendations include:

  -  increased focus on a general caching and replication architecture

  -  a rapid deployment of name resolution services, and

  -  the articulation of a common security architecture for information
     applications.

   Procedural recommendations for forwarding this work in the IETF
   include:

  -  making common identifiers such as the IANA assigned numbers
     available in an on-line database

  -  tightening the requirements on Proposed Standards to insure that
     they adequately address security

   Because of the increasing popularity of accessing networked
   information, current Internet information services are experiencing
   performance, reliability, and scaling problems.  These are general
   problems, given the distributed nature of the Internet.  Current and
   future applications would benefit from much more widespread use of
   caching and replication.

   For instance, popular WWW and Gopher servers experience serious
   overloading, as many thousands of users per day attempt to access
   them simultaneously.  Neither of these systems was designed with
   explicit caching or replication support in the core protocol.
   Moreover, because the DNS is currently the only widely deployed
   distributed and replicated data storage system in the Internet, it is
   often used to help support more scalable operation in this
   environment -- for example, storing service-specific pointer
   information, or providing a means of rotating service accesses among
   replicated copies of NCSA's extremely popular WWW server.  In most
   cases, such uses of the DNS semantically overload the system.  The
   DNS may not be able to stand such "semantic extensions" and continue
   to perform well.  It was not designed to be a general-purpose
   replicated distributed database system.

   There are many examples of systems that need or would benefit from
   caching or replication.  Examples include key distribution for
   authentication services, DHCP, multicast SD, and Internet white
   pages.

   To date there have been a number of independent attempts to provide
   caching and replication facilities.  The question we address here is
   whether it might be possible to define a general service interface or
   protocol, so that caches and replica servers (implemented in a
   variety of ways to support a range of different situations) might

   interoperate, and so that we might reduce the amount of wasted re-
   implementation effort currently being expended.  Replication and
   caching schemes could form a sort of network "middleware" to fulfill
   a common need of distributed services.

   It should be noted that it is an open question whether it would be
   feasible to define a unified interface to all caching and replication
   problems.  For example, very different considerations must go into
   providing a system to support a nationwide video service for
   1,000,000 concurrent users than would be needed for supporting
   worldwide accesses to popular WWW pages.  We recommend research and
   experimentation to address this more general issue.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2%20Characteristics%20of%20Solutions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a> Characteristics of Solutions</span>

   While on the surface caching and replication may appear to occupy two
   ends of a spectrum, further analysis shows that these are two
   different approaches with different characteristics. There are cases
   where a combination of the two techniques is the optimal solution,
   which further complicates the situation.

   We can roughly characterize the two approaches as follows:

   Caching:

        - a cache contains a partial set of data

        - a cache is built on demand

        - a cache is audience-specific, since the cache is built in
          response to demands of a community

   Replication:

        - replicated databases contain the entire data set or a
          server-defined subset of a given database

        - a replicated database can return an authoritative answer about
          existence of an item

        - data is pushed onto the replicating server rather than pulled on
          demand

   While there are important differences between caches and replicated
   databases, there are some issues common to both, especially when
   considering how updates and data consistency can be handled.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


   A variety of methods can be used to update caches and replicas:

        - master-slave

        - peer-to-peer

        - flooding techniques (such as that used by NNTP).

   Which strategy one chooses influences important characteristics of
   the cache or replicated database, such as:

        - consistency of data

        - is locking used to achieve consistency? this influences
          performance...

        - are there a priori guarantees of existence of an item in the
          database (is the answer authoritative, do you detect conflicts
          after the fact, or is there no guarantee on authoritativeness of
          the answer?)

   Consistency guarantees depend on the granularity of synchronization
   (ms, sec, hr, day), and there are cases where it is acceptable to
   trade consistency for better performance or availability. Since there
   is a range of qualities of service with respect to consistency and
   performance, we would like to be able to tune these parameters for a
   given application. However, we recognize that this may not be
   possible in all cases since it is unlikely one can implement a high
   performance solution to all of these problems in a single system.

   Beyond simply performing replication or caching, there is a need for
   managing cache and replication servers. There are several models for
   organizing groups of caches/replication servers that range from
   totally adaptive to a rigidly administered, centrally controlled
   model:

    - a club model. Minimal administrative overhead to join the club.
      Participation is a function of disk space, CPU, available
      network bandwidth.

    - centrally coordinated service. Here administrators can take
      advantage of their knowledge of the system's topology and the
      community they intend to serve. There may be scaling problems
      with this model.

    - hybrid combinations of the club and centrally coordinated models

   There are a couple of models for how to organize the management of a
   group of cooperating servers, but this does not address the question
   of what sorts of commands the manager (be it a person or a program)
   issues to a cache or replicated server. A manager needs to be able to
   address issues on a server such as:

    - control of caching algorithms, defining how information is aged
      out of the cache based on disk space, usage demands, etc. This is
      where you would control time-to-live and expiry settings.

    - flushing the cache. There are circumstances where the
      information source has become inaccessible and the normal cache
      aging strategy is inappropriate since you will not be able to
      get the information again for an indeterminate amount of time.

    - management control might also be a way for information providers
      to control how information is pushed on servers for maintaining
      data consistency, but this raises tricky problems with trust and
      authentication.

   Given a common set of management controls needed, a common protocol
   would allow for simplified management of a collection of caching and
   replicating servers since you would be able to both control them with
   a single set of commands and query them about their capabilities. A
   common language/protocol would also allow different implementations
   to interoperate.

   Replicating or caching information immediately raises issues of
   billing, access control and authentication. Ignoring authentication
   and access control issues simplifies the replication and caching
   problem a great deal. Exactly who is running the replication or
   caching server makes a big difference in how you approach this issue.
   If the information publisher runs a set of servers, they can easily
   handle billing and authentication. On the other hand, if an
   organization is running a cache on its firewall (a boundary cache),
   and purchasing information from a vendor, there are sticky issues
   regarding intellectual property in this scenario.

   Selecting an appropriate cache or replica of a database is simple in
   the case of a captive user group (for instance a company behind a
   firewall). In this case, configuring the user's software to go
   through one or more boundary caches/replication servers directs the
   users to the closest server. In the more general case, there are
   several replicated/cached copies of an object, so you may receive
   several URLs when you resolve a URN. How do you select the best URL?

   Either client developers create ad hoc performance metrics or (in an
   ideal world) the lower level protocols would give the client

   application some guidance about the "closest" copy of the object.  In
   other words, if better information about network performance was
   available from lower levels of the protocol stack, applications would
   not have to build ad hoc models of network topology

   We did not model the functions of a cache/replication server in
   detail, but we did an (incomplete) model of some of the functions
   (see Figure 1). The idea here was to start work on a general form
   which might include features such as a push function for use in both
   maintaining consistency and in preloading information that the
   information publisher believes will be requested in the near future.

   Preloading information via a push command might be a function of
   observed behavior patterns (when you ask for A you'll probably want B
   and C). The decision about what to preload can be made either by the
   information publisher or by the cache server. The cache server has
   the advantage that it has better knowledge of the use patterns of its
   community. The distributed nature of links to other servers also
   limit the knowledge of a single information publisher. In any case,
   being able to accurately predict usage patterns can result in
   significant performance enhancements for caches.

   Caching and replication are important pieces of Internet middleware,
   and solutions need to be found soon. Caches and replicas have
   different performance characteristics, and there are cases where a
   combination of the two provides the best solution. There are also
   many strategies for updating and maintaining consistency of caches
   and replicated databases, and we do not believe any single
   implementation can suffice for the broad range of needs in the
   Internet.  One possible solution would be to define a general
   protocol for a replicated distributed database and for caching so
   that different information application implementations can
   interoperate and be managed via a common management interface.  A
   common protocol would provide a framework for future protocols (e.g.,
   URN2URL, DHCP) or existing protocols (e.g., Gopher or WWW) that
   presently lack a consistent solution.

   This group took as its central agenda exploring an information
   architecture, the services that would instantiate such an
   architecture, and the functional interfaces between a realization of
   such an architecture and both layers on which it would sit and the
   layers that would sit on it.  In order to describe an architecture,
   one must describe not only what it includes, but also what it
   excludes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20The%20core%20model%20and%20service%20structure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>. The core model and service structure</span>

   The general architecture has as its centerpiece objects, or as they
   are known in the Uniform Resource Identifier Working Group,
   resources.  An object in this architecture has several
   characteristics.  First, it has an identifier, assigned within the
   context of some namespace.  Such an identifier is globally unique and
   will not be reassigned to another object.  Thus, it can be said to be
   globally unique for a long time. Because such an identifier must
   remain unique for all time, it cannot contain location-relevant
   information ... locations can and will be reused. Also, since
   resources may appear in zero, one, or many locations simultaneously,
   location-dependent information can lead to a vast number of
   identifiers for an object, which will make it difficult to identify
   separately retrieved copies of an object as being the same object.
   These locations are defined by the supporting layers that provide
   transport and access. Therefore the definition of locations is not
   within the architecture, although their existence is accepted.
   Second, an object will support one or more abstract types.  Further
   determination beyond this statement was not made.  One can conclude
   from these two points that an object cannot be part of such an
   architected universe without having at least one such identifier and
   without supporting at least one type if it has at least one location.

   In addition, the architecture contains several other components.
   First, there will be a prescribed class of objects called links that
   express a relationship among other objects including the nature of
   that relationship.  It is through links that composite objects
   composed of related objects can be created and managed.  Finally,
   there is a need for several sorts of meta-information, both in order
   to discover identifiers (e.g. for indices and in support of
   searching) and to aid in the process of mapping an identifier to one
   or more potential locations.  Both of these sorts of meta-information
   are associated with objects, although they will be used and therefore



<span class="grey">McCahill, et al              Informational                      [Page 9]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-10"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


   most likely managed differently, to support their distinctive access
   and update requirements.

   Given this architecture of information objects, one can identify
   several boundary points.  First, something that does not have an
   identifier or type is outside the architecture.  Second, the
   architecture does not, at this point, include any statement about
   computations, or communications paradigms other than second-handedly
   by assuming that traversal of links will occur.  Third, although
   pre-fetching, caching, and replication are important, such details
   may be hidden from higher level software components, and thus are not
   part of the data model exposed to the application in the normal case
   (though some applications may want to specify such characteristics).

   Now one can ask how such a model fits into a layered network model,
   how it might be modularized and realized.  We envisioned this
   information layer as an information "wholesale" layer.  It provides
   the general, broad model and provision of shared, network-based
   information.  Above this sit the "retailers," the marketers or
   providers of information to the marketplace of applications users.
   Below the "wholesalers" lie the providers of "raw materials."  Here
   will be the provision of supporting mechanisms and architecture from
   which information objects can come.

   The remainder of this group's report describes the modular
   decomposition of the wholesale layer, including the interactions
   among those modules, separate discussions of the interactions first
   between the retail and wholesale layers and then between the
   wholesale and raw material layers.  The report concludes with
   recommendations for where the most effective immediate efforts could
   be made to provide for the wholesale layer and make it useful.

   In order to realize the information architecture in the network a
   variety of classes of services or functionality must be provided.  In
   each case, there will be many instances of a sort of service,
   coordinating to a lesser or greater degree, but all within the
   general Internet model of autonomy and loose federation.  There also
   may be variants of any sort of service, to provide more specialized
   or constrained service.  In addition, services may exist that will
   provide more than one of these services, where that is deemed useful.
   Each such service will reside in one or more administrative domains
   and may be restricted or managed based on policies of those domains.
   The list of core services is described below.  Because there are many
   interdependencies, there may often be forward references in
   describing a service and its relationships to other services.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


   * RESOURCE DISCOVERY: Much of the activity of resource discovery,
   indexing and searching, will be in the domain of the retailers,
   although there are supporting hooks that can be provided by the
   wholesaler layer as well.  A resource discovery service will hold
   mappings from descriptions to identifiers of objects.  They will need
   to be queried.  Thus there is a general functionality for a wholesale
   layer service that answers queries formulated in certain ways and
   responds with identifiers.  The business of on what basis indices are
   computed or how they are managed will be domain specific.

   * NAMING or IDENTIFICATION: There are two aspects to assigning an
   identifier to an object, one in the wholesale layer, and one,
   arguably, in the retail layer.  In the wholesale layer, one can
   generate identifiers that are guaranteed to be unique.  In the retail
   layer one might ask the question about whether two objects are the
   same or different by the rules of an identification authority that
   therefore would determine whether they should bear the same or
   different identification from that authority.  It should be noted
   that the URI Working Group has included these two functions in the
   requirements document for URNs.

   An identification service will obviously provide functionality to the
   uniqueness authority.  It will also provide identification in the
   process of publication of objects, as will be discussed below, in the
   management of resource discovery information, object location and
   storage services, as well as cache and replication management.

   * NAME or IDENTIFICATION RESOLUTION: Since identifiers are presumed
   to be location independent, there is a need for a resolution service.
   Such a service may sometimes return other identifiers at this same
   level of abstraction (the equivalent of aliases) or location
   information, the information delivered to a transport service to
   access or retrieve an object.

   * OBJECT RETRIEVAL: Object retrieval is tightly coupled to
   resolution, because without resolution it cannot proceed.  Object
   retrieval provides the functionality of causing a representation of
   an object to be provided locally to the requester of an object
   retrieval.  This may involve the functionality of object publication
   (see below) and object storage, caching and replication services as
   well as the supporting transport facilities.

   * OBJECT PUBLICATION: When an object comes into existence in the
   universe of the information infrastructure, it is said to be
   "published."  There will be two common scenarios in publication.  One
   will be the use of tools to directly enter and create the information
   that comprises an object in the information infrastructure.  Thus
   there may be object creation tools visible to users in applications.



<span class="grey">McCahill, et al              Informational                     [Page 11]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-12"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


   In contrast there may also be tools outside the information
   infrastructure (for example word processing or text editing tools)
   that provide for the entry of data separately from the operation of
   assigning an object an identifier and causing it to support
   information infrastructure definitions of objects.  Thus, there will
   also be visible at the interface between the wholesale and retail
   layers the ability to cause some pre-existing data to become one or
   more objects.  In addition to interacting with the identification
   service, publication is likely to cause interaction with object
   storage, and possibly caching and replication.

   * DEFINITIONS: If the information infrastructure is to both survive
   and evolve over a long time period, we must be prepared for a wide
   variety and growing number of different sorts of information with
   different functionalities that each supports.  For objects available
   on the net, the functionality that each provides must be exposed or
   able to be learned.  To do this objects must be able to indicate by
   name or identifier the types of functionality they are supporting.
   Given such an identifier, an object is only useful to a client, if
   the client can discover the definition and perhaps a useful
   implementation of the type in question.  This will be acquired from a
   definitions service, which will be used in conjunction with
   applications themselves directly, object publication, and object
   retrieval.

   * ATTRIBUTE MANAGEMENT: The attributes considered here relate to
   policy, although any understanding of that policy will be above the
   wholesale level.  There are, for example, access management and
   copyright attributes.  There is a question here about whether there
   is or should be any access time enforcement or only after the fact
   enforcement.  The information is likely to be in the form of
   attribute-value pairs and must be able to capture copyright knowledge
   effectively.

   * ACCOUNTING: An accounting service provides metering of the use of
   resources.  The resources wholly contained in the wholesale layer are
   the services discussed here.  It will also be important to provide
   metering tools in the wholesale layer to be used by the retail layer
   to meter usage or content access in that layer.  Metering may be used
   for a variety of purposes ranging from providing better utilization
   or service from the resources to pricing and billing.  Hence
   accounting services will be used by object storage, caching and
   replication, lower layer networking services, as well as pricing and
   billing services.  In the form of content metering it will also
   interact with attribute management.






<span class="grey">McCahill, et al              Informational                     [Page 12]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


   * PRICING, BILLING and PAYMENT: Pricing and payment services straddle
   two layers in the information infrastructure.  Servers that maintain
   account balances and with which users interact to retrieve and edit
   account information are applications that will be built on top of
   wholesale layer services.  Pricing will be determined in the
   applications environment for application level activities.  However,
   it must be possible for middle layer services to process payment
   instruments analogous to cash, credit card slips, and checks, without
   an understanding of the specific implementation of the payment
   mechanism.  Application programming interfaces supporting payment
   should be provided, and a common tagged representation of payment
   instruments should allow instruments from a variety of payment
   systems to be presented within middle layer protocols.

   * OBJECT STORAGE, CACHING and REPLICATION: There is a recognition
   that caching and replication are important, but the discussion of
   that was left to another group that had taken that as the focus of
   their agenda.  Object storage will take an object and put it
   somewhere, while maintaining both the identity and nature of the
   object.  It is tightly coupled to caching and replication, as well as
   accounting, often in order to determine patterns of caching and
   replication.  It is also tightly coupled to object publication,
   translation, and provides interfaces to both supporting storage
   facilities such as local file systems, as well as direct access from
   applications, needing access to objects.

   * TRANSLATION: A translation service allows an object to behave with
   a nature different than that it would otherwise support.  Thus, for
   example, it might provide a WYSIWYG interface to an object whose
   functionality might not otherwise support that, or it might generate
   text on the fly from an audio stream.  Translation services will be
   used by object publication (allowing for identification of an object
   including a translation of it) and with object storage, providing an
   interface only within the wholesale or to the retail layers.

   * SERVER AND SERVICE LOCATION: It will be necessary as part of the
   infrastructure to be able to find services of the kinds described
   here and the servers supporting them.  This service has direct
   contact with the lower layer of raw materials, in that it will
   provide, in the final analysis, the addresses needed to actually
   locate objects and services using lower level protocols, such as the
   existing access protocols in use today, for example FTP, SMTP, HTTP,
   or TCP.  This service will provide functionality directly to resource
   discovery as well as remote object storage services.







<span class="grey">McCahill, et al              Informational                     [Page 13]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


   * ADAPTIVE GLUE: This is not a single service as much as a
   recognition that there must be a path for a flow of information
   between the network layers and the applications.  The application may
   have constraints, based both on its own needs as well as needs of the
   objects in the wholesale layer.  Only the application can really know
   what compromises in services provided below are acceptable to it.  At
   the same time, the supporting network layers understand what
   qualities of service are available at what price.  Hence there is the
   potential for flow of information both up and down through the
   wholesale layer, perhaps mediated by the wholesale layer.  Hence the
   adaptive glue has hooks into all three levels.

   * SECURITY: Security services will be a critical piece of the
   infrastructure architecture.  For any real business to be conducted,
   organizations must make their information available over the network,
   yet they require the ability to control access to that information on
   a per user and per object basis.  To account properly for the use of
   higher level services, organization must be able to identify and
   authenticate their users accurately.  Finally, payment services must
   be based on security to prevent fraudulent charges, or disclosure of
   compromising information.

   The two biggest problems in providing security services at the
   wholesale layer are poor infrastructure and multiple security
   mechanisms that need to be individually integrated with applications.
   The poor state of the infrastructure is the result of a lack of an
   accepted certification hierarchy for authentication.  A commonly held
   position is that there will not be a single hierarchy, but there must
   be established authorities whose assertions are widely accepted, who
   indirectly certify the identities of individuals with which one has
   not had prior contact.

   Integration with applications is made difficult because, though
   security services are themselves layered upon one another, such
   services do not fit into the information architecture at a single
   layer.  By integrating security services with lower layers of the
   information infrastructure, security can be provided to higher
   layers, but some security information, such as client's identity, may
   be needed at higher layers, so such support will not be completely
   transparent.  Further, the security requirements for each middle
   layer information service, and of the application itself, must be
   considered and appropriate use must be made of the middle-layer
   security services applied.

   Integration with applications will require user demand for security,
   together with common interfaces such as the GSS-API, so that
   applications and middle layer information services can utilize the
   security services that are available, without understanding the



<span class="grey">McCahill, et al              Informational                     [Page 14]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-15"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


   details of the specific security mechanism that is employed.

   * BOOTSTRAPPING: In order for a newly participating machine to join
   the infrastructure, it must have some way of finding out about at
   least one instance of many of the services described here.  This can
   be done either by providing it with some form of configuration
   provided by the human bringing it up or by a bootstrapping service.
   The bootstrapping service is more flexible and manageable; it is
   included here in recognition that this information must be provided
   in some form or other.  The bootstrapping service will sit directly
   on the raw materials layer and will have contact with all the
   services described here.

   This completes the description of the services as identified by this
   group in the wholesale layer.  Although this section suggests which
   services have interfaces to the retail and raw materials layers, each
   of these topics will need to be described separately as well, to
   clarify the functionality expected by each layer of the layer below.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Interface%20to%20retail%20layer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Interface to retail layer</span>

   The interface to the retail layer is the embodiment of the object
   model and attendant services.  Thus the interface provides the
   application environment with a collection of objects having
   identifiers for distinguishing them within the wholesale layer and
   support for a typing or abstract functionality model.  It provides
   for the ability to create or import objects into this object world by
   the publication paradigm, and allows objects to evolve to support new
   or evolving functionality through the translation paradigm.  Access
   to the objects is provided by object storage, enhanced with caching
   and replication services and mediated by the attributes managed by
   attribute management and accounting or content metering.  Discovery
   of resources (figuring out which identifier to be chasing) is
   provided by resource discovery services.  Types are registered and
   hence available both as definitions and perhaps in the form of
   implementations from a definition service.  Lastly, there is a
   vertical model of providing the two-way services of adaptive glue for
   quality of service negotiation and for security constraints and
   requirements, with access and services at all three layers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Interface%20to%20the%20raw%20materials%20layer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Interface to the raw materials layer</span>

   The raw materials layer falls into networking and operating systems.
   Hence it provides all those services currently available from current
   networking and operating systems.  Wholesale services such as object
   management will be dependent on local operating system support such
   as a file system, as well as perhaps transport protocols.  In fact,
   all instances of any of the above services will be dependent on local

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


   storage, process management, local access control and other security
   mechanisms, as well as general transport protocols for communications
   both often among services of the same sort and among services
   dependent on each other that may not be collocated.  In addition the
   group identified a set of issues that appear important for the
   networking components of the raw materials layer to provide to the
   wholesale layer in addition to the basic best effort transmission
   services that are commonly available.  These take the form of a wish
   list with the recognition that they are not all equally easy or
   possible.

   * Connectivity: It is useful and important for the operation of
   applications and the wholesale services to understand what
   connectivity is currently available.  The group identified four
   categories of connectivity that it would be useful to know about
   represented by four questions:

        1) Is there a wire out of the back of my machine?

        2) Am I connected to a router?

        3) Am I connected to the global internet?  (Can I get beyond
           my own domain?)

        4) Am I connected to a specific host?

   These are probably in increasing difficulty of knowing.

   * Connectivity forecast: Although this is recognized as either
   extremely difficult or impossible to do, some form of connectivity
   forecast would be very useful to the upper layers

   * Bandwidth availability and reservation: It is useful for the
   application to know both what bandwidth might be available to it and,
   better yet, for it to be able to make some form of reservation.

   * Latency availability and reservation: It is useful for the
   application to know both what latency the network is experiencing
   and, better yet, be able to set limits on it by means of a
   reservation.

   * Reliability availability and reservation: Again, reliability
   constraints are important for many applications, although they may
   have differing reliability constraints and may be able to adapt
   differently to different circumstances.  But, if the application
   could make a statement (reservation) about what level of
   unreliability it can tolerate, it might be able to make tradeoffs.




<span class="grey">McCahill, et al              Informational                     [Page 16]</span></pre>

   * Burstiness support: Although it is unlikely that the network can
   make predictions about the burstiness of its services, if the
   application can predict to the network its burstiness behavior, the
   network might be able to take advantage of that knowledge.

   * Service envelope: It is possible that, as an alternative to the
   above four issues, the raw materials layer could negotiate a whole
   service envelope with the layers it is supporting.

   * Security availability: In many cases, it will be important for the
   upper layers to be able to know what sorts and levels of security are
   available from the raw materials layer.  This is true of both any
   operating system support as well as transmission.

   * Cost: If there is to be usage charging at other than fixed flat
   rates, it will be important for applications and users to understand
   what those costs or at least estimates of them will be.

   * Policy routing: If it will be important for transport services to
   support policy routing, it will be important for users of the
   transport services to identify into which policy classes they might
   fall.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.5.%20Recommendations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" id="section-4.5">4.5</a>. Recommendations</span>

   This group has two categories of recommendations.  One is those
   services in the wholesale layer that will both be especially useful
   and readily achieved because work is soon to be or already underway.
   The other set of recommendations was a three item rank ordering of
   services that are most important for the lower layer to provide to
   the wholesale layer.

   Within the wholesale layer, the first services that should be
   provided are:

        * Object retrieval,

        * Name resolution,

        * Caching and replication.

   In addition, the group rank ordered three areas in which there would
   be quick payoff if the raw materials layer could provide them.  They
   are:

        1. Connectivity

        2. Bandwidth, latency, and reliability or service envelope

        3. Security constraints on communication and transactions

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20Group%202B%20Report%3A%20Components%20of%20an%20Internet%20Information%20Architecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. Group 2B Report: Components of an Internet Information Architecture</span>

   Cecilia Preston, Chris Weider, Christian Huitema, Cliff Lynch, John
   Romkey, Joyce Reynolds, Larry Masinter, Mitra, Jill Foster

   Group 2B discussed various aspects of problems in the Internet
   Information Infrastructure, thinking about recommendations to the
   IESG to focus on particular areas, and also paying attention to some
   of the philosophical and economic backgrounds to some of the
   problems. Economics can dictate some points of architecture: one can
   see economically why a publisher might bear the burden of the costs
   of publishing, or a consumer might bear the burden of costs
   associated with consumption, but not how some free-floating third
   party would necessarily bear the costs of providing services (such as
   third-party translators).

   The group discussed the following topics:

   access(URL)

   gateways

   URN resolution

   definitions

   updates

   service location

   cache &amp; replication

   security &amp; authentication

   payments, charging

   presentation

   search &amp; index

   metainformation

   boot service

   general computation

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1%20URNs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a> URNs</span>

   There are several issues in the use of Uniform Resource Names and
   Uniform Resource Locators. URN resolution is a database lookup that
   returns the URLs associated with a URN. The architecture must take
   into account not only how the lookup is performed, but how the
   database is maintained. Both the lookup problem and the update
   problem must be solved at the same time to allow deployment of URNs.

   There are at least two problems in human interaction with unique
   names. First, the notion of a unique name is a fallacy. Unique naming
   cannot be enforced. Names may be forged or may simply be duplicated
   due to human error. The architecture must accept this observation and
   still operate in the face of it. Designing for global uniqueness, but
   not requiring it, was adequate. Errors based on names not being
   unique are likely to be insignificant compared to other errors.

   Also, people frequently make assertions and assumptions about names
   rather than the documents that are being named. Making assertions
   about names is working at the wrong level of indirection. Making
   assumptions about names, such as determining the contents of the
   named object from the syntax of the name, can lead to nasty
   surprises.

   Having a single, unified naming system is vital. While it is healthy
   to have multiple competing forms of other aspects of the information
   architecture, the naming system is what ties it all together. There
   must be only one naming system. If there is more than one, it may not
   be possible to compare names or to lookup locations based on names,
   and we will continue (to our detriment) to use locators rather than
   names.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2%20Global%20Service%20Location"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a> Global Service Location</span>

   The IANA has become the central switch point for service
   identification.  and recommended that numbers that are formally
   defined and kept in documents for use in distributed information
   systems (for instance, Assigned Numbers) should also be distributed
   online in some kind of database for use by applications. This
   distribution requires both an access method (perhaps multiple access
   methods) and an update method.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3%20Security"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a> Security</span>

   Issues involving security arose over and over again. Security
   includes things like validation of authority, confidentiality,
   integrity of data, integrity of services, access control. The group
   agreed that, although often overlooked, confidentiality is important,



<span class="grey">McCahill, et al              Informational                     [Page 19]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-20"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1862">RFC 1862</a>                  IAB Workshop Report              November 1995</span>


   and, more strongly: anonymity is important. It should be possible to
   access documents or objects without the architecture requiring you to
   leave digital fingerprints all over the place.

   Security must occur on an end-to-end basis. Documents or objects used
   on the Internet may not only traverse the Internet. Relying on
   security mechanisms in the underlying protocol suite does not
   necessarily provide end-to-end authentication or confidentiality.

   Currently lower layer security is ill-defined and widely
   unimplemented. Designers building information applications atop the
   Internet currently receive little guidance in how to design security
   features into their applications, leading to weak ad hoc or
   nonexistent security in new applications. Designers are also unclear
   as to how to deal with the "security considerations" section that is
   mandatory in RFCs, and often fill them with boilerplate text.

   Furthermore, retrofitting security into existing architectures does
   not work well. The best systems are built considering security from
   the very beginning. Some systems are being designed that, for
   instance, have no place for a digital signature to authenticate the
   data they pass.  These issues apply to data management as well.

   The group makes the following recommendations to the IESG regarding
   security:

   A. Develop and communicate a security model usable by designers of
   information applications - current models are not considered usable.

   B. RFC authors should be given advice on what security considerations
   need to be outlined and how to write them. The IESG security area
   should prepare guidelines for writing security considerations.

   C. Proposed Standards should not be accepted by the IESG unless they
   really consider security. This will require that recommendations A
   and B have been implemented and that the guidelines have received
   enough visibility to reasonably expect authors to know of their
   existence.

   D. Develop security modules usable by the implementors of information
   clients and servers - reusable across many different, heterogeneous
   applications and platforms.

   E. Make clear what security services you can expect from the lower
   layers.

   F. Make sure that the key distribution infrastructure is reviewed for
   usability by information applications.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.4%20Search%20and%20Index"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" id="section-5.4">5.4</a> Search and Index</span>

   Searching is looking through directories that point to information.
   Indexing is scanning information to create directories. A "unified
   directory" is the result of combining several indices.

   Indexing is currently done on the Internet via many mechanisms. Given
   the current ad hoc nature of the indexing, information is frequently
   indexed multiple times. This is wasteful, but due to the current
   economics of the Internet, it tends not to cost more money. If the
   Internet (or parts of thereof) transitions to usage based charging,
   it may cost the information provider too much to allow the
   information to be indexed. In general, the provider should have
   control over how the information they control is indexed.

   Above all, the architecture should not encourage a situation where
   information is normally not indexed. It should encourage the
   collection of indexing data only a single time. Having a local
   computation of a summary which is sent to a search/index server is
   vastly preferable to having that server "walk the net" to discover
   information to index.

   Indexing and search techniques are quite varied. It is quite likely
   that index and search are too close to general computation to try to
   standardize on a single protocol for either. Instead, it is important
   that the architecture allow multiple search techniques. There are
   currently certain types of indices that can only be generated by
   humans because of their level of semantic content. There are large
   differences in the quality and usability of indices that are
   machine-generated vs. human generated.

   Unified directories tend to combine indexing results from quite
   different techniques. The architecture should constrain indexing so
   that it remains possible to merge the results of two searches done by
   different protocols or indexing systems. Returning information in
   standard formats such as URNs can help this problem.

   Vocabulary issues in search and index are very difficult. The library
   and information services communities do not necessarily use
   vocabulary that is consistent with the IETF community, which can lead
   to difficult misunderstandings.

   "Searching the Internet" is an inappropriate attempt to categorize
   the information you're attempting to search. Instead, we search
   certain public spaces on the Internet. The concept of public space
   vs. private space on the Internet deserves further investigation.

   Indexing can run afoul of access control considerations. Access
   control must be done at the object, but access control information
   should be propagated through indices as well. The index should be
   able to say "you're not allowed to ask that" rather than the user
   attempting to retrieve the object and being denied.

   An architectural point was raised that an index query should return
   the same result independent of who is asking. This is an important
   notion in the Domain Name System. This is inconsistent with some
   real-world indexing (for instance, corporate record management
   systems) which doesn't want to admit that some documents exist if
   you're not allowed to read them.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.5%20Miscellaneous"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.5" id="section-5.5">5.5</a> Miscellaneous</span>

   Electronic mail, netnews, FTP and the web are frequently used to
   access information on the net today. Each protocol seems to provide a
   consistent view of the information on the Internet. In addition, the
   recent popularity of multi-protocol clients such as Mosaic seem to
   imply that the information content of the Internet is uniformly
   retrievable and manageable.  This perception is misleading because
   most protocols are used for other applications than they were
   originally designed for. In addition, Telnet, which has no concept of
   information retrieval and management, is often used to access
   information as well, for example in DIALOG and card file accesses.
   Since each protocol has different access and management capabilities,
   the inconsistencies show up in erratic search and retrieval results,
   puzzling error messages, and a basic lack of standard techniques for
   dealing with information. A consistent underlying information
   architecture will go a long way towards alleviating these problems.

   As the information architecture develops we should reconsider the
   electronic mail and netnews architecture in terms of the new
   architecture.

   The group noted that there have been difficulties in scheduling joint
   working group meetings and recommends that there be a clearly defined
   process inside the IETF to facilitate scheduling such meetings.

   The workshop provided an opportunity for ongoing conversations about
   the architecture to continue and also provided space for focused
   examination of some issues and for some new voices and experience
   from other areas of Internet growth to participate in the
   architectural process.

   Part of the conclusion of the workshop is a set of recommendations to
   the IESG and IETF community.

   Recommendations on research/implementation directions:

   1. Caching and replication are important and overlooked pieces of
   Internet middleware. We should do something about it as soon as
   possible, perhaps by defining an architecture and service model for
   common implementation.

   2. Within the 'wholesale' layer, i.e. within the layer which provides
   a consistent view of the information resources available on the
   Internet, the first services that should be provided are:

        * Object retrieval,

        * Name resolution,

        * Caching and replication.

   3. There would be quick payoff if the raw materials layer, i.e. the
   layer in which information resources are physically transmitted to
   computers, could provide the following services:

        * Connectivity

        * Bandwidth, latency, and reliability or  a service envelope

        * Security constraints on communication and transactions

   4. Develop security modules usable by the implementors of information
   clients and servers - reusable across many different, heterogeneous
   applications and platforms

Recommendations to the IESG, IETF, and IANA

   1. Numbers that are formally defined and kept in documents in
   distributed information systems (for instance, Assigned Numbers)
   should be available in some kind of database for use by applications.

   2. Develop and communicate a security model usable by designers of
   information applications - current models are not considered usable
   or are not widely accepted on the Internet.

   3. RFC authors should be given advice on how security considerations
   need to be written. The IESG security area should prepare guidelines
   for writing security considerations.

   4. Proposed Standards should not be accepted by the IESG unless they
   really consider security. This will require recommendations 2 and 3
   to be implemented first.

   5. Make clear what security services you can expect from the lower
   layers.

   6. Make sure that the key distribution infrastructure is reviewed for
   usability by information applications.

   7. There needs to be a process inside the IETF for scheduling a joint
   meeting between two working groups - for example, so that the key
   distribution WG can meet jointly with IIIR.

APPENDIX A - Workshop Organization

   The workshop was held at MCI's facility in Tyson Corners, Virginia.
   The workshop organizers and attendees wish to thank MCI for the use
   of their facilities to host the workshop.

   All attendees met in joint session for the first half of October 12.
   They then split into three groups. The first group considered the
   "distributed database" problem which has arisen over and over again
   in the design of parts of the Internet. The two other groups met to
   consider a list of issues pertaining to the information
   infrastructure. The groups ran independently until the morning of
   October 14, when they met again in joint session.
