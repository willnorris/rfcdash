                       <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST QUESTIONNAIRE</span>



        The answer to a number of questions about the characteristics
and operation of Network HOSTS will be useful to implementers of some
early versions of TELNET, and/or to the USER/SERVER SITE PROTOCOL
Committee in their consideration of a full TELNET PROTOCOL
specification.


        Questions of current interest are covered on the attached
questionnaire.  The Technical Liaison contact at each HOST site is asked
to review these questions and fill in the answers as soon as convenient
after receipt.


        One of the members of the committee listed below will contact
each HOST site by telephone in the next few days to record the answers.

   Committee members include:

         Bob Long                   SDC

         John Melvin                SRI/ARC

         Ed Meyer                   MIT/MAC

         Tom O'Sullivan             RDS


        Results of the questionnaire will be tabulated and distributed
as an RFC.

System**  _____________________________  Date  _____________________

1.)    Does system operate on keyboard terminal input on one
       character at a time (e.g. searching for a special
       character other than end of line), or does it accumulate
       a line at a time and operate on the line when a
       special character is entered, e.g. Carriage Return (CR)?

         [ ]  Line at time

         [ ]  Character at time

         [ ]  Both (Explain) __________________________________

       _____________________________________________________________

2.)    What maximum buffer size does your system provide for
       input of a physical line from a keyboard terminal, and
       for output to a terminal, printer, or screen?

            Input______Char

            Output_____Char

   answers on back of page.

** Fill out separate questionnaire for each HOST to be directly
   interfaced to an IMP.

3.)    Describe the effect in your system of use of the following
       keying conventions.  Indicate how implemented, i.e. is there
       a hardware interrupt?  Does the terminal respond?  How?
       What is sent into system as data, what is echoed, etc.
       If the key(s) are not available, so indicate (as may be
       the case for Newline for some systems, line feed for 2741's,
       etc.). If available but has no meaning, so indicate.

       If appropriate, enter data for other terminal types on the
       back of this page.


4.)    What special character or characters are used in your
       system to awaken some process during the entry of data
       from a terminal (e.g. control C for some systems, break on
       others, etc.)?

       the code.

7.)    For each terminal type do you support it in:

       Half Duplex (Pure) _______________________________________

       Half Duplex (with Break or Attention) ____________________

       Half Duplex (Break &amp; Reverse Break) ______________________

       Full Duplex (without echo) _______________________________

       Full Duplex (with echo) __________________________________


8.)   For optional echo systems, at initial connect time
      is the terminal assumed to require an echo?

            [ ] Yes

            [ ] No

9.)   Does your system perform error detection (e.g. parity
      check) on terminal input and, if so, is this a hardware
