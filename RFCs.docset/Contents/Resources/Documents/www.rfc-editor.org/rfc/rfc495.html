                     TELNET Protocol Specification

Following much discussion of TELNET via the RFC series, an open meeting
was held at UCLA on 5 March to formulate a new specification for the
TELNET Protocol.  Two attached documents (TELNET Protocol Specification,
NIC #15372, and TELNET Option Specifications, NIC #15373) report the
results of that meeting, which was attended by: Alex McKenzie, BBN-NET,
co-chairman; Jon Postel, UCLA-NMC, co-chairman; Bob Braden, UCLA-CCN;
Vint Cerf, Stanford University; Bernie Cosell, BBN-NET; Dave Crocker,
UCLA-NMC; Steve Crocker, ARPA; John Davidson, Univ. of Hawaii; Gary
Grossman, Univ. of Illinois; Bob Merryman, UCSD; Lou Nelson, UCLA-NMC;
Mike Padlipsky, MIT-MULTICS: Milt Reese, FNW; Bob Thomas, BBN-TENEX;
Steve Wolfe, UCLA-CCN.


The two attached specifications referenced above have been reviewed by
the meeting attendees, and should be viewed as the "official" TELNET
Protocol (subject to the implementation schedule given below).
Nevertheless, these documents are still subject to minor revisions and
any pertinent comments should be addressed to me at the NIC as AAM, or
by mail at:

                           Alex McKenzie
                           Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.
                           50 Moulton Street
                           Cambridge, Ma. 02138

   There are two key dates for a phasing in of the new protocol:  the
   date when sites should feel free to send the "new" form of TELNET
   commands and special codes without expecting to receive "error"
   responses, and the date when sites may remove the code which
   processes the "old" form of TELNET commands.  Between these two
   dates, sites may gradually implement and test the "interpreter" for
   the new commands.  It was the sense of the meeting that appropriate
   lead times to these two dates were about 60 and 260 days.
   Accordingly, these two dates are hereby established as 1 July 1973
   and 1 January 1974.

   I have also attached specifications for TELNET options which allow
   negotiation of:

            o binary transmission
            o echoing
            o reconnection
            o suppression of "Go Ahead"
            o approximate message size
            o use of a "timing mark"
            o discussion of status
            o extension of option code set

   These specifications have been prepared by Dave Walden (BBN-NET) with
   the help of Bernie Cosell, Ray Tomlinson (BBN-TENEX) and Bob Thomas;
   by Jerry Burchfiel (BBN-TENEX); and by David Crocker (ULCA-NMC).  It
   appears that these options cover most of the capabilities of the
   current version of TELNET, with the exception of "Hide Your Input."
   Dave Walden has also promised to specify the following options in the
   near future:

            o NVT printer line width negotiation
            o NVT printer page size negotiation
            o negotiation of the mapping between the line terminator
              character available on a physical terminal (e.g., LF,
              CR, NL) and the NVT characters to be transmitted
              (e.g., CR NUL, LF, CR LF).

   Dave has also announced his intent to seek collaboration with
   Gary Grossman, Bob Braden, and perhaps others in defining an
   EBCDIC option.  The announcement of intent to specify these
   options should, of course, be seen as useful information rather
   than as the granting of an "exclusive right" to Dave, or any
   other author.

   I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Bernie Cosell
   in the preparation of the protocol specification.
