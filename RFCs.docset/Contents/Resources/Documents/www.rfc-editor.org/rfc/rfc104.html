                                Link 191

At the Network meeting at the University of Illinois, it was agreed to
reserve a link for use in measurements. The link chosen was the highest
unassigned link which was incorrectly calculated to be number 223. The
correct number is 191. Therefore, Link 191 will be assigned for
measurement use. Use of this link should be cleared with the Liasion
Officer at the Network Measurement Center (NMC).
