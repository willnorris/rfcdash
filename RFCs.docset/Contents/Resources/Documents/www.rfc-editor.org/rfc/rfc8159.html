Abstract

   This document describes a tunnel encapsulation for Ethernet over IPv6
   with a mandatory 64-bit cookie for connecting Layer 2 (L2) Ethernet
   attachment circuits identified by IPv6 addresses.  The encapsulation
   is based on the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3) over IP
   and does not use the L2TPv3 control plane.

   L2TPv3, as defined in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>], provides a mechanism for tunneling
   Layer 2 (L2) "circuits" across a packet-oriented data network (e.g.,
   over IP), with multiple attachment circuits multiplexed over a single
   pair of IP address endpoints (i.e., a tunnel) using the L2TPv3
   Session ID as a circuit discriminator.

   Implementing L2TPv3 over IPv6 [<a href="./rfc2460" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>] provides the opportunity to
   utilize unique IPv6 addresses to identify Ethernet attachment
   circuits directly, leveraging the key property that IPv6 offers -- a
   vast number of unique IP addresses.  In this case, processing of the
   L2TPv3 Session ID may be bypassed upon receipt, as each tunnel has
   one and only one associated session.  This local optimization does
   not hinder the ability to continue supporting the multiplexing of
   circuits via the Session ID on the same router for other L2TPv3
   tunnels.

   There are various advantages to this approach when compared to the
   "traditional" L2TPv3 approach of using a loopback address to
   terminate the tunnel and then carrying multiple sessions over the
   tunnel.  These include better ECMP load balancing (since each tunnel
   has a unique source/destination IPv6 address pair) and finer-grained
   control when advertising tunnel endpoints using a routing protocol.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2119">2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Static%201%3A1%20Mapping%20without%20a%20Control%20Plane"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Static 1:1 Mapping without a Control Plane</span>

   The L2TPv3 control plane defined in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] is not used for this
   encapsulation.  The management plane is used to create and maintain
   matching configurations at either end of each tunnel.  Local
   configuration by the management plane creates a one-to-one mapping
   between the access-side L2 attachment circuit and the IP address used
   in the network-side IPv6 encapsulation.

   The IPv6 L2TPv3 tunnel encapsulating device uniquely identifies each
   Ethernet L2 attachment connection by a port ID or a combination of a
   port ID and VLAN ID(s) on the access side and by a local IPv6 address
   on the network side.  The local IPv6 address also identifies the
   tunnel endpoint.  The local IPv6 addresses identifying L2TPv3 tunnels
   SHOULD NOT be assigned from connected IPv6 subnets facing towards
   remote tunnel endpoints, since that approach would result in an IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery cache entry per tunnel on the next-hop router
   towards the remote tunnel endpoint.  It is RECOMMENDED that local
   IPv6 addresses identifying L2TPv3 tunnels are assigned from dedicated
   subnets used only for such tunnel endpoints.

   Certain deployment scenarios may require using a single IPv6 address
   (such as a unicast or anycast address assigned to a specific service
   instance, for example, a virtual switch) to identify a tunnel
   endpoint for multiple IPv6 L2TPv3 tunnels.  For such cases, the
   tunnel decapsulating device uses the local IPv6 address to identify
   the service instance and the remote IPv6 address to identify the
   individual tunnel within that service instance.

   As mentioned above, Session ID processing is not required, as each
   keyed IPv6 tunnel has one and only one associated session.  However,
   for compatibility with existing [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] implementations, the
   packets need to be sent with the Session ID.  Routers implementing
   L2TPv3 according to [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] can be configured with multiple L2TPv3
   tunnels, with one session per tunnel, to interoperate with routers
   implementing the keyed IPv6 tunnel as specified by this document.
   Note that as Session ID processing is not enabled for keyed IPv6
   tunnels, there can only be a single keyed IPv6 tunnel between two
   IPv6 addresses.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%2064-Bit%20Cookie"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  64-Bit Cookie</span>

   In line with [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>], the 64-bit cookie is used for an additional
   tunnel endpoint context check.  This is the largest cookie size
   permitted in [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>].  All packets MUST carry the 64-bit L2TPv3
   cookie field.  The cookie MUST be 64 bits long in order to provide
   sufficient protection against spoofing and brute-force blind
   insertion attacks.  The cookie values SHOULD be randomly selected.

   In the absence of the L2TPv3 control plane, the L2TPv3 encapsulating
   router MUST be provided with a local configuration of the 64-bit
   cookie for each local and remote IPv6 endpoint.  Note that cookies
   are asymmetric, so local and remote endpoints may send different
   cookie values and, in fact, SHOULD do so.  The value of the cookie
   MUST be able to be changed at any time in a manner that does not drop
   any legitimate tunneled packets, i.e., the receiver MUST be
   configurable to accept two discrete cookies for a single tunnel
   simultaneously.  This enables the receiver to hold both the 'old' and
   'new' cookie values during a change of cookie value.  Cookie values
   SHOULD be changed periodically by the management plane.

   Note that mandating a 64-bit cookie is a change from the optional
   variable-length cookie of [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] and that this requirement
   constrains interoperability with existing [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] implementations
   to those supporting a 64-bit cookie.  The management plane MUST NOT
   configure a keyed IP tunnel unless both endpoints support the 64-bit
   cookie.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Encapsulation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Encapsulation</span>

   The ingress router encapsulates the entire Ethernet frame, without
   the preamble and Frame Check Sequence (FCS) in L2TPv3 as per
   [<a href="./rfc4719" title='"Transport of Ethernet Frames over Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC4719</a>].  The L2-specific sublayer MAY be carried if Virtual
   Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [<a href="./rfc5085" title='"Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV): A Control Channel for Pseudowires"'>RFC5085</a>] and/or frame
   sequencing is required, but it SHOULD NOT be carried otherwise.  The
   L2TPv3 packet is encapsulated directly over IPv6 (i.e., no UDP header
   is carried).

   The ingress router MAY retain the FCS as per [<a href="./rfc4720" title='"Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Frame Check Sequence Retention"'>RFC4720</a>].  Support for
   retaining the FCS and for receiving packets with a retained FCS is
   OPTIONAL and, if present, MUST be configurable.  In the absence of
   the L2TPv3 control plane, such configuration MUST be consistent for
   the two endpoints of any given tunnel, i.e., if one router is
   configured to retain the FCS, then the other router MUST be
   configured to receive packets with the retained FCS.  Any router
   configured to retain FCS for a tunnel MUST retain FCS for all frames

   sent over that tunnel.  All routers implementing this specification
   MUST support the ability to send frames without retaining the FCS and
   to receive such frames.

   Any service-delimiting IEEE 802.1Q [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.1Q">IEEE802.1Q</a>] or IEEE 802.1ad
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.1ad">IEEE802.1ad</a>] VLAN IDs -- S-tag, C-tag, or the tuple (S-tag, C-tag)
   -- are treated with local significance within the Ethernet L2 port
   and MUST NOT be forwarded over the IPv6 L2TPv3 tunnel.

   Note that the same approach may be used to transport protocols other
   than Ethernet, though this is outside the scope of this
   specification.

   The full encapsulation is as follows:

   The combined IPv6 and keyed IP tunnel header contains the following
   fields:

   o  IPv6 Header.  Note that:

      *  The traffic class may be set by the ingress router to ensure
         correct Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) treatment by transit routers
         between the ingress and egress and to correct QoS disposition
         at the egress router.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8159">RFC 8159</a>                    Keyed IPv6 Tunnel                   May 2017</span>


      *  The flow label, as defined in [<a href="./rfc6437" title='"IPv6 Flow Label Specification"'>RFC6437</a>], may be set by the
         ingress router to indicate a flow of packets from the client,
         which may not be reordered by the network (if there is a
         requirement for finer-grained ECMP load balancing rather than
         per-circuit load balancing).

      *  The next header will be set to 0x73 to indicate that the next
         header is L2TPv3.

      *  In the "Static 1:1 Mapping" case described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, the
         IPv6 source address may correspond to a port or port/VLAN being
         transported as an L2 circuit, or it may correspond to a virtual
         interface terminating inside the router (e.g., if L2 circuits
         are being used within a multipoint VPN or if an anycast address
         is being terminated on a set of data-center virtual machines.)

      *  As with the source address, the IPv6 destination address may
         correspond to a port or port/VLAN being transported as an L2
         circuit or to a virtual interface.

   o  Session ID.  In the "Static 1:1 Mapping" case described in
      <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, the IPv6 address identifies an L2TPv3 session directly;
      thus, at endpoints supporting one-stage resolution (IPv6 Address
      Only), the Session ID SHOULD be ignored upon receipt.  It is
      RECOMMENDED that the remote endpoint is configured to set the
      Session ID to all ones (0xFFFFFFFF) for easy identification in
      case of troubleshooting.  For compatibility with other tunnel
      termination platforms supporting only two-stage resolution (IPv6
      Address + Session ID), this specification recommends supporting
      explicit configuration of Session ID to any value other than zero
      (including all ones).  The Session ID of zero MUST NOT be used, as
      it is reserved for use by L2TP control messages as specified in
      [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>].  Note that the Session ID is unidirectional; the sent
      and received Session IDs at an endpoint may be different.

   o  Cookie.  The 64-bit cookie, configured and described as in
      <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  All packets for a destined L2 circuit (or L2TPv3
      Session) MUST match one of the cookie values configured for that
      circuit.  Any packets that do not contain a valid cookie value
      MUST be discarded (see [<a href="./rfc3931" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC3931</a>] for more details).

   o  L2-Specific Sublayer (Optional).  As noted above, this will be
      present if VCCV and/or frame sequencing is required.  If VCCV is
      required, then any frames with bit 0 (the "V-bit") set are VCCV
      messages.  If frame sequencing is required, then any frames with
      bit 1 (the "S-bit") set have a valid frame sequence number in bits
      8-31.

   o  Payload (variable).  As noted above, the preamble and any service-
      delimiting tags MUST be stripped before encapsulation, and the FCS
      MUST be stripped unless FCS retention is configured at both
      ingress and egress routers.  Since a new FCS is added at each hop
      when the encapsulating IP packet is transmitted, the payload is
      protected against bit errors.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Fragmentation%20and%20Reassembly"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Fragmentation and Reassembly</span>

   Using tunnel encapsulation of Ethernet L2 datagrams in IPv6 will
   reduce the effective MTU allowed for the encapsulated traffic.

   The recommended solution to deal with this problem is for the network
   operator to increase the MTU size of all the links between the
   devices acting as IPv6 L2TPv3 tunnel endpoints to accommodate both
   the IPv6 L2TPv3 encapsulation header and the Ethernet L2 datagram
   without requiring fragmentation of the IPv6 packet.

   It is RECOMMENDED that routers implementing this specification
   implement IPv6 Path MTU (PMTU) discovery as defined in [<a href="./rfc1981" title='"Path MTU Discovery for IP version 6"'>RFC1981</a>] to
   confirm that the path over which packets are sent has sufficient MTU
   to transport a maximum-length Ethernet frame plus encapsulation
   overhead.

   Routers implementing this specification MAY implement L2TPv3
   fragmentation (as defined in <a href="./rfc4623#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC4623]</a>).  In the absence
   of the L2TPv3 control plane, it is RECOMMENDED that fragmentation (if
   implemented) is locally configured on a per-tunnel basis.
   Fragmentation configuration MUST be consistent between the two ends
   of a tunnel.

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED for routers implementing this specification to
   enable IPv6 fragmentation (as defined in <a href="./rfc2460#section-4.5">Section 4.5 of [RFC2460]</a>)
   for keyed IP tunnels.

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is an important
   consideration when providing circuit-oriented services such as those
   described in this document; it is all the more important in the
   absence of a dedicated tunnel control plane, as OAM becomes the only
   way to detect failures in the tunnel overlay.

   Note that in the context of keyed IP tunnels, failures in the IPv6
   underlay network can be detected using the usual methods such as
   through the routing protocol, including the use of single-hop

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [<a href="./rfc5881" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for IPv4 and IPv6 (Single Hop)"'>RFC5881</a>] to rapidly detect
   link failures.  Multihop BFD MAY also be enabled between tunnel
   endpoints as per [<a href="./rfc5883" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Multihop Paths"'>RFC5883</a>].

   Since keyed IP tunnels always carry an Ethernet payload and since OAM
   at the tunnel layer is unable to detect failures in the Ethernet
   service processing at the ingress or egress router or on the Ethernet
   attachment circuit between the router and the Ethernet client, it is
   RECOMMENDED that Ethernet OAM as defined in [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.1ag">IEEE802.1ag</a>] and/or
   [<a href="#ref-Y.1731" title='"Operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) functions and mechanisms for Ethernet-based networks"'>Y.1731</a>] be enabled for keyed IP tunnels.  As defined in those
   specifications, the following Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
   and/or Ethernet Continuity Check (ETH-CC) configurations are to be
   used in conjunction with keyed IPv6 tunnels:

   o  Connectivity verification between the tunnel endpoints across
      the tunnel: Use an Up Maintenance End Point (MEP) located at the
      tunnel endpoint for transmitting the CFM PDUs towards, and
      receiving them from, the direction of the tunnel.

   o  Connectivity verification from the tunnel endpoint across
      the local attachment circuit: Use a Down MEP located at the tunnel
      endpoint for transmitting the CFM PDUs towards, and receiving them
      from, the direction of the local attachment circuit.

   o  Intermediate connectivity verification: Use a Maintenance
      Intermediate Point (MIP) located at the tunnel endpoint to relay
      CFM PDUs.

   In addition, Pseudowire VCCV [<a href="./rfc5085" title='"Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV): A Control Channel for Pseudowires"'>RFC5085</a>] MAY be used.  Furthermore, BFD
   MAY be enabled over the VCCV channel [<a href="./rfc5885" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for the Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)"'>RFC5885</a>].

   Note that since there is no control plane, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   management plane take action when attachment circuit failure is
   detected, for example, by dropping the remote attachment circuit.

   Packet spoofing for any type of Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   tunneling protocol is of particular concern as insertion of carefully
   constructed rogue packets into the VPN transit network could result
   in a violation of VPN traffic separation, leaking data into a
   customer VPN.  This is complicated by the fact that it may be
   particularly difficult for the operator of the VPN to even be aware
   that it has become a point of transit into or between customer VPNs.

   Keyed IPv6 encapsulation provides traffic separation for its VPNs via
   the use of separate 128-bit IPv6 addresses to identify the endpoints.
   The mandatory use of the 64-bit L2TPv3 cookie provides an additional
   check to ensure that an arriving packet is intended for the
   identified tunnel.

   In the presence of a blind packet-spoofing attack, the 64-bit L2TPv3
   cookie provides security against inadvertent leaking of frames into a
   customer VPN, as documented in <a href="./rfc3931#section-8.2">Section 8.2 of [RFC3931]</a>.

   For protection against brute-force blind insertion attacks, the 64-
   bit cookie MUST be used with all tunnels.

   Note that the cookie provides no protection against a sophisticated
   man-in-the-middle attacker who can sniff and correlate captured data
   between nodes for use in a coordinated attack.

   The L2TPv3 64-bit cookie must not be regarded as a substitute for
   security such as that provided by IPsec when operating over an open
   or untrusted network where packets may be sniffed, decoded, and
   correlated for use in a coordinated attack.
