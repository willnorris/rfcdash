RFC # 464                                             SRI-ARC
NIC # 14738                                           February 27, 1973


                      <span class="h1">Resource Notebook Framework</span>


Introduction

The purpose of this RFC is to present a framework for coordinating all
the surveys and data gathering efforts concerned with "resource
notebook" type of information.

We have obtained agreement from ARPA with the framework, which is
described below.

    The scheme is designed with two purposes:

        a) to avoid a proliferation of data gathering efforts, which
        would overwhelm the sites and persons supplying the much-needed
        information;

        b) to give the responsibility to the NIC for coordinating the
        tasks associated with the resource notebook.

Two companion documents, NIC 14514 and NIC 14515 provide supplementary
information to this RFC.

    NIC 14514 describes the history of the Resource Notebook from 1971
    to the present.

    NIC 14515 contains the questionnaire that the NIC is currently
    sending to server sites for data on Network Resources.

A recent RFC by John Iseli and Dave Crocker (NWG/RFC #462, NIC 14434)
also addresses the same problem area.

    The proposed framework for data collection suggested by John and
    Dave is different from the framework outlined in this RFC.

Framework

The Network Information Center will coordinate the task of collecting,
verifying, and disseminating information of a "resource notebook"
nature.

    a) Collecting and verifying the data.

        Because of the magnitude of this task, regional data collectors
        would provide assistance both to the NIC and to the sites
        supplying the information.

            We think that initially there should be five regions:
            Boston, Washington DC, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Mid-
            Continent.

        The regional agent would collect the information from the sites
        in their region and forward it to NIC for inclusion in the
        Resource Notebook data base.

        The NIC would work closely with the regional agents to ensure
        that the data is accurate and up-to-date.

    b) Disseminating data.

        There is presently a need to prepare different subsets or
        "views" of the resource notebook information.

        Regardless of which groups on the Network are given
        responsibility for preparing different views of the complete
        resource notebook data base, these views should be available for
        use on-line as the NIC as well as off-line.

A working group of persons interested in the needs and problems of a
resource notebook would meet periodically to review the situation, and
to make concrete proposals for improvements.

Discussion

We welcome discussion on this RFC.

I you think it is desirable, a meeting could be held at SRI-ARC to
discuss the whole problem area.

    If a meeting is desirable, we suggest it be held soon, say on Monday
    March 19, 1973, at 8:30 AM in the SRI-ARC Conference Room.

Please let us have your comments by March 9.

    You may contact us at (415) 326-6200, ext 3617, care of Mlke
    Kudlick.
