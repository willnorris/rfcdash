NWG/RFC# 736                                  MRC 31-OCT-77 23:28  42213
Telnet SUPDUP Option


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Motivation%20for%20the%20option."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Motivation for the option.</span>

   Since the publication of <a href="./rfc734">RFC 734</a>,  I have been requested to  design
   an option to  the TELNET  protocol to provide  for SUPDUP  service.
   This option allows a host to  provide SUPDUP service on the  normal
   TELNET socket (27 octal) instead of 137 (octal) which is the normal
   SUPDUP ICP socket.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Description%20of%20the%20option."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Description of the option.</span>

   A user  TELNET  program which  wishes  to use  the  SUPDUP  display
   protocol instead of the NVT terminal service should send an IAC  DO
   SUPDUP.  If  the  server  is  willing to  use  the  SUPDUP  display
   protocol, it  should respond  with IAC  WILL SUPDUP;  otherwise  it
   should refuse with IAC WONT SUPDUP.

   For hosts  which normally  provide  SUPDUP terminal  services,  the
   server can send IAC  WILL SUPDUP upon ICP  which the user may  then
   accept or refuse.

   If the SUPDUP option is  in effect, no further TELNET  negotiations
   are allowed.   They  are  meaningless, since  SUPDUP  has  its  own
   facilities to perform  the functions that are needed.  Hence, octal
   377 will become an ordinary transmitted character (in this case  an
   invalid %TD code) instead of an IAC.

   Following the mutual  acceptance of the  SUPDUP option, the  SUPDUP
   negotiation proceeds as described in <a href="./rfc734">RFC 734</a>.
