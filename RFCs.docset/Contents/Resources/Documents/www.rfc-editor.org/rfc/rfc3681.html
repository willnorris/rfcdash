Abstract

   This document discusses the need for delegation of the
   E.F.F.3.IP6.ARPA DNS zone in order to enable reverse lookups for
   6bone addresses, and makes specific recommendations for the process
   needed to accomplish this.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%206bone%20and%20DNS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  6bone and DNS</span>

   The 6bone, whose address space was allocated by [<a href="./rfc2471" title='"IPv6 Testing Address Allocation"'>RFC2471</a>], has
   provided a network for IPv6 experimentation for numerous purposes for
   seven years.  Up to the present time, reverse lookups for 6bone
   addresses have been accomplished through IP6.INT.  It is now
   important that the thousands of 6bone users be able to update their
   IPv6 software to use IP6.ARPA [<a href="./rfc3152" title='"Delegation of IP6.ARPA"'>RFC3152</a>].

   Although the 6bone has a limited life, as a phaseout plan is being
   discussed at the IETF at this time [<a href="#ref-I-D.fink-6bone-phaseout" title='"6bone (IPv6 Testing Address Allocation) Phaseout"'>I-D.fink-6bone-phaseout</a>], there
   is likely to be 2.5 to 3.5 more years of operation.  During this
   remaining 6bone lifetime IP6.ARPA reverse lookup services for the
   3ffe::/16 address space are required.

   Discussions have been underway between the 6bone and RIR communities,
   about having the RIRs perform this service.  It was agreed at the San
   Francisco IETF meeting in March 2003 that it was more practical for
   the 6bone to provide this service for itself.  This would relieve the
   RIRs of the costs of providing this service, yet still provide the
   IP6.ARPA authority the ability to terminate the service when the
   planned 6bone termination date is reached (currently anticipated to
   be June 6, 2006).

   The current planning within the 6bone operational community is to
   provide new inet6num attributes in the 6bone registry database for
   top level 6bone address space holders to request delegation to their
   reverse path servers.

   This memo requests that the IANA delegate the E.F.F.3.IP6.ARPA domain
   to the 6bone, as will be described in instructions to be provided by
   the IAB.  Names within this zone are to be further delegated within
   the top level 6bone ISPs (known as pTLAs) in accordance with the
   delegation of 6bone 3FFE::/16 address space.

   While DNS spoofing of address to name mapping has been exploited in
   IPv4, delegation of the E.F.F.3.IP6.ARPA zone creates no new threats
   to the security of the internet.
