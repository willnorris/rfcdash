Abstract

   This document provides an extension to the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
   ("L2TP"), a mechanism for tunneling Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
   sessions.  L2TP lacks a mechanism for a host to provide PPP-related
   disconnect cause information to another host.  This information,
   provided by the extension described in this document, can be useful
   for accounting and debugging purposes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   L2TP [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Layer 2 Tunnel Protocol (L2TP)"'>1</a>] defines a general-purpose mechanism for tunneling PPP over
   various media.  By design, it insulates L2TP operation from the
   details of the PPP session that is being encapsulated by L2TP.  There
   are, however, cases where it may be desirable for PPP-specific
   disconnect information to be provided to an L2TP host (L2TP Access
   Concentrator [LAC] or L2TP Network Server [LNS]) in a descriptive
   format.  The lack of this information is especially a problem when
   the LAC and LNS are not owned or managed by the same entities.

   The Result and Error Codes defined for L2TP specify only L2TP-
   specific disconnect information.  This document provides an
   additional Attribute Value Pair (AVP), called PPP Disconnect Cause
   Code, that MAY be used by an L2TP host to provide PPP-specific

   disconnect information to its peer.  This AVP should be used in
   conjunction with, and not as a replacement for, the L2TP Result and
   Error Code AVPs.

   The PPP Disconnect Cause Code AVP can also be used to provide a
   human-readable disconnect reason to the user.  This AVP should not
   have any effect on either the functioning of the tunnel or the
   functioning of the PPP session; it is for informational and logging
   purposes only.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>2</a>].

   The AVP is valid in the L2TP Call-Disconnect-Notify (CDN) message
   only, and it MUST NOT be marked Mandatory.

   The PPP Disconnect Cause Code AVP is encoded with Vendor ID 0 and an
   Attribute Type of PPP Disconnect Cause Code (46).  The length of the
   Value field MUST be at least 11 octets.  If the length is more than
   11 octets, the additional octets MUST contain a descriptive text in
   UTF-8 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>3</a>] format that can be displayed to the user or in a log file.
   The format of the AVP is shown below.

   Attribute Type: A two octet value in network byte order; set to 46
   (PPP Disconnect Cause Code).

   Disconnect Code: A two octet value in network byte order.  (Described
   in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> of this document.)

   Control Protocol Number: The PPP Control Protocol number of the
   primary protocol known to have caused the error, if any.  This field
   may be 0 unless mentioned otherwise in the description of the
   Disconnect Codes in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>.

   Direction: A single octet value; specifies the direction in which the
   Disconnect Code applies.

            The valid values of this field are:

                    0: global error
                    1: at peer
                    2: at local

   This section contains the list of well-known values of the Disconnect
   Code field in the PPP Disconnect Cause Code AVP.  The IANA will
   maintain a registry of the up-to-date values (see <a href="#section-5">section 5</a> of this
   document).  These values should be used in conjunction with the
   Direction value and the Control Protocol Number field to interpret
   the specific error condition.

   Unless documented otherwise for a specific Disconnect Code, the
   Direction value SHOULD be 0.

   The global error codes, given in the list below, are Disconnect Codes
   that do not relate to one particular PPP Control Protocol.  The
   Control Protocol Number for these errors thus MUST be set to 0.

   3    Normal Disconnection, LCP Terminate-Request sent.

        Valid Direction values are:

           1: LCP Terminate-Request sent by peer
           2: LCP Terminate-Request sent by local

   4    Compulsory encryption required by a PPP peer was refused by the
        other.

        Valid Direction values are:

           1: Required by local; refused by peer

   The LCP error codes, listed below, are disconnect reasons that are
   directly related to the failure of PPP peers to negotiate mutually
   agreeable link parameters.  The Control Protocol Number for these
   errors MUST be set to C021 hexadecimal (LCP).

   5    FSM (Finite State Machine) Timeout error.  (PPP event "TO-".)

   6    No recognizable LCP packets were received.

   7    LCP failure: Magic Number error; link possibly looped back.

   The authentication error codes, listed below, are disconnect reasons
   that are directly related to authentication failures between the PPP
   peers.  The Control Protocol Number for such errors MUST correspond
   to the PPP Control Protocol number for the authentication protocol in
   use.

   13   FSM Timeout error.

   14   Peer has unexpected authenticated name for existing MP bundle.

   15   PPP authentication failure: Authentication protocol
        unacceptable.

        Valid Direction values are:

           1: All local authentication protocols were rejected by the
              peer.

           2: All authentication protocols requested by peer were
              unacceptable or unimplemented locally.

   16   PPP authentication failure: Authentication failed (bad name,
        password, or secret).

        Valid Direction values are:

           1: Authentication of peer identity by local system.
           2: Authentication of local identity by peer system.

   NCP Errors are disconnect reasons that are directly related to the
   failure of PPP peers to negotiate a mutually agreeable set of
   parameters for the network protocols.  The Control Protocol Number
   for such errors SHOULD correspond to the PPP Network Control Protocol
   number in use.  Where multiple network protocols are in use, multiple
   copies of this AVP MAY be given to indicate failure reasons for each
   NCP.  Otherwise, if only one copy of the AVP is given, the Control
   Protocol Number SHOULD correspond to the last (most recent) failing
   NCP.

   17   FSM Timeout error.

   18   No NCPs available (all disabled or rejected); no NCPs went to
        Opened state.  (Control Protocol Number may be zero only if
        neither peer has enabled NCPs.)

   19   NCP failure: failed to converge on acceptable addresses.

        Valid Direction values are:

           1: Too many Configure-Naks received from peer.
           2: Too many Configure-Naks sent to peer.

   20   NCP failure: user not permitted to use any addresses.

        Valid Direction values are:

           1: Local link address not acceptable to peer.
           2: Remote link address not acceptable to local system.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Notes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Notes</span>

   This AVP MAY may be sent by either the LNS or LAC.  It is generally
   expected that this AVP will be most useful in sending notification
   from the LNS to LAC in the compulsory tunneling case, although it is
   not precluded from use in any other case.

   A draft form of this AVP used Vendor ID 43 (3Com Corporation) and
   vendor-specific Attribute Type 46.  Implementations MAY accept AVPs
   with these values as equivalent to the message described in this
   document, but SHOULD NOT transmit an AVP using these values.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The integrity and confidentiality of this AVP relies on the
   underlying L2TP security mechanisms.  It is intended for logging and
   diagnostic purposes in the event of PPP link failure and should not
   pose a threat to system security, but the AVP MAY be hidden as
   described in <a href="./rfc2661#section-4.3">section 4.3 of RFC 2661</a>.

   The defined extension does not provide information that would be
   useful to an attacker.  Future extensions should not be defined to
   lessen security.  For instance, it is inappropriate to provide
   distinguishing information that would inform the peer that a given
   authentication name is correct, but the password/secret is incorrect.

   IANA has assigned an L2TP Attribute Type value of 46 for the PPP
   Disconnect Cause Code defined in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.

   This AVP includes an enumerated cause code value, called the
   "Disconnect Code."  Values 0 through 20 are described in this
   document.  Values 21 through 32767 (inclusive) are assigned by the
   IANA subject to IESG Approval.  Values 32768 through 65279
   (inclusive) are assigned by the IANA on a First Come First Served
   basis, and are intended for vendor-specific features.  Values 65280
   through 65535 (inclusive) are allocated for Private or Experimental
   Use, and no assignment through the IANA is expected.
