NIC Course


   The Network Information Center is planning to run a course on
   the use of its Online System (NLS), including use of the
   Journal, at SRI.  The dates are to be Nov. 29, 30.

   We particularly would like this course to be for Station
   Agents or Secretaries who could help others at a site use the
   NIC and could transcribe documents or messages into NLS.
   Anyone is welcome, however.  The only restriction is a limit
   of 12 people.

   Those desiring to attend should contact Dirk Van Nouhuys or
   Dick Watson at (415) 326-6200 ext. 3370 or 2013.

   We will be glad to make motel reservations for anyone
   attending.  We usually use the Mermaid Motel in Menlo Park.
