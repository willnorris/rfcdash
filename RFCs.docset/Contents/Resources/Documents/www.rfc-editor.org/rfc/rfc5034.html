Abstract

   This document defines a profile of the Simple Authentication and
   Security Layer (SASL) for the Post Office Protocol (POP3).  This
   extension allows a POP3 client to indicate an authentication
   mechanism to the server, perform an authentication protocol exchange,
   and optionally negotiate a security layer for subsequent protocol
   interactions during this session.

   This document seeks to consolidate the information related to POP3
   AUTH into a single document.  To this end, this document obsoletes
   and replaces <a href="./rfc1734">RFC 1734</a>, and updates the information contained in
   <a href="./rfc2449#section-6.3">Section 6.3 of RFC 2449</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The POP3 (see [<a href="./rfc1939" title='"Post Office Protocol - Version 3"'>RFC1939</a>]) AUTH command (see [<a href="./rfc1734" title='"POP3 AUTHentication command"'>RFC1734</a>]) has suffered
   several problems in its specification.  The first is that it was very
   similar to a SASL framework defined by [<a href="./rfc4422" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>], but pre-dated the
   initial SASL specification.  It was therefore missing some key
   components, such as a way to list the available authentication
   mechanisms.

   Later, [<a href="./rfc2449" title='"POP3 Extension Mechanism"'>RFC2449</a>] attempted to remedy this situation by adding the
   CAPA command and allowing an initial client response with the AUTH
   command, but problems remained in the clarity of the specification of
   how the initial client response was to be handled.

   Together, this means creating a full POP3 AUTH implementation
   requires an understanding of material in at least five different
   documents (and [<a href="./rfc3206" title='"The SYS and AUTH POP Response Codes"'>RFC3206</a>] provides additional response codes that are
   useful during authentication).

   This document attempts to combine the information in [<a href="./rfc1734" title='"POP3 AUTHentication command"'>RFC1734</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc2449" title='"POP3 Extension Mechanism"'>RFC2449</a>] to simplify this situation.  Additionally, it aims to
   clarify and update the older specifications where appropriate.

   Specification reference:
      This document and [<a href="./rfc4422" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>]

   Discussion:
      The SASL capability permits the use of the AUTH command (as
      defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of this document) to begin a SASL negotiation
      (as defined in [<a href="./rfc4422" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>]).  The argument to the SASL capability is
      a space-separated list of SASL mechanisms that are supported.

      If a server either does not support the CAPA command or does not
      advertise the SASL capability, clients SHOULD NOT attempt the AUTH
      command.  If a client does attempt the AUTH command in such a
      situation, it MUST NOT supply the client initial response
      parameter (for backwards compatibility with [<a href="./rfc1734" title='"POP3 AUTHentication command"'>RFC1734</a>]).

      Note that the list of available mechanisms MAY change after a
      successful STLS command (see [<a href="./rfc2595" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>RFC2595</a>]).  However, as required by
      [<a href="./rfc2449" title='"POP3 Extension Mechanism"'>RFC2449</a>], implementations MUST continue to include the SASL
      capability even after a successful AUTH command has been completed
      (even though no further AUTH commands may be issued).

         initial-response: An optional initial client response, as
         defined in <a href="./rfc4422#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC4422]</a>.  If present, this response
         MUST be encoded as Base64 (specified in <a href="./rfc4648#section-4">Section 4 of
         [RFC4648]</a>), or consist only of the single character "=", which
         represents an empty initial response.

      Restrictions:

         After an AUTH command has been successfully completed, no more
         AUTH commands may be issued in the same session.  After a
         successful AUTH command completes, a server MUST reject any
         further AUTH commands with an -ERR reply.

         The AUTH command may only be given during the AUTHORIZATION
         state.

      Discussion:

         The AUTH command initiates a SASL authentication exchange
         between the client and the server.  The client identifies the
         SASL mechanism to use with the first parameter of the AUTH
         command.  If the server supports the requested authentication
         mechanism, it performs the SASL exchange to authenticate the
         user.  Optionally, it also negotiates a security layer for
         subsequent protocol interactions during this session.  If the
         requested authentication mechanism is not supported, the server
         rejects the AUTH command with an -ERR reply.

         The authentication protocol exchange consists of a series of
         server challenges and client responses that are specific to the
         chosen SASL mechanism.

         A server challenge is sent as a line consisting of a "+"
         character, followed by a single space and a string encoded
         using Base64, as specified in <a href="./rfc4648#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC4648]</a>.  This
         line MUST NOT contain any text other than the BASE64-encoded
         challenge.

         A client response consists of a line containing a string
         encoded as Base64.  If the client wishes to cancel the
         authentication exchange, it issues a line with a single "*".
         If the server receives such a response, it MUST reject the AUTH
         command by sending an -ERR reply.

         The optional initial-response argument to the AUTH command is
         used to save a round trip when using authentication mechanisms
         that support an initial client response.  If the initial
         response argument is omitted and the chosen mechanism requires

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5034">RFC 5034</a>           POP3 SASL Authentication Mechanism          July 2007</span>


         an initial client response, the server MUST proceed by issuing
         an empty challenge, as defined in <a href="./rfc4422#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC4422]</a>.  In
         POP3, an empty server challenge is defined as a line with only
         a "+", followed by a single space.  It MUST NOT contain any
         other data.

         For the purposes of the initial client response, the 255-octet
         limit on the length of a single command, defined in <a href="./rfc2449#section-4">Section 4
         of [RFC2449]</a>, still applies.  If specifying an initial response
         would cause the AUTH command to exceed this length, the client
         MUST NOT use the initial-response parameter (and must proceed
         instead by sending its initial response after an empty
         challenge from the server, as in <a href="./rfc4422#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC4422]</a>).

         If the client needs to send a zero-length initial response, it
         MUST transmit the response as a single equals sign ("=").  This
         indicates that the response is present, but contains no data.

         If the client uses an initial-response argument to the AUTH
         command with a SASL mechanism that does not support an initial
         client send, the server MUST reject the AUTH command with an
         -ERR reply.

         If the server cannot Base64 decode a client response, it MUST
         reject the AUTH command with an -ERR reply.  If the client
         cannot Base64 decode any of the server's challenges, it MUST
         cancel the authentication using the "*" response.  In
         particular, servers and clients MUST reject (and not ignore)
         any character not explicitly allowed by the Base64 alphabet,
         and MUST reject any sequence of Base64 characters that contains
         the pad character ('=') anywhere other than the end of the
         string (e.g., "=AAA" and "AAA=BBB" are not allowed).

         Excepting the initial client response, these BASE64 strings may
         be of arbitrary length, depending on the authentication
         mechanism in use.  Clients and servers MUST be able to handle
         the largest encoded challenges and responses generated by the
         authentication mechanisms they support.  This requirement is
         independent of any line-length limitations the client or server
         may have in other parts of its protocol implementation.

         If the server is unable to authenticate the client, it MUST
         reject the AUTH command with an -ERR reply.  Should the client
         successfully complete the exchange, the server issues a +OK
         reply.  Additionally, upon success, the POP3 session enters the
         TRANSACTION state.

         The authorization identity generated by the SASL exchange is a
         simple username, and SHOULD use the SASLprep profile (see
         [<a href="./rfc4013" title='"SASLprep: Stringprep Profile for User Names and Passwords"'>RFC4013</a>]) of the StringPrep algorithm (see [<a href="./rfc3454" title='"Preparation of Internationalized Strings ("'>RFC3454</a>]) to
         prepare these names for matching.  If preparation of the
         authorization identity fails or results in an empty string
         (unless it was transmitted as the empty string), the server
         MUST fail the authentication.

         If a security layer is negotiated during the SASL exchange, it
         takes effect for the client on the octet immediately following
         the CRLF that concludes the last response generated by the
         client.  For the server, it takes effect immediately following
         the CRLF of its success reply.

         When a security layer takes effect, the server MUST discard any
         knowledge previously obtained from the client, which was not
         obtained from the SASL negotiation itself.  Likewise, the
         client MUST discard any knowledge obtained from the server,
         such as the list of available POP3 service extensions.

         When both Transport Layer Security (TLS) (see [<a href="./rfc4346" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>RFC4346</a>]) and
         SASL security layers are in effect, the TLS encoding MUST be
         applied after the SASL encoding when sending data.  (According
         to [<a href="./rfc2595" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>RFC2595</a>], STLS can only be issued before AUTH in any case.)

         Note that POP3 does not allow for additional data to be sent
         with a message indicating a successful outcome (see <a href="./rfc4422#section-3.6">Section 3.6
         of [RFC4422]</a>).

         The service name specified by this protocol's profile of SASL
         is "pop".

         If an AUTH command fails, the client may try another
         authentication mechanism or present different credentials by
         issuing another AUTH command (or by using one of the other POP3
         authentication mechanisms).  Likewise, the server MUST behave
         as if the client had not issued the AUTH command.

         To ensure interoperability, client and server implementations
         of this extension MUST implement the PLAIN SASL mechanism
         [<a href="./rfc4616" title='"The PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"'>RFC4616</a>] running over TLS [<a href="./rfc2595" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>RFC2595</a>].

         A server implementation MUST implement a configuration in which
         it does NOT advertise or permit any plaintext password
         mechanisms, unless the STLS command has been used to negotiate
         a TLS session (see [<a href="./rfc2595" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>RFC2595</a>]).  As described by <a href="./rfc4616">RFC 4616</a>, this
         configuration SHOULD be the default configuration.  Before
         using a plaintext password mechanism over a TLS session, client

         implementations MUST verify the TLS server certificate as
         required by <a href="./rfc2595#section-2.4">RFC 2595, Section 2.4</a>.  Client and server
         implementations SHOULD implement additional SASL mechanisms
         that do not send plaintext passwords, such as the GSSAPI
         [<a href="./rfc4752" title='"The Kerberos V5 ("'>RFC4752</a>] mechanism.

   1. Updated references to newer versions of various specifications,
       particularly <a href="./rfc4422">RFC 4422</a>.

   2. The SASL-based semantics defined in <a href="./rfc2449">RFC 2449</a> are now normative for
       the AUTH extension.

   3. The proper behaviour and handling of initial client responses is
       defined, with examples and references to SASL.

   4. New minimum requirement of support for TLS+PLAIN.

   5. The SASLprep profile SHOULD be used to prepare authorization
       identities.

   6. Clarify that the TLS encoding should be applied after any encoding
       applied by SASL security layers.

   7. Note that the mechanism list can change after STLS.

   8. Explicitly mention that "=" means a zero-length initial response.

   9. Note that POP3 doesn't allow additional data to be sent with +OK.
