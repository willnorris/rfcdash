NIC 16442
Updates NIC 7554, NIC 7732


Enterprise Phone Service to NIC From ARPANET Sites


In September 1971, NIC arranged for all Sites then on the Network to
have phone service to NIC with all tolls billed to NIC. (7554,). In
October, (7732,) a revised list of numbers established for Sites was
issued. Since then, some Sites have requested the service, and further
arrangements have been made.  A list of present Enterprise and Zenith
numbers is attached.  This list is accessible online through
&lt;NIC&gt;LOCATOR.

NIC has considered consolidating to one 800 number, but this service
would be much more expensive. Enterprise numbers (Zenith in California)
are billing arrangements which must be made separately for each prefix,
not just each area code, so that even users in the same area usually
need a special arrangement. Although admittedly more awkward than an 800
number, the present arrangement costs about $800 per month; an 800
number would cost about $2200 per month.

NIC would be interested in response from users as to their satisfaction
with the present arrangement. Any Site actually on the Network which
does not have an Enterprise number and would like to have one, is
invited to call NIC to request one.

NIC also arranged for an answering service on the Enterprise or Zenith
numbers for calls that are received from 5pm to 8am. We apologize to any
users who have found this service faulty recently. We have reinstituted
the service and assume it will be satisfactory in supplying information
on the status of NIC operations at times other than 8 to 5 when our full
staff is here. Your comments on this would be appreciated.
