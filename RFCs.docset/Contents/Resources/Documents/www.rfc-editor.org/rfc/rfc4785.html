Abstract

   This document specifies authentication-only ciphersuites (with no
   encryption) for the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) protocol.  These ciphersuites are useful when
   authentication and integrity protection is desired, but
   confidentiality is not needed or not permitted.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The RFC for Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [<a href="#ref-TLS-PSK" title='"Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>TLS-PSK</a>] specifies ciphersuites for supporting TLS using pre-shared
   symmetric keys.  However, all the ciphersuites defined in [<a href="#ref-TLS-PSK" title='"Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>TLS-PSK</a>]
   require encryption.  However there are cases when only authentication
   and integrity protection is required, and confidentiality is not
   needed.  There are also cases when confidentiality is not permitted -
   e.g., for implementations that must meet import restrictions in some
   countries.  Even though no encryption is used, these ciphersuites
   support authentication of the client and server to each other, and
   message integrity.  This document augments [<a href="#ref-TLS-PSK" title='"Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>TLS-PSK</a>] by adding three
   more ciphersuites (PSK, DHE_PSK, RSA_PSK) with authentication and
   integrity only - no encryption.  The reader is expected to become
   familiar with [<a href="#ref-TLS-PSK" title='"Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>TLS-PSK</a>] standards prior to studying this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Applicability%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Applicability Statement</span>

   The ciphersuites defined in this document are intended for a rather
   limited set of applications, usually involving only a very small
   number of clients and servers.  Even in such environments, other
   alternatives may be more appropriate.

   If the main goal is to avoid Public-key Infrastructures (PKIs),
   another possibility worth considering is using self-signed
   certificates with public key fingerprints.  Instead of manually
   configuring a shared secret in, for instance, some configuration
   file, a fingerprint (hash) of the other party's public key (or
   certificate) could be placed there instead.

   It is also possible to use the Secure Remote Password (SRP)
   ciphersuites for shared secret authentication [<a href="#ref-SRP" title='"Using SRP for TLS Authentication"'>SRP</a>].  SRP was
   designed to be used with passwords, and it incorporates protection
   against dictionary attacks.  However, it is computationally more
   expensive than the PSK ciphersuites in [<a href="#ref-TLS-PSK" title='"Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>TLS-PSK</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4785">RFC 4785</a>        PSK NULL Encryption Ciphersuites for TLS    January 2007</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Cipher%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Cipher Usage</span>

   The three new ciphersuites proposed here match the three cipher
   suites defined in [<a href="#ref-TLS-PSK" title='"Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>TLS-PSK</a>], except that we define suites with null
   encryption.

   The ciphersuites defined here use the following options for key
   exchange and hash part of the protocol:

   CipherSuite                     Key Exchange   Cipher      Hash

   TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA           PSK            NULL        SHA
   TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA       DHE_PSK        NULL        SHA
   TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA       RSA_PSK        NULL        SHA

   For the meaning of the terms PSK, please refer to <a href="#section-1">section 1</a> in [TLS-
   PSK].  For the meaning of the terms DHE, RSA, and SHA, please refer
   to appendixes A.5 and B in [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>TLS</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   As with all schemes involving shared keys, special care should be
   taken to protect the shared values and to limit their exposure over
   time.  As this document augments [<a href="#ref-TLS-PSK" title='"Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>TLS-PSK</a>], everything stated in its
   Security Consideration section applies here.  In addition, as cipher
   suites defined here do not support confidentiality, care should be
   taken not to send sensitive information (such as passwords) over
   connections protected with one of the ciphersuites defined in this
   document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   This document defines three new ciphersuites whose values are in the
   TLS Cipher Suite registry defined in [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>TLS</a>].

   CipherSuite   TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA      = { 0x00, 0x2C };
   CipherSuite   TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x2D };
   CipherSuite   TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x2E };

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Acknowledgments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Acknowledgments</span>

   The ciphersuites defined in this document are an augmentation to and
   based on [<a href="#ref-TLS-PSK" title='"Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>TLS-PSK</a>].
