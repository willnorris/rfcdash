             <span class="h1">Statement of Upcoming Move of NIC/NLS Services</span>


Within the next few weeks we will be transferring computer services for
our ROME, ARPA, and NIC users from the ARC/NIC system to a new system we
are installing at TYMSHARE in Cupertino, Ca.  The name of this system is
OFFICE-1 and is site 53 (oct) when talking to TELNET or site 43 (dec)
when talking to a TIP. Currently we are experiencing hardware
difficulties on this system, but we and the staff at TYMSHARE are
working diligently to solve the problems. Once the hardware is solid and
reliable, the above users will have their directories transferred to the
OFFICE-1 facility, and receive their NLS power from that site. Watch for
upcoming announcements as to the exact date when your directory will be
moved to OFFICE-1.
