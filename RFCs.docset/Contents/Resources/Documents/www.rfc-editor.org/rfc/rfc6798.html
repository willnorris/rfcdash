<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Packet%20Delay%20Variation%20Metrics%20Block"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Packet Delay Variation Metrics Block</span>

   This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on Packet Delay Variation
   (PDV) using one of several standard metrics, for example, Mean
   Absolute Packet Delay Variation 2 (MAPDV2) (Clause 6.2.3.2 of
   [<a href="#ref-G.1020" title='"Performance parameter definitions for quality of speech and other voiceband applications utilizing IP networks"'>G.1020</a>]) or 2-point PDV (Clause 6.2.4 of [<a href="#ref-Y.1540" title='"IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters"'>Y.1540</a>]).

   The metrics belong to the class of transport metrics defined in
   [<a href="#ref-MONARCH" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>MONARCH</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20RTCP%20and%20RTCP%20XR%20Reports"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports</span>

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.3.%20%20Performance%20Metrics%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" id="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Performance Metrics Framework</span>

   The Performance Metrics Framework [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   monitoring architectures [<a href="#ref-MONARCH" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>MONARCH</a>] provides guidelines for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The XR block described in this document
   is in accordance with the guidelines in [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] and [<a href="#ref-MONARCH" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>MONARCH</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.4.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" id="section-1.4">1.4</a>.  Applicability</span>

   These metrics are applicable to a wide range of RTP applications in
   which the application streams are sensitive to delay variation
   [<a href="./rfc5481" title='"Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement"'>RFC5481</a>].  For example, applications could use the measurements of
   these metrics to help adjust the size of adaptive jitter buffers to
   improve performance.  Network managers can use these metrics to
   compare actual delay variation to targets (i.e., a numerical
   objective or Service Level Agreement) to help ensure the quality of
   real-time application performance.

   This report block makes use of binary fractions.  The terminology
   used is

      Numeric formats S X:Y

         where S indicates a two's complement signed representation, X
         the number of bits prior to the decimal place, and Y the number
         of bits after the decimal place.

         Hence, 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0 to
         255.996 with a granularity of 0.0039.  S7:8 represents the
         range -127.996 to +127.996. 0:16 represents a proper binary
         fraction with range as follows:

         0.0 to 1 - 1/65536 = 0.9999847

         however, note that use of flag values at the top of the numeric
         range slightly reduces this upper limit.  For example, if the
         16-bit values 0xfffe and 0xffff are used as flags for "over-
         range" and "unavailable" conditions, a 0:16 quantity has a
         range as follows:

         0.0 to 1 - 3/65536 = 0.9999542

   Metrics in this block report on packet delay variation in the stream
   arriving at the RTP system.  The measurement of these metrics is made
   at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances of this metric
   block refer by synchronization source (SSRC) to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Information Block [<a href="./rfc6776" title='"Measurement Identity and Information Reporting Using a Source Description (SDES) Item and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block"'>RFC6776</a>], which contains
   measurement intervals.  This metric block relies on the measurement
   interval given by the value of the "Measurement Duration (Interval)"
   field in the Measurement Information Block to indicate the span of
   the report and MUST be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   Measurement Information Block.  If the measurement interval is not
   received for this metric block, this metric block MUST be discarded.

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Packet Delay Variation Metrics Block is identified by the
      constant 15.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Packet Delay Variation
      metrics are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics [<a href="#ref-MONARCH" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>MONARCH</a>],
      that is, whether the reported values apply to the most recent
      measurement interval duration between successive metrics reports
      (I=10) (the Interval Duration), or they apply to the accumulation
      period characteristic of cumulative measurements (I=11) (the
      Cumulative Duration), or they are a sampled instantaneous value
      (I=01) (Sampled Value).  The value I=00 is reserved and MUST NOT
      be used.  If the value I=00 is received, then the XR block MUST be
      ignored by the receiver.

   Packet Delay Variation Metric Type (pdvtyp): 4 bits

      Packet Delay Variation Metric Type is of type enumerated and is
      interpreted as an unsigned, 4-bit integer.  This field is used to
      identify the Packet Delay Variation Metric Type used in this
      report block, according to the following code:

         bits 014-011

            0: MAPDV2, Clause 6.2.3.2 of [<a href="#ref-G.1020" title='"Performance parameter definitions for quality of speech and other voiceband applications utilizing IP networks"'>G.1020</a>],

            1: 2-point PDV, Clause 6.2.4 of [<a href="#ref-Y.1540" title='"IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters"'>Y.1540</a>].

   Rsv: 2 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      ignored by the receiver.

   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block is in 32-bit words, minus one.
      For the Packet Delay Variation Metrics Block, the block length is
      equal to 4.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      This field is as defined in <a href="./rfc3611#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of [RFC3611]</a>.

   Positive PDV Threshold/Peak: 16 bits

      This field is associated with the Positive PDV percentile and
      expressed in milliseconds with numeric format S11:4.  The term
      "Positive" represents that the packets are arriving later than the
      expected time.

      If the measured value is less than -2047.9375 (the value that
      would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be reported to
      indicate an over-range negative measurement.  If the measured
      value is greater than +2047.8125 (the value that would be coded as
      0x7FFD), the value 0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-
      range positive measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable,
      the value 0x7FFF MUST be reported.

   Positive PDV Percentile: 16 bits

      This field indicates the percentages of packets in the RTP stream
      for which individual packet delays were less than the Positive PDV
      Threshold.  It is expressed in numeric format 8:8 with values from
      0 to 100th percentile.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be
      reported.

   Negative PDV Threshold/Peak: 16 bits

      This field is associated with the Negative PDV percentile and
      expressed in milliseconds with numeric format S11:4.  The term
      "Negative" represents that the packets are arriving earlier than
      the expected time.

      If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the value
      that would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range negative measurement.  If the
      measured value is more positive than +2047.8125 (the value that
      would be coded as 0x7FFD), the value 0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to
      indicate an over-range positive measurement.  If the measurement
      is unavailable, the value 0x7FFF MUST be reported.

   Negative PDV Percentile: 16 bits

      This field indicates the percentages of packets in the RTP stream
      for which individual packet delays were more than the Negative PDV
      Threshold.  It is expressed in numeric format 8:8 with values from
      0 to 100th percentile.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be
      reported.

      If the PDV Type indicated is 2-point PDV and the Positive and
      Negative PDV percentiles are set to 100.0, then the Positive and
      Negative Threshold/Peak PDV values are the peak values measured
      during the reporting interval (which may be from the start of the
      call for cumulative reports).  In this case, the difference
      between the Positive and Negative Threshold/Peak values defines
      the range of 2-point PDV.

   Mean PDV: 16 bits

      The mean PDV value of data packets is expressed in milliseconds
      with Numeric format S11:4 format.

      For MAPDV2, this value is generated according to Clause 6.2.3.2 of
      [<a href="#ref-G.1020" title='"Performance parameter definitions for quality of speech and other voiceband applications utilizing IP networks"'>G.1020</a>].  For interval reports, the MAPDV2 value is reset at the
      start of the interval.

      For 2-point PDV, the value reported is the mean of per-packet
      2-point PDV values.  This metric indicates the arrival time of the
      first media packet of the session with respect to the mean of the
      arrival times of every packet of the session.  A single value of
      the metric (for a single session) may not be useful by itself, but
      its average over a number of sessions may be useful in diagnosing

      media delay at session startup.  For example, this might occur if
      media packets are often delayed behind signaling packets due to
      head-of-line blocking.

      If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the value
      that would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range negative measurement.  If the
      measured value is more positive than +2047.8125 (the value that
      would be coded as 0x7FFD), the value 0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to
      indicate an over-range positive measurement.  If the measurement
      is unavailable, the value 0x7FFF MUST be reported.

   Reserved: 16 bits

      These bits are reserved for future definition.  They MUST be set
      to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

   MAPDV2 (Clause 6.2.3.2 of [<a href="#ref-G.1020" title='"Performance parameter definitions for quality of speech and other voiceband applications utilizing IP networks"'>G.1020</a>]) is the envelope of instantaneous
   (per-packet) delay when compared to the short-term moving average
   delay.  This metric could be useful in determining residual
   impairment when an RTP end system uses an adaptive de-jitter buffer
   that tracks the average delay variation, provided that the averaging
   behavior of the adaptive algorithm is similar to that of the MAPDV2
   algorithm.

   2-point PDV (Clause 6.2.4 of [<a href="#ref-Y.1540" title='"IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters"'>Y.1540</a>]) reports absolute packet delay
   variation with respect to a defined reference packet transfer delay.
   Note that the reference packet is generally selected as the packet
   with minimum delay based on the most common criterion (see Sections <a href="#section-1">1</a>
   and 5.1 of [<a href="./rfc5481" title='"Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement"'>RFC5481</a>]).  In an RTP context, the two "points" are at
   the sender (the synchronization source that applies RTP timestamps)
   and at the receiver.  The value of this metric for the packet with
   index j is identical to the quantity D(i,j) defined in <a href="./rfc3550#section-6.4.1">SectionÂ 6.4.1
   of [RFC3550]</a>, and the packet index i should be set equal to the index
   of the reference packet for the metric in practice.  The metric
   includes the effect of the frequency offsets of clocks in both the
   sender and receiver end systems, so it is useful mainly in networks
   where synchronization is distributed.  As well as measuring packet
   delay variation in such networks, it may be used to ensure that
   synchronization is effective, for example, where the network carries
   ISDN data traffic over RTP [<a href="./rfc4040" title='"RTP Payload Format for a 64 kbit/s Transparent Call"'>RFC4040</a>].  The metric is likely to be
   useful in networks that use fixed de-jitter buffering, because it may
   be used to determine the length of the required de-jitter buffer, or

   to determine if network performance has deteriorated such that
   existing de-jitter buffers are too small to accommodate the observed
   delay variation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Examples%20of%20Use"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Examples of Use</span>

      (a) To report MAPDV2 [<a href="#ref-G.1020" title='"Performance parameter definitions for quality of speech and other voiceband applications utilizing IP networks"'>G.1020</a>]:

         Pos PDV Threshold = 50.0; Pos PDV Percentile = 95.3; Neg PDV
         Threshold = 50.0 (note this implies -50 ms); Neg PDV Percentile
         = 98.4; PDV type = 0 (MAPDV2)

         causes average MAPDV2 to be reported in the Mean PDV field.

         Note that implementations either may fix the reported
         percentile and calculate the associated PDV level or may fix a
         threshold PDV level and calculate the associated percentile.
         From a practical implementation perspective, it is simpler to
         use the second of these approaches (except of course in the
         extreme case of the 100th percentile).

      (b) To report 2-point PDV [<a href="#ref-Y.1540" title='"IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters"'>Y.1540</a>]:

         Pos PDV Threshold = 60 (note this implies +60 ms); Pos PDV
         Percentile = 96.3; Neg PDV Threshold = 0; Neg PDV Percentile =
         0; PDV type = 1 (2-point PDV)

         causes 2-point PDV to be reported in the Mean PDV field.

         2-point PDV, according to [<a href="#ref-Y.1540" title='"IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters"'>Y.1540</a>] is the difference in delay
         between the current packet and the referenced packet of the
         stream.  If the sending and receiving clocks are not
         synchronized, this metric includes the effect of relative
         timing drift.

   When SDP is used in offer/answer, a system sending SDP may request a
   specific type of PDV measurement.  In addition, they may state a
   specific percentile or threshold value and expect to receive the
   corresponding threshold or percentile metric, respectively.  The
   system receiving the SDP SHOULD send the PDV metrics requested, but
   if the metric is not available, the system receiving the SDP MUST
   send the metric block with the flag value indicating that the metric
   is unavailable.

   This document creates a new registry to be called "RTCP XR PDV block
   - PDV type" as a sub-registry of the "RTP Control Protocol Extended
   Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry".  Policies for this new
   registry are as follows:

   o  The information required to support an assignment is an
      unambiguous definition of the new metric, covering the base
      measurements and how they are processed to generate the reported
      metric.  This should include the units of measurement, how values
      of the metric are reported in the three 16-bit fields "Pos PDV
      Threshold/Peak", "Neg PDV Threshold/Peak", and "Mean PDV" within
      the report block, and how the metric uses the two 16-bit fields
      "Pos PDV Percentile" and "Neg PDV Percentile".

   o  The review process for the registry is "Specification Required" as
      described in <a href="./rfc5226#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of [RFC5226]</a>.

   o  Entries in the registry are unsigned 4-bit integers.  The valid
      range is 0 to 15 corresponding to the 4-bit field "pdvtyp" in the
      block.  Values are to be recorded in decimal.

   o  Initial assignments are as follows:

      *  0: MAPDV2, Clause 6.2.3.2 of [<a href="#ref-G.1020" title='"Performance parameter definitions for quality of speech and other voiceband applications utilizing IP networks"'>G.1020</a>],

      *  1: 2-point PDV, Clause 6.2.4 of [<a href="#ref-Y.1540" title='"IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters"'>Y.1540</a>],

      *  2-15: Reserved for future use.

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR block introduces no new
   security considerations beyond those described in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].  This
   block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>, paragraph 3, of [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>]
   does not apply.
