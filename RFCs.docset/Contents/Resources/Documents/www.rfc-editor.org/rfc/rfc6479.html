            <span class="h1">IPsec Anti-Replay Algorithm without Bit Shifting</span>

Abstract

   This document presents an alternate method to do the anti-replay
   checks and updates for IP Authentication Header (AH) and
   Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP).  The method defined in this
   document obviates the need for bit shifting and it reduces the number
   of times an anti-replay window is adjusted.

   "IP Authentication Header" [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>] and "IP Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP)" [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>] define an anti-replay service that employs a
   sliding window mechanism.  The mechanism, when enabled by a receiver,
   uses an anti-replay window of size W.  This window limits how far out
   of order a packet can be, relative to the packet with the highest
   sequence number that has been authenticated so far.  The window can
   be represented by a range [WB, WT], where WB=WT-W+1.  The whole
   anti-replay window can be thought of as a string of bits.  The value
   of each bit indicates whether or not a packet with that sequence
   number has been received and authenticated, so that the replay packet
   can be detected and rejected.  If the packet is received, the
   receiver gets the sequence number S in the packet.  If S is inside
   window (S&lt;=WT and S&gt;=WB), then the receiver checks the corresponding
   bit (location is S-WB) in the window to see if this S has already
   been seen.  If S&lt;WB, the packet is dropped.  If S&gt;WT and is
   validated, the window is advanced by (S-WT) bits.  The new window
   becomes [WB+S-WT, S].  The new bits in this new window are set to
   indicate that no packets with those sequence numbers have been
   received.  The typical implementation (for example, the integrity
   algorithm [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>]) is done by shifting (S-WT) bits.  In normal
   cases, the packets arrive in order, which results in continuous
   updates and bit-shifting operations.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4302">RFC4302</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>] define minimum window sizes of 32 and 64.
   But no requirement is established for minimum or recommended window
   sizes beyond 64 packets.  The window size needs to be based on
   reasonable expectations for packet re-ordering.  For a high-end,
   multi-core network processor with multiple crypto cores, a window
   size bigger than 64 or 128 is needed due to the varied IPsec
   processing latency caused by different cores.  In such a case, the
   window sliding is tremendously costly even with hardware acceleration
   to do the bit shifting.  This document describes an alternate method
   to avoid bit shifting.  It only discusses the anti-replay processing
   at the receiving side.  The processing is always safe and has no
   interoperability effects.  Even with a window size bigger than the
   usual 32- or 64-bit window, no interoperability issues are caused.

   Any node employing practices that potentially cause reordering beyond
   the usual 32- or 64-bit window may lead to interoperability or
   performance problems, however.  For instance, if either the sending
   node or routers along the path cause significant re-ordering, this
   can lead to inability of the receiving IPsec endpoint to process the
   packets, as many current implementations do not support the
   extensions defined in this memo.  Similarly, such reordering can
   cause significant problems for transport and upper-layer protocols,
   and is generally best avoided.

   Here we present an easy way to update the window index only, while
   also reducing the number window updates.  The basic idea is
   illustrated in the following figures.  Suppose that we configure the
   window size W, which consists of M-1 blocks, where M is a power of
   two (2).  Each block contains N bits, where N is also a power of two
   (2).  It can be a byte (8 bit) or word (32 bit), or multiple words.
   The supported sliding window size is (M-1)*N.  However, it covers up
   M blocks (four blocks as shown in Figure 1).  All these M blocks are
   circulated and become a ring of blocks, each with N bits.  In this
   way, the supported sliding window (M-1 blocks) is always a subset
   window of the actual window when the window slides.

   Initially, the actual window is defined by a low- and high-end index
   [WB, WT], as illustrated in Figure 1.

   If we receive a packet with the sequence number (S) greater than WT,
   we slide the window.  But we only change the window index by adding
   the difference (S-WT) to both WT and WB (WB is automatically changed
   as the window size is fixed).  So, S becomes the largest sequence
   number of the received packets.  Figure 2 shows the case that the
   packet with sequence number S=WT+1 is received.

           WB                        WT

      Figure 2: The sliding window [WB, WT] after S=WT+1

   If S is in a different block from where WT is, we have to initialize
   all bit values in the blocks to 0 without bit shifting.  If S passes
   several blocks, we have to initialize several blocks instead of only
   one block.  Figure 3 shows that the sequence number already passed
   the block boundary.  Immediately after the update, all the check bits
   should be 0 in the block where WT resides.

       WT        WB

      Figure 3: The sliding window [WB, WT] after S passes the boundary

   After the update, the new window still covers the configured window.
   This means the configured sub-window also slides, conforming to the
   sliding window protocol.  The actual effect is somewhat like
   shifting the block.  In this way, the bit shifting is deemed
   unnecessary.

   It is also easier and much faster to check the window with the
   sequence number because the sequence number check does not
   depend on the lowest index WB.  Instead, it only depends on the
   sequence number of the received packet.  If we receive a sequence
   number S, the bit location is the lowest several bits of the
   sequence number, which only depends on the block size (N).  The
   block index is several bits before the location bits, which only
   depends on the window size (M).

   We do not specify how many redundancy bits are needed, except that
   it should be a power of two (2) for computation efficiency.  If the
   microprocessor is 32 bits, 32 might be a better choice while 64
   might be better for 64-bit microprocessor.  For a microprocessor
   with cache support, one cache line is also a good choice.  It also
   depends on the size of the sliding window.  If we have N
   redundancy bits (for example, 32 bits in the above description),
   we only need 1/N times update of blocks, comparing to the
   bit-shifting algorithm in [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>].

   The cost of this method is extra byte(s) being used as a redundant
   window.  The cost will be minimal if the window size is big enough.
   Actually, the extra redundant bits are not completely wasted.  We
   could reuse the unused bits in the block where index WB resides,
   i.e., the supported window size could be (M-1)*N, plus the unused
   bits in the last block.

   checks and updates, which is described in the previous sections.

    high-performance multi-core network processor.  The new network
    processor core integrates a dozen of crypto core in a distributed
