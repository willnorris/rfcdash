   clarified in <a href="#section-2">section 2</a>.  Needless to say, the purpose of this
   specification is not limited to this support, and it should also be
   applicable to other purposes.

   This specification provides an indispensable framework for the
   implementation of long-lived session and QoS-sensitive session
   transfers over ATM.  Note that this document only specifies the
   assignment of the information field and protocol identifier, and that
   it may not specify complete protocol that enables interoperable
   implementation.  This is because it is beyond the scope of this
   document and will be specified in a separate document.

   With the development of new multimedia applications on the current
   Internet, the demands for multimedia support are increasing in the IP
   network, which currently supports best effort communications.  In
   particular, demands to support QoS guaranteed communications are
   increasing with the development of voice, audio, and video
   communications applications.  And it may also be necessary to
   introduce the mechanism that can efficiently transfer the huge volume
   of traffic expected with these applications.

   The major features of B-ISDN are high speed, logical multiplexing
   with the VP/VC, and flexible QoS management per VC, so it is quite
   natural to use these distinctive functions of B-ISDN to implement a
   multimedia support mechanism in the IP network.  The flexible QoS
   management and logical multiplexing functions in B-ISDN are the
   expected method of implementing the QoS guaranteed communications in
   the Internet.  And when a long-lived session is supported by a
   particular VC, efficient packet forwarding may be possible using the
   high speed and logical multiplexing of B-ISDN.

   This section clarifies B-ISDN signaling functions that are required
   when the session is supported by the VC, for advanced B-ISDN
   signaling support of the Internet protocol.

      Fig. 2.1: Example scenario for establishing a VC for a long-lived
                session.

   First, a session is multiplexed into the default VC connecting the
   routers.  Then, if a router detects that it is a long-lived session,
   it sets up a new VC for the session.  If the new VC is established
   successfully, the long-lived session is moved to the new VC.

   In this procedure involving an ATM VC setup, the B-ISDN signaling
   entity in the called side router must detect that the incoming call
   corresponds to a session of the Internet protocol and notify that
   fact to the IP layer entity.  Based on this information, the IP layer
   entity moves the session to the new VC.

   Therefore, to implement this signaling procedure, the B-ISDN
   signaling must include an session identifier as an information
   element.  The B-LLI, B-HLI, User-user, and Generic Identifier
   information elements are all capable of transferring this
   information.  Considering the original purposes of these information
   elements, the most appropriate one to use is the Generic Identifier
   information element.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2%20QoS-sensitive%20Session%20Signaling"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a> QoS-sensitive Session Signaling</span>

   The major difference between QoS-sensitive session signaling and
   long-lived session signaling is that call setup is not initiated by
   the detection of a long-lived session, but is explicitly initiated by
   the setup protocol such as RSVP.  To implement QoS-sensitive session
   signaling using ATM, the ATM network between the routers must forward
   not only the session identifier but also the setup protocol.

   There are two schemes for forwarding the setup protocol.  One is to
   multiplex the protocol into a default VC connecting the routers, or
   to forward the protocol through a particular VC.  In this case, the
   QoS-sensitive session and the ATM VC are established sequentially.
   The second scheme is to forward the setup protocol as an information
   element in the B-ISDN signaling.  In this case, the QoS-sensitive
   session and the ATM VC are established simultaneously.  The latter
   scheme has the following advantages compared with the former one.

   o Easier to implement.

     - Admission control is simplified, because admission control for
       the IP and ATM layers can be done simultaneously.

     - Watchdog timer processing is simplified, because there is no need
       to watch the IP layer establishment and ATM layer establishment
       sequentially.

   o If the setup protocol supports negotiation, then an ATM VC whose
     QoS is based on the result of negotiation can be established.

   However, the latter scheme, at least, cannot support a case where a
   PVC is used to support a QoS-sensitive session.  Therefore, both
   procedures should be taken into account.

      Fig. 2.2: Example procedure for simultaneous QoS-sensitive session
                and ATM VC establishment.

   RSVP is currently proposed for the setup protocol and new setup
   protocols are likely to be developed in the future.  Therefore, to
   generalize the discussion, the procedure for the setup protocol in
   this example is the general connection setup procedure using
   confirmed service.

   To implement this signaling procedure, the B-ISDN signaling must
   include the User-user information element that the capacity is
   sufficient to forward the setup protocol.

   The SETUP, ALERTING, CONNECT, RELEASE, RELEASE COMPLETE, PROGRESS,
   ADD PARTY, PARTY ALERTING, ADD PARTY ACK, ADD PARTY REJECT, DROP
   PARTY, and DROP PARTY ACK messages that are transferred between end-
   to-end users in the ATM network may contain a User-user information
   element.  The ATM network transfers the User-user information element
   transparently if it contains no coding rule errors.

   From the viewpoint of B-ISDN signaling applications, it seems the
   Generic Identifier and User-to-user Signaling are similar functions.
   But their rules for processing exceptions are not completely the
   same, because their purposes are different.  The Generic Identifier
   is designed for the transfer of identifiers between the c-planes,
   while the User-to-user Signaling is designed for the transfer of user
   data via the c-planes.  Another difference is that the latter
   supports interworking with the user-user information element in the

   The Identifier type field is the Session, Resource, or
   Experiment/Organization specific.

   The Identifier value field is assigned to Internet protocol related
   information which is identified by the Identifier related
   standard/application field and Identifier type field.  The following
   identifiers are specified.

                                     Std./app.               Id type

     IPv4 session identifier         IPv4                    Session

     IPv6 session identifier         IPv6                    Session

     Exp./Org. specific              IPv4/ST2+/IPv6/MPLS     Experiment

   As described in <a href="#section-3.1">section 3.1</a>, the B-ISDN signaling message transferred
   between end-to-end users may contain up to three Generic Identifier
   information elements.  These elements may contain multiple
   identifiers.  This document does not specify the order of identifiers
   when multiple identifiers appear in a signaling message.

   This document also does not specify the semantics when multiple
   identifiers having the same Identifier type appear in a signaling
   message, or when a signaling message contains a Generic Identifier
   information element that does not contain identifiers.

   When a B-ISDN signaling message containing a Generic Identifier
   information element enters an ATM network that does not support the
   Generic Identifier, the network clears the call, discards the
   information element, or discards the signaling message.  (See
   sections <a href="#section-4.5.1">4.5.1</a> and <a href="#section-5.6.8.1">5.6.8.1</a> of Q.2931 and <a href="#section-9.3">section 9.3</a> of Q.2941.1 for
   details.)

   To enable reliable Generic Identifier information element transfer,
   when the calling party sends a SETUP or ADD PARTY message with up to
   three Generic Identifier information elements, the CONNECT or ADD
   PARTY ACK message returned by the called party must contain at least
   one Generic Identifier information element.  The called party may not
   respond with the same identifiers received from the calling party.
   The calling party should confirm that the response message contains
   at least one Generic Identifier information element.  This rule
   enables identifier negotiation; this document does not specify the
   detailed procedure of this negotiation.

      Fig. 4.6: Principle of assignment in the User-user information
                element.

   The Protocol discriminator field is the Internet protocol/application
   (0x06).  In this case, the first 1 octet in the User information
   field is the Internet protocol/application identifier field.

   Assignment of the Internet protocol/application identifier field is
   as follows.  A leading 0x means hexadecimal.

     0x00: Reserved.

     0x01: Reserved for ST2+.

     0x02: RSVP message.

     0x03-0xFD: Reserved for IANA assignment.

     0xFE: Experiment/Organization specific.

     0xFF: Reserved.

   The field that follows the Internet protocol/application identifier
   field is assigned to Internet protocol/application related
   information that is identified by the Internet protocol/application
   identifier field.

   When a B-ISDN signaling message containing a User-user information
   element enters an ATM network that does not support the User-to-user
   Signaling, the network clears the call, discards the information
   element, or discards the signaling message.  (See sections <a href="#section-4.5.1">4.5.1</a> and
   5.6.8.1 of Q.2931, <a href="#section-1.9">section 1.9</a> of Q.2957, and Q.2971 annex D for
   details.)

   To enable reliable User-user information element transfer, when the
   calling party sends a SETUP or ADD PARTY message with a User-user
   information element, the CONNECT or ADD PARTY ACK message returned by
   the called party must contain a User-user information element.  The
   called party may not respond with the same user information received
   from the calling party.  The calling party should confirm that the
   response message contains a User-user information element.  This rule
   enables negotiation; this document does not specify the detailed
   procedure of this negotiation.

   o Generic Identifier support for session aggregation.

      Session aggregation support may be needed in a backbone
      environment.  Wild card style aggregated session identifier may be
      feasible.  However, before specifying Generic Identifier support
      for it, session aggregation model in ATM VCs should be clarified.

   o Generic Identifier support for the IPv6 flow label and traffic
      classes.

      The IPv6 flow label and traffic classes support may be needed in
      future.  However, currently their semantics are not clear.

   When the Identifier related standard/application field in the
   Q.2941.2 Generic Identifier information element is the IPv4, ST2+,
   IPv6, or MPLS, numbers between 0x10-0xFD in the Identifier type field
   are reserved for IANA assignment.  (See <a href="#section-3.1">section 3.1</a>.)  Following the
   policies outlined in [<a href="#ref-14" title="">14</a>], these numbers are allocated through an
   IETF Consensus action.

   When the Protocol discriminator field in the Q.2957 User-user
   information element is the Internet protocol/application, numbers
   between 0x03-0xFD in the Internet protocol/application identifier
   field are reserved for IANA assignment.  (See <a href="#section-4.2.1">section 4.2.1</a>.)

   This document specifies the information field and protocol identifier
   assignment in the Q.2941 Generic Identifier and Q.2957 User-to-user
   Signaling for the Internet protocol, so these do not weaken the
   security of the B-ISDN signaling.

   In a called party of the B-ISDN signaling, if the incoming SETUP
   message contains the calling party number and if it is verified and
   passed by the ATM network or it is provided by the network, then it
   is feasible to use the calling party number for part of the calling
   party authentication to strengthen security.

   If the Identifier related standard/application field in the Generic
   Identifier information element is the ST2+, and the Identifier type
   field in the identifier is the Session, the identifier is the ST2+
   session identifier.  The format of the ST2+ session identifier is
