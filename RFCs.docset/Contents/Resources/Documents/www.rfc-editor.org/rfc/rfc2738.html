Abstract

   In <a href="./rfc2533">RFC 2533</a>, "A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets", an
   expression format is presented for describing media feature
   capabilities using simple media feature tags.

   This memo contains two corrections to that specification:  one fixes
   an error in the formal syntax specification, and the other fixes an
   error in the rules for reducing feature comparison predicates.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   In <a href="./rfc2533">RFC 2533</a>, "A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets" [<a href="#ref-1" title='"A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets"'>1</a>], an
   expression format is presented for describing media feature
   capabilities using simple media feature tags.  This provides a format
   for message handling agents to describe the media feature content of
   messages that they can handle.  That memo also describes an algorithm
   for finding the common capabilities expressed by two different
   feature expressions.

   This memo contains two corrections to that specification:  one fixes
   an error in the formal syntax specification, and the other fixes an
   error in the feature set matching algorithm, in the rules for
   reducing feature comparison predicates.

   The first of these corrections affects the normative content of <a href="./rfc2533">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2533">2533</a>;  the second affects non-normative content.

   This specification uses syntax notation and conventions described in
   <a href="./rfc2234">RFC 2234</a>, "Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF" [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>2</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Correction%20to%20feature%20expression%20syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Correction to feature expression syntax</span>

   In <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>, <a href="./rfc2533">RFC 2533</a> defines the syntax for a "set" expression as
   follows:

       set        =  attr "=" "[" setentry *( "," setentry ) "]"
       setentry   =  value "/" range

   The production for 'setentry' should read:

       setentry   =  value / range

   That is: the '/' character is not a character literal, but separates
   two alternative forms for 'setentry'.  This corrected syntax allows
   the set expression examples given in <a href="./rfc2533#section-4.2.5">sectionÂ 4.2.5 of RFC 2533</a>, such
   as:

       ( width=[3,4,6..17/2] )

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Correction%20to%20feature%20set%20matching%20reduction%20rules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Correction to feature set matching reduction rules</span>

   In <a href="#section-5.8.2">section 5.8.2</a>, "Rules for simplifying unordered values", <a href="./rfc2533">RFC 2533</a>
   lists the following rewriting rules for simplifying feature tag
   comparisons with unordered values:

      (LE f a)  (LE f b)      --&gt;  (LE f a),   a=b
                                   FALSE,      otherwise
      (LE f a)  (GE f b)      --&gt;  FALSE,      a!=b
      (LE f a)  (NL f b)      --&gt;  (LE f a)    a!=b
                                   FALSE,      otherwise
      (LE f a)  (NG f b)      --&gt;  (LE f a),   a!=b
                                   FALSE,      otherwise

   The second of these rules is incomplete, and should read:

      (LE f a)  (GE f b)      --&gt;  (LE f a),   a=b
                                   FALSE,      otherwise

        NOTE:  implementation experience with these rules has
        suggested a revised feaure set matching algorithm with a
        more useful set of simplification rules.  Apart from the
        change noted above, the algorithm given in <a href="./rfc2533">RFC 2533</a> has
        been implemented and shown to work as intended, but the
        results generated are not always in the most convenient
        form.  It is planned to test and publish a revised
        algorithm at a future date.
