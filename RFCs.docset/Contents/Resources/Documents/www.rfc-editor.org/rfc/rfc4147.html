Abstract

   This document proposes a revised format for the IANA IPv6 address
   registries.  Rather than providing a formal definition of the format,
   it is described by giving examples of the (current as of preparation
   of this document) contents of the registries in the proposed format.
   The proposed format would bring the IANA IPv6 address registries into
   alignment with the current IPv6 Address Architecture specification,
   as well as update it to a more useful and generally accepted format.

   This document proposes a revised format for the IANA IPv6 address
   registries.  The proposed format would bring the IANA IPv6 address
   registries into alignment with the current IPv6 Address Architecture
   specification, as well as update it to a more useful and generally
   accepted format.

   The current (as of preparation of this document) IANA IPv6 registries
   [<a href="#ref-iana-ipv6-registry" title='"IANA IPv6 Address Registry"'>iana-ipv6-registry</a>] [<a href="#ref-iana-ipv6-tla" title='"IANA Registry of IPv6 Top Level Aggregation Identifier Assignments"'>iana-ipv6-tla</a>] are based on a now-deprecated
   address architecture that used the concept of Top Level Aggregation
   Identifiers (TLAs) and sub-TLAs.  The current IPv6 Address
   Architecture [<a href="./rfc3513" title='"Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture"'>RFC3513</a>] uses the terminology of Global Identifiers
   instead of TLAs and sub-TLAs.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4147">RFC 4147</a>                   IANA IPv6 Registry                August 2005</span>

   The proposed format for the IPv6 address registry is indicated by
   example, using the registry state that is current as of preparation
   of this document, in Figure 1.  The registry explicitly notes which
   entity is placing a reservation on an address block and notes the
   defining RFC document for each allocation.

   The proposed format of the registry is a title line, the date of the
   last change to the registry, the registry in a tabular format, notes
   and references.

   The table uses 4 columns.  Within the table, the first column
   contains an IPv6 address prefix, using a hexadecimal notation of the
   address prefix and a prefix length.  There are no overlapping address
   blocks in the first column, and the set of address blocks in the
   registry spans the entire IPv6 address space.  The second column
   denotes the current disposition of the address block, using notation
   derived from the defining RFC document.  The third column contains a
   reference to the RFC that describes the current disposition of the
   address block.  The fourth column uses numeric footnote notation to
   reference any additional text associated with the address block.

   The notes in the registry may include a summary of previous
   disposition status values associated with an address block, as this
   summary is specifically not included in the registry table.  The
   notes are numbered sequentially.

   The reference section uses a conventional citation format.  The
   references include documents referenced in the registry table and
   documents referenced in the notes.

     FF00::/8              Multicast               <a href="./rfc3513">RFC3513</a>

   Notes:

     [<a id="ref-0">0</a>]  The IPv6 address management function was formally delegated to
          IANA in December 1995 [<a href="./rfc1881">RFC1881</a>].

     [<a id="ref-1">1</a>]  The "unspecified address", the "loopback address", and the
          IPv6 Addresses with Embedded IPv4 Addresses are assigned out
          of the 0000::/8 address block.

     [<a id="ref-2">2</a>]  0200::/7 was previously defined as an OSI NSAP-mapped prefix
          set [<a href="./rfc1888">RFC1888</a>].  This definition has been deprecated as of
          December 2004 [<a href="./rfc4048">RFC4048</a>].

     [<a id="ref-3">3</a>]  The IPv6 Unicast space encompasses the entire IPv6 address
          range with the exception of FF00::/8. [<a href="./rfc3513" title='"Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture"'>RFC3513</a>] IANA unicast
          address assignments are currently limited to the IPv6 unicast
          address range of 2000::/3.  IANA assignments from this block
          are registered in the IANA registry: iana-ipv6-unicast-
          address-assignments.

     [<a id="ref-4">4</a>]  FEC0::/10 was previously defined as a Site-Local scoped
          address prefix.  This definition has been deprecated as of
          September 2004 [<a href="./rfc3879">RFC3879</a>].

   o  The textual preamble at the start of the registry has been
      removed, in deference to the use of standard IPv6 prefix notation
      in the registry.

   o  Binary prefix notation has been replaced by standard IPv6 prefix
      hexadecimal notation, and the fraction of address space column has
      been replaced with the reference to the relevant RFC that defines
      the disposition of the address block.  Footnote references are
      also displayed in a consistent fashion.

   o  The terminology "Unassigned" has been replaced by the more precise
      phrase "Reserved by IETF", indicating the body that has the token
      to permit reassignment of the status of this address block.

   o  The "Formerly Site-Local" entry in the body of the registry has
      been replaced with an explicit reference to deprecation.  A
      similar treatment is proposed for 0200::/8, although the RFC
      number for the deprecation document has yet to be assigned.  There
      is a distinction drawn between the current status of a registry
      and the set of registry actions that have lead to the current
      state.  The registry table describes the current status of the
      registry, while the text footnotes are used to describe the set of
      transactions leading to the current state, including any former
      states.

   o  Annotations that are references to footnotes are included in the
      registry in a separate column.

   o  The text commentary on unicast, multicast and anycast addresses
      has been removed, as there is no distinction between anycast and
      unicast addresses and multicast addresses are explicitly flagged
      in the registry.

   o  A note and a corresponding reference to <a href="./rfc1881">RFC1881</a> was added to
      record the formal delegation of the IPv6 address management
      function to IANA.

   The proposed registry format for Global Unicast IPv6 address block
   allocations is indicated by example, using the registry state that
   was current as of preparation of this document, in Figure 2.  The
   registry notes the current allocations, and does not include any
   notation of intended future allocations or reservations.  All address
   space not listed in this registry forms the IANA unallocated address
   pool, to be allocated by IANA as per the prevailing address
   allocation policies.

   The proposed format of the registry is a title line, the date of the
   last change to the registry, the registry in a tabular format, notes
   and references.

   The table uses 4 columns.  Within the table, the first column is an
   IPv6 address prefix, using a hexadecimal notation of the address
   prefix and a prefix length.  There are no overlapping address blocks
   in the first column.  The entries here describe only IANA allocations
   of address blocks.  Temporary IANA reservations for future
   allocations, allocation expansion windows and any other internal IANA
   states are not described in this registry.  The second column
   describes the current disposition of the address block, by noting
   either the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) to whom the address block
   was assigned, or the intended use of the address block.  The third
   column is the date of the IANA allocation, including the day of the
   month.  The fourth column uses numeric footnote notation to reference
   any additional text associated with the address block.

   The notes in the registry may include a summary of previous
   disposition status values associated with an address block, as this
   summary is specifically not included in the registry table.  The
   notes are numbered sequentially.

   The reference section uses a conventional citation format.  The
   references include documents referenced in the registry table and
   documents referenced in the notes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Notes%20on%20Proposed%20Format%20Changes%20to%20the%20Registry"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Notes on Proposed Format Changes to the Registry</span>

   o  The current registry name "iana-ipv6-tla-assignments" should be
      changed to "iana-ipv6-unicast-address-assignments".

   o  The title of the registry has been altered to remove the reference
      to "TOP LEVEL AGGREGATION IDENTIFIER".

   o  The TLA and Sub-TLA identifier assignments have been rolled into a
      single set of address prefixes and their assignment.

   o  The text commentary at the start of the registry contents has been
      removed.

   o  Binary value notation of the address prefixes has been removed.

   o  Further commentary on assignments, such as the planned phaseout of
      the 6BONE, is placed in a footnote.

   o  The registry continuation lines using ellipsis notation have been
      removed.

   o  Only assigned addresses are listed.  All unassigned addresses,
      marked in the original IANA registry with the assignment note of
      "(future assignment)" have been removed, as has the entry marked
      "reserved *)".

   o  Address assignments are listed using prefix size notation of the
      actual allocation, rather than reporting the allocation in sub-
      units of /23 prefixes.

   o  The date of the IANA action includes the day of the month as well
      as the month and year.

   IANA is advised to adopt these formats for the IPv6 address registry
   and the IPv6 Global Unicast address registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Security of the Internet's routing system relies on the ability to
   authenticate an assertion of unique control of an address block.
   Measures to authenticate such assertions rely on validation that the
   address block forms part of an existing allocated address block, and
   that there is a trustable reference from the IANA address registry to
   the RIR, and a trustable reference from the RIR's registry to a Local
   Internet Registry or end-user Internet Service Provider.

   The proposed format for the IANA registry is a small step towards the
   creation of a registry that can be used as a trust point for
   commencing a chain of address validation.  Consideration should be
   given to IANA registry publication formats that are machine
   parseable, and also the use of file signatures and associated
   certificate mechanisms to allow applications to confirm that the
   registry contents are current, and that they have been published by
   the IANA.
