                              ARPAWOCKY


                    Twas brillig, and the Protocols
                         Did USER-SERVER in the wabe.
                    All mimsey was the FTP,
                         And the RJE outgrabe,

                    Beware the ARPANET, my son;
                         The bits that byte, the heads that scratch;
                    Beware the NCP, and shun
                         the frumious system patch,

                    He took his coding pad in hand;
                         Long time the Echo-plex he sought.
                    When his HOST-to-IMP began to limp
                         he stood a while in thought,

                    And while he stood, in uffish thought,
                         The ARPANET, with IMPish bent,
                    Sent packets through conditioned lines,
                         And checked them as they went,

                    One-two, one-two, and through and through
                         The IMP-to-IMP went ACK and NACK,
                    When the RFNM came, he said "I'm game",
                         And sent the answer back,

                    Then hast thou joined the ARPANET?
                         Oh come to me, my bankrupt boy!
                    Quick, call the NIC! Send RFCs!
                         He chortled in his joy.

                    Twas brillig, and the Protocols
                         Did USER-SERVER in the wabe.
                    All mimsey was the FTP,
                         And the RJE outgrabe.

                                                            D.L. COVILL
                                                            May 1973
