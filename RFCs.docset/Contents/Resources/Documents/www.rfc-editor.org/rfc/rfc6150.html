<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6150">RFC 6150</a>                 MD2 to Historic Status               March 2011</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   MD4 [<a href="#ref-MD4" title='"The MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>MD4</a>] is a message digest algorithm that takes as input a message
   of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or
   "message digest" of the input.  This document retires [<a href="#ref-MD4" title='"The MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>MD4</a>].
   Specifically, this document moves <a href="./rfc1320">RFC 1320</a> [<a href="#ref-MD4" title='"The MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>MD4</a>] to Historic status.
   The reasons for taking this action are discussed.

   [<a id="ref-HASH-Attack">HASH-Attack</a>] summarizes the use of hashes in many protocols and
   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's one-way
   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet
   protocols.  Familiarity with [<a href="#ref-HASH-Attack">HASH-Attack</a>] is assumed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Rationale"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Rationale</span>

   MD4 was published in 1992 as an Informational RFC.  Since its
   publication, MD4 has been under attack [<a href="#ref-denBORBOS1992">denBORBOS1992</a>] [<a href="#ref-DOBB1995" title="1(3): 5">DOBB1995</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-DOBB1996" title="pages 53-70">DOBB1996</a>] [<a href="#ref-GLRW2010" title='"Advanced Meet-in-the-Middle Preimage Attacks: First Results on Full Tiger, and Improved Results on MD4 and SHA-2"'>GLRW2010</a>] [<a href="#ref-WLDCY2005" title=" Cryptanalysis of Hash Functions MD4 and RIPEMD">WLDCY2005</a>] [<a href="#ref-LUER2008" title="LNCS 5086. Springer">LUER2008</a>].  In fact, RSA, in 1996,
   suggested that MD4 should not be used [<a href="#ref-RSA-AdviceOnMD4">RSA-AdviceOnMD4</a>].  Microsoft
   also made similar statements [<a href="#ref-MS-AdviceOnMD4">MS-AdviceOnMD4</a>].

   In <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>, this document discusses attacks against MD4 that
   indicate use of MD4 is no longer appropriate when collision
   resistance is required.  <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> also discusses attacks against
   MD4's pre-image and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally,
   attacks against MD4 used in message authentication with a shared
   secret (i.e., HMAC-MD4) are discussed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Documents%20that%20Reference%20RFC%201320"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Documents that Reference <a href="./rfc1320">RFC 1320</a></span>

   There are other RFCs that refer to MD2, but they have been either
   moved to Historic status or obsoleted by a later RFC.  References and
   discussions about these RFCs are omitted.  The notable exceptions
   are:

     o [<a href="./rfc2313" title='"PKCS #1: RSA Encryption Version 1.5"'>RFC2313</a>] PKCS #1: RSA Encryption Version 1.5.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Impact%20of%20Moving%20MD4%20to%20Historic"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Impact of Moving MD4 to Historic</span>

   The impact of moving MD4 to Historic is minimal with the one
   exception of Microsoft's use of MD4 as part of RC4-HMAC in Windows,
   as described below.

   Regarding DS, PS, and BCP RFCs:

   o The initial One-Time Password systems, based on [<a href="./rfc2289" title='"A One- Time Password System"'>RFC2289</a>], have
     ostensibly been replaced by HMAC-based mechanism, as specified in
     "HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm" [<a href="./rfc4226" title='"HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm"'>RFC4226</a>].
     [<a href="./rfc4226" title='"HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm"'>RFC4226</a>] suggests following recommendations in [<a href="./rfc4086" title='"Randomness Requirements for Security"'>RFC4086</a>] for
     random input, and in [<a href="./rfc4086" title='"Randomness Requirements for Security"'>RFC4086</a>] weaknesses of MD4 are discussed.

   o MD4 was used in the Inter-Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP); each IDRP
     message carries a 16-octet hash that is computed by applying the
     MD-4 algorithm (<a href="./rfc1320">RFC 1320</a>) to the context of the message itself.
     Over time, IDRP was replaced by BGP-4 [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>], which required at
     least [<a href="#ref-MD5" title='"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>MD5</a>].



<span class="grey">Turner &amp; Chen                 Informational                     [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6150">RFC 6150</a>                 MD2 to Historic Status               March 2011</span>


   o Kerberos Version 5 [<a href="./rfc3961" title='"Encryption and Checksum Specifications for Kerberos 5"'>RFC3961</a>] specifies the use of MD4 for DES
     encryption types and checksum types.  They were specified, never
     really used, and are in the process of being deprecated by
     [<a href="#ref-DES-DIE" title='"Deprecate DES support for Kerberos"'>DES-DIE</a>].  Further, the mandatory-to-implement encrypted types and
     checksum types specified by Kerberos are based on AES-256 and HMAC-
     SHA1 [<a href="./rfc3962" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Encryption for Kerberos 5"'>RFC3962</a>].

   Regarding Informational RFCs:

   o PKCS#1 v1.5 [<a href="./rfc2313" title='"PKCS #1: RSA Encryption Version 1.5"'>RFC2313</a>] indicated that there was no reason to not use
     MD4.  PKCS#1 v2.0 [<a href="./rfc2437" title='"PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.0"'>RFC2437</a>] and v2.1 [<a href="./rfc3447" title='"Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.1"'>RFC3447</a>] recommend against
     MD4 due to cryptoanalytic progress having uncovered weaknesses in
     the collision resistance of MD4.

   o Randomness Requirements [<a href="./rfc4086" title='"Randomness Requirements for Security"'>RFC4086</a>] does mention MD4, but not in a
     good way; it explains how the algorithm works and that there have
     been a number of attacks found against it.

   o The "Internet Users' Glossary" [<a href="./rfc1983" title="&quot;Internet Users' Glossary&quot;">RFC1983</a>] provided a definition for
     Message Digest and listed MD4 as one example.

   o The IETF OTP specification [<a href="./rfc2289" title='"A One- Time Password System"'>RFC2289</a>] was based on S/KEY technology.
     So S/KEY was replaced by OTP, at least in theory.  Additionally,
     the S/KEY implementations in the wild have started to use MD5 in
     lieu of MD4.

   o The CAdES document [<a href="./rfc5126" title='"CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES)"'>RFC5126</a>] lists MD4 as a hash algorithm,
     disparages it, and then does not mention it again.

   o The SHA-1 document [<a href="./rfc3174" title='"US Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1)"'>RFC3174</a>] mentions MD4 in the acknowledgements
     section.

   o The three RFCs describing Microsoft protocols, [<a href="./rfc2433" title='"Microsoft PPP CHAP Extensions"'>RFC2433</a>],
     [<a href="./rfc2759" title='"Microsoft PPP CHAP Extensions, Version 2"'>RFC2759</a>], and [<a href="./rfc4757" title='"The RC4-HMAC Kerberos Encryption Types Used by Microsoft Windows"'>RFC4757</a>], are very widely deployed as MS-CHAP v1,
     MS-CHAP v2, and RC4-HMAC, respectively.

      o MS-CHAP Version 1 is supported in Microsoft's Windows XP, 2000,
        98, 95, NT 4.0, NT 3.51, and NT 3.5, but support has been
        dropped in Vista.  MS-CHAP Version 2 is supported in Microsoft's
        Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2000, 98, 95, and NT 4.0.  Both versions
        of MS-CHAP are also supported by RADIUS [<a href="./rfc2548" title='"Microsoft Vendor-specific RADIUS Attributes"'>RFC2548</a>] and the
        Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [<a href="./rfc5281" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol Tunneled Transport Layer Security Authenticated Protocol Version 0 (EAP-TTLSv0)"'>RFC5281</a>].  In 2007,
        [<a href="./rfc4962" title='"Guidance for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Key Management"'>RFC4962</a>] listed MS-CHAP v1 and v2 as flawed and recommended
        against their use; these incidents were presented as a strong
        indication for the necessity of built-in crypto-algorithm
        agility in Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
        protocols.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6150">RFC 6150</a>                 MD2 to Historic Status               March 2011</span>


      o The RC4-HMAC is supported in Microsoft's Windows 2000 and later
        versions of Windows for backwards compatibility with Windows
        2000.  As [<a href="./rfc4757" title='"The RC4-HMAC Kerberos Encryption Types Used by Microsoft Windows"'>RFC4757</a>] stated, RC4-HMAC doesn't rely on the
        collision resistance property of MD4, but uses it to generate a
        key from a password, which is then used as input to HMAC-MD5.
        For an attacker to recover the password from RC4-HMAC, the
        attacker first needs to recover the key that is used with HMAC-
        MD5.  As noted in [<a href="./rfc6151" title='"Updated Security Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the HMAC-MD5 Algorithms"'>RFC6151</a>], key recovery attacks on HMAC-MD5
        are not yet practical.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Other%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Other Considerations</span>

   rsync [<a href="#ref-RSYNC">RSYNC</a>], a non-IETF protocol, once specified the use of MD4,
   but as of version 3.0.0 published in 2008, it has adopted MD5 [<a href="#ref-MD5" title='"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>MD5</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This section addresses attacks against MD4's collisions, pre-image,
   and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally, attacks against HMAC-
   MD4 are discussed.

   Some may find the guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in
   [<a href="#ref-SP800-57" title=" Special Publication 800-57: Recommendation for Key Management - Part 1 (Revised)">SP800-57</a>] and [<a href="#ref-SP800-131" title=" Special Publication 800-131: DRAFT Recommendation for the Transitioning of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes">SP800-131</a>] useful.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20Collision%20Resistance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Collision Resistance</span>

   A practical attack on MD4 was shown by Dobbertin in 1996 with
   complexity 2^20 of MD4 hash computations [<a href="#ref-DOBB1996" title="pages 53-70">DOBB1996</a>].  In 2004, a more
   devastating result presented by Xiaoyun Wang showed that the
   complexity can be reduced to 2^8 of MD4 hash operations.  At the Rump
   Session of Crypto 2004, Wang said that as a matter of fact, finding a
   collision of MD4 can be accomplished with a pen on a piece of paper.
   The formal result was presented at EUROCRYPT 2005 in [<a href="#ref-WLDCY2005" title=" Cryptanalysis of Hash Functions MD4 and RIPEMD">WLDCY2005</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20Pre-Image%20and%20Second%20Pre-Image%20Resistance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance</span>

   The first pre-image attack on full MD4 was accomplished in [<a href="#ref-LUER2008" title="LNCS 5086. Springer">LUER2008</a>]
   with complexity 2^100.  Some improvements are shown on pre-image
   attacks and second pre-image attacks of MD4 with certain pre-
   computations [<a href="#ref-GLRW2010" title='"Advanced Meet-in-the-Middle Preimage Attacks: First Results on Full Tiger, and Improved Results on MD4 and SHA-2"'>GLRW2010</a>], where complexity is reduced to 2^78.4 and
   2^69.4 for pre-image and second pre-image, respectively.  The pre-
   image attacks on MD4 are practical.  It cannot be used as a one-way
   function.  For example, it must not be used to hash a cryptographic
   key of 80 bits or longer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.3.%20%20HMAC"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" id="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  HMAC</span>

   The attacks on Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
   algorithms [<a href="./rfc2104" title='"HMAC: Keyed- Hashing for Message Authentication"'>RFC2104</a>] presented so far can be classified in three
   types: distinguishing attacks, existential forgery attacks, and key
   recovery attacks.  Of course, among all these attacks, key recovery
   attacks are the most severe attacks.

   The best results on key recovery attacks on HMAC-MD4 were published
   at EUROCRYPT 2008 with 2^72 queries and 2^77 MD4 computations
   [<a href="#ref-WOK2008" title="and N. Kunihiro">WOK2008</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Recommendation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Recommendation</span>

   Despite MD4 seeing some deployment on the Internet, this
   specification obsoletes [<a href="#ref-MD4" title='"The MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>MD4</a>] because MD4 is not a reasonable
   candidate for further standardization and should be deprecated in
   favor of one or more existing hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 [<a href="#ref-SHS" title=" FIPS Publication 180-3: Secure Hash Standard">SHS</a>]).

   RSA Security considers it appropriate to move the MD4 algorithm to
   Historic status.

   It takes a number of years to deploy crypto and it also takes a
   number of years to withdraw it.  Algorithms need to be withdrawn
   before a catastrophic break is discovered.  MD4 is clearly showing
   signs of weakness, and implementations should strongly consider
   removing support and migrating to another hash algorithm.
