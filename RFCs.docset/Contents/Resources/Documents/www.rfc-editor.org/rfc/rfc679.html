         <span class="h1">February, 1975, Survey of New-Protocol TELNET Servers</span>

   It has been two and a half months since our last survey, and it has
   been depressing to note that "progress" toward an all-new-protocol
   network has been even slower than previously.  Changes since the last
   list (with host numbers in octal):

   SRI-ARC (2) and OFFICE-1 (53) have added logger sockets 27, but with
      Old-Protocol servers (are these forerunners of New-Protocol
      servers?);
   SDC-CC (110) has been removed from the list until it starts operating
      on the network
   LL-67 (12) now has a New-Protocol server on socket 1;
   CASE-10 (15) has departed from the network;
   BBN-TENEX is now host 361 (formerly 105);
   ANL (ARGONNE, 67) has come on the net with Old- and New-Protocol
      servers on sockets 1 and 27, respectively.

   The following is the latest version* of the summary and tabulation of
   server-host Telnet servers.
           total server hosts             36      100%
           no New-Prot server             17       47%
           unknown status (new host)       1        3%
           total New-Prot implem.         18       50%
               New-Prot on socket 27,
                   Old on socket 1 (2)    10       28%
               New-Prot on 1 and 27 (3)    6       16%
               New-Prot on 1 only (3)      2        6%
   Notes:

   * All data in this report were gathered via a surveying program run
     at various times, plus a few manual checks to fill out the data.
     What is reported here is the way the various servers work as seen
     by the new-Protocol User Telnet at BBNA, as of 20 Feb. 1975.

   (2) These are the sites whose operation is 100% correct according to
       all protocols and conventions, as I understand them.

   (3) We realize that some of the servers that appear here as New-
       Protocol servers on socket 1 are actually servers which attempt
       to communicate with both Old- and New-Protocol User TELNETs
       according to what control sequences are received.

   Note: * These servers return improper responses to some TELNET option
   requests.
