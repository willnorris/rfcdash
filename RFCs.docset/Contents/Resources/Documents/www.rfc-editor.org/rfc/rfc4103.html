Abstract

   This memo obsoletes <a href="./rfc2793">RFC 2793</a>; it describes how to carry real-time
   text conversation session contents in RTP packets.  Text conversation
   session contents are specified in ITU-T Recommendation T.140.

   One payload format is described for transmitting text on a separate
   RTP session dedicated for the transmission of text.

   This RTP payload description recommends a method to include redundant
   text from already transmitted packets in order to reduce the risk of
   text loss caused by packet loss.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document defines a payload type for carrying text conversation
   session contents in RTP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>2</a>] packets.  Text conversation session
   contents are specified in ITU-T Recommendation T.140 [<a href="#ref-1" title="with amendment 1">1</a>].  Text
   conversation is used alone or in connection with other conversational
   facilities, such as video and voice, to form multimedia conversation
   services.  Text in multimedia conversation sessions is sent
   character-by-character as soon as it is available, or with a small
   delay for buffering.

   The text is intended to be entered by human users from a keyboard,
   handwriting recognition, voice recognition or any other input method.
   The rate of character entry is usually at a level of a few characters
   per second or less.  In general, only one or a few new characters are
   expected to be transmitted with each packet.  Small blocks of text
   may be prepared by the user and pasted into the user interface for
   transmission during the conversation, occasionally causing packets to
   carry more payload.

   T.140 specifies that text and other T.140 elements must be
   transmitted in ISO 10646-1 [<a href="#ref-5">5</a>] code with UTF-8 [<a href="#ref-6" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>6</a>] transformation.
   This makes it easy to implement internationally useful applications
   and to handle the text in modern information technology environments.
   The payload of an RTP packet that follows this specification consists
   of text encoded according to T.140, without any additional framing.
   A common case will be a single ISO 10646 character, UTF-8 encoded.

   T.140 requires the transport channel to provide characters without
   duplication and in original order.  Text conversation users expect
   that text will be delivered with no, or a low level, of lost
   information.

   Therefore, a mechanism based on RTP is specified here.  It gives text
   arrival in correct order, without duplication, and with detection and
   indication of loss.  It also includes an optional possibility to
   repeat data for redundancy in order to lower the risk of loss.
   Because packet overhead is usually much larger than the T.140
   contents, the increase in bandwidth, with the use of redundancy, is
   minimal.

   By using RTP for text transmission in a multimedia conversation
   application, uniform handling of text and other media can be achieved
   in, for example, conferencing systems, firewalls, and network
   translation devices.  This, in turn, eases the design and increases
   the possibility for prompt and proper media delivery.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4103">RFC 4103</a>           RTP Payload for Text Conversation           June 2005</span>


   This document obsoletes <a href="./rfc2793">RFC 2793</a> [<a href="#ref-16" title='"RTP Payload for Text Conversation"'>16</a>].  The text clarifies
   ambiguities in <a href="./rfc2793">RFC 2793</a>, improves on the specific implementation
   requirements learned through development experience and gives
   explicit usage examples.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Conventions%20Used%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>4</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Usage%20of%20RTP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Usage of RTP</span>

   The payload format for real-time text transmission with RTP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>2</a>]
   described in this memo is intended for general text conversation use
   and is called text/t140 after its MIME registration.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Motivations%20and%20Rationale"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Motivations and Rationale</span>

   The text/t140 format is intended to be used for text transmitted on a
   separate RTP session, dedicated for the transmission of text, and not
   shared with other media.

   The text/t140 format MAY be used for any non-gateway application, as
   well as in gateways.  It MAY be used simultaneously with other media
   streams, transmitted as a separate RTP session, as required in real
   time multimedia applications.

   The text/t140 format specified in this memo is compatible with its
   earlier definition in <a href="./rfc2793">RFC 2793</a>.  It has been refined, with the main
   intention to minimize interoperability problems and encourage good
   reliability and functionality.

   By specifying text transmission as a text medium, many good effects
   are gained.  Routing, device selection, invocation of transcoding,
   selection of quality of service parameters, and other high and low
   level functions depend on each medium being explicitly specified.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Payload%20Format%20for%20Transmission%20of%20text%2Ft140%20Data"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Payload Format for Transmission of text/t140 Data</span>

   A text/t140 conversation RTP payload format consists of one, and only
   one, block of T.140 data, referred to as a "T140block" (see <a href="#section-3.3">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>).  There are no additional headers specific to this payload
   format.  The fields in the RTP header are set as defined in <a href="#section-3.5">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>, carried in network byte order (see <a href="./rfc791">RFC 791</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Internet Protocol"'>12</a>]).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20The%20%22T140block%22"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  The "T140block"</span>

   T.140 text is UTF-8 coded, as specified in T.140, with no extra
   framing.  The T140block contains one or more T.140 code elements as
   specified in [<a href="#ref-1" title="with amendment 1">1</a>].  Most T.140 code elements are single ISO 10646 [<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]
   characters, but some are multiple character sequences.  Each
   character is UTF-8 encoded [<a href="#ref-6" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>6</a>] into one or more octets.  Each block
   MUST contain an integral number of UTF-8 encoded characters
   regardless of the number of octets per character.  Any composite
   character sequence (CCS) SHOULD be placed within one block.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Synchronization%20of%20Text%20with%20Other%20Media"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Synchronization of Text with Other Media</span>

   Usually, each medium in a session utilizes a separate RTP stream.  As
   such, if synchronization of the text and other media packets is
   important, the streams MUST be associated when the sessions are
   established and the streams MUST share the same reference clock
   (refer to the description of the timestamp field as it relates to
   synchronization in <a href="./rfc3550#section-5.1">Section 5.1 of RFC 3550</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>2</a>]).  Association of RTP
   streams can be done through the CNAME field of RTCP SDES function.
   It is dependent on the particular application and is outside the
   scope of this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.5.%20%20RTP%20Packet%20Header"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" id="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  RTP Packet Header</span>

   Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header.  The following fields
   of the RTP fixed header are specified for T.140 text streams:

   Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type is specific
                      to the RTP profile under which the payload format
                      is used.  For profiles that use dynamic payload
                      type number assignment, this payload format can be
                      identified by the MIME type "text/t140" (see
                      <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>).  If redundancy is used per <a href="./rfc2198">RFC 2198</a>,
                      another payload type number needs to be provided
                      for the redundancy format.  The MIME type for
                      identifying <a href="./rfc2198">RFC 2198</a> is available in <a href="./rfc4102">RFC 4102</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Registration of the text/red MIME Sub-Type"'>9</a>].

   Sequence number:   The definition of sequence numbers is available in
                      <a href="./rfc3550">RFC 3550</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>2</a>].  When transmitting text using the
                      payload format for text/t140, it is used for
                      detection of packet loss and out-of-order packets,
                      and can be used in the process of retrieval of
                      redundant text, reordering of text and marking
                      missing text.

   Timestamp:         The RTP Timestamp encodes the approximate instance
                      of entry of the primary text in the packet.  A
                      clock frequency of 1000 Hz MUST be used.
                      Sequential packets MUST NOT use the same
                      timestamp.  Because packets do not represent any
                      constant duration, the timestamp cannot be used to
                      directly infer packet loss.

   M-bit:             The M-bit MUST be included.  The first packet in a
                      session, and the first packet after an idle
                      period, SHOULD be distinguished by setting the
                      marker bit in the RTP data header to one.  The
                      marker bit in all other packets MUST be set to
                      zero.  The reception of the marker bit MAY be used
                      for refined methods for detection of loss.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Protection%20against%20Loss%20of%20Data"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Protection against Loss of Data</span>

   Consideration must be devoted to keeping loss of text due to packet
   loss within acceptable limits.  (See ITU-T F.703 [<a href="#ref-17" title="Multimedia Conversational Services">17</a>])

   The default method that MUST be used, when no other method is
   explicitly selected, is redundancy in accordance with <a href="./rfc2198">RFC 2198</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data"'>3</a>].
   When this method is used, the original text and two redundant
   generations SHOULD be transmitted if the application or end-to-end
   conditions do not call for other levels of redundancy to be used.

   Forward Error Correction mechanisms, as per <a href="./rfc2733">RFC 2733</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"An RTP Payload Format for Generic Forward Error Correction"'>8</a>], or any
   other mechanism with the purpose of increasing the reliability of
   text transmission, MAY be used as an alternative or complement to
   redundancy.  Text data MAY be sent without additional protection if
   end-to-end network conditions allow the text quality requirements,
   specified in ITU-T F.703 [<a href="#ref-17" title="Multimedia Conversational Services">17</a>], to be met in all anticipated load
   conditions.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Payload%20Format%20When%20Using%20Redundancy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Payload Format When Using Redundancy</span>

   When using the payload format with redundant data, the transmitter
   may select a number of T140block generations to retransmit in each
   packet.  A higher number introduces better protection against loss of
   text but marginally increases the data rate.

   The RTP header is followed by one or more redundant data block
   headers: one for each redundant data block to be included.  Each of
   these headers provides the timestamp offset and length of the
   corresponding data block, in addition to a payload type number
   (indicating the payload format text/t140).

<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-7"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4103">RFC 4103</a>           RTP Payload for Text Conversation           June 2005</span>


   The redundant data block headers are followed by the redundant data
   fields carrying T140blocks from previous packets.  Finally, the new
   (primary) T140block for this packet follows.

   Redundant data that would need a timestamp offset higher than 16383
   (due to its age at transmission) MUST NOT be included in transmitted
   packets.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Using%20Redundancy%20with%20the%20text%2Ft140%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Using Redundancy with the text/t140 Format</span>

   Because text is transmitted only when there is text to transmit, the
   timestamp is not used to identify a lost packet.  Rather, missing
   sequence numbers are used to detect lost text packets at reception.
   Also, because sequence numbers are not provided in the redundant
   header, some additional rules must be followed to allow redundant
   data that corresponds to missing primary data to be properly merged
   into the stream of primary data T140blocks.  They are:

   - Each redundant data block MUST contain the same data as a T140block
     previously transmitted as primary data.

   - The redundant data MUST be placed in age order, with the most
     recent redundant T140block last in the redundancy area.

   - All T140blocks, from the oldest desired generation up through the
     generation immediately preceding the new (primary) T140block, MUST
     be included.

   These rules allow the sequence numbers for the redundant T140blocks
   to be inferred by counting backwards from the sequence number in the
   RTP header.  The result will be that all the text in the payload will
   be contiguous and in order.

   If there is a gap in the received RTP sequence numbers, and redundant
   T140blocks are available in a subsequent packet, the sequence numbers
   for the redundant T140blocks should be inferred by counting backwards
   from the sequence number in the RTP header for that packet.  If there
   are redundant T140blocks with sequence numbers matching those that
   are missing, the redundant T140blocks may be substituted for the
   missing T140blocks.

   This section contains RECOMMENDED procedures for usage of the payload
   format.  Based on the information in the received packets, the
   receiver can:

      - reorder text received out of order.
      - mark where text is missing because of packet loss.
      - compensate for lost packets by using redundant data.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Recommended%20Basic%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Recommended Basic Procedure</span>

   Packets are transmitted when there is valid T.140 data to transmit.

   T.140 specifies that T.140 data MAY be buffered for transmission with
   a maximum buffering time of 500 ms.  A buffering time of 300 ms is
   RECOMMENDED when the application or end-to-end network conditions are
   not known to require another value.

   If no new data is available for a longer period than the buffering
   time, the transmission process is in an idle period.

   When new text is available for transmission after an idle period, it
   is RECOMMENDED to send it as soon as possible.  After this
   transmission, it is RECOMMENDED to buffer T.140 data in buffering
   time intervals, until the next idle period.  This is done in order to
   keep the maximum bit rate usage for text at a reasonable level.  The
   buffering time MUST be selected so that text users will perceive a
   real-time text flow.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Transmission%20before%20and%20after%20%22Idle%20Periods%22"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Transmission before and after "Idle Periods"</span>

   When valid T.140 data has been sent and no new T.140 data is
   available for transmission after the selected buffering time, an
   empty T140block SHOULD be transmitted.  This situation is regarded as
   the beginning of an idle period.  The procedure is recommended in
   order to more rapidly detect potentially missing text before an idle
   period.

   An empty T140block contains no data.

   When redundancy is used, transmission continues with a packet at
   every transmission timer expiration and insertion of an empty
   T.140block as primary, until the last non-empty T140block has been
   transmitted, as primary and as redundant data, with all intended
   generations of redundancy.  The last packet before an idle period
   will contain only one non-empty T140block as redundant data, while
   the remainder of the redundancy packet will contain empty T140blocks.

   Any empty T140block sent as primary data MUST be included as
   redundant T140blocks in subsequent packets, just as normal text
   T140blocks would be, unless the empty T140block is too old to be
   transmitted.  This is done so that sequence number inference for the
   redundant T140blocks will be correct, as explained in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.

   After an idle period, the transmitter SHOULD set the M-bit to one in
   the first packet with new text.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.%20%20Detection%20of%20Lost%20Text%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Detection of Lost Text Packets</span>

   Packet loss for text/t140 packets MAY be detected by observing gaps
   in the sequence numbers of RTP packets received by the receiver.

   With text/t140, the loss of packets is usually detected by comparison
   of the sequence of RTP packets as they arrive.  Any discrepancy MAY
   be used to indicate loss.  The highest RTP sequence number received
   may also be compared with that in RTCP reports, as an additional
   check for loss of the last packet before an idle period.

   Missing data SHOULD be marked by insertion of a missing text marker
   in the received stream for each missing T140block, as specified in
   ITU-T T.140 Addendum 1 [<a href="#ref-1" title="with amendment 1">1</a>].

   Because empty T140blocks are transmitted in the beginning of an idle
   period, there is a slight risk of falsely marking loss of text, when
   only an empty T140block was lost.  Procedures based on detection of
   the packet with the M-bit set to one MAY be used to reduce the risk
   of introducing false markers of loss.

   If redundancy is used with the text/t140 format, and a packet is
   received with fewer redundancy levels than normally in the session,
   it SHOULD be treated as if one empty T140block has been received for
   each excluded level in the received packet.  This is because the only
   occasion when a T140block is excluded from transmission is when it is
   an empty T140block that has become too old to be transmitted.

   If two successive packets have the same number of redundant
   generations, it SHOULD be treated as the general redundancy level for
   the session.  Change of the general redundancy level SHOULD only be
   done after an idle period.

   The text/t140 format relies on use of the sequence number in the RTP
   packet header for detection of loss and, therefore, is not suitable
   for applications where it needs to be alternating with other payloads
   in the same RTP stream.  It would be complicated and unreliable to

   try to detect loss of data at the edges of the shifts between t140
   text and other stream contents.  Therefore, text/t140 is RECOMMENDED
   to be the only payload type in the RTP stream.

   For protection against packets arriving out of order, the following
   procedure MAY be implemented in the receiver.  If analysis of a
   received packet reveals a gap in the sequence and no redundant data
   is available to fill that gap, the received packet SHOULD be kept in
   a buffer to allow time for the missing packet(s) to arrive.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the waiting time be limited to 1 second.

   If a packet with a T140block belonging to the gap arrives before the
   waiting time expires, this T140block is inserted into the gap and
   then consecutive T140blocks from the leading edge of the gap may be
   consumed.  Any T140block that does not arrive before the time limit
   expires should be treated as lost and a missing text marker should be
   inserted (see <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Parameter%20for%20Character%20Transmission%20Rate"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Parameter for Character Transmission Rate</span>

   In some cases, it is necessary to limit the rate at which characters
   are transmitted.  For example, when a Public Switched Telephone
   Network (PSTN) gateway is interworking between an IP device and a
   PSTN textphone, it may be necessary to limit the character rate from
   the IP device in order to avoid throwing away characters (in case of
   buffer overflow at the PSTN gateway).

   To control the character transmission rate, the MIME parameter "cps"
   in the "fmtp" attribute [<a href="#ref-7" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>7</a>] is defined (see <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> ).  It is used
   in SDP with the following syntax:

      a=fmtp:&lt;format&gt; cps=&lt;integer&gt;

   The &lt;format&gt; field is populated with the payload type that is used
   for text.  The &lt;integer&gt; field contains an integer representing the
   maximum number of characters that may be received per second.  The
   value shall be used as a mean value over any 10-second interval.  The
   default value is 30.

   Examples of use in SDP are found in <a href="#section-7.2">Section 7.2</a>.

   In receipt of this parameter, devices MUST adhere to the request by
   transmitting characters at a rate at or below the specified &lt;integer&gt;
   value.  Note that this parameter was not defined in <a href="./rfc2793">RFC 2793</a> [<a href="#ref-16" title='"RTP Payload for Text Conversation"'>16</a>].
   Therefore implementations of the text/t140 format may be in use that
   do not recognize and act according to this parameter.  Therefore,

   receivers of text/t140 MUST be designed so they can handle temporary
   reception of characters at a higher rate than this parameter
   specifies.  As a result malfunction due to buffer overflow is avoided
   for text conversation with human input.

   Because the intention of the described payload format is to carry
   text in a text conversation, security measures in the form of
   encryption are of importance.  The amount of data in a text
   conversation session is low.  Therefore, any encryption method MAY be
   selected and applied to T.140 session contents or to whole RTP
   packets.  Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [<a href="#ref-14" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>14</a>] provides a
   suitable method for ensuring confidentiality.

   It may be desirable to protect the text contents of an RTP stream

   There are several methods of making sure the source of the text is
   the intended one.

   Text streams are usually used in a multimedia control environment.
   Security measures for authentication are available and SHOULD be
   applied in the registration and session establishment procedures, so
   that the identity of the sender of the text stream is reliably
   associated with the person or device setting up the session.  Once
   established, SRTP [<a href="#ref-14" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>14</a>] mechanisms MAY be applied to ascertain that
   the source is maintained the same during the session.

   The congestion considerations from <a href="./rfc3550#section-10">Section 10 of RFC 3550</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>2</a>],

   Automated systems MUST NOT use this format to send large amounts of
   text at rates significantly above those a human user could enter.

   Even if the network load from users of text conversation is usually

   packet loss rate and take appropriate actions to reduce its sending
   rate (if this application sends at higher rate than what TCP would

   achieve over the same path).  The reason for this is that this
   application, due to its recommended usage of two or more redundancy
   levels, is very robust against packet loss.  At the same time, due to
   the low bit-rate of text conversations, if one considers the
   discussion in <a href="./rfc3714">RFC 3714</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title='"IAB Concerns Regarding Congestion Control for Voice Traffic in the Internet"'>13</a>], this application will experience very
   high packet loss rates before it needs to perform any reduction in
   the sending rate.

   If the application needs to reduce its sending rate, it SHOULD NOT
   reduce the number of redundancy levels below the default amount
   specified in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  Instead, the following actions are
   RECOMMENDED in order of priority:

   - Increase the shortest time between transmissions (described in
     <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>) from the recommended 300 ms to 500 ms, which is the
     highest value allowed according to T.140.

   - Limit the maximum rate of characters transmitted.

   - Increase the shortest time between transmissions to a higher value,
     not higher than 5 seconds.  This will cause unpleasant delays in
     transmission, beyond what is allowed according to T.140, but text
     will still be conveyed in the session with some usability.

   - Exclude participants from the session.

   Please note that if the reduction in bit-rate achieved through the
   above measures is not sufficient, the only remaining action is to
   terminate the session.

   As guidance, some load figures are provided here as examples based on
   use of IPv4, including the load from IP, UDP, and RTP headers without
   compression .

   - Experience tells that a common mean character transmission rate,
     during a complete PSTN text telephony session, is around two
     characters per second.

   - A maximum performance of 20 characters per second is enough even
     for voice-to-text applications.

   - With the (unusually high) load of 20 characters per second, in a
     language that makes use of three octets per UTF-8 character, two
     redundant levels, and 300 ms between transmissions, the maximum
     load of this application is 3300 bits/s.

   - When the restrictions mentioned above are applied, limiting
     transmission to 10 characters per second, using 5 s between
     transmissions, the maximum load of this application, in a language
     that uses one octet per UTF-8 character, is 300 bits/s.

   Note that this payload can be used in a congested situation as a last
   resort to maintain some contact when audio and video media need to be
   stopped.  The availability of one low bit-rate stream for text in
   such adverse situations may be crucial for maintaining some
   communication in a critical situation.

   This document updates the RTP payload format named "t140" and the
   associated MIME type "text/t140", in the IANA RTP and Media Type
   registries.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.1.%20%20Registration%20of%20MIME%20Media%20Type%20text%2Ft140"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.1" id="section-10.1">10.1</a>.  Registration of MIME Media Type text/t140</span>

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: t140

   Required parameters: rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate, which is
     equal to the sampling rate.  The only valid value is 1000.

   Optional parameters: cps: The maximum number of characters that may
     be received per second.  The default value is 30.

   Encoding considerations: T.140 text can be transmitted with RTP as
     specified in <a href="./rfc4103">RFC 4103</a>.

   Security considerations: See <a href="./rfc4103#section-8">Section 8 of RFC 4103</a>.

   Interoperability considerations: This format is the same as specified
     in <a href="./rfc2793">RFC2793</a>.  For <a href="./rfc2793">RFC2793</a> the "cps=" parameter was not defined.
     Therefore, there may be implementations that do not consider this
     parameter.  Receivers need to take that into account.

   Published specification: ITU-T T.140 Recommendation.  <a href="./rfc4103">RFC 4103</a>.

   Applications which use this media type: Text communication terminals
     and text conferencing tools.

   Additional information: This type is only defined for transfer via
     RTP.

   Magic number(s): None

   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [<a href="#ref-7" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>7</a>], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the text/t140 format, the mapping
   is as follows:

   - The MIME type ("text") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   - The MIME subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
     the encoding name.  The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST be 1000
     for text/t140.

   - The parameter "cps" goes in SDP "a=fmtp" attribute.

   - When the payload type is used with redundancy according to <a href="./rfc2198">RFC</a>
     <a href="./rfc2198">2198</a>, the level of redundancy is shown by the number of elements in
     the slash-separated payload type list in the "fmtp" parameter of
     the redundancy declaration as defined in <a href="./rfc4102">RFC 4102</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Registration of the text/red MIME Sub-Type"'>9</a>] and <a href="./rfc2198">RFC 2198</a>
     [<a href="#ref-3" title='"RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data"'>3</a>].

   In order to achieve interoperability within the framework of the
   offer/answer model [<a href="#ref-10" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>10</a>], the following consideration should be made:

   - The "cps" parameter is declarative.  Both sides may provide a
     value, which is independent of the other side.
