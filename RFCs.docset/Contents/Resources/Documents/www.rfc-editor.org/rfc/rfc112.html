          <span class="h1">User/Server Site Protocol Network HOST Questionnaire</span>
                  <span class="h1">(Reference RFC #106, NIC Note 5776)</span>

   Attached is a summary of the responses to the referenced
   questionnaires.

   The questions involving terminal support were of interest to members
   of the User/Service Site Protocol Committee in its considerations of
   TELNET.

   The summary points out some of the key differences between line-at-
   a-time and character-at-a-time (or both) in handling terminal
   support, especially with respect to control characters.  The
   information may prove useful as background information to TELNET
   implementers.

   If errors of interpretation of any sites' answer have occurred,
   please advise me at the following address so that I may update the
   chart.
