Abstract

   The Message-Context header defined in <a href="./rfc3458">RFC 3458</a> describes the context
   of a message (for example: fax-message or voice-message).  This
   specification extends the Message-Context header with one additional
   context value: "video-message".

   A receiving user agent (UA) may use this information as a hint to
   optimally present the message.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Email messages can be used to convey many different forms of
   messages, and the user will interact with different types in
   different ways.  As explained in <a href="./rfc3458">RFC 3458</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Message Context for Internet Mail"'>1</a>], the "message context"
   of the message conveys information about the way the user expects to
   interact with the message, such as which icon to display.  <a href="./rfc3458">RFC 3458</a>
   then registers the message contexts for a "voice-message", "fax-
   message", "pager-message", "multimedia-message", "text-message", and
   "none".

   One form of email is a message that consists mostly of a video
   stream.  Examples of services that send video email are those
   connected to cell phones that capture video streams, and video email
   services that use webcams attached to a PC.  These email messages
   currently consist of two flavors, both of which can be properly
   considered a video message:

   1. those that embed the video stream internally within the message as
      a body part, and

   2. those whose video stream is stored on a third party's video
      server.

   However, none of the existing message contexts properly identify such
   video messages.  This specification extends the Message-Context
   header with one additional context value: video-message.

   As specified in <a href="./rfc3458">RFC 3458</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Message Context for Internet Mail"'>1</a>], this document registers "video-message"
   in the "Internet Message Context Types" repository.

   Message-Context class name:
      video-message

   Summary of the message class:
      Indicates a message whose primary content is a video mail message.
      The primary content is video data.  The context is usually a
      message recorded on a video camera, or a message whose primary
      purpose is to contain an external reference to a message recorded
      on a video camera.

   This header is intended to be an indicator of message context only.
   As such, it is only a hint and requires no behavior on the part of a
   message user agent.
