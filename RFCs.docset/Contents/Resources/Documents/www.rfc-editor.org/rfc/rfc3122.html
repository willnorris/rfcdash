Abstract

   This memo describes extensions to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery that
   allow a node to determine and advertise an IPv6 address corresponding
   to a given link-layer address.  These extensions are called Inverse
   Neighbor Discovery.  The Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) was
   originally developed for Frame Relay networks, but may also apply to
   other networks with similar behavior.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document defines extensions to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   (ND)[IPv6-IND].  The extensions are called IPv6 Inverse Neighbor
   Discovery (IND).  The IPv6 Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) allows a
   node that knows the link-layer address of a directly connected remote
   node to learn the IPv6 addresses of that node.  A node using IND
   sends solicitations and receives advertisements for one or more IPv6
   addresses corresponding to a known link-layer address.

   The Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) was originally developed for
   Frame Relay networks, but may also apply to other networks with
   similar behavior.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED,
   SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as defined
   in [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORDS</a>].

   There are a number of similarities and differences between the
   mechanisms described here and those defined for Inverse ARP for IPv4
   in [<a href="#ref-INV-ARP" title='"Inverse Address Resolution Protocol"'>INV-ARP</a>] or its replacement documents.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Inverse%20Neighbor%20Discovery%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Inverse Neighbor Discovery Messages</span>

   The following messages are defined:

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20Inverse%20Neighbor%20Discovery%20Solicitation%20Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>. Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message</span>

   A node sends an Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation message to
   request an IPv6 address corresponding to a link-layer address of the
   target node while also providing its own link-layer address to the
   target.  Since the remote node IPv6 addresses are not known, Inverse
   Neighbor Discovery (IND) Solicitations are sent as IPv6 all-node
   multicasts [<a href="#ref-IPv6" title='"Internet Protocol Version 6 Specification"'>IPv6</a>], [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>], [<a href="#ref-ENCAPS" title='"Multiprotocol Interconnect over Frame Relay"'>ENCAPS</a>].  However, at link layer
   level, an IND Solicitation is sent directly to the target node,
   identified by the known link-layer address.

   Description:

   The Source Address List contains a list of IPv6 addresses of the
   interface identified by the Source Link-Layer Address.

   The Target Address List contains a list of IPv6 addresses of the
   interface identified by the Target Link-Layer Address.

   The number of addresses "n" in the list is calculated based on the
   length of the option:

      n = (Length - 1)/2  (Length is the number of groups of 8 octets)

   The Source Address List MUST fit in one IND Solicitation message.
   Therefore in case all IPv6 addresses of an interface do not fit in
   one messages, the option does not contain a complete list.  For a
   complete list of IPv6 addresses, a node should rely on the IND
   Advertisement message.

   The Target Address List SHOULD be the complete list of addresses of
   the interface identified by the Target Link-Layer Address.  If the
   list of IPv6 addresses of an interface does not fit in one IND
   Advertisement message, one or more IND Advertisement messages, with
   the same fields as the first message, SHOULD follow.  The Target
   Address List option(s) of the second, and subsequent message(s)
   SHOULD contain the rest of the IPv6 addresses of the interface
   identified by the Target Link-Layer Address, which did not fit in the
   first message.

   Note 1: The scope of the Inverse Neighbor Discovery mechanism is
   limited to IPv6 address discovery, that is, providing address mapping
   information.  Therefore, it does not make any provisions or rules
   regarding how a node uses the addresses that were returned in an
   Inverse Discovery message.  Furthermore, it does not exclude any
   particular type of IPv6 address from the Source or Target Address

   List.  For example, if an interface has manually configured, and
   autoconfigured addresses, including temporary ones, unicast,
   multicast, etc..., the list should not exclude any.

   Note 2: An implementation MUST NOT send duplicates in the IPv6
   address list.

   IND operates essentially the same as ND [<a href="#ref-IPv6-ND" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>IPv6-ND</a>]: the solicitor of a
   target IP address sends on an interface a solicitation message, the
   target node responds with an advertisement message containing the
   information requested.  The information learned MAY be stored in the
   Neighbor Discovery cache [<a href="#ref-IPv6-ND" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>IPv6-ND</a>], as well as IPv6 address
   structures which may be associated with the interface.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1%20%20Sender%20Node%20Processing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>  Sender Node Processing</span>

   A soliciting node formats an IND Solicitation message as defined in a
   previous section, encapsulates the packet for the specific link-layer
   and sends it directly to the target node.  Although the destination
   IP address is the all-node multicast address, the message is sent
   only to the target node.  The significant fields for the IND protocol
   are the Source IP address, the Source link-layer address, the Target
   link-layer address, and the MTU.  The latter can be used in setting
   the optimum value of the MTU for the link.

   While awaiting a response, the sender SHOULD retransmit IND
   Solicitation messages approximately every RetransTimer
   (expiration)[<a href="#ref-IPv6-ND" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>IPv6-ND</a>], even in the absence of additional traffic to
   the neighbor.  Retransmissions MUST be rate-limited to at most one
   solicitation per neighbor every RetransTimer.

   If no IND Advertisement is received after MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT
   [<a href="#ref-IPv6-ND" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>IPv6-ND</a>] solicitations, inverse address resolution has failed.  If
   the sending of the Solicitation was required by an upper-layer, the
   sender module MUST notify the error to the upper-layer through an
   appropriate mechanism (e.g., return value from a procedure call).

   For every IND Solicitation, the receiving node SHOULD format in
   response a proper IND Advertisement using the link-layer source and
   target address pair as well as the IPv6 source address from the IND
   Solicitation message.

   If a node updates the Neighbor Discovery Cache with information
   learned from IND messages, the receiver node of the IND Solicitation
   SHOULD put the sender's IPv6 address/link-layer address mapping -
   i.e., the source IP address and the Source link-layer address from
   the solicitation message - into its ND cache [<a href="#ref-IPv6-ND" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>IPv6-ND</a>] as it would
   for a ND solicitation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   When being employed on point to point virtual circuits, as it is the
   case with Frame Relay networks, Inverse Neighbor Discovery messages
   are less sensitive to impersonation attacks from on-link nodes, as it
   would be the case with broadcast links.

   Like Neighbor Discovery, the protocol reduces the exposure to threats
   from off-link nodes in the absence of authentication by ignoring IND
   packets received from off-link senders.  The Hop Limit field of all
   received packets is verified to contain 255, the maximum legal value.
   Because routers decrement the Hop Limit on all packets they forward,
   received packets containing a Hop Limit of 255 must have originated
   from a neighbor.

   Inverse Neighbor Discovery protocol packet exchanges can be
   authenticated using the IP Authentication Header [<a href="#ref-IPSEC-Auth" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>IPSEC-Auth</a>].  A
   node SHOULD include an Authentication Header when sending Inverse
   Neighbor Discovery packets if a security association for use with the
   IP Authentication Header exists for the destination address.  The
   security associations may have been created through manual
   configuration or through the operation of some key management
   protocol.

   Received Authentication Headers in Inverse Neighbor Discovery packets
   MUST be verified for correctness and packets with incorrect
   authentication MUST be ignored.

   In case of use with Frame Relay, to avoid an IP Security
   Authentication verification failure, the Frame Relay specific
   preprocessing of a Neighbor Discovery Solicitation message that
   contains a DLCI format Source link-layer address option, MUST be done
   by the receiver node after it completed IP Security processing.

   It SHOULD be possible for the system administrator to configure a
   node to ignore any Inverse Neighbor Discovery messages that are not
   authenticated using either the Authentication Header or Encapsulating
   Security Payload.  Such a switch SHOULD default to allowing
   unauthenticated messages.

   This appendix documents the details of using the Inverse Neighbor
   Discovery on Frame Relay Networks, which were too specific to be part
   of the more general content of the previous sections.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.1%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" id="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>  Introduction</span>

   The Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) specifically applies to Frame
   Relay nodes.  Frame Relay permanent virtual circuits (PVCs) and
   switched virtual circuits (SVCs) are identified in a Frame Relay
   network by a Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI).  Each DLCI
   defines for a Frame Relay node a single virtual connection through
   the wide area network (WAN).  A DLCI has in general a local
   significance.

   By way of specific signaling messages, a Frame Relay network may
   announce to a node a new virtual circuit with its corresponding DLCI.
   The DLCI identifies to a node a virtual circuit, and can be used as
   the equivalent of a remote node link-layer address, allowing a node
   to identify at link layer level the node at the other end of the
   virtual circuit.  For instance in Figure 1., node A (local node)
   identifies the virtual circuit to node B (remote node) by way of DLCI
   = 30.  However, the signaling message does not contain information
   about the DLCI used by a remote node to identify the virtual circuit
   to the local node, which could be used as the equivalent of the local
   link-layer address.  For instance in Figure 1., node B (remote node)
   may identify the virtual circuit to node A by way of DLCI = 62.

   Furthermore, the message being transmitted at link-layer level and
   completely independent of the IPv6 protocol does not include any IPv6
   addressing information.  The Inverse Neighbor Discovery is a protocol
   that allows a Frame Relay node to discover the equivalent of a local
   link layer address, that is, the identifier by way of which remote
   nodes identify the node, and more importantly discover the IPv6
   addresses of the interface at the other end of the virtual circuit,
   identified by the remote link-layer address.

   The IPv6 Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) protocol allows a Frame
   Relay node to discover dynamically the DLCI by which a remote node
   identifies the virtual circuit.  It also allows a node to learn the
   IPv6 addresses of a node at the remote end of a virtual circuit.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.2.%20Inverse%20Neighbor%20Discovery%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2" id="appendix-A.2">A.2</a>. Inverse Neighbor Discovery Messages</span>

   Frame Relay nodes generate Inverse Neighbor Discovery messages as
   follows:

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.2.1.%20Inverse%20Neighbor%20Discovery%20Solicitation%20Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2.1" id="appendix-A.2.1">A.2.1</a>. Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message</span>

   The sender of an Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation does not
   know the remote node's IPv6 addresses, but knows the equivalent of a
   remote node link-layer address.  Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND)
   Solicitations are sent as IPv6 all-node multicasts [<a href="#ref-IPv6" title='"Internet Protocol Version 6 Specification"'>IPv6</a>], [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-ENCAPS" title='"Multiprotocol Interconnect over Frame Relay"'>ENCAPS</a>].  However, at link layer level, an IND Solicitation is sent
   directly to the target node, identified by the known link-layer
   address (DLCI).

   The fields of the message, which are filled following considerations
   specific to Frame Relay are:

   Source Link-Layer Address
      For the sender Frame Relay node, the Source Link-Layer Address is
      the equivalent of the link-layer address by which the remote node
      identifies the source of this message.  The sender may have no
      knowledge of this information.  If the sender knows the
      information, it SHOULD include it in the field, otherwise it
      SHOULD live it zero (empty).  This information, if present, can be
      used for network debugging purposes.  Regardless of the sender's
      action on this field, prior to any Inverse Neighbor Discovery
      processing, the receiver of this message replaces this field,
      whether filled in or not by the sender, with information carried
      by the Frame Relay header in the DLCI field.  The field is encoded
      in DLCI format as defined by [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3122">RFC 3122</a>         Extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery         June 2001</span>


   Target Link-Layer Address
      For sender Frame Relay node, the Target Link-Layer Address field
      is filled with the value known as the equivalent of the target
      node link-layer address.  This value is the DLCI of the VC to the
      target node.  It is encoded in DLCI format [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>].

      To illustrate the generating of a IND Solicitation message by a
      Frame Relay node, let's consider as an example Node A (Figure 1.)
      which sends an IND solicitation to Node B.  The Solicitation
      message fields will have the following values:

            At Node A (sender of the IND solicitation message).

                   Source Link-Layer Address
                           DLCI=unknown (overwritten by the receiver).

                   Target Link-Layer Address
                           DLCI=30.

            At Node B (receiver of the IND solicitation message).

                   Source Link-Layer Address
                           DLCI=62 (filled in by the receiver).

                   Target Link-Layer Address
                           DLCI=30.

   Note: For Frame Relay, both the above addresses are in Q.922 format
   (DLCI), which can have 10 (default), or 23 significant addressing
   bits [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>].  The option length (link-layer address) is expressed
   in 8 octet units, therefore, the DLCI will have to be extracted from
   the 8 bytes based on the EA field (bit 0) of the second, third, or
   forth octet (EA = 1).  The C/R, FECN, BECN, DE fields in the Q.922
   address have no significance for IND and are set to 0 [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>].

   MTU
      The value filled in the MTU option is the MTU for the virtual

   Source Link-Layer Address
      For Frame Relay, this field is copied from the Target link-layer
      address field of the Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation.  It
      is encoded in DLCI format [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>].

   Target Link-Layer Address
      For Frame Relay, this field is copied from the Source link-layer
      address field of the Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation.  It
      is encoded in DLCI format [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>].

   For example if Node B (Figure 1.) responds to an IND solicitation
   sent by Node A. with an IND advertisement, these fields will have the
   following values:

         At Node B (sender of the advertisement message):

                  Source Link-Layer Address
                     DLCI=30 (was Target in Solicitation Message).

                  Target Link-Layer Address
                     DLCI=62 (was Source in Solicitation Message).

         At Node A (receiver of the advertisement message from B).

                   Source Link-Layer Address
                     DLCI=30 (was Target in Solicitation Message).

                   Target Link-Layer Address
                     DLCI=62 (was Source in Solicitation Message).

   Target Address List
      The list of one or more IPv6 addresses of the interface identified
      by the Target Link-Layer Address in the Inverse Neighbor Discovery
      Solicitation message that prompted this advertisement.

   MTU The MTU configured for this link (virtual circuit) [<a href="#ref-IPv6-ND" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>IPv6-ND</a>].

      Note:  In case of Frame Relay networks, the IND messages are sent
      on a virtual circuit, which acts like a virtual-link.  If the
      virtual circuit breaks, all participants to the circuit receive
      appropriate link layer signaling messages, which can be propagated
      to the  upper layers, including IPv6.

   A soliciting Frame Relay node formats an IND solicitation message as
   defined in a previous section, encapsulates the packet for the Frame
   Relay link-layer [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>] and sends it to the target Frame Relay
   node.  Although the destination IP address is the IPv6 all-node
   multicast address, the message is sent only to the target Frame Relay
   node.  The target node is the known remote node on the link
   represented by the virtual circuit.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.3.2%20%20Receiver%20Node%20Processing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3.2" id="appendix-A.3.2">A.3.2</a>  Receiver Node Processing</span>

   A Frame Relay node, before further processing, is replacing in the
   Source link-layer address the existent DLCI value with the DLCI value
   from the Frame Relay header of the frame containing the message.  The
   DLCI value has to be formatted appropriately in the Source link-layer
   address field [<a href="#ref-IPv6-FR" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks"'>IPv6-FR</a>].  This operation is required to allow a
   correct interpretation of the fields in the further processing of the
   IND solicitation message.

   For a Frame Relay node, the MTU value from the solicitation message
   MAY be used to set the receiver's MTU to a value that is more
   optimal, in case that was not already done at the interface
   configuration time.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.3.2.2%20%20Processing%20Inverse%20Neighbor%20Advertisement%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3.2.2" id="appendix-A.3.2.2">A.3.2.2</a>  Processing Inverse Neighbor Advertisement Messages</span>

   The receiver Frame Relay node of the IND Advertisement MAY put the
   sender's IPv6 address/link-layer address mapping - i.e., the Target
   IP addresses and the Source link-layer address from the IND
   advertisement  message - into its ND cache [<a href="#ref-IPv6-ND" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>IPv6-ND</a>] as it would for
   a ND Advertisement.

   Further, the receiver Frame Relay node of the IND Advertisement MAY
   store the Target link-layer address from the message as the DLCI
   value at the remote end of the VC.  This DLCI value is the equivalent
   of the link-layer address by which the remote node identifies the
   receiver.

   If the receiver node of the IND Advertisement has a pool of IPv6
   addresses, and if the implementation allows, it may take decisions to
   pairing specific local IPv6 addresses to specific IPv6 addresses from
   the target list in further communications on the VC.  More
   specifically, such a pairing may be based on IPv6 addresses being on
   the same subnet, that is having the same prefix.
