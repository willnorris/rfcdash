Abstract

   This document contains the registration for two media feature tags:
   "charset" and "language".  These media features allow specification
   of character sets and human languages that can be understood by
   devices and the devices' users.  The templates in this document are
   derived from <a href="./rfc2506">RFC 2506</a>.

   To: media-feature-tags@apps.ietf.org (Media feature tags mailing list)
   Subject: Registration of media feature tag charset

   Media feature tag name:
      charset

   ASN.1 identifier associated with feature tag:
      1.3.6.1.8.1.31

   Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag:
      Ability to display particular charsets as defined in [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Charset Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>].
           For most devices, this media feature is usually a capability;
           that is, most devices cannot intelligently process text in a
           charset that is unknown to the device.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2987">RFC 2987</a>       Charset and Languages Media Features Tags   November 2000</span>


   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:
      The values are tokens as defined in [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Charset Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>].  The values can
           only be compared for equality.  Comparison is not case
           sensitive.

   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
   applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
       Any protocol that uses media tags

   Examples of typical use:
      (| (charset=utf-8);q=1.0 (charset=iso-8859-1);q=0.9
         (charset=utf-16);q=0.5 )

   Related standards or documents:
      "IANA Charset Registration Procedures", <a href="./rfc2978">RFC 2978</a>

   Considerations particular to use in individual applications,
   protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
      None

   Interoperability considerations: Aliases for charsets should not be
           used in media feature expressions because feature expression
           manipulation tools may convert aliases to the the principal
           name for the charset.  Even though charset names are not
           case-sensitive, values should be expressed as all lowercase
           letters to increase the likelihood of interoperability.  The
           "charset" capability should always be indicated in
           conjunction with any capability to handle textual data.

   Security considerations:
      If it is known that there is a security bug in the display of a
      particular charset in a particular environment, knowing that a
      device can accept that charset may slightly help an attacker.

   Additional information:

   To: media-feature-tags@apps.ietf.org (Media feature tags mailing list)
   Subject: Registration of media feature tag language

   Media feature tag name:
      language

   ASN.1 identifier associated with feature tag:
      1.3.6.1.8.1.32

   Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag:  Ability
      to display particular human languages as defined in [<a href="#ref-LANG" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>LANG</a>].  Note
      that "display" in this case will most often mean speech by a
      computer.  For most devices, this media feature is a preference,
      not a requirement.

   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:
      The values are tokens, with allowable values defined by
           registration as defined in [<a href="#ref-LANG" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>LANG</a>].  The values can only be
           compared for equality.  As described in [<a href="#ref-LANG" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>LANG</a>], language tags
           are always handled as a single token, and "subtags" are not
           used for comparison.  Comparison is not case sensitive.

   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
   applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
       Any protocol that uses media tags

   Examples of typical use:
      (| (language=no-nynorsk);q=1.0 (language=no-bokmaal);q=0.9
         (language=i-sami-no);q=0.5 )

   Related standards or documents:
      "Tags for the Identification of Languages", <a href="./rfc1766">RFC 1766</a>

   Considerations particular to use in individual applications,
   protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
      None

           expressed as all lowercase letters to increase the likelihood
