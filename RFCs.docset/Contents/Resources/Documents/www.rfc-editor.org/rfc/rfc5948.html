Abstract

   IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband
   access.  IEEE 802.16 has specified multiple service-specific
   Convergence Sublayers for transmitting upper-layer protocols.  The
   Packet CS (Packet Convergence Sublayer) is used for the transport of
   all packet-based protocols such as the Internet Protocol (IP) and
   IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet).  The IP-specific part of the Packet CS enables
   the transport of IPv4 packets directly over the IEEE 802.16 Media
   Access Control (MAC) layer.

   This document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission
   Unit (MTU), and the address assignment procedures for transmitting
   IPv4 packets over the IP-specific part of the Packet Convergence
   Sublayer of IEEE 802.16.

   IEEE 802.16 [<a href="#ref-IEEE802_16" title='"IEEE Std 802.16-2009, Draft Standard for Local and Metropolitan area networks, Part 16: Air Interface for Broadband Wireless Access Systems"'>IEEE802_16</a>] is a connection-oriented access technology
   for the last mile.  The IEEE 802.16 specification includes the
   Physical (PHY) and Media Access Control (MAC) layers.  The MAC layer
   includes various Convergence Sublayers (CSs) for transmitting higher-
   layer packets, including IPv4 packets [<a href="#ref-IEEE802_16" title='"IEEE Std 802.16-2009, Draft Standard for Local and Metropolitan area networks, Part 16: Air Interface for Broadband Wireless Access Systems"'>IEEE802_16</a>].

   The scope of this specification is limited to the operation of IPv4
   over the IP-specific part of the Packet CS (referred to as "IPv4 CS")
   for hosts served by a network that utilizes the IEEE Std 802.16 air
   interface.

   This document specifies a method for encapsulating and transmitting
   IPv4 [<a href="./rfc0791" title='"Internet Protocol"'>RFC0791</a>] packets over the IPv4 CS of IEEE 802.16.  This
   document also specifies the MTU and address assignment method for
   hosts using IPv4 CS.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   o  Mobile Station (MS) -- The term "MS" is used to refer to an IP
      host.  This usage is more informal than that in IEEE 802.16, in
      which "MS" refers to the interface implementing the IEEE 802.16
      MAC and PHY layers and not to the entire host.

   o  Last mile -- The term "last mile" is used to refer to the final
      leg of delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a
      customer.

   Other terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [<a href="./rfc5154" title='"IP over IEEE 802.16 Problem Statement and Goals"'>RFC5154</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Typical%20Network%20Architecture%20for%20IPv4%20over%20IEEE%20802.16"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Typical Network Architecture for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16</span>

   The network architecture follows what is described in [<a href="./rfc5154" title='"IP over IEEE 802.16 Problem Statement and Goals"'>RFC5154</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc5121" title='"Transmission of IPv6 via the IPv6 Convergence Sublayer over IEEE 802.16 Networks"'>RFC5121</a>].  Namely, each MS is attached to an Access Router (AR)
   through a Base Station (BS), a Layer 2 (L2) entity (from the
   perspective of the IPv4 link between the MS and the AR).

   For further information on the typical network architecture, see
   <a href="./rfc5121#section-5">[RFC5121], SectionÂ 5</a>.

   As described in [<a href="#ref-IEEE802_16" title='"IEEE Std 802.16-2009, Draft Standard for Local and Metropolitan area networks, Part 16: Air Interface for Broadband Wireless Access Systems"'>IEEE802_16</a>], the IP-specific part of the Packet CS
   allows the transmission of either IPv4 or IPv6 payloads.  In this
   document, we are focusing on IPv4 over the Packet Convergence
   Sublayer.

   For further information on the IEEE 802.16 Convergence Sublayer and
   encapsulation of IP packets, see <a href="./rfc5121#section-4">SectionÂ 4 of [RFC5121]</a> and
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE802_16" title='"IEEE Std 802.16-2009, Draft Standard for Local and Metropolitan area networks, Part 16: Air Interface for Broadband Wireless Access Systems"'>IEEE802_16</a>].

   In 802.16, the transport connection between an MS and a BS is used to
   transport user data, i.e., IPv4 packets in this case.  A transport
   connection is represented by a service flow, and multiple transport
   connections can exist between an MS and a BS.

   When an AR and a BS are co-located, the collection of transport
   connections to an MS is defined as a single IPv4 link.  When an AR
   and a BS are separated, it is recommended that a tunnel be
   established between the AR and a BS whose granularity is no greater

   than "per MS" or "per service flow".  (An MS can have multiple
   service flows, which are identified by a service flow ID.)  Then the
   tunnel(s) for an MS, in combination with the MS's transport
   connections, forms a single point-to-point IPv4 link.

   Each host belongs to a different IPv4 link and is assigned a unique
   IPv4 address, similar to the recommendations discussed in "Analysis
   of IPv6 Link Models for IEEE 802.16 Based Networks" ([<a href="./rfc4968" title='"Analysis of IPv6 Link Models for 802.16 Based Networks"'>RFC4968</a>]).

   In order to enable the sending and receiving of IPv4 packets between
   the MS and the AR, the link between the MS and the AR via the BS
   needs to be established.  This section explains the link
   establishment procedure, as described in <a href="./rfc5121#section-6.2">SectionÂ 6.2 of [RFC5121]</a>.
   Steps 1-4 are the same as those indicated in <a href="./rfc5121#section-6.2">SectionÂ 6.2 of
   [RFC5121]</a>.  In step 5, support for IPv4 is indicated.  In step 6, a
   service flow is created that can be used for exchanging IP-layer
   signaling messages, e.g., address assignment procedures using DHCP.

   IPv4 packets are transmitted in Generic IEEE 802.16 MAC frames in the
   data payloads of the 802.16 PDU (see <a href="./rfc5154#section-3.2">SectionÂ 3.2 of [RFC5154]</a>).

   The MTU value for IPv4 packets on an IEEE 802.16 link is configurable
   (e.g., see the end of this section for some possible mechanisms).
   The default MTU for IPv4 packets over an IEEE 802.16 link SHOULD be
   1500 octets.  Given the possibility for "in-the-network" tunneling,
   supporting this MTU at the end hosts has implications on the
   underlying network, for example, as discussed in [<a href="./rfc4459" title='"MTU and Fragmentation Issues with In-the- Network Tunneling"'>RFC4459</a>].

   Per <a href="./rfc5121#section-6.3">[RFC5121], SectionÂ 6.3</a>, the IP MTU can vary to be larger or
   smaller than 1500 octets.

   If an MS transmits 1500-octet packets in a deployment with a smaller
   MTU, packets from the MS may be dropped at the link layer silently.
   Unlike IPv6, in which departures from the default MTU are readily
   advertised via the MTU option in Neighbor Discovery (via router
   advertisement), there is no similarly reliable mechanism in IPv4, as



<span class="grey">Madanapalli, et al.          Standards Track                    [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5948">RFC 5948</a>             IPv4 over IEEE 802.16's IPv4 CS         August 2010</span>


   the legacy IPv4 client implementations do not determine the link MTU
   by default before sending packets.  Even though there is a DHCP
   option to accomplish this, DHCP servers are required to provide the
   MTU information only when requested.

   Discovery and configuration of the proper link MTU value ensures
   adequate usage of the network bandwidth and resources.  Accordingly,
   deployments should avoid packet loss due to a mismatch between the
   default MTU and the configured link MTUs.

   Some of the mechanisms available for the IPv4 CS host to find out the
   link's MTU value and mitigate MTU-related issues are:

   o  Recent revision of 802.16 by the IEEE (see IEEE 802.16-2009
      [<a href="#ref-IEEE802_16" title='"IEEE Std 802.16-2009, Draft Standard for Local and Metropolitan area networks, Part 16: Air Interface for Broadband Wireless Access Systems"'>IEEE802_16</a>]) to (among other things) allow the provision of the
      Service Data Unit or MAC MTU in the IEEE 802.16 SBC-REQ/SBC-RSP
      phase, such that clients that are compliant with IEEE 802.16 can
      infer and configure the negotiated MTU size for the IPv4 CS link.
      However, the implementation must communicate the negotiated MTU
      value to the IP layer to adjust the IP Maximum Payload Size for
      proper handling of fragmentation.  Note that this method is useful
      only when the MS is directly connected to the BS.

   o  Configuration and negotiation of MTU size at the network layer by
      using the DHCP interface MTU option [<a href="./rfc2132" title='"DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions"'>RFC2132</a>].

   This document recommends that implementations of IPv4 and IPv4 CS
   clients SHOULD use the DHCP interface MTU option [<a href="./rfc2132" title='"DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions"'>RFC2132</a>] in order
   to configure its interface MTU accordingly.

   In the absence of DHCP MTU configuration, the client node (MS) has
   two alternatives: 1) use the default MTU (1500 bytes), or 2)
   determine the MTU by the methods described in IEEE 802.16-2009
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE802_16" title='"IEEE Std 802.16-2009, Draft Standard for Local and Metropolitan area networks, Part 16: Air Interface for Broadband Wireless Access Systems"'>IEEE802_16</a>].

   Additionally, the clients are encouraged to run Path MTU (PMTU)
   Discovery [<a href="./rfc1191" title='"Path MTU discovery"'>RFC1191</a>] or Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery
   (PLPMTUD) [<a href="./rfc4821" title='"Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery"'>RFC4821</a>].  However, the PMTU mechanism has inherent
   problems of packet loss due to ICMP messages not reaching the sender
   and IPv4 routers not fragmenting the packets due to the Don't
   Fragment (DF) bit being set in the IP packet.  The above-mentioned
   path MTU mechanisms will take care of the MTU size between the MS and

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Subnet%20Model%20and%20IPv4%20Address%20Assignment"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Subnet Model and IPv4 Address Assignment</span>

   The subnet model recommended for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16 using IPv4 CS
   is based on the point-to-point link between the MS and the AR
   [<a href="./rfc4968" title='"Analysis of IPv6 Link Models for 802.16 Based Networks"'>RFC4968</a>]; hence, each MS shall be assigned an address with a 32-bit
   prefix length or subnet mask.  The point-to-point link between the MS
   and the AR is achieved using a set of IEEE 802.16 MAC connections
   (identified by service flows) and an L2 tunnel (e.g., a Generic
   Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel) for each MS between the BS and
   the AR.  If the AR is co-located with the BS, then the set of IEEE
   802.16 MAC connections between the MS and the BS/AR represent the
   point-to-point connection.

   The "next hop" IP address of the IPv4 CS MS is always the IP address
   of the AR, because the MS and the AR are attached via a point-to-
   point link.

   DHCP [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>] SHOULD be used for assigning an IPv4 address for the
   MS.  DHCP messages are transported over the IEEE 802.16 MAC
   connection to and from the BS and relayed to the AR.  In case the
   DHCP server does not reside in the AR, the AR SHOULD implement a DHCP
   relay agent [<a href="./rfc1542" title='"Clarifications and Extensions for the Bootstrap Protocol"'>RFC1542</a>].

   The IPv4 CS does not allow for transmission of Address Resolution
   Protocol (ARP) [<a href="./rfc0826" title='"Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol: Or converting network protocol addresses to 48.bit Ethernet address for transmission on Ethernet hardware"'>RFC0826</a>] packets.  Furthermore, in a point-to-point
   link model, address resolution is not needed.

   Multicast or broadcast packets from the MS are delivered to the AR
   via the BS through the point-to-point link.  This specification
   simply assumes that the broadcast and multicast services are
   provided.  How these services are implemented in an IEEE 802.16
   Packet CS deployment is out of scope of this document.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5948">RFC 5948</a>             IPv4 over IEEE 802.16's IPv4 CS         August 2010</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Multiple%20Convergence%20Layers%20--%20Impact%20on%20Subnet%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Multiple Convergence Layers -- Impact on Subnet Model</span>

   Two different MSs using two different Convergence Sublayers (e.g., an
   MS using Ethernet CS only and another MS using IPv4 CS only) cannot
   communicate at the data link layer and require interworking at the IP
   layer.  For this reason, these two nodes must be configured to be on
   two different subnets.  For more information, refer to [<a href="./rfc4840" title='"Multiple Encapsulation Methods Considered Harmful"'>RFC4840</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20B.%20%20Sending%20and%20Receiving%20IPv4%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B" id="appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Sending and Receiving IPv4 Packets</span>

   IEEE 802.16 MAC is a point-to-multipoint connection-oriented air
   interface, and the process of sending and receiving IPv4 packets is
   different from multicast-capable shared-medium technologies like
   Ethernet.

   Before any packets are transmitted, an IEEE 802.16 transport
   connection must be established.  This connection consists of an
   IEEE 802.16 MAC transport connection between the MS and the BS and an
   L2 tunnel between the BS and the AR (if these two are not
   co-located).  This IEEE 802.16 transport connection provides a point-
   to-point link between the MS and the AR.  All the packets originating
   at the MS always reach the AR before being transmitted to the final
   destination.

   IPv4 packets are carried directly in the payload of IEEE 802.16
   frames when the IPv4 CS is used.  IPv4 CS classifies the packet based
   on upper-layer (IP and transport layers) header fields to place the
   packet on one of the available connections identified by the CID.
   The classifiers for the IPv4 CS are source and destination IPv4
   addresses, source and destination ports, Type-of-Service, and IP
   Protocol field.  The CS may employ Packet Header Suppression (PHS)
   after the classification.

   The BS optionally reconstructs the payload header if PHS is in use.
   It then tunnels the packet that has been received on a particular MAC
   connection to the AR.  Similarly, the packets received on a tunnel
   interface from the AR would be mapped to a particular CID using the
   IPv4 classification mechanism.

   The AR performs normal routing for the packets that it receives,
   processing them per its forwarding table.  However, the DHCP relay
   agent in the AR MUST maintain the tunnel interface on which it
   receives DHCP requests so that it can relay the DHCP responses to the
   correct MS.  The particular method is out of scope of this
   specification as it need not depend on any particularities of
   IEEE 802.16.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20C.%20%20WiMAX%20IPv4%20CS%20MTU%20Size"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C" id="appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.  WiMAX IPv4 CS MTU Size</span>

   The WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) forum has
   defined a network architecture [<a href="#ref-WMF" title='"WiMAX End-to-End Network Systems Architecture Stage 2-3 Release 1.2, http://www.wimaxforum.org/"'>WMF</a>].  Furthermore, WiMAX has
   specified IPv4 CS support for transmission of IPv4 packets between
   the MS and the BS over the IEEE 802.16 link.  The WiMAX IPv4 CS and
   this specification are similar.  One significant difference, however,
   is that the WiMAX Forum [<a href="#ref-WMF" title='"WiMAX End-to-End Network Systems Architecture Stage 2-3 Release 1.2, http://www.wimaxforum.org/"'>WMF</a>] has specified the IP MTU as 1400 octets
   [<a href="#ref-WMF" title='"WiMAX End-to-End Network Systems Architecture Stage 2-3 Release 1.2, http://www.wimaxforum.org/"'>WMF</a>] as opposed to 1500 in this specification.

   Hence, if an IPv4 CS MS configured with an MTU of 1500 octets enters
   a WiMAX network, some of the issues mentioned in this specification
   may arise.  As mentioned in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>, the possible mechanisms are
   not guaranteed to work.  Furthermore, an IPv4 CS client is not
   capable of doing ARP probing to find out the link MTU.  On the other
   hand, it is imperative for an MS to know the link MTU size.  In
   practice, an MS should be able to sense or deduce the fact that it is
   operating within a WiMAX network (e.g., given the WiMAX-specific
   particularities of the authentication and network entry procedures),
   and adjust its MTU size accordingly.  Even though this method is not
   perfect, and the potential for conflict may remain, this document
   recommends a default MTU of 1500.  This represents the WG's consensus
   (after much debate) to select the best value for IEEE 802.16 from the
   point of view of the IETF, in spite of the WiMAX Forum's deployment.
