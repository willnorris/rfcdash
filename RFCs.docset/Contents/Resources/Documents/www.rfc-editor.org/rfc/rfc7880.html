<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), as described in [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>]
   and related documents, has efficiently generalized the failure
   detection mechanism for multiple protocols and applications.  There
   are some improvements that can be made to better fit existing
   technologies.  There is a possibility of evolving BFD to better fit
   new technologies.  This document focuses on several aspects of BFD in
   order to further improve efficiency, expand failure detection
   coverage, and allow BFD usage for wider scenarios.  Additional use
   cases are listed in [<a href="./rfc7882" title='"Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) Use Cases"'>RFC7882</a>].

   Specifically, this document defines Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (S-BFD), a simplified mechanism for using BFD with a large
   proportion of negotiation aspects eliminated, thus providing benefits
   such as quick provisioning, as well as improved control and
   flexibility for network nodes initiating path monitoring.  S-BFD
   enables cases benefiting from the use of core BFD technologies in a
   fashion that leverages existing implementations and protocol
   machinery while providing a rather simplified and largely stateless
   infrastructure for continuity testing.

   One key aspect of the mechanism described in this document eliminates
   the time between a network node wanting to perform a continuity test
   and completing the continuity test.  In traditional BFD terms, the
   initial state changes from DOWN to UP are virtually nonexistent.
   Removal of this "seam" (i.e., time delay) in BFD provides a smooth
   and continuous operational experience for applications.  Therefore,
   "Seamless BFD" (S-BFD) has been chosen as the name for this
   mechanism.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the BFD [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>], IP
   [<a href="./rfc791" title='"Internet Protocol"'>RFC791</a>] [<a href="./rfc2460" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>], and MPLS [<a href="./rfc3031" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>RFC3031</a>] terms and protocol constructs.
   The remainder of this section describes several new terms introduced
   by S-BFD.

   o  Classical BFD - BFD session types based on [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>].

   o  S-BFD - Seamless BFD.

   o  S-BFD Control packet - a BFD Control packet for the S-BFD
      mechanism.

   o  S-BFD Echo packet - a BFD Echo packet for the S-BFD mechanism.

   o  S-BFD packet - a BFD Control packet or a BFD Echo packet.

   o  Entity - a function on a network node to which the S-BFD mechanism
      allows remote network nodes to perform continuity tests.  An
      entity can be abstract (e.g., reachability) or specific (e.g., IP
      addresses, Router-IDs, functions).

   o  SBFDInitiator - an S-BFD session on a network node that performs a
      continuity test to a remote entity by sending S-BFD packets.

   o  SBFDReflector - an S-BFD session on a network node that listens
      for incoming S-BFD Control packets to local entities and generates
      response S-BFD Control packets.

   o  Reflector BFD session - synonymous with SBFDReflector.

   o  S-BFD Discriminator - a BFD Discriminator allocated for a local
      entity.  An SBFDReflector listens for S-BFD Discriminators.

   o  BFD Discriminator - a BFD Discriminator allocated for an
      SBFDInitiator.

   o  Initiator - a network node hosting an SBFDInitiator.

   o  Responder - a network node hosting an SBFDReflector.

   Figure 1 describes the relationship between S-BFD terms.

   An S-BFD module on each network node allocates one or more S-BFD
   Discriminators for local entities and creates a Reflector BFD
   session.  Allocated S-BFD Discriminators may be advertised by
   applications (e.g., OSPF/IS-IS).  The required result is that
   applications on other network nodes will know about the S-BFD
   Discriminators allocated by a remote node to remote entities.  The
   Reflector BFD session, upon receiving an S-BFD Control packet
   targeted to one of the local S-BFD Discriminator values, is to
   transmit a response S-BFD Control packet back to the initiator.

   Once the above setup is complete, any network node that knows about
   the S-BFD Discriminator allocated by a remote node to a remote entity
   or entities can quickly perform a continuity test to the remote
   entity by simply sending S-BFD Control packets with a corresponding
   S-BFD Discriminator value in the Your Discriminator field.

   This is exemplified in Figure 2.

                     Figure 2: S-BFD for IS-IS Network

   An S-BFD module in a system with IS-IS System-ID xxx (Node A)
   allocates an S-BFD Discriminator 123, and IS-IS advertises the S-BFD
   Discriminator 123 in an IS-IS TLV.  An S-BFD module in a system with
   IS-IS System-ID yyy (Node D) allocates an S-BFD Discriminator 456,
   and IS-IS advertises the S-BFD Discriminator 456 in an IS-IS TLV.  A
   Reflector BFD session is created on both network nodes (Node A and
   Node D).  When Node A wants to check the reachability of Node D,
   Node A can send an S-BFD Control packet destined to Node D with the
   Your Discriminator field set to 456.  When the Reflector BFD session
   on Node D receives this S-BFD Control packet, then a response S-BFD
   Control packet is sent back to Node A, which allows Node A to
   complete the continuity test.

   When a node allocates multiple S-BFD Discriminators, how remote nodes
   determine which of the discriminators is associated with a specific
   entity is currently unspecified.  The use of multiple S-BFD
   Discriminators by a single network node is therefore discouraged
   until a means of learning the mapping is defined.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20S-BFD%20Discriminators"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  S-BFD Discriminators</span>

   One important characteristic of an S-BFD Discriminator is that it
   MUST be unique within an administrative domain.  If multiple network
   nodes allocate the same S-BFD Discriminator value, then S-BFD Control
   packets falsely terminating on a wrong network node can result in a
   Reflector BFD session generating a response back because of a
   matching Your Discriminator value.  This is clearly not desirable.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Discriminator%20Pools"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Discriminator Pools</span>

   This subsection describes a discriminator pool implementation
   technique to minimize S-BFD Discriminator collisions.  This technique
   will allow an implementation to better satisfy the S-BFD
   Discriminator uniqueness requirement defined in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   o  An SBFDInitiator is to allocate a discriminator from the BFD
      Discriminator pool.  If the system also supports classical BFD
      (i.e., implements [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>]), then the BFD Discriminator pool
      SHOULD be shared by SBFDInitiator sessions and classical BFD
      sessions.

   o  An SBFDReflector is to allocate a discriminator from the S-BFD
      Discriminator pool.  The S-BFD Discriminator pool SHOULD be a
      separate pool from the BFD Discriminator pool.

   The remainder of this subsection describes the reasons for the
   suggestions above.

   Locally allocated S-BFD Discriminator values for entities that
   SBFDReflector sessions are listening for may be arbitrarily allocated
   or derived from values provided by applications.  These values may be
   protocol IDs (e.g., System-ID, Router-ID) or network targets (e.g.,
   IP address).  To avoid derived S-BFD Discriminator values already
   being assigned to other BFD sessions (i.e., SBFDInitiator sessions
   and classical BFD sessions), it is RECOMMENDED that the discriminator
   pool for SBFDReflector sessions be separate from other BFD sessions.

   Even when following the "separate discriminator pool" approach, a
   collision is still possible between different S-BFD applications that
   may be using different values and algorithms to derive S-BFD
   Discriminator values.  If two applications are using S-BFD for the
   same purpose (e.g., network reachability), then the colliding S-BFD
   Discriminator value can be shared.  If the two applications are using
   S-BFD for a different purpose, then the collision must be addressed.
   The use of multiple S-BFD Discriminators by a single network node,
   however, is discouraged (see <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Reflector%20BFD%20Session"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Reflector BFD Session</span>

   Each network node creates one or more Reflector BFD sessions.  This
   Reflector BFD session is a session that transmits S-BFD Control
   packets in response to received S-BFD Control packets with the
   Your Discriminator field having S-BFD Discriminators allocated for
   local entities.  Specifically, this Reflector BFD session has the
   following characteristics:

   o  MUST NOT transmit any S-BFD packets based on local timer expiry.

   o  MUST transmit an S-BFD Control packet in response to a received
      S-BFD Control packet having a valid S-BFD Discriminator in the
      Your Discriminator field, unless prohibited by local policies
      (e.g., administrative, security, rate-limiter).

   o  MUST be capable of sending only two states: UP and AdminDown.

   One Reflector BFD session may be responsible for handling received
   S-BFD Control packets targeted to all locally allocated S-BFD
   Discriminators, or a few Reflector BFD sessions may each be
   responsible for a subset of locally allocated S-BFD Discriminators.
   This policy is a local matter and is outside the scope of this
   document.

   Note that incoming S-BFD Control packets may be based on IPv4, IPv6,
   or MPLS [<a href="./rfc7881" title='"Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) for IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS"'>RFC7881</a>].  Note also that other options are possible and may
   be defined in future documents.  How such S-BFD Control packets reach
   an appropriate Reflector BFD session is also a local matter and is
   outside the scope of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20State%20Variables"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  State Variables</span>

   S-BFD introduces new state variables and modifies the usage of
   existing ones.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20New%20State%20Variables"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  New State Variables</span>

   A new state variable is added to the base specification in support
   of S-BFD.

   o  bfd.SessionType: This is a new state variable that describes
      the type of a particular session.  Allowable values for S-BFD
      sessions are:

      *  SBFDInitiator - an S-BFD session on a network node that
         performs a continuity test to a target entity by sending S-BFD
         packets.

      *  SBFDReflector - an S-BFD session on a network node that listens
         for incoming S-BFD Control packets to local entities and
         generates response S-BFD Control packets.

   The bfd.SessionType variable MUST be initialized to the appropriate
   type when an S-BFD session is created.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20State%20Variable%20Initialization%20and%20Maintenance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  State Variable Initialization and Maintenance</span>

   State variables (defined in <a href="./rfc5880#section-6.8.1">SectionÂ 6.8.1 of [RFC5880]</a>) need to
   be initialized or manipulated differently, depending on the
   session type.

   o  bfd.DemandMode: This variable MUST be initialized to 1 for session
      type SBFDInitiator and MUST be initialized to 0 for session type
      SBFDReflector.  This is done to prevent loops (see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).

   An S-BFD packet MUST be demultiplexed with lower-layer information
   (e.g., dedicated destination UDP port [<a href="./rfc7881" title='"Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) for IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS"'>RFC7881</a>], associated Channel
   Type [<a href="./rfc7885" title='"Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) for Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)"'>RFC7885</a>]).  The following procedure SHOULD be executed on both
   initiator and reflector:

      If the packet is an S-BFD packet

         If the S-BFD packet is for an SBFDReflector

            The packet MUST be looked up to locate a corresponding
            SBFDReflector session based on the value from the
            Your Discriminator field in the table describing S-BFD
            Discriminators.

         Else

            The packet MUST be looked up to locate a corresponding
            SBFDInitiator session or classical BFD session based on the
            value from the Your Discriminator field in the table
            describing BFD Discriminators.  If no match, then the
            received packet MUST be discarded.

            If the session is an SBFDInitiator session

               The destination of the packet (i.e., the destination IP
               address) SHOULD be verified as being for itself.

            Else

               The packet MUST be discarded.

         The procedure described in <a href="./rfc5880#section-6.8.6">SectionÂ 6.8.6 of [RFC5880]</a> MUST be

   A network node that receives S-BFD Control packets transmitted by an
   initiator is referred to as the responder.  The responder, upon
   reception of S-BFD Control packets, is to verify the validity of the
   packets, as described in [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.2.1.%20%20Responder%20Demultiplexing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2.1" id="section-7.2.1">7.2.1</a>.  Responder Demultiplexing</span>

   An S-BFD packet MUST be demultiplexed with lower-layer information.
   The following procedure SHOULD be executed by the responder:

      If the Your Discriminator field is not one of the entries
      allocated for local entities

         The packet MUST be discarded.

      Else

         The packet is determined to be handled by a Reflector BFD
         session responsible for that S-BFD Discriminator.

         If allowable per local policy (e.g., administrative, security,
         rate-limiter)

            The chosen Reflector BFD session SHOULD transmit a response
            BFD Control packet using the procedures described in

      State (Sta)

         Set to bfd.SessionState (either UP or AdminDown only).

      microseconds, the minimum interval between incoming S-BFD Control
      packets that this SBFDReflector can handle.  The SBFDReflector can
      control how fast SBFDInitiators will be sending S-BFD Control
      packets to themselves by ensuring that Required Min RX Interval
      indicates a value based on the current load.

   o  When the SBFDReflector receives an S-BFD Control packet from an
      SBFDInitiator, then the SBFDReflector needs to determine what
      "state" to send in the response S-BFD Control packet.  If the
      monitored local entity is in service, then the state MUST be set
      to UP.  If the monitored local entity is "temporarily out of
      service", then the state SHOULD be set to AdminDown.

   o  If an SBFDReflector receives an S-BFD Control packet with the
      Demand (D) bit cleared, the packet MUST be discarded (see
      <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).

   S-BFD Control packets transmitted by an SBFDInitiator MUST set the
   Your Discriminator field to an S-BFD Discriminator corresponding to
   the remote entity.

   Every SBFDInitiator MUST have a locally unique My Discriminator value
   allocated from the BFD Discriminator pool.

   Figure 3 describes the high-level concept of continuity testing using
   S-BFD.  R2 allocates XX as the S-BFD Discriminator for network
   reachability purposes and advertises XX to neighbors.  Figure 3 shows
   R1 and R4 performing a continuity test to R2.

   An SBFDInitiator may be a "persistent" session on the initiator with
   a timer for S-BFD Control packet transmissions (stateful
   SBFDInitiator).  An SBFDInitiator may also be a module, a script, or
   a tool on the initiator that transmits one or more S-BFD Control
   packets "when needed" (stateless SBFDInitiator).  For stateless
   SBFDInitiators, a complete BFD state machine may not be applicable.
   For stateful SBFDInitiators, the states and the state machine
   described in [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>] will not function due to the SBFDReflector
   session only sending the UP and AdminDown states (i.e., the
   SBFDReflector session does not send the INIT state).  The following
   diagram provides the RECOMMENDED state machine for stateful
   SBFDInitiators.  The notation on each arc represents the state of the
   SBFDInitiator (as received in the State field in the S-BFD Control
   packet) or indicates the expiration of the Detection Timer.  See
   Figure 4.

                                TIMER

               Figure 4: SBFDInitiator Finite State Machine

   Note that the above state machine is different from the base BFD
   specification [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>].  This is because the INIT state is no longer
   applicable for the SBFDInitiator.  Another important difference is
   the transition of the state machine from the DOWN state to the UP
   state when a packet with an UP state setting is received by the
   SBFDInitiator.  The definitions of the states and events have the
   same meanings as those defined in the base BFD specification
   [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>].

   o  If the SBFDInitiator receives a valid S-BFD Control packet in
      response to a transmitted S-BFD Control packet to a remote entity,
      then the SBFDInitiator SHOULD conclude that the S-BFD Control
      packet reached the intended remote entity.

   o  When an SBFDInitiator receives a response S-BFD Control packet, if
      the state specified is AdminDown, the SBFDInitiator MUST NOT
      conclude that the reachability of the corresponding remote entity
      is lost and MUST back off the packet transmission interval for the
      remote entity to an interval no faster than 1 second.

   o  When a sufficient number of S-BFD packets have not arrived as they
      should, the SBFDInitiator SHOULD declare loss of reachability to
      the remote entity.  The criteria for declaring loss of
      reachability and the action that would be triggered as a result
      are outside the scope of this document; the action MAY include
      logging an error.

   o  Regarding the third bullet item, it is critical for an
      implementation to understand the latency to/from the Reflector BFD
      session on the responder.  In other words, for the very first
      S-BFD packet transmitted by the SBFDInitiator, an implementation
      MUST NOT expect a response S-BFD packet to be received for a time
      equivalent to the sum of the latencies: initiator to responder and
      responder back to initiator.

   o  If the SBFDInitiator receives an S-BFD Control packet with the
      Demand (D) bit set, the packet MUST be discarded (see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).

   The diagnostic value in both directions MAY be set to a certain
   value, to attempt to communicate further information to both ends.
   Implementations MAY use the already-existing diagnostic values
   defined in <a href="./rfc5880#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of [RFC5880]</a>.  However, details regarding this

   The Poll Sequence MAY be used in both directions.  The Poll Sequence
   MUST operate in accordance with [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>].  An SBFDReflector MAY use
   the Poll Sequence to slow down the rate at which S-BFD Control
   packets are generated from an SBFDInitiator.  This is done by the
   SBFDReflector, using the procedures described in <a href="#section-7.2.3">Section 7.2.3</a> and
   setting the Poll (P) bit in the reflected S-BFD Control packet.  The
   SBFDInitiator is to then send the next S-BFD Control packet with the
   Final (F) bit set.  If an SBFDReflector receives an S-BFD Control
   packet with the P bit set, then the SBFDReflector MUST respond with
   an S-BFD Control packet with the P bit cleared and the F bit set.

   S-BFD provides a smooth and continuous (i.e., seamless) operational
   experience as an Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
   mechanism for connectivity checking and connection verification.
   This is achieved by providing a simplified mechanism with a large
   proportion of negotiation aspects eliminated, resulting in faster and
   simpler provisioning.

   Because of this simplified mechanism, due to a misconfiguration an
   SBFDInitiator could send S-BFD Control packets to a target that does

   explained in <a href="#section-7.3.1">Section 7.3.1</a>, an SBFDInitiator can be a persistent

   the administrative domain that uses it.  Further, operational
   measures SHOULD be taken to determine if responses to S-BFD packets
   are not sent for an extended period of time and then remediate the
   situation.  These potential concerns are largely mitigated by dynamic
   advertisement mechanisms for S-BFD and with automation checks before
   applying configurations.

   This mechanism brings forth one noticeable difference in terms of the
   scaling aspect: the number of SBFDReflectors.  This specification
   eliminates the need for egress nodes to have fully active BFD
   sessions when only one side desires to perform continuity tests.
   With the introduction of the Reflector BFD concept, egress is no
   longer required to create any active BFD sessions on a per-path/LSP/
   function basis.  Because of this, the total number of BFD sessions in
   a network is reduced.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.2.%20%20Congestion%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" id="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Congestion Considerations</span>

   When S-BFD performs failure detection, it consumes resources,
   including bandwidth and CPU processing.  To avoid congestion, it is
   therefore imperative that operators correctly provision the rates at
   which S-BFD packets are transmitted.  When BFD is used across
   multiple hops, a congestion control mechanism MUST be implemented,
   and when congestion is detected, the BFD implementation MUST reduce
   the amount of traffic it generates.  The exact mechanism used to
   detect congestion is outside the scope of this specification but may
   include the detection of lost BFD Control packets or other means.
   The SBFDReflector can limit the rate at which SBFDInitiators will be
   sending S-BFD Control packets by utilizing Required Min RX Interval,
   but at the expense of detection time (i.e., detection time will
   increase).

   Demultiplexing requirements for the initial packet are described in
   <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.  Because of this, the S-BFD mechanism can co-exist with
   classical BFD sessions.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.%20%20S-BFD%20Echo%20Function"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" id="section-10">10</a>.  S-BFD Echo Function</span>

   The concept of the S-BFD Echo function is similar to the BFD Echo
   function described in [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>].  S-BFD Echo packets have the
   destination of "self"; thus, S-BFD Echo packets are self-generated
   and self-terminated after traversing a link/path.  S-BFD Echo packets
   are expected to U-turn on the target node in the data plane and
   MUST NOT be processed by any Reflector BFD sessions on the
   target node.

   When using the S-BFD Echo function, it is RECOMMENDED that:

   o  Both S-BFD Control packets and S-BFD Echo packets be sent.

   o  Both S-BFD Control packets and S-BFD Echo packets have the same
      semantics in the forward direction to reach the target node.

   In other words, it is not preferable to send just S-BFD Echo packets
   without also sending S-BFD Control packets.  There are two reasons
   behind this suggestion:

   o  S-BFD Control packets can verify the reachability of the intended
      target node; this allows one to have confidence that S-BFD Echo
      packets are U-turning on the expected target node.

   o  S-BFD Control packets can detect when the target node is going out
      of service (i.e., by receiving AdminDown state).

   S-BFD Echo packets can be spoofed and can U-turn in a transit node
   before reaching the expected target node.  When the S-BFD Echo
   function is used, it is RECOMMENDED in this specification that both
   S-BFD Control packets and S-BFD Echo packets be sent.  While the
   additional use of S-BFD Control packets alleviates these two
   concerns, some form of authentication MAY still be included.

   The usage of the Required Min Echo RX Interval field is described in
   Sections <a href="#section-7.2.2">7.2.2</a> and <a href="#section-7.3.2">7.3.2</a>.  Because of the stateless nature of
   SBFDReflector sessions, a value specified in the Required Min Echo RX
   Interval field is not very meaningful to the SBFDReflector.  Thus, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the Required Min Echo RX Interval field simply be
   set to zero by the SBFDInitiator.  The SBFDReflector MAY set the
   Required Min Echo RX Interval field to an appropriate value to
   control the rate at which it wants to receive S-BFD Echo packets.

   The following aspects of S-BFD Echo functions are left as
   implementation details and are outside the scope of this document:

   o  Format of the S-BFD Echo packet (e.g., data beyond UDP header).

   o  Procedures on when and how to use the S-BFD Echo function.

   The same security considerations as those described in [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>]
   apply to this document.  Additionally, implementing the following
   measures will strengthen security aspects of the mechanism described
   by this document:

   o  The SBFDInitiator MAY pick a sequence number to be set in
      "sequence number" in the Authentication Section, based on the
      configured authentication mode.

   o  The SBFDReflector MUST NOT use the crypto sequence number to make
      a decision about accepting the packet.  This is because the
      SBFDReflector does not maintain S-BFD peer state and because the
      SBFDReflector can receive S-BFD packets from multiple
      SBFDInitiators.  Consequently, BFD authentication can be used, but
      not the sequence number.

   o  The SBFDReflector MAY use the Auth Key ID in the incoming packet
      to verify the Authentication Data.

   o  The SBFDReflector MUST accept the packet if authentication is
      successful.

   o  The SBFDReflector MUST compute the Authentication Data and MUST
      use the same sequence number that it received in the S-BFD Control
      packet to which it is responding.

   o  The SBFDInitiator SHOULD accept an S-BFD Control packet with a
      sequence number within the permissible range.  One potential
      approach is the procedure explained in [<a href="#ref-BFD-GEN-AUTH">BFD-GEN-AUTH</a>].

   Using the above method,

   o  SBFDReflectors continue to remain stateless, despite using
      security.

   o  SBFDReflectors are not susceptible to replay attacks, as they
      always respond to S-BFD Control packets irrespective of the
      sequence number carried.

   o  An attacker cannot impersonate the responder, since the
      SBFDInitiator will only accept S-BFD Control packets that come
      with the sequence number that it had originally used when sending
      the S-BFD Control packet.

   Additionally, the use of strong forms of authentication is strongly
   encouraged for S-BFD.  The use of Simple Password authentication
   [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>] potentially puts other services at risk if S-BFD packets
   can be intercepted and those password values are reused for other
   services.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Loop%20Problem%20and%20Solution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Loop Problem and Solution</span>

   Consider a scenario where we have two nodes and both are S-BFD
   capable.

    Node A (IP 2001:db8::1) ----------------- Node B (IP 2001:db8::2)
                                    |
                                    |
                         Man in the Middle (MITM)

   Assume that Node A reserved a discriminator 0x01010101 for target
   identifier 2001:db8::1 and has a reflector session in listening mode.
   Similarly, Node B reserved a discriminator 0x02020202 for its target
   identifier 2001:db8::2 and also has a reflector session in
   listening mode.

   Suppose that a MITM sends a spoofed packet with My Discriminator =
   0x01010101, Your Discriminator = 0x02020202, source IP as
   2001:db8::1, and destination IP as 2001:db8::2.  When this packet
   reaches Node B, the reflector session on Node B will swap the
   discriminators and IP addresses of the received packet and reflect it
   back, since the Your Discriminator value of the received packet
   matches the reserved discriminator of Node B.  The reflected packet
   that reached Node A will have My Discriminator = 0x02020202 and
   Your Discriminator = 0x01010101.  Since the Your Discriminator value
   of the received packet matches the reserved discriminator of Node A,
   Node A will swap the discriminators and reflect the packet back to
   Node B.  Since the reflectors must set the TTL of the reflected
   packets to 255, the above scenario will result in an infinite loop
   because of just one malicious packet injected from the MITM.

   The solution is to avoid the loop problem by using the D bit (Demand
   mode bit).  The initiator always sets the D bit, and the reflector
   always clears it.  This way, we can determine if a received packet
   was a reflected packet and avoid reflecting it back.
