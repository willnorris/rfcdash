Abstract

   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
   application/xv+xml.  This sub-type is intended for use as a media
   descriptor for XHTML+Voice multimodal language documents.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   XHTML+Voice is a member of the XHTML family of document types, as
   specified by XHTML Modularization [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Modularization of XHTML"'>4</a>].  XHTML+Voice extends XHTML 1.1
   [<a href="#ref-5" title='"XHTML 1.1 - Module-based XHTML"'>5</a>] with a modularized subset of VoiceXML 2.0 [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML)"'>9</a>], XML Events [<a href="#ref-7" title='"XML Events - An events syntax for XML"'>7</a>],
   and a few extensions to both XHTML and VoiceXML 2.0.  XHTML 1.1,
   VoiceXML 2.0, and XML Events are W3C Recommendations.

   The language integration defined by XHTML+Voice supports all modules
   defined by XHTML Modularization and adds voice interaction to XHTML
   elements in order to enable multimodal applications.  The defined
   document type for XHTML+Voice is XHTML Host language document type
   conformant.

   XHTML+Voice 1.2 [<a href="#ref-8" title='"XHTML+Voice Profile 1.2"'>8</a>] is maintained by the VoiceXML Forum, at URI
   location &lt;<a href="http://www.voicexml">http://www.voicexml</a>.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/&gt;.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20application%2Fxv%2Bxml%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  application/xv+xml Usage</span>

   The application/xv+xml media type is intended to be a media
   descriptor for XHTML+Voice multimodal documents.  It is used to
   inform applications that additional markup for running a voice
   browser component and activating handlers for DOM Level 2 events [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Document Object Model Level 2 Events Specification"'>6</a>]
   via XML Events [<a href="#ref-7" title='"XML Events - An events syntax for XML"'>7</a>] can be processed.

      To: ietf-types@iana.org
      Subject: Registration of MIME media type
               application/xv+xml

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: xv+xml

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters:

      charset: has the same semantics as the charset parameter of the
      "application/xml" media type specified in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"XML Media Types"'>1</a>].

   Encoding considerations:
      XHTML+Voice has the same media type encoding considerations
      specified in Section 3.2 of [<a href="#ref-1" title='"XML Media Types"'>1</a>].

   Security considerations:
      XHTML+Voice is an extension of XHTML and has the same security
      issues as XHTML.  These include interpreting anchors and forms in
      XHTML documents, and scripting languages and other dynamic
      interactive capabilities.  See Section 7 of [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;The 'application/xhtml+xml' Media Type&quot;">2</a>].
      In addition, the scripting language can be accessed by both the
      XHTML and the VoiceXML 2.0 markup embedded in the XHTML+Voice
      document.  See Section 1.3.1.5 of [<a href="#ref-8" title='"XHTML+Voice Profile 1.2"'>8</a>].
      XML-Events [<a href="#ref-7" title='"XML Events - An events syntax for XML"'>7</a>] allows an author to attach a handler to any node in
      the document.  The handler that is activated in response to a
      specified event may be either a voice dialog or a script that can
      be in either the same or an external document.

   Interoperability considerations:
      Because XHTML+Voice is built upon W3C standard recommendations, it
      is designed to be interoperable across a wide range of platforms
      and client devices.  Because the extensions to XHTML are
      identified by their namespaces, all browsers that have namespace
      support can run an XHTML+Voice document as an XHTML document
      without voice interaction.

   Published specification:
      The latest published version of XHTML+Voice is [<a href="#ref-8" title='"XHTML+Voice Profile 1.2"'>8</a>].

   Applications which use this media type:
      XHTML+Voice documents are intended to be deployed on the World
      Wide Web and rendered by multimodal browsers that support the
      visual and voice modes of interaction.  Because XHTML+Voice is an
      application of XML, authors can expect XHTML+Voice user agents to
      be conformant XML 1.0 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0"'>3</a>] processors.  See section 2 of [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;The 'application/xhtml+xml' Media Type&quot;">2</a>].

   Additional information:
      Magic number(s): There is no single string that is always present.
      File extension(s): mxml, xhvml, xvml, xvm
      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Fragment%20Identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Fragment Identifiers</span>

   See Section 3 of [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;The 'application/xhtml+xml' Media Type&quot;">2</a>].  Following [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;The 'application/xhtml+xml' Media Type&quot;">2</a>], fragment identifiers for XHTML+
   Voice documents designate the element with the corresponding ID
   attribute value (see [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0"'>3</a>], Section 3.3.1).

   While XHTML+Voice adds new ID attributes with fragment identifier
   namespaces that are not in the same namespace as XHTML, uniqueness of
   the ID attribute values is preserved within the document.  See
   sections <a href="#section-1.3.1">1.3.1</a> and <a href="#section-5.3">5.3</a> of [<a href="#ref-8" title='"XHTML+Voice Profile 1.2"'>8</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Recognizing%20XHTML%2BVoice%20files"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Recognizing XHTML+Voice files</span>

   Because XHTML+Voice is XML, an XHTML+Voice document (optionally)
   starts with an XML declaration that begins with "&lt;?xml" and has a
   DOCTYPE declaration "&lt;!DOCTYPE html".  XHTML+Voice 1.2 has the
   following DOCTYPE declaration:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//VoiceXML Forum//DTD XHTML+Voice 1.2//EN"
"<a href="http://www.voicexml">http://www.voicexml</a>.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/dtd/xhtml+voice12.dtd"&gt;

   Because XHTML+Voice is in the XHTML family of languages, the root
   element of an XHTML+Voice document is 'html', and '&lt;html' can be
   found near the top of the document.
