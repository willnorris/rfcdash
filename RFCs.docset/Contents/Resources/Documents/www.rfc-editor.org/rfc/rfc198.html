                <span class="h1">SITE CERTIFICATION - LINCOLN LABS 360/67</span>



        We have exercised Lincoln Labs Network software as follows: NCP,
ICP, ASCII Telnet (user and server), login procedure, access to CMS, and
operator and console communication.  All  behave  according  to  current
specifications.

        Multiple message responses, such as  listing  users,  were  very
smooth under moderate to heavy load of the /67.
