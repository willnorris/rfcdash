Abstract

   This document is one in the series of documents that define various
   MIB objects for IPv6.  Specifically, this document is the MIB module
   which defines managed objects for implementations of the Transmission
   Control Protocol (TCP) over IP Version 6 (IPv6).

   This document also recommends a specific policy with respect to the
   applicability of <a href="./rfc2012">RFC 2012</a> for implementations of IPv6.  Namely, that
   most of managed objects defined in <a href="./rfc2012">RFC 2012</a> are independent of which
   IP versions underlie TCP, and only the TCP connection information is
   IP version-specific.

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   IPv6-based internets.

   A management system contains: several (potentially many) nodes, each
   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to
   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a
   management protocol, used to convey management information between
   the agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are
   carried out under an administrative framework which defines
   authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy policies.

   Management stations execute management applications which monitor and
   control managed elements.  Managed elements are devices such as
   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and
   controlled via access to their management information.

   Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
   residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined
   in MIB modules.  These modules are written using a subset of OSI's
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-1" title=" (December">1</a>], termed the Structure of
   Management Information (SMI) [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure of Management Information for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

   This document is one in the series of documents that define various
   MIB objects, and statements of conformance, for IPv6.  This document
   defines the required instrumentation for implementations of TCP over
   IPv6.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Transparency%20of%20IP%20versions%20to%20TCP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Transparency of IP versions to TCP</span>

   The fact that a particular TCP connection uses IPv6 as opposed to
   IPv4, is largely invisible to a TCP implementation.  A "TCPng" did
   not need to be defined, implementations simply need to support IPv6
   addresses.

   As such, the managed objects already defined in [TCP MIB] are
   sufficient for managing TCP in the presence of IPv6.  These objects
   are equally applicable whether the managed node supports IPv4 only,
   IPv6 only, or both IPv4 and IPv6.

   For example, tcpActiveOpens counts "The number of times TCP
   connections have made a direct transition to the SYN-SENT state from
   the CLOSED state", regardless of which version of IP is used between
   the connection endpoints.

   Stated differently, TCP implementations don't need separate counters
   for IPv4 and for IPv6.

   The exception to the statements in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> is the tcpConnTable.
   Since IPv6 addresses cannot be represented with the IpAddress syntax,
   not all TCP connections can be represented in the tcpConnTable
   defined in [TCP MIB].

   This memo defines a new, separate table to represent only those TCP
   connections between IPv6 endpoints.  TCP connections between IPv4
   endpoints continue to be represented in tcpConnTable [TCP MIB].  (It
   is not possible to establish a TCP connection between an IPv4
    endpoint and an IPv6 endpoint.)

   A different approach would have been to define a new table to
   represent all TCP connections regardless of IP version.  This would
   require changes to [TCP MIB] and hence to existing (IPv4-only) TCP
   implementations.  The approach suggested in this memo has the
   advantage of leaving IPv4-only implementations intact.

   It is assumed that the objects defined in this memo will eventually
   be defined in an update to [TCP MIB].  For this reason, the module
   identity is assigned under the experimental portion of the MIB.

   This MIB contains a management object that has a MAX-ACCESS clause of
   read-write and/or read-create.  In particular, it is possible to
   delete individual TCP control blocks (i.e., connections).

   Consequently, anyone having the ability to issue a SET on this object
   can impact the operation of the node.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be
   considered to contain sensitive information in some environments.
   For example, the MIB identifies the active TCP connections on the
   node.  Although this information might be considered sensitive in
   some environments (i.e., to identify ports on which to launch
   denial-of-service or other attacks), there are already other ways of
   obtaining similar information.  For example, sending a random TCP
   packet to an unused port prompts the generation of a TCP reset
   message.

   Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read
   and/or write access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the
   values of these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.
   Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure
   environment.  SNMPv1 by itself does not provide encryption or strong
   authentication.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [<a href="./rfc2274" title='"The User-Based Security Model for Version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2274</a>] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [<a href="./rfc2275" title='"View-based Access Control Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2275</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
