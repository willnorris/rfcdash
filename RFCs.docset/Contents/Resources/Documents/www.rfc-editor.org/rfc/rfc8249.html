Abstract

   The base IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   protocol has a TRILL campus-wide MTU feature, specified in RFCs 6325
   and 7177, that assures that link-state changes can be successfully
   flooded throughout the campus while being able to take advantage of a
   campus-wide capability to support jumbo packets.  This document
   specifies recommended updates to that MTU feature to take advantage,
   for appropriate link-local packets, of link-local MTUs that exceed
   the TRILL campus MTU.  In addition, it specifies an efficient
   algorithm for local MTU testing.  This document updates RFCs 6325,
   7177, and 7780.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC6325">RFC6325</a>] describes the way RBridges agree on the campus-wide minimum
   acceptable inter-RBridge MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) size (called
   "Sz") to ensure that link-state flooding operates properly and all
   RBridges converge to the same link state.  For the proper operation
   of TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) IS-IS, all
   RBridges format their Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) to fit
   in Sz.

   [<a id="ref-RFC7177">RFC7177</a>] diagrams the state transitions of an adjacency.  If MTU
   testing is enabled, "Link MTU size is successfully tested" is part of
   an event (event A6) causing the transition from the "2-Way" state
   [<a href="./rfc7177" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Adjacency"'>RFC7177</a>] to the "Report" state for an adjacency.  This means that
   the link MTU testing of size x succeeds, and x is greater than or
   equal to Sz [<a href="./rfc6325" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>].  If this link cannot support an MTU of Sz, it
   will not be reported as part of the campus topology.

   In this document, a new RECOMMENDED link-wide minimum inter-RBridge
   MTU size, "Lz", is specified.  As further discussed in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, by
   calculating and using Lz as specified herein, link-scoped Protocol
   Data Units (PDUs) can be formatted greater than Sz, up to the
   link-wide minimum acceptable inter-RBridge MTU size, potentially
   improving the efficiency of link utilization and speeding link-state
   convergence.

   An optional TRILL MTU size-testing algorithm is specified in
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> as an efficient method to update the old MTU testing method
   described in <a href="./rfc6325#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2 of [RFC6325]</a> and in [<a href="./rfc7177" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Adjacency"'>RFC7177</a>].  The new
   MTU size-testing method specified in this document is backward
   compatible with the old one.  Multicasting the MTU-probes is
   recommended when there are multiple RBridges on a link responding to
   the probing with an MTU-ack [<a href="./rfc7177" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Adjacency"'>RFC7177</a>].  The testing method and rules
   of this document are devised in a way that minimizes the number of
   MTU-probes for testing, therefore reducing the number of multicast
   packets for MTU testing.

   This document updates RFCs 6325, 7177, and 7780.  The update to
   [<a href="./rfc6325" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>] and [<a href="./rfc7177" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Adjacency"'>RFC7177</a>] is specified in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  The update to
   [<a href="./rfc7780" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Clarifications, Corrections, and Updates"'>RFC7780</a>] is specified in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8249">RFC 8249</a>                     MTU Negotiation              September 2017</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Link-Wide%20TRILL%20MTU%20Size"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Link-Wide TRILL MTU Size</span>

   This document specifies a new value "Lz" for the minimum acceptable
   inter-RBridge link MTU size on a local link.  Link-wide Lz is the
   minimum Lz supported and agreed upon amongst all RBridges on a
   specific link.  If the link is usable, Lz will be greater than or
   equal to Sz.

   Some TRILL IS-IS PDUs are exchanged only between neighbors instead of
   throughout the whole campus.  They are confined by the link-wide Lz
   instead of Sz.  Complete Sequence Number PDUs (CSNPs) and Partial
   Sequence Number PDUs (PSNPs) are examples of such PDUs.  These PDUs
   are exchanged only on the local link.  (While TRILL IS-IS Hellos are
   also link local, they are always limited to 1470 bytes for
   robustness.)

   [<a id="ref-RFC7356">RFC7356</a>] defines the PDUs that support flooding scopes in addition
   to area-wide scopes and domain-wide scopes.  As specified in
   [<a href="./rfc8139" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Appointed Forwarders"'>RFC8139</a>], RBridges support the Extended L1 Circuit Scope (E-L1CS)
   Flooding Scope LSP (FS-LSP) [<a href="./rfc7780" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Clarifications, Corrections, and Updates"'>RFC7780</a>].  The originatingSNPBufferSize
   for a port is the minimum of the following two quantities but
   not less than 1470 bytes: (1) the MTU of the port and (2) the maximum
   LSP size that the TRILL IS-IS implementation can handle.  They use
   that flooding to exchange their maximum supported value of "Lz".  The
   smallest value of the Lz advertised by the RBridges on a link, but
   not less than Sz, is the link-wide Lz.  An RBridge on a local link
   will be able to tell which other RBridges on that link support E-L1CS
   FS-LSPs because, as required by [<a href="./rfc7780" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Clarifications, Corrections, and Updates"'>RFC7780</a>], all RBridges include the
   Scope Flooding Support TLV [<a href="./rfc7356" title='"IS-IS Flooding Scope Link State PDUs (LSPs)"'>RFC7356</a>] in their TRILL Hellos.

   The maximum size for a level-1 link-local PDU (such as a PSNP or
   CSNP) that may be generated by a system is controlled by the value of
   the management parameter originatingL1SNPBufferSize.  This value
   determines Lz.  The TRILL APPsub-TLV shown in Figure 1 SHOULD be
   included in a TRILL GENINFO TLV [<a href="./rfc7357" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): End Station Address Distribution Information (ESADI) Protocol"'>RFC7357</a>] in an E-L1CS FS-LSP
   fragment zero.  If it is missing from an E-L1CS FS-LSP fragment zero
   or there is no E-L1CS FS-LSP fragment zero, it is assumed that its
   originating IS is implicitly advertising its originatingSNPBufferSize
   value as Sz octets.

   E-L1CS FS-LSPs are link local and can also be sent up to a size of Lz
   but, for robustness, E-L1CS FS-LSP fragment zero MUST NOT exceed
   1470 bytes.

             Figure 1: The originatingSNPBufferSize APPsub-TLV

   Type: Set to the originatingSNPBufferSize APPsub-TLV (TRILL
      APPsub-TLV type 21).  Two bytes, because this APPsub-TLV appears
      in an extended TLV [<a href="./rfc7356" title='"IS-IS Flooding Scope Link State PDUs (LSPs)"'>RFC7356</a>].

   Length: Set to 2.

   originatingSNPBufferSize: The local value of
      originatingL1SNPBufferSize as an unsigned integer, limited to the
      range from 1470 to 65,535 bytes.  (A value less than 1470 will be
      ignored.)

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Operations</span>

   Lz MAY be reported using an originatingSNPBufferSize APPsub-TLV that
   occurs in fragment zero of the RBridge's E-L1CS FS-LSP.  An
   originatingSNPBufferSize APPsub-TLV occurring in any other fragment
   is ignored.  If more than one originatingSNPBufferSize APPsub-TLV
   occurs in fragment zero, the one advertising the smallest value for
   originatingSNPBufferSize, but not less than 1470 bytes, is used.

   Even if all RBridges on a specific link have reached consensus on the
   value of link-wide Lz based on advertised originatingSNPBufferSize,
   it does not mean that these RBridges can safely exchange PDUs between
   each other.  Figure 2 shows such a corner case.  RB1, RB2, and RB3
   are three RBridges on the same link and their Lz is 1800, so the
   link-wide Lz of this link is 1800.  There is an intermediate bridge
   (say B1) between RB2 and RB3 whose port MTU size is 1700.  If RB2
   sends PDUs formatted in chunks of size 1800, those PDUs will be
   discarded by B1.

       Figure 2: Link-Wide Lz = 1800 vs. Tested Link MTU Size = 1700

   Therefore, the link MTU size SHOULD be tested.  After the link MTU
   size of an adjacency is successfully tested, those link-local PDUs,
   such as CSNPs, PSNPs, and E-L1CS FS-LSPs, will be formatted
   no greater than the tested link MTU size and will be safely
   transmitted on this link.

   As for Sz, RBridges continue to propagate their
   originatingL1LSPBufferSize across the campus through the
   advertisement of LSPs as defined in <a href="./rfc6325#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2 of [RFC6325]</a>.  The
   smallest value of Sz advertised by any RBridge, but not less than
   1470, will be deemed as Sz.  Each RBridge formats their "campus-wide"
   PDUs -- for example, LSPs -- no greater than what they determine
   as Sz.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Testing%20Link%20MTU%20Size"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Testing Link MTU Size</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC7177">RFC7177</a>] defines event A6 as indicating that the MTU test was
   successful if MTU testing is enabled.  As described in <a href="./rfc6325#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2
   of [RFC6325]</a>, this is a combination of the following event and
   condition:

   o  Event: The link MTU size has been tested.

   o  Condition: The link can support Sz.

   This condition can be efficiently tested by the following "binary
   search algorithm" and rules.  This updates [<a href="./rfc6325" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>] and [<a href="./rfc7177" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Adjacency"'>RFC7177</a>].

   x, lowerBound, and upperBound are local integer variables.  The
   MTU-probe and MTU-ack PDUs are specified in <a href="./rfc7176#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC7176]</a>.
   It is RECOMMENDED that one Round-Trip Time (RTT) between the two
   adjacent RBridges be used as the minimum interval between two
   successive probes.  Note that RTT estimation is out of scope for this
   document.  If operators cannot estimate the RTT, the default value of
   5 milliseconds should be assumed.

   Step 0: RB1 sends an MTU-probe padded to the size of link-wide Lz.

      1) If RB1 successfully receives the MTU-ack from RB2 to the probe
         of the value of link-wide Lz within k tries (where k is a
         configurable parameter whose default is 3), the link MTU size
         is set to the size of link-wide Lz.  Stop.

      2) RB1 tries to send an MTU-probe padded to 1470 bytes.

         a) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ack from RB2 after k tries
            (an MTU-ack should be considered to have failed two RTTs
            after the probe is sent out), RB1 sets the "failed minimum
            MTU test" flag for RB2 in RB1's Hello.  Stop.

         b) The link MTU size is set to 1470; lowerBound is set to 1470;
            upperBound is set to the link-wide Lz; x is set to
            [(lowerBound + upperBound) / 2], rounded down to the nearest
            integer.

   Step 1: RB1 tries to send an MTU-probe padded to the size x.

      1) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ack from RB2 after k tries:

         upperBound is set to x - 1; x is set to
         [(lowerBound + upperBound) / 2], rounded down to the nearest
         integer.

      2) If RB1 receives an MTU-ack to a probe of size x from RB2:

         The link MTU size is set to x; lowerBound is set to x; x is set
         to [(lowerBound + upperBound) / 2], rounded down to the nearest
         integer.  If lowerBound equals upperBound - 1, then x is set to
         upperBound.

      3) If lowerBound &gt;= upperBound or Step 1 has been repeated n times
         (where n is a configurable parameter whose default value is 5),
         stop.

      4) Repeat Step 1.

   After the testing, the two connected RBridges agree on the value of
   the link MTU size.  MTU testing is only done in the Designated VLAN

   desired to respond with an MTU-ack on the link.  The binary search
   algorithm given here is a way to minimize the probing attempts; it
   reduces the number of multicast packets for MTU-probing.

   The following rules are designed to determine whether the
   aforementioned "Condition" holds.

   RBridges have figured out the upper bound and lower bound of the link
   MTU size from the execution of the above algorithm.  If Sz is smaller
   than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound, RBridges can
   directly judge whether the link supports Sz without MTU-probing.

   (a) If lowerBound &gt;= Sz, this link can support Sz.

   (b) Else if upperBound &lt;= Sz, this link cannot support Sz.

   Otherwise, RBridges SHOULD test whether the link can support Sz as in
   item (c) below.  If they do not, the only safe assumption will be
   that the link cannot support Sz.  This assumption, without testing,
   might rule out the use of a link that can, in fact, handle packets up
   to Sz.  In the worst case, this might result in unnecessary network
   partition.

   (c) lowerBound &lt; Sz &lt; upperBound.  RBridges probe the link with
       MTU-probe messages padded to Sz.  If an MTU-ack is received
       within k tries, this link can support Sz.  Otherwise, this link
       cannot support Sz.  Through this test, the lower bound and upper
       bound of the link MTU size can be updated accordingly.

   RBridges may join or leave the campus; this may change Sz.

   1) Joining

      a) When a new RBridge joins the campus and its
         originatingL1LSPBufferSize is smaller than the current Sz,
         reporting its originatingL1LSPBufferSize in its LSPs will cause
         other RBridges to decrease their Sz.  Then, any LSP greater
         than the reduced Sz MUST be split, and/or the LSP contents in
         the campus MUST be otherwise redistributed so that no LSP is
         greater than the new Sz.

      b) If the joining RBridge's originatingL1LSPBufferSize is greater
         than or equal to the current Sz, reporting its
         originatingL1LSPBufferSize will not change Sz.

   2) Leaving

      a) From the specification of the Joining process, we know that if
         an RBridge's originatingL1LSPBufferSize is smaller than Sz,
         this RBridge will not join this campus.

      b) When an RBridge leaves the campus and its
         originatingL1LSPBufferSize equals Sz, its LSPs are purged from
         the remainder of the campus after reaching MaxAge [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intra-domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>].  Sz
         MAY be recalculated and MAY increase.  In other words, while in
         most cases RB1 ignores link-state information for IS-IS
         unreachable RBridge RB2 [<a href="./rfc7780" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Clarifications, Corrections, and Updates"'>RFC7780</a>], originatingL1LSPBufferSize
         is meaningful.  Its value, even from IS-IS unreachable
         RBridges, is used in determining Sz.  This updates [<a href="./rfc7780" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Clarifications, Corrections, and Updates"'>RFC7780</a>].

      c) When an RBridge leaves the campus and its
         originatingL1LSPBufferSize is greater than Sz, Sz will not be
         updated, since Sz is determined by another RBridge with a
         smaller originatingL1LSPBufferSize.

   Frequent LSP "resizing" is harmful to the stability of the TRILL
   campus, so, to avoid this, upward resizing SHOULD be dampened.  When
   an upward resizing event is noticed by an RBridge, it is RECOMMENDED
   that a timer be set at that RBridge via a configurable parameter --
   LSPresizeTime -- whose default value is 300 seconds.  Before this
   timer expires, all subsequent upward resizing will be dampened
   (ignored).  Of course, in a well-configured campus with all RBridges
   configured to have the same originatingL1LSPBufferSize, no resizing
   will be necessary.  It does not matter if different RBridges have
   different dampening timers or if some RBridges resize upward more
   quickly than others.

   If the refreshed Sz is smaller than the lower bound or greater than
   the upper bound of the tested link MTU size, the issue of resource
   consumption from testing the link MTU size can be avoided according
   to rule (a) or (b) as specified in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  Otherwise, RBridges
   test the link MTU size according to rule (c).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Relationship%20between%20Port%20MTU%2C%20Lz%2C%20and%20Sz"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Relationship between Port MTU, Lz, and Sz</span>

   When the port MTU of an RBridge is smaller than the local
   originatingL1SNPBufferSize of an RBridge (an inconsistent
   configuration), that port SHOULD be disabled, since, in any case, an
   adjacency cannot be formed through such a port.  On the other hand,
   when an RBridge receives an LSP or E-L1CS FS-LSP with size greater
   than the link-wide Lz or Sz but not greater than its port MTU size,
   this LSP is processed normally.  If the size of an LSP is greater

   than the MTU size of a port over which it is to be propagated, this
   LSP MUST NOT be sent over the port and an LSPTooLargeToPropagate
   alarm shall be generated [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intra-domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20LSP%20Synchronization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  LSP Synchronization</span>

   An RBridge participates in LSP synchronization on a link as soon as
   it has at least one adjacency on that link that has advanced to at
   least the 2-Way state [<a href="./rfc7177" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Adjacency"'>RFC7177</a>].  On a LAN link, CSNPs and PSNPs are
   used for synchronization.  On a point-to-point link, only PSNPs are
   used.

   The CSNPs and PSNPs can be formatted in chunks of size (at most)
   link-wide Lz but are processed normally if received having a larger
   size.  Since the link MTU size may not have been tested in the 2-Way
   state, link-wide Lz may be greater than the supported link MTU size.
   In that case, a CSNP or PSNP may be discarded.  After the link MTU
   size is successfully tested, RBridges will begin to format these PDUs
   with a size no greater than that MTU; therefore, these PDUs will
   eventually get through.

   Note that the link MTU size is frequently greater than Sz.
   Link-local PDUs are limited in size by the link MTU size rather than
   Sz, which, when Lz is greater than Sz, promises a reduction in the
   number of PDUs and a faster LSP synchronization process.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Recommendations%20for%20Traffic%20Link%20Testing%20of%20MTU%20Size"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Recommendations for Traffic Link Testing of MTU Size</span>

   Sz and link-wide Lz are used to limit the size of most TRILL IS-IS
   PDUs.  They are different from the MTU size restricting the size of
   TRILL Data packets.  The size of a TRILL Data packet is restricted by
   the physical MTU of the ports and links the packet traverses.  It is
   possible that a TRILL Data packet successfully gets through the
   campus but its size is greater than Sz or link-wide Lz values.

   The algorithm defined for testing the link MTU size can also be used
   in TRILL traffic MTU size testing; in that case, the link-wide Lz
   used in that algorithm is replaced by the port MTU of the RBridge
   sending MTU-probes.  The successfully tested size x MAY be advertised
   as an attribute of this link, using the MTU sub-TLV defined in
   [<a href="./rfc7176" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Use of IS-IS"'>RFC7176</a>].

   Unlike RBridges, end stations do not participate in the exchange of
   TRILL IS-IS PDUs; therefore, they cannot grasp the traffic link MTU
   size from a TRILL campus automatically.  An operator may collect
   these values using network management tools such as TRILL ping or
   TraceRoute.  Then, the path MTU can be set as the smallest tested

   link MTU on this path, and end stations should not generate frames
   that -- when encapsulated as TRILL Data packets -- exceed this
   path MTU.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Backward%20Compatibility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Backward Compatibility</span>

   There can be a mixture of Lz-ignorant and Lz-aware RBridges on a
   link.  This configuration will behave properly, although it may
   not be as efficient as it would be if all RBridges on the link are
   Lz aware.

   For an Lz-ignorant RBridge, TRILL IS-IS PDUs are always formatted
   no greater than Sz.  Lz-aware RBridges as receivers can handle these
   PDUs, since they cannot be greater than the link-wide Lz.

   For an Lz-aware RBridge, in the case that link-wide Lz is greater
   than Sz, larger link-local TRILL IS-IS PDUs can be sent out to
   increase efficiency.  Lz-ignorant RBridges as receivers will have
   no problem handling them, since the originatingL1LSPBufferSize value
   of these RBridges had been tested and the link-wide Lz is not greater
   than that value.

   An Lz-ignorant RBridge might not support the link MTU size-testing
   algorithm defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> but could be using some algorithm just
   to test for the Sz MTU on the link.  In any case, if an RBridge per
   [<a href="./rfc6325" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>] receives an MTU-probe, it MUST respond with an MTU-ack
   padded to the same size as the MTU-probe.

   This document raises no significant new security issues for TRILL.
   In TRILL, RBridges are generally considered to be trusted devices.
   Protection against forged TRILL IS-IS PDUs, including forged Hellos
   containing originatingSNPBufferSize APPsub-TLVs, can be obtained
   through IS-IS PDU cryptographic authentication [<a href="./rfc5310" title='"IS-IS Generic Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC5310</a>].  The worst
   that an RBridge can do by reporting an erroneous
   originatingSNPBufferSize is reduce Lz to Sz and thus make unavailable
   the optimization of being able to use link MTUs that exceed the
   campus-wide MTU for link-local TRILL IS-IS PDUs.

   For general and adjacency-related TRILL security considerations, see
   [<a href="./rfc6325" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>] and [<a href="./rfc7177" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Adjacency"'>RFC7177</a>].

   Implementation of the features specified in this document adds two

   Each RBridge implementing the RECOMMENDED LSP resizing damping
   strategy specified in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> has an LSPresizeTime parameter that
   is an integer in the range of 0-65,535 and that defaults to 300.  It
   is the number of seconds for which an RBridge determines that Sz has
   increased before it will create any LSP or E-L1FS FS-LSP fragments.

   Each RBridge port on which the calculation and use of Lz are
   implemented has an originatingL1SNPBufferSize parameter that is an
   integer in the range of 1470-65,535.  This parameter defaults to the
   minimum of the size that the port can accommodate and the link-local
   IS-IS PDU size that the TRILL implementation can accommodate.
