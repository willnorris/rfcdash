Abstract

   The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic
   algorithms in order to provide security services.  The Encapsulating
   Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication Header (AH) provide two
   mechanisms for protecting data being sent over an IPsec Security
   Association (SA).  To ensure interoperability between disparate
   implementations, it is necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-
   implement algorithms to ensure that there is at least one algorithm
   that all implementations will have available.  This document defines
   the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH
   as well as specifying algorithms that should be implemented because
   they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication
   Header (AH) provide two mechanisms for protecting data being sent
   over an IPsec Security Association (SA) [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>], [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>].  To
   ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is
   necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to
   ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations
   will have available.  This document defines the current set of
   mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH as well as
   specifying algorithms that should be implemented because they may be
   promoted to mandatory at some future time.

   The nature of cryptography is that new algorithms surface
   continuously and existing algorithms are continuously attacked.  An
   algorithm believed to be strong today may be demonstrated to be weak
   tomorrow.  Given this, the choice of mandatory-to-implement algorithm
   should be conservative so as to minimize the likelihood of it being
   compromised quickly.  Thought should also be given to performance
   considerations as many uses of IPsec will be in environments where
   performance is a concern.

   Finally, we need to recognize that the mandatory-to-implement
   algorithm(s) may need to change over time to adapt to the changing
   world.  For this reason, the selection of mandatory-to-implement
   algorithms is not included in the main IPsec, ESP, or AH
   specifications.  It is instead placed in this document.  As the
   choice of algorithm changes, only this document should need to be
   updated.

   Ideally, the mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should
   already be available in most implementations of IPsec by the time it
   is made mandatory.  To facilitate this, we will attempt to identify
   such algorithms (as they are known today) in this document.  There is
   no guarantee that the algorithms that we (today) believe may be
   mandatory in the future will in fact become so.  All algorithms known
   today are subject to cryptographic attack and may be broken in the
   future.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   We define some additional terms here:

         SHOULD+  This term means the same as SHOULD.  However, it is
                  likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be
                  promoted at some future time to be a MUST.

         SHOULD-  This term means the same as SHOULD.  However, it is
                  likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD- will be
                  deprecated to a MAY or worse in a future version of
                  this document.

         MUST-    This term means the same as MUST.  However, we
                  expect that at some point in the future this algorithm
                  will no longer be a MUST.


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Algorithm%20Selection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Algorithm Selection</span>

   For IPsec implementations to interoperate, they must support one or
   more security algorithms in common.  This section specifies the
   security algorithm implementation requirements for standards-
   conformant ESP and AH implementations.  The security algorithms
   actually used for any particular ESP or AH security association are
   determined by a negotiation mechanism, such as the Internet Key
   Exchange (IKE [<a href="./rfc2409" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>RFC2409</a>], [<a href="./rfc4306" title='"Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol"'>RFC4306</a>]) or pre-establishment.

   Of course, additional standard and proprietary algorithms beyond
   those listed below can be implemented.

   The implementation conformance requirements for security algorithms
   for ESP are given in the tables below.  See <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> for definitions
   of the values in the "Requirement" column.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.1.%20%20ESP%20Encryption%20and%20Authentication%20Algorithms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" id="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  ESP Encryption and Authentication Algorithms</span>

   These tables list encryption and authentication algorithms for the
   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol.

        Requirement    Authentication Algorithm (notes)
        -----------    -----------------------------
        MUST           HMAC-SHA1-96 [<a href="./rfc2404" title='"The Use of HMAC-SHA-1-96 within ESP and AH"'>RFC2404</a>] (3)

        MAY            NULL (1)
        MAY            HMAC-MD5-96 [<a href="./rfc2403" title='"The Use of HMAC-MD5-96 within ESP and AH"'>RFC2403</a>] (4)

   Notes:

      (1) Since ESP encryption is optional, support for the "NULL"
      algorithm is required to maintain consistency with the way
      services are negotiated.  Note that while authentication and
      encryption can each be "NULL", they MUST NOT both be "NULL"
      [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>].

      (2) DES, with its small key size and publicly demonstrated and
      open-design special-purpose cracking hardware, is of questionable
      security for general use.

      (3) Weaknesses have become apparent in SHA-1 [<a href="#ref-SHA1-COLL" title='"Update on SHA-1"'>SHA1-COLL</a>]; however,
      these should not affect the use of SHA1 with HMAC.

      (4) Weaknesses have become apparent in MD5 [<a href="#ref-MD5-COLL" title='"Finding MD5 Collisions - a Toy For a Notebook"'>MD5-COLL</a>]; however,
      these should not affect the use of MD5 with HMAC.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.2.%20%20ESP%20Combined%20Mode%20Algorithms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2" id="section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  ESP Combined Mode Algorithms</span>

   As specified in [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>], combined mode algorithms are supported
   that provide both confidentiality and authentication services.
   Support of such algorithms will require proper structuring of ESP
   implementations.  Under many circumstances, combined mode algorithms
   provide significant efficiency and throughput advantages.  Although
   there are no suggested or required combined algorithms at this time,
   AES-CCM [<a href="./rfc4309" title='"Using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) CCM Mode with IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4309</a>] and AES-GCM [<a href="./rfc4106" title='"The Use of Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) in IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4106</a>] are of interest.  AES-CCM has
   been adopted as the preferred mode in IEEE 802.11 [<a href="#ref-802.11i" title='"LAN/MAN Specific Requirements Part 11: Wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications"'>802.11i</a>], and AES-
   GCM has been adopted as the preferred mode in IEEE 802.1ae [<a href="#ref-802.1ae" title='"Media Access Control (MAC) Security"'>802.1ae</a>].

   The implementation conformance requirements for security algorithms
   for AH are given below.  See <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> for definitions of the values
   in the "Requirement" column.  As you would suspect, all of these
   algorithms are authentication algorithms.

   The security of cryptography-based systems depends on both the
   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of
   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on
   the engineering and administration of the protocol used by the system
   to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the
   security of the overall system.

   This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
   algorithms for the use of ESP and AH, specifically with the selection
   of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.  The algorithms identified in
   this document as "MUST implement" or "SHOULD implement" are not known
   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far
   leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the
   foreseeable future.  However, this is not necessarily forever.  We
   would therefore expect that new revisions of this document will be
   issued from time to time that reflect the current best practice in
   this area.

   [<a id="ref-RFC2402">RFC2402</a>] and [<a href="./rfc2406" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC2406</a>] defined the IPsec Authentication Header and
   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload.  Each specified the
   implementation requirements for cryptographic algorithms for their
   respective protocols.  They have now been replaced with [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>], which do not specify cryptographic algorithm
   implementation requirements, and this document, which specifies such
   requirements for both [<a href="./rfc4302" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC4302</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4303" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4303</a>].

   The implementation requirements are compared below:

      Old    Old             New
      Req.   RFC(s)       Requirement     Algorithm (notes)
      ----   ------       -----------     -----------------

   Note:

      (1) The IETF deprecated the use of single DES years ago and has
      not included it in any new standard for some time (see IESG note
      on the first page of [<a href="./rfc2407" title='"The Internet IP Security Domain of Interpretation for ISAKMP"'>RFC2407</a>]).  [<a href="./rfc4305" title='"Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH)"'>RFC4305</a>] represented the first
      standards-track recognition of that deprecation by specifying that
      implementations SHOULD NOT provide single DES.  The US Government
      National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has formally
      recognized the weakness of single DES by a notice published
      [<a href="#ref-DES-WDRAW" title='"Announcing Proposed Withdrawal of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Request for Comments"'>DES-WDRAW</a>] proposing to withdraw it as a US Government Standard.
      Triple DES remains approved by both the IETF and NIST.

   for the support for the NULL Authentication Algorithm making the

   document consistent with [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>].  Text for SHA-1 collision attacks
   as well as the future use of AES-GCM and AES-CCM is added.
