Abstract

   With Wi-Fi emerging as a crucial access network for mobile service
   providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly
   available in 3G and 4G networks in Wi-Fi access networks as well.
   Such functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple
   Packet Data Network (PDN) connections, and seamless mobility between
   Wi-Fi and 3G/4G networks.

   The EAP Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA), and EAP-AKA',
   protocol is required for mobile devices to access the mobile Evolved
   Packet Core (EPC) via Wi-Fi networks.  This document defines a few
   new EAP attributes to enable the above-mentioned functions in such
   networks.  The attributes are exchanged between a client (such as a
   Mobile Node (MN)) and its network counterpart (such as an
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server) in the
   service provider's infrastructure.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Wi-Fi has emerged as a "trusted" access technology for mobile service
   providers; see [<a href="#ref-EPC2" title='"Architecture enhancements for non-3GPP accesses"'>EPC2</a>] for reference to the 3rd Generation Partnership
   Project (3GPP) description of "trusted" access.  Advances in IEEE
   802.11u [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.11u">IEEE802.11u</a>] and "HotSpot 2.0" [<a href="#ref-hs20" title='"Hotspot 2.0 (Release 2) Technical Specification Package v1.0.0"'>hs20</a>] have enabled seamless
   roaming, in which a Mobile Node can select and connect to a Wi-Fi
   access network just as it would roam into a cellular network.  It has
   thus become important to provide certain functions in Wi-Fi that are
   commonly supported in licensed-spectrum networks such as 3G and 4G
   networks.  This document specifies a few new EAP attributes for an MN
   to interact with the network to support some of these functions (see
   below).  These new attributes serve as a trigger for Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 network nodes to undertake the relevant mobility operations.
   For instance, when the MN requests a new IP session (i.e., a new APN
   in 3GPP) and the network agrees, the corresponding attribute (defined
   below) acts as a trigger for the Mobile Anchor Gateway (MAG) to
   initiate a new mobility session with the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA).
   This document refers to [<a href="./rfc6459" title='"IPv6 in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Evolved Packet System (EPS)"'>RFC6459</a>] for the basic definitions of mobile
   network terminology (such as APN) used here.

   The 3GPP networks support many functions that are not commonly
   implemented in a Wi-Fi network.  This document defines EAP attributes
   that enable the following functions in Wi-Fi access networks using
   EAP-AKA [<a href="./rfc4187" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for 3rd Generation Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA)"'>RFC4187</a>] and EAP-AKA' [<a href="./rfc5448" title="&quot;Improved Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for 3rd Generation Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA')&quot;">RFC5448</a>]:

      o APN Selection

      o Multiple APN Connectivity

      o Wi-Fi to 3G/4G (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network
      (UTRAN) / Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN)) mobility

   The attributes defined here are exchanged between the MN and the EAP
   server, typically realized as part of the AAA server infrastructure
   in a service provider's infrastructure.  In particular, the Wi-Fi
   access network simply conveys the attributes to the service
   provider's core network where the EAP processing takes place [<a href="#ref-EPC" title='"General Packet Radio Service (GPRS); enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access"'>EPC</a>].
   Since these attributes share the same IANA registry, the methods are
   applicable to EAP-AKA, EAP-AKA', EAP Subscriber Identity Modules
   (EAP-SIM) [<a href="./rfc4186" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Subscriber Identity Modules (EAP-SIM)"'>RFC4186</a>], and with appropriate extensions, are possibly
   applicable for other EAP methods as well.  In addition to the trusted
   Wi-Fi access networks, the attributes are applicable to any trusted
   "non-3GPP" access network that uses the EAP methods and provides
   connectivity to the mobile EPC, which provides connectivity for 3G,
   4G, and other non-3GPP access networks [<a href="#ref-EPC2" title='"Architecture enhancements for non-3GPP accesses"'>EPC2</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7458">RFC 7458</a>       EAP Attributes for Wi-Fi - EPC Integration  February 2015</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20APN%20Selection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  APN Selection</span>

   The 3GPP networks support the concept of an APN.  This is defined in
   [<a href="#ref-GPRS" title='"General Packet Radio Service (GPRS); Service description, Stage 2"'>GPRS</a>].  Each APN is an independent IP network with its own set of IP
   services.  When the MN attaches to the network, it may select a
   specific APN to receive desired services.  For example, to receive
   generic Internet services, a user device may select APN "Internet";
   and to receive IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS) voice services, it may
   select APN "IMSvoice".

   In a Wi-Fi access scenario, an MN needs a way of sending the desired
   APN name to the network.  This document specifies a new attribute to
   propagate the APN information via EAP.  The agreed APN is necessary
   for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 MAG to initiate a new session with the LMA.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20Multiple%20APN%20Connectivity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Multiple APN Connectivity</span>

   As an extension of APN Selection, an MN may choose to connect to
   multiple IP networks simultaneously.  3GPP provides this feature via
   additional Packet Data Protocol (PDP) contexts or additional Packet
   Data Network (PDN) connections and defines the corresponding set of
   signaling procedures.  In a trusted Wi-Fi network, an MN connects to
   the first APN via DHCPv4 or IPv6 Router Solicitation.  This document
   specifies an attribute that indicates the MN's capability to support
   multiple APN connectivity.  The specific connectivity types are also
   necessary for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.3.%20%20Wi-Fi%20to%20E-UTRAN%20Mobility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" id="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Wi-Fi to E-UTRAN Mobility</span>

   When operating in a multiaccess network, an MN may want to gracefully
   handover its IP attachment from one access network to another.  For
   instance, an MN connected to a 3GPP E-UTRAN network may choose to
   move its connectivity to a trusted Wi-Fi network.  Alternatively, the
   MN may choose to connect using both access technologies
   simultaneously and maintain two independent IP attachments.  To
   implement these scenarios, the MN needs a way to correlate the UTRAN/
   E-UTRAN session with the new Wi-Fi session.  This document specifies
   an attribute to propagate E-UTRAN session identification to the
   network via EAP.  This helps the network to correlate the sessions
   between the two Radio Access Network (RAN) technologies and thus
   helps the overall handover process.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   EAP is defined as a generic protocol in [<a href="./rfc3748" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)"'>RFC3748</a>].  EAP, combined
   with one of the payload protocols such as EAP-AKA' [<a href="./rfc5448" title="&quot;Improved Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for 3rd Generation Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA')&quot;">RFC5448</a>] can
   accomplish several things in a network:

   o  Establish the identity of the user (MN) to the network.

   o  Authenticate the user during the first attach with the help of an
      authentication center that securely maintains the user
      credentials.  This process is called "EAP Authentication".

   o  Re-authenticate the user periodically, but without the overhead of
      a round-trip to the authentication center.  This process is called
      "EAP Fast Re-Authentication".

   This document makes use of the EAP Authentication procedure.  The use
   of the EAP Fast Re-Authentication procedure is for further study.
   Both the EAP Authentication and EAP Fast Re-Authentication procedures
   are specified for trusted access network use in 3GPP[TS-33.402].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20IEEE%20802.11%20Authentication%20Using%20EAP%20over%20802.1X"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  IEEE 802.11 Authentication Using EAP over 802.1X</span>

   In a Wi-Fi network, EAP is carried over the IEEE 802.1X
   Authentication protocol.  The IEEE 802.1X Authentication is a
   transparent, payload-unaware mechanism to carry the authentication
   messages between the MN and the Wi-Fi network elements.

   EAP, on the other hand, has multiple purposes.  Apart from its core
   functions of communicating an MN's credentials to the network and
   proving the MN's identity, it also allows the MN to send arbitrary
   information elements to help establish the MN's IP session in the
   network.  Figure 1 shows an example of end-to-end EAP flow in the
   context of an IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi network.  We first define the
   terminology:

   o  MN: Mobile Node

   o  WAN: Wi-Fi Access Node, typically consisting of Wi-Fi Access Point
      and Wi-Fi Controller.  The CAPWAP [<a href="./rfc5415" title='"Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Protocol Specification"'>RFC5415</a>] protocol allows these
      functions to be realized in separate physical nodes or in a single
      node.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [<a href="./rfc5213" title='"Proxy Mobile IPv6"'>RFC5213</a>] network, the MAG
      functionality is located in the WAN, either in the Wi-Fi Access
      Point or in the Wi-Fi Controller.

   o  AAA: The infrastructure node supporting the AAA server with the
      EAP methods (AKA, AKA', EAP-SIM).  The endpoints of the EAP method
      are the MN and the AAA server.

   o  IPCN: IP Core Network.  This includes the PMIPv6 LMA function.

                     Figure 1: Example EAP Deployment

   1.   An MN detects a beacon from a WAP in the vicinity.

   2.   The MN probes the WAP to determine suitability to attach (Verify
        Service Set Identifier (SSID) list, authentication type, and so
        on).

   3.   The MN initiates the IEEE 802.11 Authentication with the Wi-Fi
        network.  In Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) / WPA2 mode, this is
        an open authentication without any security credential
        verification.

   4.   The MN initiates 802.11 Association with the Wi-Fi network.

   5.   The Wi-Fi network initiates 802.1X/EAP Authentication procedures
        by sending EAP Request/Identity.

   6.   The MN responds with its permanent or temporary identity.

   7.   The Wi-Fi network challenges the MN to prove its identity by
        sending EAP Request/AKA-Challenge.

   8.   The MN calculates the security digest and responds with EAP
        Response/AKA-Challenge.

   9.   If the authentication is successful, the Wi-Fi network responds
        to the MN with EAP Success.

   10.  An end-to-end data path is available for the MN to start IP
        layer communication (DHCPv4, IPv6 Router Solicitation, and so
        on).

   attribute in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge to indicate the desired
   APN identity for the first PDN connection.

   If the MN does not include the AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID attribute in the
   EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge, the network may select an APN by other
   means.  This selection mechanism is outside the scope of this
   document.

   An MN includes the AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_REQ attribute to indicate
   single or multiple PDN capability.  In addition, a Sub type in the
   attribute indicates IPv4, IPv6, or dual IPv4v6 PDN connectivity.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Connectivity%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Connectivity Type</span>

   An MN indicates its preference for connectivity using the
   AT_CONNECTIVITY_TYPE attribute in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge
   message.  The preference indicates whether the MN wishes connectivity
   to the Evolved Packet Core (the so-called "EPC PDN connectivity") or
   Internet Offload (termed as "Non-Seamless Wireless Offload").

   The network makes its decision and replies with the same attribute in
   the EAP Success message.

   When a multiaccess MN enters a Wi-Fi network, the following
   parameters are applicable in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge for IP
   session continuity from UTRAN/E-UTRAN.

   o  AT_HANDOVER_INDICATION: This attribute indicates to the network
      that the MN intends to continue the IP session from UTRAN/E-UTRAN.
      If a previous session can be located, the network will honor this
      request by connecting the Wi-Fi access to the existing IP session.

   o  AT_HANDOVER_SESSION_ID: An MN MAY use this attribute to identify
      the session on UTRAN/E-UTRAN.  If used, this attribute contains
      Packet Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (P-TMSI) if the
      previous session was on UTRAN; if the previous session was on
      E-UTRAN, it contains Mobile Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity
      (M-TMSI).  This attribute helps the network correlate the Wi-Fi
      session to an existing UTRAN/E-UTRAN session.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.4.%20%20MN%20Serial%20ID"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" id="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  MN Serial ID</span>

   The MN_SERIAL_ID attribute defines an MN's serial number, including
   International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and International
   Mobile Equipment Identity Software Version (IMEISV).  The IMEI (or
   IMEISV) is used for ensuring a legitimate (and not a stolen) device
   is in use.  As with the others, this attribute is exchanged with the
   service provider's AAA server.  The MN_SERIAL_ID MUST NOT be
   propagated further by the AAA server to any other node.

   The format for the new attributes follows that in [<a href="./rfc4187" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for 3rd Generation Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA)"'>RFC4187</a>].  Note
   that the Length field value is inclusive of the first two bytes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID</span>

   The AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID attribute identifies the virtual IP network
   to which the MN intends to attach.  The implementation of the virtual
   network on the core network side is technology specific.  For
   instance, in a 3GPP network, the virtual network is implemented based
   on the 3GPP APN primitive.

   This attribute SHOULD be included in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge
   message.

   Virtual Network Id:

   An arbitrary octet string that identifies a virtual network in the
   access technology to which the MN is attaching.  For instance, in
   3GPP E-UTRAN, this could be an APN.  See [<a href="#ref-TS-23.003">TS-23.003</a>] for encoding of

   Handover Type:

   o  0 - The MN has no intention of handing over an existing IP
      session, i.e., the MN is requesting an independent IP session with
      the Wi-Fi network without disrupting the IP session with the
      UTRAN/E-UTRAN.  In this case, no Session Id (<a href="#section-5.5">Section 5.5</a>) is
      included.

   o  1 - The MN intends to handover an existing IP session.  In this
      case, MN MAY include a Session Id (<a href="#section-5.5">Section 5.5</a>) to correlate this
      Wi-Fi session with a UTRAN/E-UTRAN session.

   When an MN intends to handover an earlier IP session to the current
   access network, it may propagate a session identity that can help
   identify the previous session from UTRAN/E-UTRAN that the MN intends
   to handover.  This attribute is defined as a generic octet string.
   The MN MAY include an E-UTRAN Globally Unique Temporary User
   Equipment Identity (GUTI) if the previous session was an E-UTRAN
   session.  If the previous session was a UTRAN session, the MN MAY
   include a UTRAN Global Radio Network Controller (RNC) ID (Mobile
   Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), RNC ID) and P-TMSI
   concatenated as an octet string.

   This attribute SHOULD be included in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge
   message.

   include the attribute in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge message.  If
   the MN sends the attribute, it MUST be contained within an
   AT_ENCR_DATA attribute.  An MN MUST NOT provide the attribute unless
   it receives the request from a network authenticated via EAP/AKA.

   An AT_MN_SERIAL_ID attribute MUST only be used with methods that can
   provide mutual (network and device) authentication, such as AKA,
   AKA', and EAP-SIM.

   This document defines new EAP attributes to extend the capability of
   the EAP-AKA protocol as specified in <a href="./rfc4187#section-8.2">Section 8.2 of [RFC4187]</a>.  The
   attributes are passed between an MN and a AAA server in provider-
   controlled, trusted Wi-Fi networks, where the Wi-Fi access network is
   a relay between the MN and the AAA server.  The document does not
   specify any new messages or options to the EAP-AKA protocol.

   The attributes defined here are fields that are used in existing 3G

   Wi-Fi access that is connected to the same core infrastructure as the
   3G and 4G access, a similar model is followed here with the EAP-AKA
   (or EAP-AKA', EAP-SIM) authentication.  In doing so, processing these
   attributes, security-wise, is no worse than that in existing 3G and
   4G mobile networks.

   The attributes inherit the security protection (integrity, replay,
   and confidentiality) provided by the parameters in the AKA(') or SIM
   methods; see <a href="./rfc4187#section-12.6">Section 12.6 in [RFC4187]</a>.  Furthermore, <a href="./rfc4187">RFC 4187</a>
   requires attributes exchanged in EAP-Request/AKA-Identity or
   EAP-Response/AKA-Identity to be integrity-protected with
   AT_CHECKCODE; see <a href="./rfc4187#section-8.2">Section 8.2 in [RFC4187]</a>.  This requirement applies
   to the AT_CONNECTIVITY_TYPE and AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_REQ attributes
   defined in this document.

   The AT_MN_SERIAL_ID attribute MUST have confidentiality protection
   provided by the AKA(') or EAP-SIM methods beyond the secure transport
   (such as private leased lines, VPN, etc.) deployed by the provider of
   the trusted Wi-Fi service.

   Use of identifiers such as IMEI could have privacy implications,
   wherein devices can be profiled and tracked.  With additional
   information, this could also lead to profiling of user's network
   access patterns.  Implementers should consult [<a href="#ref-hotos-2011">hotos-2011</a>], and the
   references therein, for a broader discussion and possible mitigation
   methods on the subject.

   1, starting from 1.  New assignments in this registry are made with
   the Specification Required policy [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].

   The IANA Designated Expert should review the requirements for new
   assignments based on factors including, but not limited to, the
   source of request (e.g., standards bodies), deployment needs (e.g.,
   industry consortium, operator community), and experimental needs
   (e.g., academia, industrial labs).  A document outlining the purpose
   of new assignments should accompany the request.  Such a document
   could be a standards document or a research project description.  The
   Designated Expert should consider that there is sufficient evidence
   of potential usage both on the endpoints (e.g., Mobile Devices, etc.)
   and the infrastructure (e.g., AAA servers, gateways, etc.)

   The following fields have been assigned:

   o  Virt-Net-Req Type (<a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>): 1

   o  Virt-Net-Req Sub type (<a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>): 2

   o  Connectivity Type (<a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>): 3

   o  Access Technology (<a href="#section-5.5">Section 5.5</a>): 4

   o  Serial ID Type (<a href="#section-5.6">Section 5.6</a>): 5
