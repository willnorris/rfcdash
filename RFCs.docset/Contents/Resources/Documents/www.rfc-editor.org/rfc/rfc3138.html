Abstract

   This memo provides describes the mapping of the GLOP addresses
   corresponding to the private AS space.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc2770">RFC 2770</a> [<a href="./rfc2770" title='"GLOP Addressing in 233/8"'>RFC2770</a>] describes an experimental policy for use of the
   class D address space using 233/8.  The technique described there
   maps 16 bits of Autonomous System number (AS) into the middle two
   octets of 233/8 to yield a /24.  While this technique has been
   successful, the assignments are inefficient in those cases in which a
   /24 is too small or the user doesn't have its own AS.

   <a href="./rfc1930">RFC 1930</a> [<a href="./rfc1930" title='"Guidelines for creation, selection, and registration of an Autonomous System (AS)"'>RFC1930</a>] defines the private AS space to be 64512 through
   65535.  This memo expands on <a href="./rfc2770">RFC 2770</a> to allow routing registries to
   assign multicast addresses from the GLOP space corresponding to the
   <a href="./rfc1930">RFC 1930</a> private AS space.  This space will be referred to as the
   EGLOP (Extended GLOP) address space.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Overview</span>

   <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses">http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses</a> defines a
   mechanism for assignment of multicast addresses that are generally
   for use in network control applications.  It is envisioned that those
   addresses assigned from the EGLOP space (233.252.0.0 -
   233.255.255.255) will be used by applications that cannot use
   Administratively Scoped Addressing [<a href="./rfc2365" title='"Administratively Scoped IP Multicast"'>RFC2365</a>], GLOP Addressing
   [<a href="./rfc2770" title='"GLOP Addressing in 233/8"'>RFC2770</a>], or Source Specific Multicast (Source Specific Multicast,
   or SSM, is an extension of IP Multicast in which traffic is forwarded
   to receivers from only those multicast sources for which the
   receivers have explicitly expressed interest, and is primarily
   targeted at one-to-many (broadcast) applications).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Assignment%20Criteria"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Assignment Criteria</span>

   Globally scoped IPv4 multicast addresses in the EGLOP space are
   assigned by a Regional Registry (RIR).  An applicant MUST, as per
   [<a href="#ref-IANA">IANA</a>], show that the request cannot be satisfied using
   Administratively Scoped addressing [<a href="./rfc2365" title='"Administratively Scoped IP Multicast"'>RFC2365</a>], GLOP addressing
   [<a href="./rfc2770" title='"GLOP Addressing in 233/8"'>RFC2770</a>], or SSM.  The fine-grained assignment policy is left to the
   assigning RIR.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   The assignment scheme described in this document does not effect the
   security properties of the the single source or any source multicast
   service models.
