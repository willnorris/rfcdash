          <span class="h1">Benchmarking Terminology for Protection Performance</span>

Abstract

   This document provides common terminology and metrics for
   benchmarking the performance of sub-IP layer protection mechanisms.
   The performance benchmarks are measured at the IP layer; protection
   may be provided at the sub-IP layer.  The benchmarks and terminology
   can be applied in methodology documents for different sub-IP layer
   protection mechanisms such as Automatic Protection Switching (APS),
   Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), Stateful High Availability
   (HA), and Multiprotocol Label Switching Fast Reroute (MPLS-FRR).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IP network layer provides route convergence to protect data
   traffic against planned and unplanned failures in the Internet.  Fast
   convergence times are critical to maintain reliable network
   connectivity and performance.  Convergence Events [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Terminology for Benchmarking Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence"'>6</a>] are recognized
   at the IP Layer so that Route Convergence [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Terminology for Benchmarking Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence"'>6</a>] occurs.  Technologies
   that function at sub-IP layers can be enabled to provide further
   protection of IP traffic by providing the failure recovery at the
   sub-IP layers so that the outage is not observed at the IP layer.
   Such sub-IP protection technologies include, but are not limited to,
   High Availability (HA) stateful failover, Virtual Router Redundancy
   Protocol (VRRP) [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) Version 3 for IPv4 and IPv6"'>8</a>], Automatic Link Protection (APS) for SONET/SDH,
   Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) for Ethernet, and Fast Reroute for
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-FRR) [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>9</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Scope</span>

   Benchmarking terminology was defined for IP-layer convergence in [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Terminology for Benchmarking Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence"'>6</a>].
   Different terminology and methodologies specific to benchmarking sub-
   IP layer protection mechanisms are required.  The metrics for
   benchmarking the performance of sub-IP protection mechanisms are
   measured at the IP layer, so that the results are always measured in
   reference to IP and independent of the specific protection mechanism
   being used.  The purpose of this document is to provide a single
   terminology for benchmarking sub-IP protection mechanisms.

   A common terminology for sub-IP layer protection mechanism
   benchmarking enables different implementations of a protection
   mechanism to be benchmarked and evaluated.  In addition,
   implementations of different protection mechanisms can be benchmarked
   and evaluated.  It is intended that there can exist unique
   methodology documents for each sub-IP protection mechanism based upon
   this common terminology document.  The terminology can be applied to
   methodologies that benchmark sub-IP protection mechanism performance
   with a single stream of traffic or multiple streams of traffic.  The
   traffic flow may be unidirectional or bidirectional as to be
   indicated in the methodology.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20General%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  General Model</span>

   The sequence of events to benchmark the performance of sub-IP
   protection mechanisms is as follows:

   1. Failover Event - Primary Path fails
   2. Failure Detection - Failover Event is detected
   3. Failover - Backup Path becomes the Working Path due to Failover
      Event
   4. Restoration - Primary Path recovers from a Failover Event
   5. Reversion (optional) - Primary Path becomes the Working Path

   These terms are further defined in this document.

   Figures 1 through 5 show models that MAY be used when benchmarking
   sub-IP protection mechanisms, which MUST use a Protection-Switching
   System that consists of a minimum of two Protection-Switching Nodes,
   an Ingress Node known as the Headend Node and an Egress Node known as
   the Merge Node.  The Protection-Switching System MUST include either
   a Primary Path and Backup Path, as shown in Figures 1 through 4, or a
   Primary Node and Standby Node, as shown in Figure 5.  A Protection-
   Switching System may provide link protection, node protection, path
   protection, local link protection, and high availability, as shown in
   Figures 1 through 5, respectively.  A Failover Event occurs along the
   Primary Path or at the Primary Node.  The Working Path is the Primary
   Path prior to the Failover Event and the Backup Path after the
   Failover Event.  A Tester is set outside the two paths or nodes as it
   sends and receives IP traffic along the Working Path.  The tester
   MUST record the IP packet sequence numbers, departure time, and
   arrival time so that the metrics of Failover Time, Additive Latency,
   Packet Reordering, Duplicate Packets, and Reversion Time can be
   measured.  The Tester may be a single device or a test system.  If
   Reversion is supported, then the Working Path is the Primary Path
   after Restoration (Failure Recovery) of the Primary Path.

   Link Protection, as shown in Figure 1, provides protection when a
   Failover Event occurs on the link between two nodes along the Primary
   Path.  Node Protection, as shown in Figure 2, provides protection
   when a Failover Event occurs at a Node along the Primary Path.  Path
   Protection, as shown in Figure 3, provides protection for link or
   node failures for multiple hops along the Primary Path.  Local Link
   Protection, as shown in Figure 4, provides sub-IP protection of a
   link between two nodes, without a Backup Node.  An example of such a
   sub-IP protection mechanism is SONET APS.  High Availability
   Protection, as shown in Figure 5, provides protection of a Primary
   Node with a redundant Standby Node.  State Control is provided
   between the Primary and Standby Nodes.  Failure of the Primary Node

   is detected at the sub-IP layer to force traffic to switch to the
   Standby Node, which has state maintained for zero or minimal packet
   loss.

   Some protection-switching technologies may use a series of steps that
   differ from the general model.  The specific differences SHOULD be
   highlighted in each technology-specific methodology.  Note that some
   protection-switching technologies are endowed with the ability to re-
   optimize the working path after a node or link failure.

   Definition:
      A unidirectional sequence of nodes &lt;R1, ..., Rn&gt; and links
      &lt;L12,... L(n-1)n&gt; with the following properties:

      a. R1 is the ingress node and forwards IP packets, which input
         into DUT/SUT, to R2 as sub-IP frames over link L12.

      b. Ri is a node which forwards data frames to R(i+1) over Link
         Li(i+1) for all i, 1&lt;i&lt;n-1, based on information in the sub-IP
         layer.

      c. Rn is the egress node, and it outputs sub-IP frames from
         DUT/SUT as IP packets.  L(n-1)n is the link between the R(n-1)
         and Rn.

   Discussion:
      The path is defined in the sub-IP layer in this document, unlike
      an IP path in <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>1</a>].  One path may be regarded as being
      equivalent to one IP link between two IP nodes, i.e., R1 and Rn.
      The two IP nodes may have multiple paths for protection.  A packet
      will travel on only one path between the nodes.  Packets belonging
      to a microflow [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>10</a>] will traverse one or more paths.  The path is
      unidirectional.  For example, the link between R1 and R2 in the
      direction from R1 to R2 is L12.  For traffic flowing in the
      reverse direction from R2 to R1, the link is L21.  Example paths
      are the SONET/SDH path and the label switched path for MPLS.

   Issues:
      "A bidirectional path", which transmits traffic in both directions
      along the same nodes, consists of two unidirectional paths.
      Therefore, the two unidirectional paths belonging to "one
      bidirectional path" will be treated independently when
      benchmarking for "a bidirectional path".

   Definition:
      A path that exists to carry data traffic only if a Failover Event
      occurs on a Primary Path.

   Discussion:
      The Backup Path shall become the Working Path upon a Failover
      Event.  A Path may have one or more Backup Paths.  A Backup Path
      may protect one or more Primary Paths.  There are various types of
      Backup Paths:

      a. dedicated recovery Backup Path (1+1) or (1:1), which has 100%
         redundancy for a specific ordinary path

      b. shared Backup Path (1:N), which is dedicated to the protection
         for more than one specific Primary Path

      c. associated shared Backup Path (M:N) for which a specific set of
         Backup Paths protects a specific set of more than one Primary
         Path

      A Backup Path may be signaled or unsignaled.  The Backup Path must
      be created prior to the Failover Event.  The Backup Path generally
      originates at the point of local repair (PLR) and terminates at a
      node along a primary path.

   Definition:
      A node capable of Failover along the Primary Path that is also the
      ingress node for the Backup Path to protect another node or link.

   Discussion:
      Any node along the Primary Path from the ingress node to the
      penultimate node may be a PLR.  The PLR may use a single Backup
      Path for protecting one or more Primary Paths.  There can be
      multiple PLRs along a Primary Path.  The PLR must be an ingress to
      a Backup Path.  The PLR can be any node along the Primary Path
      except the egress node of the Primary Path.  The PLR may
      simultaneously be a Headend Node when it is serving the role as
      ingress to the Primary Path and the Backup Path.  If the PLR is
      also the Headend Node, then the Backup Path is a Disjoint Path
      from the ingress to the Merge Node.

   Discussion:
      SRLG is considered the set of links to be avoided when the primary
      and secondary paths are considered disjoint.  The SRLG will fail

   Definition:
      A Protection-Switching System with a Primary Node protected by a
      Standby Node along the Primary Path.

   Discussion:
      Redundant Node Protection is provided by Protection-Switching
      Systems such as VRRP and HA.  The protection mechanisms occur at
      sub-IP layers to switch traffic from a Primary Node to Backup Node
      upon a Failover Event at the Primary Node.  Traffic continues to
      traverse the Primary Path through the Standby Node.  The failover
      may be stateful, in which the state information may be exchanged
      in-band or over an out-of-band State Control Interface.  The
      Standby Node may be active or passive.  Redundant Node Protection
      is shown in Figure 5.

      information between the Primary Node and Standby Node.

   Discussion:
      The State Control Interface may be used for Redundant Node
      Protection.  The State Control Interface should be out-of-band.
      It is possible to have Redundant Node Protection in which there is
      no state control or state control is provided in-band.  The State
      Control Interface between the Primary and Standby Node may be one
      or more hops.

      A DUT/SUT that is capable of Failure Detection and Failover from a
      Primary Path to a Backup Path or Standby Node when a Failover
      Event occurs.

   Discussion:
      The Protection-Switching System must include either a Primary Path
      and Backup Path, as shown in Figures 1 through 4, or a Primary
      Node and Standby Node, as shown in Figure 5.  The Backup Path may
      be a Standby Backup Path or a Dynamic Backup Path.  The

   Definition:
      The occurrence of a planned or unplanned action in the network
      that results in a change in the Path that data traffic traverses.

   Discussion:
      Failover Events include, but are not limited to, link failure and
      router failure.  Routing changes are considered Convergence Events
      [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Terminology for Benchmarking Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence"'>6</a>] and are not Failover Events.  This restricts Failover Events
      to sub-IP layers.  Failover may be at the PLR or at the ingress.
      If the failover is at the ingress, it is generally on a disjoint
      path from the ingress to egress.

      Failover Events may result from failures such as link failure or
      router failure.  The change in path after Failover may have a
      Backup Span of one or more nodes.  Failover Events are
      distinguished from routing changes and Convergence Events [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Terminology for Benchmarking Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence"'>6</a>] by
      the detection of the failure and subsequent protection switching
      at a sub-IP layer.  Failover occurs at a PLR or Primary Node.

   Definition:
      The process to identify at a sub-IP layer a Failover Event at a
      Primary Node or along the Primary Path.

   Discussion:
      Failure Detection occurs at the Primary Node or ingress node of
      the Primary Path.  Failure Detection occurs via a sub-IP mechanism
      such as detection of a link down event or timeout for receipt of a
      control packet.  A failure may be completely isolated.  A failure

   Definition:
      The process to switch data traffic from the protected Primary Path
      to the Backup Path upon Failure Detection of a Failover Event.

   Discussion:
      Failover to a Backup Path provides Link Protection, Node
      Protection, or Path Protection.  Failover is complete when Packet

   Definition:
      The state of failover recovery in which the Primary Path has

      Restoration must occur while the Backup Path is the Working Path.
      The Backup Path is maintained as the Working Path during

   Definition:
      The state of failover recovery in which the Primary Path has

      Protection-Switching Systems may or may not support Reversion.
      Reversion, if supported, must occur after Restoration.  Packet
      forwarding on the Primary Path resulting from Reversion may occur
      either fully or partially over the Primary Path.  A potential
      problem with Reversion is the discontinuity in end-to-end delay
      when the Forwarding Delays [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Terminology for Benchmarking Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms"'>4</a>] along the Primary Path and Backup
      Path are different, possibly causing Out-of-order Packets [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Terminology for Benchmarking Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms"'>4</a>],

   Definition:
      A redundant node to a Primary Node; it forwards traffic along the
      Primary Path upon Failure Detection of the Primary Node.

   Discussion:
      The Standby Node must be used for Protection-Switching Systems
      that provide Redundant Node Protection, such as VRRP and HA.  The
      Standby Node must provide protection along the same Primary Path.
      If the failover is to a Disjoint Path, then it is a Backup Node.
      The Standby Node may be configured for 1:1 or N:1 protection.

      The communication between the Primary Node and Standby Node may be
      in-band or across an out-of-band State Control Interface.  The
      Standby Node may be geographically dispersed from the Primary
      Node.  When geographically dispersed, the number of hops of
      separation may increase failover time.

      The Standby Node may be passive or active.  The Passive Standby
      Node is not offered traffic and does not forward traffic until
      Failure Detection of the Primary Node.  Upon Failure Detection of
      the Primary Node, traffic offered to the Primary Node is instead
      offered to the Passive Standby Node.  The Active Standby Node is
      offered traffic and forwards traffic along the Primary Path while
      the Primary Node is also active.  Upon Failure Detection of the
      Primary Node, traffic offered to the Primary Node is switched to
      the Active Standby Node.

   Definition:
      The amount of increased Forwarding Delay [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Terminology for Benchmarking Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms"'>4</a>] resulting from data
      traffic traversing the Backup Path instead of the Primary Path.

   Discussion:
      Additive Backup Delay is calculated using Equation 1 as shown
      below:

      (Equation 1)
      Additive Backup Delay =
                Forwarding Delay(Backup Path) -
                Forwarding Delay(Primary Path)

   Measurement Units:
      milliseconds

   Issues:
      Additive Backup Latency may be a negative result.  This is
      theoretically possible but could be indicative of a sub-optimum
      network configuration.

   The following Methods may be assessed on a per-flow basis using at
   least 16 flows spread over the routing table (using more flows is
   better).  Otherwise, the impact of a prefix-dependency in the
   implementation of a particular protection technology could be missed.
   However, the test designer must be aware of the number of packets per
   second sent to each prefix, as this establishes sampling of the path
   and the time resolution for measurement of Failover time on a per-
   flow basis.

   Definition:
      The method to calculate Failover Time (or Reversion Time) using a
      time scale on the Tester to measure the interval of Failover
      Packet Loss.

   Discussion:
      The Tester must provide statistics that show the duration of
      failure on a time scale based on occurrence of packet loss on a
      time scale.  This is indicated by the duration of non-zero packet
      loss.  The TBLM includes failure detection time and time for data
      traffic to begin traversing the Backup Path.  Failover Time and
      Reversion Time are calculated using the TBLM as shown in Equation
      2:

      (Equation 2)
          (Equation 2a)
          TBLM Failover Time = Time(Failover) - Time(Failover Event)

          (Equation 2b)
          TBLM Reversion Time = Time(Reversion) - Time(Restoration)

      Where

      Time(Failover) = Time on the tester at the receipt of the first
      unimpaired packet at egress node after the backup path became the
      working path

      Time(Failover Event) = Time on the tester at the receipt of the
      last unimpaired packet at egress node on the primary path before
      failure

   Measurement Units:
      milliseconds

   Issues:
      None.

   Discussion:
      PLBM includes failure detection time and time for data traffic to
      begin traversing the Backup Path.  Failover Time can be calculated
      using PLBM from the amount of Failover Packet Loss as shown below
      in Equation 3.  Note: If traffic is sent to more than 1
      destination, PLBM gives the average loss over the measured
      destinations.

      (Equation 3)
           (Equation 3a)
           PLBM Failover Time =
              (Number of packets lost / Offered Load rate) * 1000)

           (Equation 3b)
           PLBM Restoration Time =
              (Number of packets lost / Offered Load rate) * 1000)

           Units are packets/(packets/second) = seconds

   Measurement Units:
      milliseconds

   Issues:
      None.

   Definition:
      The method to calculate Failover Time (or Reversion Time) using a
      time scale to quantify the interval between unimpaired packets
      arriving in the test stream.

   Discussion:
      The purpose of this method is to quantify the duration of failure
      or reversion on a time scale based on the observation of
      unimpaired packets.  The TBM is calculated from Equation 2 with
      the values obtained from the timestamp in the packet payload,
      rather than from the Tester clock (which are used with the TBLM).

      Unimpaired packets are normal packets that are not lost,
      reordered, or duplicated.  A reordered packet is defined in
      Section 3.3 of [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Packet Reordering Metrics"'>7</a>].  A duplicate packet is defined in <a href="#section-3.3.5">Section</a>
      <a href="#section-3.3.5">3.3.5</a> of [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Terminology for Benchmarking Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms"'>4</a>].  Unimpaired packets may be detected by checking a

      sequence number in the payload, where the sequence number equals
      the next expected number for an unimpaired packet.  A sequence gap
      or sequence reversal indicates impaired packets.

      For calculating Failover Time, the TBM includes failure detection
      time and time for data traffic to begin traversing the Backup
      Path.  For calculating Reversion Time, the TBM includes Reversion
      Time and time for data traffic to begin traversing the Primary
      Path.

   Measurement Units:
      milliseconds

   Issues:
      None.

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.
