    I have several questions about the November 1973 ARPANET
topographical map:

    1.  AMES is 4-connected, i.e. four network connections will go down
        if the IMP fails.  Is there some aspiration that IMPs should be
        no more than three connected?

    2.  The seven IMPS in the Washington area are arranged into a loop.
        This guarantees that local communication can take place even if
        one connection fails, and is probably a worthwhile preparation
        for area routing.  On the other hand, for example, a break
        between MIT-IPC and MIT-MAC will require them to communicate
        through a 12-hop path through Washington.  This can be remedied
        by a short (inexpensive) connection between Harvard and Lincoln
        Labs.  Is there a plan to pull the Boston area, the San
        Francisco area, and the Los Angeles area into loops like the
        Washington area?
