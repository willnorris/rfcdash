Abstract

   This document describes a method to inform Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) clients when RTP packets are transmitted at a time
   other than their 'nominal' transmission time.  It also provides a
   mechanism to provide improved inter-arrival jitter reports from the
   clients, that take into account the reported transmission times.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   In the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>],
   network jitter calculations are based on the presumption that packets
   are transmitted essentially in accordance with their RTP timestamps.
   This must be true, of course, on average over longer time intervals,
   as the client is playing the packets out according to those
   timestamps.  However, for individual packets, this may not be true
   under some circumstances, such as:

   o  When the data rate of the stream is bursty, such as with video
      where I-frames may be significantly larger than P or B frames,
      traffic smoothing may need to be applied to maintain an
      appropriate data rate.

   o  In video that has forward-decode dependencies, frames may need to
      be transmitted in decoding order (the sequence number order) but
      with, of course, presentation timestamps.  Under these
      circumstances, the transmission time of a frame sent early in
      sequence does not correspond to its RTP timestamp.

   o  When retransmissions are sent, the retransmitted packet clearly
      has a different actual transmission time from the original, even
      though they share the same timestamp.

   Under some circumstances, it can help the receiver, or intermediate
   network elements, to know the actual transmission time of the packet.
   This RTP header extension element allows the communication of this
   information.

   The RTP specification does not define a transmission timestamp; nor
   does this specification.  This specification merely provides
   information on the relationship between the relative transmission
   times and relative RTP timestamps.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5450">RFC 5450</a>                RTP Transmission Offsets              March 2009</span>


   This specification allows the transmitter to indicate to the receiver
   any known variation between the spacing of transmission times and the
   spacing of RTP timestamps; any unreported variation introduced at or
   after the point of measurement of the transmission time will be
   treated as network jitter by the receiver.  The definition of the
   point where the transmission time is measured or defined is left to
   the transmitter, though it should, of course, be consistent from
   packet to packet.

   This information can also be of use to report the inter-arrival
   jitter caused by the network, excluding that introduced by the
   source.  A new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packet is defined to
   enable this reporting.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Transmission%20Offset"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Transmission Offset</span>

   Classically, a pair of RTP packets with timestamps S2 and S1 are
   transmitted with a time interval between them of (S2 - S1).  This
   specification permits sending an offset value O in each packet, O1
   and O2.  One characteristic of these offsets is that the original
   transmission interval can be deduced to be (S2 + O2) - (S1 + O1).

   More precisely, the offset is defined as follows (with the function
   RtoN converting from RTP to Network Time Protocol (NTP) times, and
   NtoR doing the reverse):

   o  Take an RTP stream that has a recent RTCP sender report relating
      RTP timestamp S0 to NTP timestamp N0;

   o  Consider a packet sent after that with RTP timestamp S1.
      Nominally, this is sent at N1 = (N0 + RtoN(S1 - S0));

   o  If it was actually sent at a different time, Na, then the offset
      value O1 is O1 = NtoR(Na - N1).

   The transmission time is signaled to the receiver in-band using the
   general mechanism for RTP header extensions [<a href="./rfc5285" title='"A General Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions"'>RFC5285</a>].  The payload
   of this extension (the transmitted value) is a 24-bit signed integer.
   When added to the RTP timestamp of the packet, it represents the
   "effective" RTP transmission time of the packet, on the RTP
   timescale.  The reported transmission time T1 of a packet with

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5450">RFC 5450</a>                RTP Transmission Offsets              March 2009</span>


   timestamp S1 and an offset of O1, from the above equations, is T1 =
   S1+O1 (though of course the transmission time values only have
   meaning when two or more are compared).

   The form of the transmission offset extension block is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  ID   | len=2 |              transmission offset              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The length field takes the value 2 to indicate that 3 bytes follow.

   The sign of the offset value depends greatly on the choice of the
   initial mapping of RTP to NTP times.  In general, without scanning a
   stream entirely it is not possible to ensure that this mapping would
   keep all the offsets positive; therefore, this specification allows
   negative values.

   Imagine a stream with the following timestamps and sizes (in KB):

   200    2 KB
   300    4 KB
   400    2 KB
   500   12 KB
   600   ...effective end of stream

   This has 20 KB spread over 400 time units, i.e., on average, 1 KB per
   20 time units.  We traffic-smooth this, and establish that given a
   transmission time of x for the first packet, we would transmit the
   following packets at the given intervals later:

   x + 000   2 KB
   x + 040   4 KB
   x + 120   2 KB
   x + 160  12 KB
   x + 400 ...effective end of stream

   The choice of x is essentially arbitrary: only relative values of
   timestamps matter.  Now, let's say I claim on the first packet that
   it went out *at* its RTP timestamp, i.e., with an offset of 0,
   meaning that x is 200.  Then the offset values are:

      0
    -60
    -80
   -140



<span class="grey">Singer &amp; Desineni           Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5450">RFC 5450</a>                RTP Transmission Offsets              March 2009</span>


   This is because in this case, I traffic-smooth by conceptually
   sending the small packets 'early'.  But since only the relative
   values are significant, it is just as valid to say x is 400,
   whereupon the offset values are:

   200
   140
   120
    60

   In a stream where this extension is not in effect (i.e., not declared
   or negotiated), the actual transmission offset is therefore unknown.
   However, when the extension is in effect for the stream, it MAY be
   omitted in those packets for which the offset is 0 (zero); that is,
   packets sent at their nominal time do not need this to be tagged with
   this extension.  Therefore, the implied transmission time of an un-
   tagged RTP packet depends on whether the extension is in effect for
   the stream (and therefore the transmission offset is 0) or not
   (whereupon the transmission offset is unknown).

   The jitter calculations performed by an RTP client MUST NOT use these
   transmission offsets.  In general, the sender (or intermediate
   network elements doing RTP analysis) cannot always know whether the
   offsets have been taken into account or not.  Therefore, for
   consistency, the jitter calculation should continue to operate on the
   'raw' reception times.  However, see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> on extended jitter
   reports, below.

   There are no extensionattributes defined for this extension.

   It is structurally possible to have more than one extension of the
   same type in a packet.  However, this extension is only defined for
   the source to report.  Intermediate network nodes that are not the
   source of the RTP session MUST NOT add this extension (whether or not
   it was previously present) and MUST NOT alter the existing
   transmission offset value in a packet, if the extension is already
   present.

   (Of course, it is clear that network elements that terminate an RTP
   flow, and are the source for a new RTP flow, can add a transmission
   offset extension header to the RTP packets of the new flow, if
   desired.)

   The inter-arrival jitter computed as defined in Section 6.4.1 of <a href="./rfc3550">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3550">3550</a> provides inter-arrival jitter reports that include any source-

       .                                                               .

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   If present, this RTCP packet must be placed after a receiver report
   (inside a compound RTCP packet), and MUST have the same value for RC
   (reception report count) as the receiver report.  The content is
   exactly that number of inter-arrival jitter calculations, calculated
   using the same formula as for sender and receiver reports, but taking
   into account the transmission offsets for the streams (if any).  That
   is, the formula uses the values T1=S1+O1, T2, etc., as defined above,
   instead of S1, S2, etc.  (If no transmission offset information is
   given for a stream, then the value of inter-arrival jitter in this
   packet and in the receiver report will be identical).

   Precisely, the replacement equation for the equation in the RTP
   specification is as follows, where Rj is the most recent arrival
   time:

   D(i,j) = (Rj - Ri) - ((Sj + Oj) - (Si + Oi))
          = (Rj - (Sj + Oj)) - (Ri - (Si + Oi))

   The URI for declaring this header extension in an extmap attribute is
   "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:toffset".  There is no additional setup
   information needed for this extension (no extensionattributes).

   The given transmission offsets are only informative, and it is hard
   to see security considerations from associating them with media
   streams.

   The underlying security considerations of [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] should be taken
   into account.

   It is possible that malicious senders (or systems tampering with
   packets in transit) could send offsets that are implausible, could
   confuse the receiver, or result in calculated jitter values that
   might mislead the sender.  Both the sender and receiver of the
   transmission offsets and jitter values should take care that such
   behavior does not result in denial of service or other problems.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   The RTCP packet type used for the adjusted inter-arrival jitter has
   been registered, in accordance with <a href="./rfc3550#section-15">Section 15 of [RFC3550]</a>.  IANA
   has added a new value to the RTCP Control Packet types subregistry of
   the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Parameters registry, according
   to the following data:
