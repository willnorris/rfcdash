<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction%20and%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction and Overview</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC2831">RFC2831</a>] defines how HTTP Digest Authentication [<a href="./rfc2617" title='"HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication"'>RFC2617</a>] can be
   used as a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [<a href="./rfc4422" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>]
   mechanism for any protocol that has a SASL profile.  It was intended
   both as an improvement over CRAM-MD5 [<a href="./rfc2195" title='"IMAP/POP AUTHorize Extension for Simple Challenge/Response"'>RFC2195</a>] and as a convenient
   way to support a single authentication mechanism for web, email, the
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), and other protocols.
   While it can be argued that it is an improvement over CRAM-MD5, many
   implementors commented that the additional complexity of DIGEST-MD5
   makes it difficult to implement fully and securely.

   Below is an incomplete list of problems with the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism
   as specified in [<a href="./rfc2831" title='"Using Digest Authentication as a SASL Mechanism"'>RFC2831</a>]:

   1.  The mechanism has too many options and modes.  Some of them are
       not well described and are not widely implemented.  For example,
       DIGEST-MD5 allows the "qop" directive to contain multiple values,
       but it also allows for multiple qop directives to be specified.
       The handling of multiple options is not specified, which results
       in minor interoperability problems.  Some implementations
       amalgamate multiple qop values into one, while others treat
       multiple qops as an error.  Another example is the use of an
       empty authorization identity.  In SASL, an empty authorization
       identity means that the client is willing to authorize as the
       authentication identity.  The document is not clear on whether



<span class="grey">Melnikov                      Informational                     [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-3"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6331">RFC 6331</a>              Moving DIGEST-MD5 to Historic            July 2011</span>


       the authzid must be omitted or if it can be specified with an
       empty value to convey this.  The requirement for backward
       compatibility with HTTP Digest means that the situation is even
       worse.  For example, DIGEST-MD5 requires all usernames/passwords
       that can be entirely represented in the ISO-8859-1 charset to be
       down converted from UTF-8 [<a href="./rfc3629" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>RFC3629</a>] to ISO-8859-1 [<a href="#ref-ISO-8859-1" title='"Information technology - 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets - Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1"'>ISO-8859-1</a>].
       Another example is the use of quoted strings.  Handling of
       characters that need escaping is not properly described, and the
       DIGEST-MD5 document has no examples to demonstrate correct
       behavior.

   2.  The DIGEST-MD5 document uses ABNF from <a href="./rfc822">RFC 822</a> [<a href="./rfc0822" title='"Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages"'>RFC0822</a>], which
       allows an extra construct and allows for "implied folding
       whitespace" to be inserted in many places.  The difference from a
       more common ABNF defined in [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] is confusing for some
       implementors.  As a result, many implementations do not accept
       folding whitespace in many places where it is allowed.

   3.  The DIGEST-MD5 document uses the concept of a "realm" to define a
       collection of accounts.  A DIGEST-MD5 server can support one or
       more realms.  The DIGEST-MD5 document does not provide any
       guidance on how realms should be named and, more importantly, how
       they can be entered in User Interfaces (UIs).  As a result, many
       DIGEST-MD5 clients have confusing UIs, do not allow users to
       enter a realm, and/or do not allow users to pick one of the
       server-supported realms.

   4.  Use of username in the inner hash is problematic.  The inner hash
       of DIGEST-MD5 is an MD5 hash of colon-separated username, realm,
       and password.  Implementations may choose to store inner hashes
       instead of clear text passwords.  This has some useful
       properties, such as protection from compromise of authentication
       databases containing the same username and password on other
       servers if a server with the username and password is
       compromised; however, this is rarely done in practice.  First,
       the inner hash is not compatible with widely deployed Unix
       password databases, and second, changing the username would
       invalidate the inner hash.

   5.  Description of DES/3DES [<a href="#ref-DES" title='"Data Encryption Standard (DES)"'>DES</a>] and RC4 security layers are
       inadequate to produce independently developed interoperable
       implementations.  In the DES/3DES case, this is partly a problem
       with existing DES APIs.

   6.  DIGEST-MD5 outer hash (the value of the "response" directive)
       does not protect the whole authentication exchange, which makes
       the mechanism vulnerable to "man-in-the-middle" (MITM) attacks,
       such as modification of the list of supported qops or ciphers.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6331">RFC 6331</a>              Moving DIGEST-MD5 to Historic            July 2011</span>


   7.  The following features are missing from DIGEST-MD5, making it
       insecure or unsuitable for use in protocols:

       A.  Channel bindings [<a href="./rfc5056" title='"On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels"'>RFC5056</a>].

       B.  Hash agility (i.e., no easy way to replace the MD5 hash
           function with another one).

       C.  Support for SASLPrep [<a href="./rfc4013" title='"SASLprep: Stringprep Profile for User Names and Passwords"'>RFC4013</a>] or any other type of Unicode
           character normalization of usernames and passwords.  The
           original DIGEST-MD5 document predates SASLPrep and does not
           recommend any Unicode character normalization.

   8.  The cryptographic primitives in DIGEST-MD5 are not up to today's
       standards, in particular:

       A.  The MD5 hash is sufficiently weak to make a brute force
           attack on DIGEST-MD5 easy with common hardware [<a href="./rfc6151" title='"Updated Security Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the HMAC- MD5 Algorithms"'>RFC6151</a>].

       B.  The RC4 algorithm is prone to attack when used as the
           security layer without discarding the initial key stream
           output [<a href="./rfc6229" title='"Test Vectors for the Stream Cipher RC4"'>RFC6229</a>].

       C.  The DES cipher for the security layer is considered insecure
           due to its small key space [<a href="./rfc3766" title='"Determining Strengths For Public Keys Used For Exchanging Symmetric Keys"'>RFC3766</a>].

   Note that most of the problems listed above are already present in
   the HTTP Digest authentication mechanism.

   Because DIGEST-MD5 is defined as an extensible mechanism, it is
   possible to fix most of the problems listed above.  However, this
   would increase implementation complexity of an already complex
   mechanism even further, so the effort is not worth the cost.  In
   addition, an implementation of a "fixed" DIGEST-MD5 specification
   would likely either not interoperate with any existing implementation
   of [<a href="./rfc2831" title='"Using Digest Authentication as a SASL Mechanism"'>RFC2831</a>] or would be vulnerable to various downgrade attacks.

   Note that despite DIGEST-MD5 seeing some deployment on the Internet,
   this specification recommends obsoleting DIGEST-MD5 because DIGEST-
   MD5, as implemented, is not a reasonable candidate for further
   standardization and should be deprecated in favor of one or more new
   password-based mechanisms currently being designed.

   The Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) family
   of SASL mechanisms [<a href="./rfc5802" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms"'>RFC5802</a>] has been developed to provide similar
   features as DIGEST-MD5 but with a better design.
