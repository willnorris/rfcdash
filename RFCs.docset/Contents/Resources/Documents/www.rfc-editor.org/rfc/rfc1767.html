   Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) provides a means of conducting
   structured transactions between trading partners.  The delivery
   mechanism for these types of transactions in a paper world has been
   the postal system, so it is to be expected that electronic mail would
   serve as a natural delivery mechanism for electronic transactions.
   This specification permits formatted electronic business interchanges
   to be encapsulated within MIME messages [<a href="#ref-Bore92" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>Bore92</a>].  For the
   specification effort, the basic building block from EDI is an
   interchange.

   This specification pertains only to the encapsulation of EDI objects
   within the MIME environment.  It intends no changes in those objects
   from the primary specifications that define the syntax and semantics
   of them.  EDI transactions take place through a variety of carriage
   and exchange mechanisms.  This specification adds to that repertoire,
   by permitting convenient carriage through Internet email.

   Since there are many different EDI specifications, the current
   document defines three distinct categories as three different MIME
   content-types.  One is Application/EDI-X12, indicating that the
   contents conform to the range of specifications developed through the
   X12 standards organization [<a href="#ref-X125" title="Washington D.C.: DISA [X126] ANSI X12.6 Applications Control Structures for Electronic Data Interchange">X125</a>, X126, X12V].  Another is
   Application/EDIFACT, indicating that the contents conform to the
   range of specifications developed by the United Nations Working Party
   4 Group of Experts 1 EDIFACT boards [<a href="#ref-FACT" title=" Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) - Application Level Syntax Rules (ISO 9735)">FACT</a>, <a href="#ref-FACV" title=" the element and segment dictionaries">FACV</a>].  The last category
   covers all other specifications; it is Application/EDI-consent.

   The Application/EDIFACT MIME body-part contains data as specified for
   electronic data interchange by [<a href="#ref-FACT" title=" Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) - Application Level Syntax Rules (ISO 9735)">FACT</a>, <a href="#ref-FACV" title=" the element and segment dictionaries">FACV</a>].

   Within EDIFACT, information is specified by:

   MIME type name:               Application

   MIME subtype name:            EDIFACT

   Required parameters:          none

   Optional parameters:          CHARSET, as defined for MIME

   Encoding considerations:      May need BASE64 or QUOTED-PRINTABLE
                                 transfer encoding

   Security considerations:      See separate section in the
                                 document.

   Published specification:      Contained in the following section.

   Rationale:                    The EDIFACT specifications are
                                 accepted standards for a class of
                                 inter-organization transactions;
                                 this permits their transmission

   Detail specific to MIME-based usage:

        This is a generic mechanism for sending any EDIFACT
        interchange.  The object is self-defining, in terms of
        indicating which specific EDI objects are included.  Most
        EDI data is textual, but special characters such as some
        delimiters may be non-printable ASCII or some data may be

        pure binary.  For EDI objects containing such data, the MIME
        transfer mechanism may need to encode the object in Content-
        Transfer-Encoding:quoted-printable or base64.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1767">RFC 1767</a>                      EDI in MIME                     March 1995</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20%20%20%20APPLICATION%2FEDI-CONSENT%20SPECIFICATION"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.     APPLICATION/EDI-CONSENT SPECIFICATION</span>

   The Application/EDI-consent MIME body-part contains data as specified
   for electronic data interchange with the consent of explicit,
   bilateral trading partner agreement exchanging the EDI-consent
   traffic.  As such, use of EDI-consent only provides a standard
   mechanism for "wrapping" the EDI objects but does not specify any of
   the details about those objects.

   Within MIME, EDI-consent information is specified by:

   MIME type name:               Application

   MIME subtype name:            EDI-consent

   Required parameters:          none

   Optional parameters:          CHARSET, as defined for MIME

   Encoding considerations:      May need BASE64 or QUOTED-PRINTABLE
                                 transfer encoding

   Security considerations:      See separate section in the
                                 document.

   Published specification:      Contained in the following section.

   Rationale:                    Existing practice for exchanging
                                 EDI includes a very wide range of
                                 specifications which are not part
                                 of the usual, accredited standards
                                 world.  Nevertheless, this traffic
                                 is substantial and well-
                                 established.  This content type
                                 provides a means of delimiting such
                                 content in a standard fashion.

   Contact-info:                 See Contact section, below.

   Detail specific to MIME-based usage:

        This is a generic mechanism for sending any EDI object
        explicitly agreed to by the trading partners.  X12 and
        EDIFACT object must be sent using their assigned MIME
        content type.  EDI-consent is for all other EDI objects, but
        only according to trading partner agreements between the
        originator and the recipient.   Most EDI data is textual,
        but special characters such as some delimiters may be non-

        printable ASCII or some data may be pure binary.  For EDI
        objects containing such data, the MIME transfer mechanism

   Actual use of EDI within MIME-based mechanisms requires attention to
   considerable detail.  This section is intended as an example of the
   gist of the formatting required to encapsulate EDI objects within
   Internet mail, using MIME.  To send a single EDIFACT interchange:

   To:  &lt;&lt;recipient organization EDI email address&gt;&gt;
   Subject:
   From: &lt;&lt;sending organization EDI email address&gt;&gt;
   Date:
   Mime-Version: 1.0
   Content-Type: Application/EDIFACT
   Content-Transfer-Encoding:  QUOTED-PRINTABLE

   &lt;&lt;standard EDIFACT Interchange goes here&gt;&gt;

   EDI transactions typically include sensitive data, so that
   transmission often needs to attend to authentication, data integrity,
   privacy, access control and non-repudiation concerns.  This
   specification permits transmission of such sensitive data via
   Internet mail and other services which support MIME object
   encapsulation.  For transmission of sensitive data, it is essential
   that appropriate security services, such as authentication, privacy
   and/or non-repudiation be provided.

   This specification does NOT, itself, provide any security-related
   mechanisms.  As needed and appropriate, such mechanisms MUST be
   added, either via Internet MIME-based security services or any other
   services which are appropriate to the user requirements, such as
   those provided by EDI-based standards.

   To assist those familiar with EDI but not with Internet electronic
   mail, this Appendix is provided as a very brief introduction,
   primarily to give pointers to the relevant specifications.  This
   section is in no way intended to be a thorough introduction.  An
   excellent introductory text is [<a href="#ref-Rose93" title='"The Internet Message: Closing the Book with Electronic Mail"'>Rose93</a>].

   Internet electronic mail follows the classic user agent/mail transfer
   agent model.  In this model, user software produces a standardized
   object which is transferred via standard exchange protocols.

   An Internet electronic mail object comprises a collection of headers,
   followed by a (possibly structured) body.  The headers specify such
   information as author and recipient addresses, subject summary,
   creation date, handling node names, and so on, and are defined by
   <a href="./rfc822">RFC822</a> and <a href="./rfc1123">RFC1123</a> [<a href="#ref-Croc82" title='"Standard for the Format of Internet Text Messages"'>Croc82</a>, <a href="#ref-Brad89" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support"'>Brad89</a>].  If the body is structured, it
   conforms to the rules of the Multipurpose Internet Message Exchange
   (MIME) [<a href="#ref-Bore92" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>Bore92</a>].  A structured body may have parts encoded in
   different text character sets, or even of entirely different types of
   data, such as voice or graphics.

   The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [<a href="#ref-Post82" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>Post82</a>, <a href="#ref-Brad89" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support"'>Brad89</a>] performs
   the primary task of message transmission.  User posting and delivery
   interactions, between the user agent and the message transfer agent,
   on the same machine, are not standardized and are platform-specific.

   An EDI-related use of Internet Mime email will have (at least) the
   following components:

       Business Program/Data base -&gt; EDI Translator -&gt;
       -&gt; MIME encapsulation -&gt; <a href="./rfc822">RFC822</a> packaging -&gt; mail
       submission -&gt;
       -&gt; SMTP relaying -&gt;
       -&gt; mail delivery -&gt; <a href="./rfc822">RFC822</a> &amp; Mime stripping -&gt;
       -&gt; EDI Translator -&gt; Business processing

   The first and last lines show components normal to all EDI activities,
   so that it is only the EDI "transmission" components that are replaced
   with Internet modules.
