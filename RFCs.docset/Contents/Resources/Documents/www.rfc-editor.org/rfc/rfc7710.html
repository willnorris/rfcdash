Captive-Portal Identification Using DHCP or Router Advertisements (RAs)

Abstract

   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
   (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a
   captive-portal mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do
   until the customer has authenticated.

   This document describes a DHCP option (and a Router Advertisement
   (RA) extension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of
   captive-portal device and that they will need to authenticate to get
   Internet access.  It is not a full solution to address all of the
   issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to
   be used in larger solutions.  The method of authenticating to and
   interacting with the captive portal is out of scope for this
   document.

   In many environments, users need to connect to a captive-portal
   device and agree to an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and/or provide
   billing information before they can access the Internet.  It is
   anticipated that the IETF will work on a more fully featured protocol
   at some point, to ease interaction with captive portals.  Regardless
   of how that protocol operates, it is expected that this document will
   provide needed functionality because the client will need to know
   when it is behind a captive portal and how to contact it.

   In order to present users with the payment or AUP pages, the captive-
   portal device has to intercept the user's connections and redirect
   the user to the captive portal, using methods that are very similar
   to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  As increasing focus is placed
   on security, and end nodes adopt a more secure stance, these
   interception techniques will become less effective and/or more
   intrusive.

   This document describes a DHCP ([<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>]) option (Captive-Portal)
   and an IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) ([<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>]) extension that
   inform clients that they are behind a captive-portal device and how
   to contact it.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Requirements%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20Captive-Portal%20Option"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The Captive-Portal Option</span>

   The Captive-Portal DHCP/RA option informs the client that it is
   behind a captive portal and provides the URI to access an
   authentication page.  This is primarily intended to improve the user
   experience by getting them to the captive portal faster; for the
   foreseeable future, captive portals will still need to implement the
   interception techniques to serve legacy clients, and clients will
   need to perform probing to detect captive portals.

   In order to support multiple "classes" of clients (e.g., IPv4 only,
   IPv6 only with DHCPv6 ([<a href="./rfc3315" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>]), IPv6 only with RA), the captive
   portal can provide the URI via multiple methods (IPv4 DHCP, IPv6
   DHCP, IPv6 RA).  The captive-portal operator should ensure that the
   URIs handed out are equivalent to reduce the chance of operational
   problems.  The maximum length of the URI that can be carried in IPv4
   DHCP is 255 bytes, so URIs longer than 255 bytes should not be used
   in IPv6 DHCP or IPv6 RA.

   In order to avoid having to perform DNS interception, the URI SHOULD
   contain an address literal.  If the captive portal allows the client
   to perform DNS requests to resolve the name, it is then acceptable
   for the URI to contain a DNS name.  The URI parameter is not null
   terminated.

   o  URI: The contact URI for the captive portal that the user should
      connect to.  For the reasons described above, the implementer
      might want to use an IP address literal instead of a DNS name.
      This should be padded with NULL (0x0) to make the total option

      bytes.

   This document defines two DHCP Captive-Portal options, one for IPv4
   and one for IPv6.  An option code (160) has been assigned from the
   "BOOTP Vendor Extensions and DHCP Options" registry
   (<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters">http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters</a>), as specified
   in [<a href="./rfc2939" title='"Procedures and IANA Guidelines for Definition of New DHCP Options and Message Types"'>RFC2939</a>].  Also, an option code (103) has been assigned from the
   "Option Codes" registry under DHCPv6 parameters
   (<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters">http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters</a>).

   IANA also has assigned an IPv6 RA Option Type code (37) from the
   "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" registry under ICMPv6
   parameters (<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters">http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters</a>).
   Thanks, IANA!

   An attacker with the ability to inject DHCP messages could include
   this option and so force users to contact an address of his choosing.
   As an attacker with this capability could simply list himself as the
   default gateway (and so intercept all the victim's traffic), this
   does not provide the attacker with significantly more capabilities,
   but because this document removes the need for interception, the
   attacker may have an easier time performing the attack.  As the
   operating systems and application that make use of this information
   know that they are connecting to a captive-portal device (as opposed
   to intercepted connections), they can render the page in a sandboxed
   environment and take other precautions, such as clearly labeling the
   page as untrusted.  The means of sandboxing and how the user
   interface presents this information are not covered in this document
   -- by their nature, those are implementation specific and best left
   to the application and user-interface designers.

   Devices and systems that automatically connect to an open network
   could potentially be tracked using the techniques described in this
   document (forcing the user to continually authenticate, or exposing
   their browser fingerprint).  However, similar tracking can already be
   performed with the standard captive-portal mechanisms, so this
   technique does not give the attackers more capabilities.

   Captive portals are increasingly hijacking TLS connections to force
   browsers to talk to the portal.  Providing the portal's URI via a
   DHCP or RA option is a cleaner technique and reduces user
   expectations of being hijacked; this may improve security by making
   users more reluctant to accept TLS hijacking, which can be performed
   from beyond the network associated with the captive portal.

   By simplifying the interaction with the captive-portal systems and
   doing away with the need for interception, we think that users will
   be less likely to disable useful security safeguards like DNSSEC
   validation, VPNs, etc.  In addition, because the system knows that it
   is behind a captive portal, it can know not to send cookies,
   credentials, etc.  By handing out a URI that is protected with TLS,
   the captive-portal operator can attempt to reassure the user that the
   captive portal is not malicious.
