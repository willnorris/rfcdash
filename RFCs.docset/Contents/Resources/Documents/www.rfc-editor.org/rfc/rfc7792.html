<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-G.694.1">G.694.1</a>] defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)
   frequency grids for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
   applications.  A frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies
   used to denote allowed nominal central frequencies that may be used
   for defining applications that utilize WDM transmission.  The channel
   spacing is the frequency spacing between two allowed nominal central
   frequencies.  All of the wavelengths on a fiber use different central
   frequencies and occupy a designated range of frequencies.

   Fixed-grid channel spacing is selected from 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz,
   100 GHz, and integer multiples of 100 GHz.  Additionally, [<a href="#ref-G.694.1" title='"Spectral grids for WDM applications: DWDM frequency grid"'>G.694.1</a>]
   defines "flexible grids", also known as "flexi-grid".  The terms
   "frequency slot" (i.e., the frequency range allocated to a specific
   channel and unavailable to other channels within a flexible grid) and
   "slot width" (i.e., the full width of a frequency slot in a flexible
   grid) are introduced in [<a href="#ref-G.694.1" title='"Spectral grids for WDM applications: DWDM frequency grid"'>G.694.1</a>] to define a flexible grid.

   [<a id="ref-RFC7698">RFC7698</a>] defines a framework and the associated control-plane
   requirements for the GMPLS-based [<a href="./rfc3945" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Architecture"'>RFC3945</a>] control of flexi-grid DWDM
   networks.

   [<a id="ref-RFC6163">RFC6163</a>] provides a framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element
   (PCE) control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs), and
   [<a href="./rfc7689" title='"Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks"'>RFC7689</a>] describes the requirements and protocol extensions for
   signaling to set up Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in WSONs.

   This document describes the additional requirements and protocol
   extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering
   (RSVP-TE) [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] to set up LSPs in networks that support the
   flexi-grid.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Requirements%20for%20Flexible-Grid%20Signaling"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Requirements for Flexible-Grid Signaling</span>

   The architecture for establishing LSPs in a flexi-grid network is
   described in [<a href="./rfc7698" title='"Framework and Requirements for GMPLS-Based Control of Flexi-Grid Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) Networks"'>RFC7698</a>].

   An optical-spectrum LSP occupies a specific frequency slot, i.e., a
   range of frequencies.  The process of computing a route and the
   allocation of a frequency slot is referred to as "Routing and
   Spectrum Assignment" (RSA).  [<a href="./rfc7698" title='"Framework and Requirements for GMPLS-Based Control of Flexi-Grid Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) Networks"'>RFC7698</a>] describes three architectural
   approaches to RSA: combined RSA, separated RSA, and distributed SA.
   The first two approaches are referred to as "centralized SA", because
   routing (i.e., path determination) and spectrum assignment (i.e.,
   selection of frequency slots) are both performed by a centralized
   entity prior to the signaling procedure.

   In the case of centralized SA, the assigned frequency slot is
   specified in the RSVP-TE Path message during LSP setup.  In the case
   of distributed SA, the slot width of the flexi-grid LSP is specified
   in the Path message, allowing the network elements to select the
   frequency slot to be used when they process the RSVP-TE messages.

   If the capability to switch or convert the whole optical spectrum
   allocated to an optical-spectrum LSP is not available at some nodes
   along the path of the LSP, the LSP is subject to the Optical
   "spectrum continuity constraint" as described in [<a href="./rfc7698" title='"Framework and Requirements for GMPLS-Based Control of Flexi-Grid Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) Networks"'>RFC7698</a>].

   The remainder of this section states the additional requirements for
   signaling in a flexi-grid network.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Slot%20Width"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Slot Width</span>

   The slot width is an end-to-end parameter representing how much
   frequency resource is requested for a flexi-grid LSP.  It is the
   equivalent of optical bandwidth, although the amount of bandwidth
   associated with a slot width will depend on the signal encoding.

   Different LSPs may request different amounts of frequency resource in
   flexible-grid networks, so the slot width MUST be carried in the
   signaling message during LSP establishment.  This enables the nodes
   along the LSP to know how much frequency resource has been requested
   (in a Path message) and how much has been allocated (by a
   Resv message) for the LSP.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7792">RFC 7792</a>         Flexi-Grid RSVP-TE Signaling Extensions      March 2016</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Frequency%20Slot"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Frequency Slot</span>

   The frequency slot information identifies which part of the frequency
   spectrum is allocated on each link for an LSP in a flexi-grid
   network.

   This information MUST be present in a Resv message to indicate,
   hop by hop, the central frequency of the allocated resource.  In
   combination with the slot width indicated in a Resv message (see
   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>), the central frequency carried in a Resv message
   identifies the resources reserved for the LSP (known as the
   frequency slot).

   The frequency slot can be represented by two parameters, as follows:

      Frequency slot = [(central frequency) - (slot width)/2] ~
                       [(central frequency) + (slot width)/2]

   As is common with other resource identifiers (i.e., labels) in GMPLS
   signaling, it must be possible for the head-end node, when sending a
   Path message, to suggest or require the central frequency to be used
   for the LSP.  Furthermore, for bidirectional LSPs, the Path message
   MUST be able to specify the central frequency to be used for
   reverse-direction traffic.

   As described in [<a href="#ref-G.694.1" title='"Spectral grids for WDM applications: DWDM frequency grid"'>G.694.1</a>], the allowed frequency slots for the
   flexible DWDM grid have a nominal central frequency (in THz),
   defined by:

      193.1 + n * 0.00625

      where n is zero or a positive or negative integer.

   The slot width (in GHz) is defined as:

      12.5 * m

      where m is a positive integer.

   It is possible that an implementation supports only a subset of the
   possible slot widths and central frequencies.  For example, an
   implementation can be built that is

   1. limited to have a nominal central frequency granularity of
      12.5 GHz, by only allowing values of n that are even, and

   2. further limited to only support slot widths of 25 GHz, by only
      allowing values of m that are even.

   This section defines the extensions to RSVP-TE signaling for GMPLS
   [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>] to support flexible-grid networks.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Traffic%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Traffic Parameters</span>

   In RSVP-TE, the SENDER_TSPEC object in the Path message indicates the
   requested resource reservation.  The FLOWSPEC object in the Resv
   message indicates the actual resource reservation.  As described in
   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>, the slot width represents how much frequency resource is
   requested for a flexi-grid LSP.  That is, it describes the end-to-end
   traffic profile of the LSP.  Therefore, the traffic parameters for a
   flexi-grid LSP encode the slot width.

   This document defines new Class Types (C-Types) for the SENDER_TSPEC
   and FLOWSPEC objects to carry Spectrum-Switched Optical Network
   (SSON) traffic parameters:

      SSON SENDER_TSPEC: Class = 12, C-Type = 8.

      SSON FLOWSPEC: Class = 9, C-Type = 8.

   The SSON traffic parameters carried in both objects MUST have the
   format shown in Figure 1.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.1.%20%20Applicability%20to%20Fixed-Grid%20Networks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1" id="section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Applicability to Fixed-Grid Networks</span>

   Note that the slot width (i.e., traffic parameters) of a fixed grid
   defined in [<a href="#ref-G.694.1" title='"Spectral grids for WDM applications: DWDM frequency grid"'>G.694.1</a>] can also be specified by using the SSON traffic
   parameters.  The fixed-grid channel spacings (12.5 GHz, 25 GHz,
   50 GHz, 100 GHz, and integer multiples of 100 GHz) are also the
   multiples of 12.5 GHz, so the m parameter can be used to represent
   these slot widths.

   Therefore, it is possible to consider using the new traffic parameter
   object types in common signaling messages for flexi-grid and legacy
   DWDM networks.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Generalized%20Label"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Generalized Label</span>

   In the case of a flexible-grid network, the labels that have been
   requested or allocated as signaled in the RSVP-TE objects are encoded
   as described in [<a href="./rfc7699" title='"Generalized Labels for the Flexi-Grid in Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) Label Switching Routers"'>RFC7699</a>].  This new label encoding can appear in any
   RSVP-TE object or sub-object that can carry a label.

   As noted in <a href="./rfc7699#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of [RFC7699]</a>, the m parameter forms part of
   the label as well as part of the traffic parameters.

   As described in <a href="./rfc7699#section-4.3">Section 4.3 of [RFC7699]</a>, a "compound label",
   constructed from a concatenation of the flexi-grid labels, is used
   when signaling an LSP that uses multiple flexi-grid slots.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20Signaling%20Procedures"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Signaling Procedures</span>

   There are no differences between the signaling procedures described
   for LSP control in [<a href="./rfc7698" title='"Framework and Requirements for GMPLS-Based Control of Flexi-Grid Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) Networks"'>RFC7698</a>] and those required for use in a
   fixed-grid network [<a href="./rfc7689" title='"Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks"'>RFC7689</a>].  Obviously, the TSpec, FlowSpec, and
   label formats described in Sections <a href="#section-4.1">4.1</a> and <a href="#section-4.2">4.2</a> are used.  The
   signaling procedures for distributed SA and centralized SA can be
   applied.

   This document makes minor modifications to GMPLS signaling but does
   not change the manageability considerations for such networks.
   Clearly, protocol analysis tools and other diagnostic aids (including
   logging systems and MIB modules) will need to be enhanced to support
   the new traffic parameters and label formats.

   This document introduces no new security considerations to [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>].

   See also [<a href="./rfc5920" title='"Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS Networks"'>RFC5920</a>] for a discussion of security considerations for
   GMPLS signaling.
