<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined a Mission
   Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) over LTE service [<a href="#ref-TS.3GPP.22.179">TS.3GPP.22.179</a>].  The
   MCPTT service supports an enhanced Push To Talk (PTT) service that is
   suitable for mission critical scenarios and is based upon 3GPP
   Evolved Packet System (EPS) services.  The requirements for the MCPTT
   service defined within 3GPP can also form the basis for other PTT
   services.

   The MCPTT service is intended to support communication between
   several users (a group call), where each user can gain permission to
   talk in an arbitrated manner.  However, the MCPTT service also
   supports private calls between pairs of users.

   MCPTT is primarily targeted to provide a professional PTT service to,
   e.g., public safety, transport companies, utilities, and industrial
   and nuclear plants.  In addition to this, a commercial PTT service
   for non-professional use (e.g., groups of people on holiday) may be
   delivered through an MCPTT system.  Based on their operational model,
   the performance and MCPTT features in use vary per user organization,
   where functionality that is more mission-critical-specific (e.g.,
   Imminent Peril Call) might not be available to commercial customers.

   The MCPTT service provides its users with different priorities for
   the access to network resources in order to provide means to
   prioritize between calls when resources are scarce.  Among other
   things, these priorities take into account the priority and role of
   the caller, the priority and type of the group, and the situation in
   which the call is made.

   The SIP-level call control procedures using these namespaces are
   specified in [<a href="#ref-TS.3GPP.24.379">TS.3GPP.24.379</a>].  The namespaces defined here will
   support a wide range of queuing options.  The namespaces correspond
   to what can be supported over the 3GPP Rx interface, defined in

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8101">RFC 8101</a>                   MCPTT R-P Namespace                March 2017</span>


   [<a href="#ref-TS.3GPP.29.214">TS.3GPP.29.214</a>].  The usage of the namespaces can be tailored to the
   needs of the operator.  The mechanism to do this is to configure
   which values a specific user is allowed to use.  This configuration
   is specified in [<a href="#ref-TS.3GPP.24.384">TS.3GPP.24.384</a>].

   High-priority calls (when the life of either a public safety worker
   or anyone else is in danger) need to be set up immediately; thus,
   they require preemption.  Other calls may be less sensitive in call
   setup time but have a high priority once established.  For these
   calls, a queueing mechanism is more appropriate.  The MCPTT data
   transfer service currently under development can benefit from a
   queueing mechanism.  Another example is video-only calls that are not
   critical in call setup time but where keeping the call is important.

   This document creates additional SIP Resource-Priority namespaces to
   meet the requirements of the 3GPP-defined MCPTT and places these
   namespaces in the IANA registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Applicability</span>

   This document defines namespaces applicable for MCPTT services
   defined by 3GPP that use the network services of a 3GPP-defined LTE
   network.  The use of this namespace outside such networks is
   undefined.

   This document introduces the following MCPTT namespaces: mcpttp and
   mcpttq.  The names of which come from the 3GPP-defined MCPTT service.
