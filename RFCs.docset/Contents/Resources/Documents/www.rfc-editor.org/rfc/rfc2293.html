Abstract

   This document defines techniques for representing two types of
   information mapping in the OSI Directory [<a href="#ref-1" title="models and services">1</a>].

   1.  Mapping from a key to a value (or set of values), as might
       be done in a table lookup.

   2.  Mapping from a distinguished name to an associated
       value (or values), where the values are not defined by the owner
       of the entry.  This is achieved by use of a directory subtree.

   These techniques were developed for supporting MHS use of Directory
   [<a href="#ref-2" title='"X.400-MHS use of the X.500 directory to support X.400-MHS routing,"'>2</a>], but are specified separately as they have more general
   applicability.

   Before considering specific function, a general purpose technique for
   representing tables in the directory is introduced.  The schema for
   this is given in Figure 1.  A table can be considered as an unordered
   set of key to (single or multiple) value mappings, where the key
   cannot be represented as a global name.  There are four reasons why
   this may occur:

   1.  The object does not have a natural global name.

   2.  The object can only be named effectively in the context of
       being a key to a binding.  In this case, the object will be given
       a natural global name by the table.

   3.  The object has a global name, and the table is being used
       to associate parameters with this object, in cases where they
       cannot be placed in the objects global entry.  Reasons why they
       might not be so placed include:

        o  The object does not have a directory entry

        o  There is no authority to place the parameters in the
           global entry

        o  The parameters are not global --- they only make sense
           in the  context of the table.

   4.  It is desirable to group information together as a
       performance optimization, so that the block of information may be
       widely replicated.

   A table is represented as a single level subtree.  The root of the
   subtree is an entry of object class Table.  This is named with a
   common name descriptive of the table.  The table will be located
   somewhere appropriate to its function.  If a table is private to an
   MTA, it will be below the MTA's entry.  If it is shared by MTA's in
   an organization, it will be located under the organization.

   The generic table entry contains only a description.  All instances
   will be subclassed, and the subclass will define the naming
   attribute.  Two subclasses are defined:

   1.  TextEntry, which define table entries with text keys,
       which may have single or multiple values of any type.  An
       attribute is defined to allow a text value, to support the
       frequent text key to text value mapping.  Additional values may
       be defined.

   2.  DistinguishedNameEntry.  This is used for associating
       information with globally defined objects.  This approach should
       be used where the number of objects in the table is small or very
       sparsely spread over the DIT. In other cases where there are many
       objects or the objects are tightly clustered in the DIT, the
       subtree approach defined in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> will be preferable.  No
       value attributes are defined for this type of entry.  An
       application of this will make appropriate subtyping to define the
       needed values.

   This is best illustrated by example.  Consider the MTA:

   CN=Bells, OU=Computer Science,
   O=University College London, C=GB

   Suppose that the MTA needs a table mapping from private keys to fully
   qualified domain names (this example is fictitious).  The table might
   be named as:

   CN=domain-nicknames,
   CN=Bells, OU=Computer Science,
   O=University College London, C=GB

   To represent a mapping in this table from "euclid" to
   "bloomsbury.ac.uk", the entry:

   TextTableKey=euclid, CN=domain-nicknames,
   CN=Bells, OU=Computer Science,
   O=University College London, C=GB

   will contain the attribute:

   TextTableValue=bloomsbury.ac.uk

   A second example, showing the use of DistinguishedNameEntry is now
   given.  Consider again the MTA:

   CN=Bells, OU=Computer Science,
   O=University College London, C=GB

   Suppose that the MTA needs a table mapping from MTA Name to bilateral
   agreement information of that MTA. The table might be named as:

   CN=MTA Bilateral Agreements,
   CN=Bells, OU=Computer Science,
   O=University College London, C=GB

   To represent information on the MTA which has the Distinguished Name:

   CN=Q3T21, ADMD=Gold 400, C=GB

   There would be an entry in this table with the Relative Distinguished
   Name of the table entry being the Distinguished Name of the MTA being
   referred to.  The MTA Bilateral information would be an attribute in
   this entry.  Using a non-standard notation, the Distinguished Name of
   the table entry is:

   DistinguishedNameTableKey=&lt;CN=Q3T21, ADMD=Gold 400, C=GB&gt;,
   CN=MTA Bilateral Agreements,
   CN=Bells, OU=Computer Science,
   O=University College London, C=GB

   A subtree is similar to a table, except that the keys are constructed
   as a distinguished name hierarchy relative to the location of the
   subtree in the DIT. The subtree effectively starts a private "root",
   and has distinguished names relative to this root.  Typically, this
   approach is used to associate local information with global objects.
   The schema used is defined in Figure 2.  Functionally, this is
   equivalent to a table with distinguished name keys.  The table
   approach is best when the tree is very sparse.  This approach is
   better for subtrees which are more populated.

   The subtree object class defines the root for a subtree in an
   analogous means to the table.  Information within the subtree will
   generally be defined in the same way as for the global object, and so

   subtree OBJECT-CLASS ::= {
       SUBCLASS OF {top}
       MUST CONTAIN {commonName}
       MAY CONTAIN {manager}
       ID oc-subtree}

                     Figure 2:  Representing Subtrees


   no specific object classes for subtree entries are needed.

   For example consider University College London.

   O=University College London, C=GB

   Suppose that the UCL needs a private subtree, with interesting
   information about directory objects.  The table might be named as:

   CN=private subtree,
   O=University College London, C=GB

   UCL specific information on Inria might be stored in the entry:

   O=Inria, C=FR,
   CN=private subtree,
   O=University College London, C=GB

   Practical examples of this mapping are given in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"X.400-MHS use of the X.500 directory to support X.400-MHS routing,"'>2</a>].
