   This memo documents an experiment to review and classify Proposed
   Standards as not reflecting documented practice within the world
   today.  The results identify a set of documents that were marked as
   Proposed Standards that are now reclassified as Historic.

   <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a>, and <a href="./rfc1602">RFC 1602</a> before it, specified timelines for review of
   immature (draft or proposed) standards.  The purpose of such review
   was to determine whether such documents should be advanced, retired,
   or developed further [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>1</a>].

   This procedure has never been followed in the history of the IETF.
   Since this procedure has not been followed, members of the community
   have suggested that the retiring of a document to Historic is a
   significant event, which should be justified carefully -- leading to
   the production of documents such as <a href="./rfc2556">RFC 2556</a> (OSI Connectionless
   Transport Services on top of UDP Applicability Statement for Historic
    Status) and <a href="./rfc3166">RFC 3166</a> (Request to Move <a href="./rfc1403">RFC 1403</a> to Historic Status).

   Such documents require significant time and effort on the part of
   authors, area directors, and the RFC Editor.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Bulk%20Decommissioning%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Bulk Decommissioning Procedure</span>

   From the Fall of 2004 through the Spring of 2005, the authors
   conducted an experiment to determine how many Proposed Standards
   could be considered obsolete.  The experiment was operated as
   follows:

   o  Identify a group of documents that are standards.
   o  Assume by default that each document will be retired.
   o  Create a mailing list for discussion with a policy of open access.
   o  Allow any document to be removed from the list of those to be
      retired for virtually any reason, so long as a reason is provided.
   o  Present the list to the working group, IETF, and IESG for review.
   o  Revise list based on comments.
   o  Write up results.

   The initial intent of the authors was to present a list of documents
   to be reclassified as Historic.  The NEWTRK working group supported
   this view.  The IESG, and the IETF as a community, makes the final
   decision.  We will discuss this further below.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Input%2C%20Mailing%20list%2C%20Output%2C%20and%20Observations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Input, Mailing list, Output, and Observations</span>

   We started with our initial document set being all RFCs with numbers
   less than 2000 and a status of Proposed Standard.  The input we used,
   starting November 25, 2004, can be found in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  There were
   some 125 documents in all.

   A mailing list, old-standards@alvestrand.no, was created to discuss
   and remove candidates from this list.  A call for participation was
   issued to the IETF-Announce list on or around the November 15, 2004.
   There were 29 members of the mailing list.  Approximately 244
   messages were sent to the list.  People were encouraged to consider
   the question of whether or not an implementer would either write a
   new implementation or maintain an existing one.

   After some months the list of documents to be considered was reduced
   considerably.  This list was then forwarded to the IETF discussion
   list on December 16, 2004, and to the NEWTRK working group list for
   wider review.

   During review, RFCs 1518 and 1519 were removed, based on the fact
   that work is ongoing to revise them.  Similarly, RFCs 1381, 1382,
   1471, 1472, 1473, 1582, 1598, and 1755 were removed based on the
   belief that they were actively in use.  <a href="./rfc1584">RFC 1584</a> was removed based on
   an expected future dependency.

   One additional document, <a href="./rfc1829">RFC 1829</a>, the ESP DES-CBC transform, was
   suggested for Historic status, but in this case, the group consensus
   is that the community would benefit from a separate document
   describing the security implications of using this algorithm.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Discussion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Discussion</span>

   As one peruses this list one sees several classes of documents:

   o  Multiprotocol functions for protocols that are obsolete, such as
      Appletalk or X.400.
   o  Protocols that were defined but not used, such as PEM or Whois++

   In either case above, a judgment is necessary as to whether or not a
   protocol is both in use and likely to be supported.  The parameters
   of our experiment were sufficiently conservative to avoid cases where
   protocols were likely to continue to be supported.  That is, anyone
   could remove a document from the list for any reason.  In fact, in
   some cases we may have been too conservative.  Thus, it is also worth
   considering the categories of documents that were removed from the
   list:





<span class="grey">Lear &amp; Alvestrand            Informational                      [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4450">RFC 4450</a>                     Cruft Removal                    March 2006</span>


   o  specifications known to be in full use that should be considered
      for advancement
   o  specifications that are currently under review within the IETF
      process
   o  Specifications that were previously considered for deprecation and
      rejected.

   The last category is exclusive to telnet options, which were reviewed
   in the late 1990s.  Arguably, such options should be reconsidered for
   deprecation.  Realistically, nobody is going to develop a new version
   of telnet that supports the TACACS option, for instance.
   Nevertheless, as a first cut we were still left with 61 documents
   that could be reclassified.

   In at least one case, discussion of deprecation has spurred work on
   documents.  For instance, there is a Classless Inter-Domain Routing
   (CIDR) update in progress.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Next%20Steps"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Next Steps</span>

   As we mention in the introduction, the current process requires
   reconsideration of immature standards, and this review currently does
   not occur.  This experiment has been an attempt at a procedure that
   could ease that review.  The final step was working group
   consideration of what to do next.  There were four options:

   1.  Accept the results of this experiment, issue a last call, and
       deprecate standards that remain on the list past last call.  This
       is an aggressive approach that would preserve the intent of <a href="./rfc2026">RFC</a>
       <a href="./rfc2026">2026</a>.
   2.  Do not accept the results of this experiment and update <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a>
       to indicate a new practice.
   3.  Revise the procedure based on the results of this experiment,
       based on feedback from the IESG.  This option might take into
       account the different types of old standards as described above.
   4.  Do nothing.  This would leave the IETF and the IESG practice
       inconsistent with documented practice.

   The working group chose the first option.  The RFC Editor is
   requested to mark the above listed standards as Historic.

   It should be pointed out that we only looked at proposed standards
   and only those RFCs with numbers less than 2000.  Should either the
   first or third of the above options be accepted, draft standards and
   those older than several years should be considered.

   Finally, should NEWTRK deliver a new document classification system,
   these documents may provide a basis for one or more new categories of
   that.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   The IANA databases contain references to many of these documents.
   The documents are still the normative definitions for these values,
   and the IANA databases do not contain information about the status of
   the RFCs referred to.

   Therefore, the IANA should not need to do anything based on this
   document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Documents that have security problems may require special attention
   and individual documents to indicate what concerns exist, and when or
   in what ways an implementation can be deployed to alleviate concerns.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Acknowledgements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Acknowledgements</span>

   This experiment would have been completely useless without
   participation of the members of the old-standards mailing list.  Most
   notably, Pekka Savalo, Bob Braden, and John Klensin were very active
   contributors to the discussions.
