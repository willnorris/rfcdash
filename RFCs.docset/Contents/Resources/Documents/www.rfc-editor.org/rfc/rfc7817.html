<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Use of TLS by SMTP Submission, IMAP, POP, and ManageSieve clients is
   described in [<a href="./rfc3207" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security"'>RFC3207</a>], [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>], [<a href="./rfc2595" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>RFC2595</a>], and [<a href="./rfc5804" title='"A Protocol for Remotely Managing Sieve Scripts"'>RFC5804</a>],
   respectively.  Each of the documents describes slightly different
   rules for server certificate identity verification (or doesn't define
   any rules at all).  In reality, email client and server developers
   implement many of these protocols at the same time, so it would be
   good to define modern and consistent rules for verifying email server
   identities using TLS.

   This document describes the updated TLS server identity verification
   procedure for SMTP Submission [<a href="./rfc6409" title='"Message Submission for Mail"'>RFC6409</a>] [<a href="./rfc3207" title='"SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security"'>RFC3207</a>], IMAP [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>],
   POP [<a href="./rfc1939" title='"Post Office Protocol - Version 3"'>RFC1939</a>], and ManageSieve [<a href="./rfc5804" title='"A Protocol for Remotely Managing Sieve Scripts"'>RFC5804</a>] clients.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of this
   document replaces <a href="./rfc2595#section-2.4">Section 2.4 of [RFC2595]</a>.

   Note that this document doesn't apply to use of TLS in MTA-to-MTA
   SMTP.

   This document provides a consistent TLS server identity verification
   procedure across multiple email-related protocols.  This should make
   it easier for Certification Authorities (CAs) and ISPs to deploy TLS
   for email use and would enable email client developers to write more
   secure code.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The following terms or concepts are used through the document:

   reference identifier:  One of the domain names that the email client
      (an SMTP, IMAP, POP3, or ManageSieve client) associates with the
      target email server.  For some identifier types, the identifier
      also includes an application service type.  Reference identifiers
      are used for performing name checks on server certificates.  (This
      term is formally defined in [<a href="./rfc6125" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>].)

   CN-ID, DNS-ID, SRV-ID, and URI-ID are identifier types (see [<a href="./rfc6125" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>]
   for details).  For convenience, their short definitions from
   [<a href="./rfc6125" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>] are listed below:

   CN-ID:  A Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) in the certificate
      subject field that contains one and only one attribute-type-and-
      value pair of type Common Name (CN), where the value matches the
      overall form of a domain name (informally, dot-separated, letter-
      digit-hyphen labels).

   DNS-ID:  A subjectAltName entry of type dNSName

   SRV-ID:  A subjectAltName entry of type otherName whose name form is
      SRVName

   URI-ID:  A subjectAltName entry of type uniformResourceIdentifier
      whose value includes both (i) a "scheme" and (ii) a "host"
      component (or its equivalent) that matches the "reg-name" rule
      (where the quoted terms represent the associated [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>]
      productions from [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>]).

   During a TLS negotiation, an email client (i.e., an SMTP, IMAP, POP3,
   or ManageSieve client) MUST check its understanding of the server
   identity (client's reference identifiers) against the server's
   identity as presented in the server Certificate message in order to
   prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  This check is only performed
   after the server certificate passes certification path validation as
   described in <a href="./rfc5280#section-6">Section 6 of [RFC5280]</a>.  Matching is performed according
   to the rules specified in <a href="./rfc6125#section-6">Section 6 of [RFC6125]</a>, including the
   relative order of matching of different identifier types,
   "certificate pinning", and the procedure on failure to match.  The

   following inputs are used by the verification procedure used in
   [<a href="./rfc6125" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>]:

   1.  For DNS-ID and CN-ID identifier types, the client MUST use one or
       more of the following as "reference identifiers": (a) the domain
       portion of the user's email address, (b) the hostname it used to
       open the connection (without CNAME canonicalization).  The client
       MAY also use (c) a value securely derived from (a) or (b), such
       as using "secure" DNSSEC [<a href="./rfc4033" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>] [<a href="./rfc4034" title='"Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4034</a>] [<a href="./rfc4035" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>] validated
       lookup.

   2.  When using email service discovery procedure specified in
       [<a href="./rfc6186" title='"Use of SRV Records for Locating Email Submission/Access Services"'>RFC6186</a>], the client MUST also use the domain portion of the
       user's email address as another "reference identifier" to compare
       against an SRV-ID identifier in the server certificate.

   The rules and guidelines defined in [<a href="./rfc6125" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>] apply to an email
   server certificate with the following supplemental rules:

   1.  Support for the DNS-ID identifier type (subjectAltName of dNSName
       type [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>]) is REQUIRED in email client software
       implementations.

   2.  Support for the SRV-ID identifier type (subjectAltName of SRVName
       type [<a href="./rfc4985" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Subject Alternative Name for Expression of Service Name"'>RFC4985</a>]) is REQUIRED for email client software
       implementations that support [<a href="./rfc6186" title='"Use of SRV Records for Locating Email Submission/Access Services"'>RFC6186</a>].  A list of SRV-ID types
       for email services is specified in [<a href="./rfc6186" title='"Use of SRV Records for Locating Email Submission/Access Services"'>RFC6186</a>].  For the
       ManageSieve protocol, the service name "sieve" is used.

   3.  A URI-ID identifier type (subjectAltName of
       uniformResourceIdentifier type [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>]) MUST NOT be used by
       clients for server verification, as URI-IDs were not historically
       used for email.

   4.  For backward compatibility with deployed software, a CN-ID
       identifier type (CN attribute from the subject name, see
       [<a href="./rfc6125" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>]) MAY be used for server identity verification.

   5.  Email protocols allow use of certain wildcards in identifiers
       presented by email servers.  The "*" wildcard character MAY be
       used as the left-most name component of a DNS-ID or CN-ID in the
       certificate.  For example, a DNS-ID of "*.example.com" would
       match "a.example.com", "foo.example.com", etc., but would not
       match "example.com".  Note that the wildcard character MUST NOT
       be used as a fragment of the left-most name component (e.g.,
       "*oo.example.com", "f*o.example.com", or "foo*.example.com").

   1.  CAs MUST support issuance of server certificates with a DNS-ID
       identifier type (subjectAltName of dNSName type [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>]).
       (Note that some DNS-IDs may refer to domain portions of email
       addresses, so they might not have corresponding A/AAAA DNS
       records.)

   2.  CAs MUST support issuance of server certificates with an SRV-ID
       identifier type (subjectAltName of SRVName type [<a href="./rfc4985" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Subject Alternative Name for Expression of Service Name"'>RFC4985</a>]) for
       each type of email service.  See <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> for more discussion
       on what this means for CAs.

   3.  For backward compatibility with a deployed client base, CAs MUST
       support issuance of server certificates with a CN-ID identifier
       type (CN attribute from the subject name, see [<a href="./rfc6125" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>]).

   4.  CAs MAY allow "*" (wildcard) as the left-most name component of a
       DNS-ID or CN-ID in server certificates it issues.

   [<a id="ref-RFC6186">RFC6186</a>] provides an easy way for organizations to autoconfigure
   email clients.  It also allows for delegation of email services to an
   email hosting provider.  When connecting to such delegated hosting
   service, an email client that attempts to verify TLS server identity
   needs to know that if it connects to "imap.hosting.example.net", such
   server is authorized to provide email access for an email such as
   alice@example.org.  In absence of SRV-IDs, users of compliant email
   clients would be forced to manually confirm exceptions because the
   TLS server certificate verification procedures specified in this
   document would result in failure to match the TLS server certificate
   against the expected domain(s).  One way to provide such
   authorization is for the TLS certificate for
   "imap.hosting.example.net" to include SRV-ID(s) (or a DNS-ID) for the
   "example.org" domain.  Note that another way is for DNS Service
   Record (SRV) lookups to be protected by DNSSEC, but this solution
   depends on ubiquitous use of DNSSEC and availability of DNSSEC-aware
   APIs and thus is not discussed in this document.  A future update to
   this document might rectify this.

   A CA that receives a Certificate Signing Request containing multiple
   unrelated DNS-IDs and/or SRV-IDs (e.g., a DNS-ID of "example.org" and
   a DNS-ID of "example.com") needs to verify that the entity that
   supplied such Certificate Signing Request is authorized to provide
   email service for all requested domains.

   The ability to issue certificates that contain an SRV-ID (or a DNS-ID
   for the domain part of email addresses) implies the ability to verify
   that entities requesting them are authorized to run email service for
   these SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs.  In particular, CAs that can't verify such
   authorization (whether for a particular domain or in general) MUST
   NOT include such email SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs in certificates they issue.
   This document doesn't specify exact mechanism(s) that can be used to
   achieve this.  However, a few special case recommendations are listed
   below.

   A CA willing to sign a certificate containing a particular DNS-ID
   SHOULD also support signing a certificate containing one or more of
   the email SRV-IDs for the same domain because the SRV-ID effectively
   provides more restricted access to an email service for the domain
   (as opposed to unrestricted use of any services for the same domain,
   as specified by the DNS-ID).

   A CA that also provides DNS service for a domain can use DNS
   information to validate SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs for the domain.

   A CA that is also a Mail Service Provider for a hosted domain can use
   that knowledge to validate SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs for the domain.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Signing%20Request%20Generation%20Tools"></a>    Signing Request Generation Tools</span>

   Mail Service Providers and Certificate Signing Request generation
   tools:

   1.  MUST include the DNS-ID identifier type in Certificate Signing
       Requests for the host name(s) where the email server(s) are
       running.  They SHOULD include the DNS-ID identifier type in
       Certificate Signing Requests for the domain portion of served
       email addresses.

   2.  MUST include the SRV-ID identifier type for each type of email
       service in Certificate Signing Requests if the email services
       provided are discoverable using DNS SRV as specified in
       [<a href="./rfc6186" title='"Use of SRV Records for Locating Email Submission/Access Services"'>RFC6186</a>].

   3.  SHOULD include the CN-ID identifier type for the host name where
       the email server(s) is running in Certificate Signing Requests
       for backward compatibility with deployed email clients.  (Note, a
       certificate can only include a single CN-ID, so if a mail service
       is running on multiple hosts, either each host has to use
       different certificate with its own CN-ID, a single certificate
       with multiple DNS-IDs, or a single certificate with wildcard in a
       CN-ID can be used).

   4.  MAY include "*" (wildcard) as the left-most name component of a
       DNS-ID or CN-ID in Certificate Signing Requests.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Notes%20on%20Hosting%20Multiple%20Domains"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Notes on Hosting Multiple Domains</span>

   A server that hosts multiple domains needs to do one of the following
   (or some combination thereof):

   1.  Use DNS SRV records to redirect each hosted email service to a
       fixed domain, deploy TLS certificate(s) for that single domain,
       and instruct users to configure their clients with appropriate
       pinning (unless the SRV records can always be obtained via
       DNSSEC).  Some email clients come with preloaded lists of pinned
       certificates for some popular domains; this can avoid the need
       for manual confirmation.

   2.  Use a single TLS certificate that includes a complete list of all
       the domains it is serving.

   3.  Serve each domain on its own IP/port, using separate TLS
       certificates on each IP/port.

   4.  Use the Server Name Indication (SNI) TLS extension [<a href="./rfc6066" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions: Extension Definitions"'>RFC6066</a>] to
       select the right certificate to return during TLS negotiation.
       Each domain has its own TLS certificate in this case.

   Each of these deployment choices have their scaling disadvantages
   when the list of domains changes.  Use of DNS SRV without an SRV-ID
   requires manual confirmation from users.  While preloading pinned
   certificates avoids the need for manual confirmation, this
   information can get stale quickly or would require support for a new
   mechanism for distributing preloaded pinned certificates.  A single
   certificate (the second choice) requires that when a domain is added,
   then a new Certificate Signing Request that includes a complete list
   of all the domains needs to be issued and passed to a CA in order to
   generate a new certificate.  A separate IP/port can avoid
   regenerating the certificate but requires more transport layer
   resources.  Use of TLS SNI requires each email client to use it.

   Several Mail Service Providers host hundreds and even thousands of
   domains.  This document, as well as its predecessors, RFCs 2595,
   3207, 3501, and 5804, don't address scaling issues caused by use of
   TLS in multi-tenanted environments.  Further work is needed to
   address this issue, possibly using DNSSEC or something like PKIX over
   Secure HTTP (POSH) [<a href="./rfc7711" title='"PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)"'>RFC7711</a>].

   Consider an IMAP-accessible email server that supports both IMAP and
   IMAP-over-TLS (IMAPS) at the host "mail.example.net" servicing email
   addresses of the form "user@example.net".  A certificate for this
   service needs to include DNS-IDs of "example.net" (because it is the
   domain portion of emails) and "mail.example.net" (this is what a user
   of this server enters manually if not using [<a href="./rfc6186" title='"Use of SRV Records for Locating Email Submission/Access Services"'>RFC6186</a>]).  It might
   also include a CN-ID of "mail.example.net" for backward compatibility
   with deployed infrastructure.

   Consider the IMAP-accessible email server from the previous paragraph
   that is additionally discoverable via DNS SRV lookups in domain
   "example.net" (using DNS SRV records "_imap._tcp.example.net" and
   "_imaps._tcp.example.net").  In addition to the DNS-ID/CN-ID identity
   types specified above, a certificate for this service also needs to
   include SRV-IDs of "_imap.example.net" (when STARTTLS is used on the
   IMAP port) and "_imaps.example.net" (when TLS is used on IMAPS port).
   See [<a href="./rfc6186" title='"Use of SRV Records for Locating Email Submission/Access Services"'>RFC6186</a>] for more details.  (Note that unlike DNS SRV there is
   no "_tcp" component in SRV-IDs).

   Consider the IMAP-accessible email server from the first paragraph
   that is running on a host also known as "mycompany.example.com".  In
   addition to the DNS-ID identity types specified above, a certificate
   for this service also needs to include a DNS-ID of
   "mycompany.example.com" (this is what a user of this server enters
   manually if not using [<a href="./rfc6186" title='"Use of SRV Records for Locating Email Submission/Access Services"'>RFC6186</a>]).  It might also include a CN-ID of
   "mycompany.example.com" instead of the CN-ID "mail.example.net" for
   backward compatibility with deployed infrastructure.  (This is so,
   because a certificate can only include a single CN-ID)

   Consider an SMTP Submission server at the host "submit.example.net"
   servicing email addresses of the form "user@example.net" and
   discoverable via DNS SRV lookups in domain "example.net" (using DNS
   SRV record "_submission._tcp.example.net").  A certificate for this
   service needs to include SRV-IDs of "_submission.example.net" (see
   [<a href="./rfc6186" title='"Use of SRV Records for Locating Email Submission/Access Services"'>RFC6186</a>]) along with DNS-IDs of "example.net" and
   "submit.example.net".  It might also include a CN-ID of
   "submit.example.net" for backward compatibility with deployed
   infrastructure.

   Consider a host "mail.example.net" servicing email addresses of the
   form "user@example.net" and discoverable via DNS SRV lookups in
   domain "example.net", which runs SMTP Submission, IMAPS and POP3S
   (POP3-over-TLS), and ManageSieve services.  Each of the servers can
   use their own certificate specific to their service (see examples
   above).  Alternatively, they can all share a single certificate that
   would include SRV-IDs of "_submission.example.net",

   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> covers operational considerations (in particular, use of
   DNS SRV for autoconfiguration) related to generating TLS certificates
   for email servers so that they can be successfully verified by email
   clients.  Additionally, <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> talks about operational
   considerations related to hosting multiple domains.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The goal of this document is to improve interoperability and thus
   security of email clients wishing to access email servers over TLS-
   protected email protocols by specifying a consistent set of rules
   that email service providers, email client writers, and CAs can use
   when creating server certificates.

   The TLS server identity check for email relies on use of trustworthy
   DNS hostnames when constructing "reference identifiers" that are
   checked against an email server certificate.  Such trustworthy names
   are either entered manually (for example, if they are advertised on a
   Mail Service Provider's website), explicitly confirmed by the user
   (e.g., if they are a target of a DNS SRV lookup), or derived using a
   secure third party service (e.g., DNSSEC-protected SRV records that
   are verified by the client or trusted local resolver).  Future work
   in this area might benefit from integration with DNS-Based
   Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) [<a href="./rfc6698" title='"The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA"'>RFC6698</a>], but it is not
   covered by this document.
