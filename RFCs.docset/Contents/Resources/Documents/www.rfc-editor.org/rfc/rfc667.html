   All host interfaces are local (except host number 005 which is an
   easily convertible local/distant interface and we have been asked by
   Div 6 to avoid using it so Div 6 can more easily check out PDP-10 IMP
   interfaces).  The PDP-11 with the line printer is intentionally on
   host 105 so that a simple minded program can respond when someone
   tries to ICP to its logger socket "To login to BBN (System C) use
   host number 241(10)".
