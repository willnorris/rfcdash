                  <span class="h1">Note on Pre-assigned Journal Numbers</span>


This is to announce that RFC numbers can now be obtained on-line through
NLS at OFFICE-1;  they can no longer be obtained on-line at SRI-ARC.
You may still call the NIC to get an RFC number, if you do not wish to
use the on-line facilities.

Also, please note that pre-assigned journal numbers (excepting RFC
numbers) can be used through NLS only on the system (OFFICE-1 or SRI-
ARC) from which they were taken.
