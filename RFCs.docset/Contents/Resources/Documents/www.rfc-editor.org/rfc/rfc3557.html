   Motivated by technology advances in the field of speech recognition,
   voice interfaces to services (such as airline information systems,
   unified messaging) are becoming more prevalent.  In parallel, the
   popularity of mobile devices has also increased dramatically.



<span class="grey">Xie                         Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

   However, the voice codecs typically employed in mobile devices were
   designed to optimize audible voice quality and not speech recognition
   accuracy, and using these codecs with speech recognizers can result
   in poor recognition performance.  For systems that can be accessed
   from heterogeneous networks using multiple speech codecs, recognition
   system designers are further challenged to accommodate the
   characteristics of these differences in a robust manner.  Channel
   errors and lost data packets in these networks result in further
   degradation of the speech signal.

   In traditional systems as described above, the entire speech
   recognizer lies on the server.  It is forced to use incoming speech
   in whatever condition it arrives after the network decodes the
   vocoded speech.  To address this problem, we use a distributed speech
   recognition (DSR) architecture.  In such a system, the remote device
   acts as a thin client, also known as the front-end, in communication
   with a speech recognition server, also called a speech engine.  The
   remote device processes the speech, compresses the data, and adds
   error protection to the bitstream in a manner optimal for speech
   recognition.  The speech engine then uses this representation
   directly, minimizing the signal processing necessary and benefiting
   from enhanced error concealment.

   To achieve interoperability with different client devices and speech
   engines, a common format is needed.  Within the "Aurora" DSR working
   group of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI),
   a payload has been defined and was published as a standard [<a href="#ref-ES201108" title='"Speech Processing, Transmission and Quality Aspects (STQ); Distributed Speech Recognition; Front-end Feature Extraction Algorithm; Compression Algorithms,"'>ES201108</a>]
   in February 2000.

   For voice dialogues between a caller and a voice service, low latency
   is a high priority along with accurate speech recognition.  While
   jitter in the speech recognizer input is not particularly important,
   many issues related to speech interaction over an IP-based connection
   are still relevant.  Therefore, it is desirable to use the DSR
   payload in an RTP-based session.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1%20%20ETSI%20ES%20201%20108%20DSR%20Front-end%20Codec"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>  ETSI ES 201 108 DSR Front-end Codec</span>

   The ETSI Standard ES 201 108 for DSR [<a href="#ref-ES201108" title='"Speech Processing, Transmission and Quality Aspects (STQ); Distributed Speech Recognition; Front-end Feature Extraction Algorithm; Compression Algorithms,"'>ES201108</a>] defines a signal
   processing front-end and compression scheme for speech input to a
   speech recognition system.  Some relevant characteristics of this
   ETSI DSR front-end codec are summarized below.

   The coding algorithm, a standard mel-cepstral technique common to
   many speech recognition systems, supports three raw sampling rates: 8
   kHz, 11 kHz, and 16 kHz.  The mel-cepstral calculation is a frame-
   based scheme that produces an output vector every 10 ms.

   After calculation of the mel-cepstral representation, the
   representation is first quantized via split-vector quantization to
   reduce the data rate of the encoded stream.  Then, the quantized
   vectors from two consecutive frames are put into an FP, as described
   in more detail in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   The diagrams in Figure 1 show some typical use scenarios of the ES
   201 108 DSR RTP payload format.

         Figure 1: Typical Scenarios for Using DSR Payload Format.

   For the different scenarios in Figure 1, the speech recognizer always
   resides in the speech engine.  A DSR front-end encoder inside the
   User Terminal performs front-end speech processing and sends the
   resultant data to the speech engine in the form of "frame pairs"
   (FPs).  Each FP contains two sets of encoded speech vectors
   representing 20ms of original speech.

   An ES 201 108 DSR RTP payload datagram consists of a standard RTP
   header [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] followed by a DSR payload.  The DSR payload itself
   is formed by concatenating a series of ES 201 108 DSR FPs (defined in
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).

   FPs are always packed bit-contiguously into the payload octets
   beginning with the most significant bit.  For ES 201 108 front-end,
   the size of each FP is 96 bits or 12 octets (see Sections <a href="#section-4.1">4.1</a> and
   4.2).  This ensures that a DSR payload will always end on an octet
   boundary.

   The following example shows a DSR RTP datagram carrying a DSR payload
   containing three 96-bit-long FPs (bit 0 is the MSB):

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1%20Consideration%20on%20Number%20of%20FPs%20in%20Each%20RTP%20Packet"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a> Consideration on Number of FPs in Each RTP Packet</span>

   The number of FPs per payload packet should be determined by the
   latency and bandwidth requirements of the DSR application using this
   payload format.  In particular, using a smaller number of FPs per
   payload packet in a session will result in lowered bandwidth
   efficiency due to the RTP/UDP/IP header overhead, while using a
   larger number of FPs per packet will cause longer end-to-end delay
   and hence increased recognition latency.  Furthermore, carrying a
   larger number of FPs per packet will increase the possibility of
   catastrophic packet loss; the loss of a large number of consecutive
   FPs is a situation most speech recognizers have difficulty dealing
   with.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the number of FPs per DSR payload
   packet be minimized, subject to meeting the application's
   requirements on network bandwidth efficiency.  RTP header compression
   techniques, such as those defined in [<a href="./rfc2508" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links"'>RFC2508</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3095" title='"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): Framework and four profiles"'>RFC3095</a>], should
   be considered to improve network bandwidth efficiency.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2%20Support%20for%20Discontinuous%20Transmission"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a> Support for Discontinuous Transmission</span>

   The DSR RTP payloads may be used to support discontinuous
   transmission (DTX) of speech, which allows that DSR FPs are sent only
   when speech has been detected at the terminal equipment.

   In DTX a set of DSR frames coding an unbroken speech segment
   transmitted from the terminal to the server is called a transmission
   segment.  A DSR frame inside such a transmission segment can be
   either a speech frame or a non-speech frame, depending on the nature
   of the section of the speech signal it represents.

   The end of a transmission segment is determined at the sending end
   equipment when the number of consecutive non-speech frames exceeds a
   pre-set threshold, called the hangover time.  A typical value used
   for the hangover time is 1.5 seconds.

   After all FPs in a transmission segment are sent, the front-end
   SHOULD indicate the end of the current transmission segment by
   sending one or more Null FPs (defined in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>).

   The length of each frame is 44 bits representing 10ms of voice. The

   Frame #2 in FP:
   ===============
       (MSB)                                     (LSB)

   Therefore, each FP represents 20ms of original speech.  Note, as
   shown above, each FP MUST be padded with 4 zeros to the end in order
   to make it aligned to the 32-bit word boundary.  This makes the size
   of an FP 96 bits, or 12 octets.  Note, this padding is separate from
   padding indicated by the P bit in the RTP header.

   The 4-bit CRC MUST be calculated using the formula defined in 6.2.4
   in [<a href="#ref-ES201108" title='"Speech Processing, Transmission and Quality Aspects (STQ); Distributed Speech Recognition; Front-end Feature Extraction Algorithm; Compression Algorithms,"'>ES201108</a>]. The definition of the indices and the determination of
   their value are also described in [<a href="#ref-ES201108" title='"Speech Processing, Transmission and Quality Aspects (STQ); Distributed Speech Recognition; Front-end Feature Extraction Algorithm; Compression Algorithms,"'>ES201108</a>].

   A Null FP for the ES 201 108 front-end codec is defined by setting
   the content of the first and second frame in the FP to null (i.e.,
   filling the first 88 bits of the FP with 0's).  The 4-bit CRC MUST be
   calculated the same way as described in 6.2.4 in [<a href="#ref-ES201108" title='"Speech Processing, Transmission and Quality Aspects (STQ); Distributed Speech Recognition; Front-end Feature Extraction Algorithm; Compression Algorithms,"'>ES201108</a>], and 4
   zeros MUST be padded to the end of the Null FP to make it 32-bit word
   aligned.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3%20RTP%20header%20usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a> RTP header usage</span>

   The format of the RTP header is specified in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  This payload
   format uses the fields of the header in a manner consistent with that
   specification.

   The RTP timestamp corresponds to the sampling instant of the first
   sample encoded for the first FP in the packet.  The timestamp clock
   frequency is the same as the sampling frequency, so the timestamp
   unit is in samples.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3557">RFC 3557</a>         RTP Payload Format for DSR ES 201 108         July 2003</span>


   As defined by ES 201 108 front-end codec, the duration of one FP is
   20 ms, corresponding to 160, 220, or 320 encoded samples with
   sampling rate of 8, 11, or 16 kHz being used at the front-end,
   respectively. Thus, the timestamp is increased by 160, 220, or 320
   for each consecutive FP, respectively.

   The DSR payload for ES 201 108 front-end codes is always an integral
   number of octets.  If additional padding is required for some other
   purpose, then the P bit in the RTP in the header may be set and
   padding appended as specified in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].

   The RTP header marker bit (M) should be set following the general
   rules defined in [<a href="./rfc3551" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>].

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format is
   outside the scope of this document, and will not be specified here.
   It is expected that the RTP profile under which this payload format
   is being used will assign a payload type for this encoding or specify
   that the payload type is to be bound dynamically.

   One new MIME subtype registration is required for this payload type,
   as defined below.

   This section also defines the optional parameters that may be used to
   describe a DSR session.  The parameters are defined here as part of
   the MIME subtype registration.  A mapping of the parameters into the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [<a href="./rfc2327" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC2327</a>] is also provided in 5.1
   for those applications that use SDP.

   Media Type name: audio

   Media subtype name: dsr-es201108

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:

   rate: Indicates the sample rate of the speech.  Valid values include:
      8000, 11000, and 16000.  If this parameter is not present, 8000
      sample rate is assumed.

   maxptime: The maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated in
      each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  The time shall be
      calculated as the sum of the time the media present in the packet
      represents.  The time SHOULD be a multiple of the frame pair size
      (i.e., one FP &lt;-&gt; 20ms).

      If this parameter is not present, maxptime is assumed to be 80ms.

      Note, since the performance of most speech recognizers are
      extremely sensitive to consecutive FP losses, if the user of the
      payload format expects a high packet loss ratio for the session,
      it MAY consider to explicitly choose a maxptime value for the
      session that is shorter than the default value.

   ptime: see <a href="./rfc2327">RFC2327</a> [<a href="./rfc2327" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC2327</a>].

   Encoding considerations : This type is defined for transfer via RTP
      [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] as described in Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a> and <a href="#section-4">4</a> of <a href="./rfc3557">RFC 3557</a>.

   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [<a href="./rfc2327" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC2327</a>], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP
   is used to specify sessions employing ES 201 018 DSR codec, the
   mapping is as follows:

   o  The MIME type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The MIME subtype ("dsr-es201108") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the
      encoding name.

   o  The optional parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as clock
      rate.

   o  The optional parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP
      "a=ptime" and "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.
