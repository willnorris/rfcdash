<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Experiences from initial service provider IPv6 network deployments,
   such as [<a href="./rfc6219" title='"The China Education and Research Network (CERNET) IVI Translation Design and Deployment for the IPv4/IPv6 Coexistence and Transition"'>RFC6219</a>], indicate that successful transition to IPv6 can
   happen while supporting legacy IPv4 users without a full end-to-end
   dual-IP-stack deployment.  However, due to public IPv4 address
   exhaustion, this requires an IPv6 technology that supports IPv4 users
   utilizing shared IPv4 addressing, while also allowing the network
   operator to optimize their operations around IPv6 network practices.
   The use of double NAT64 translation-based solutions is an optimal way
   to address these requirements, especially in combination with
   stateless translation techniques that minimize operational challenges
   outlined in [<a href="#ref-Solutions-4v6">Solutions-4v6</a>].

   The Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T)
   architecture specified in this document is such a double stateless
   NAT64-based solution.  It builds on existing stateless NAT64
   techniques specified in [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>], along with the stateless
   algorithmic address and transport-layer port-mapping scheme defined
   in the Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)
   specification [<a href="./rfc7597" title='"Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)"'>RFC7597</a>].  The MAP-T solution differs from MAP-E in
   that MAP-T uses IPv4-IPv6 translation, rather than encapsulation, as
   the form of IPv6 domain transport.  The translation mode is
   considered advantageous in scenarios where the encapsulation
   overhead, or IPv6 operational practices (e.g., the use of IPv6-only
   servers, or reliance on IPv6 + protocol headers for traffic
   classification) rule out encapsulation.  These scenarios are
   presented in [<a href="#ref-MAP-T-Use-Cases">MAP-T-Use-Cases</a>].

   MAP-T:                  Mapping of Address and Port using
                           Translation.

   MAP Customer Edge (CE): A device functioning as a Customer Edge
                           router in a MAP deployment.  A typical MAP CE
                           adopting MAP Rules will serve a residential
                           site with one WAN-side IPv6-addressed
                           interface and one or more LAN-side interfaces
                           addressed using private IPv4 addressing.

   MAP Border Relay (BR):  A MAP-enabled router managed by the service
                           provider at the edge of a MAP domain.  A BR
                           has at least an IPv6-enabled interface and an
                           IPv4 interface connected to the native IPv4
                           network.  A MAP BR may also be referred to as
                           simply a "BR" within the context of MAP.

   MAP domain:             One or more MAP CEs and BRs connected by
                           means of an IPv6 network and sharing a common
                           set of MAP Rules.  A service provider may
                           deploy a single MAP domain or may utilize
                           multiple MAP domains.

   MAP Rule:               A set of parameters describing the mapping
                           between an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address, or
                           shared IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix or
                           address.  Each MAP domain uses a different
                           mapping rule set.

   MAP rule set:           A rule set is composed of all the MAP Rules
                           communicated to a device that are intended to
                           determine the device's IP+port mapping and
                           forwarding operations.  The MAP rule set is
                           interchangeably referred to in this document
                           as a MAP rule table or as simply a "rule
                           table".  Two specific types of rules -- the
                           Basic Mapping Rule (BMR) and the Forwarding
                           Mapping Rule (FMR) -- are defined in
                           <a href="./rfc7597#section-5">SectionÂ 5 of [RFC7597]</a>.  The Default Mapping
                           Rule (DMR) is defined in this document.

   MAP rule table:         See MAP rule set.

   MAP node:               A device that implements MAP.

   Port set:               Each node has a separate part of the
                           transport-layer port space; this is denoted
                           as a port set.

   Port Set ID (PSID):     Algorithmically identifies a set of ports
                           exclusively assigned to a CE.

   Shared IPv4 address:    An IPv4 address that is shared among multiple
                           CEs.  Only ports that belong to the assigned
                           port set can be used for communication.  Also
                           known as a port-restricted IPv4 address.

   End-user IPv6 prefix:   The IPv6 prefix assigned to an End-user CE by
                           means other than MAP itself, e.g.,
                           provisioned using DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
                           (PD) [<a href="./rfc3633" title='"IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"'>RFC3633</a>], assigned via Stateless
                           Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [<a href="./rfc4862" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>],
                           or configured manually.  It is unique for
                           each CE.

   MAP IPv6 address:       The IPv6 address used to reach the MAP
                           function of a CE from other CEs and from BRs.

   Rule IPv6 prefix:       An IPv6 prefix assigned by a service provider
                           for a MAP Rule.

   Rule IPv4 prefix:       An IPv4 prefix assigned by a service provider
                           for a MAP Rule.

   Embedded Address (EA) bits:
                           The IPv4 EA-bits in the IPv6 address identify
                           an IPv4 prefix/address (or part thereof) or a
                           shared IPv4 address (or part thereof) and a
                           Port Set Identifier.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Architecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Architecture</span>

   Figure 1 depicts the overall MAP-T architecture, which sees any
   number of privately addressed IPv4 users (N and M) connected by means
   of MAP-T CEs to an IPv6 network that is equipped with one or more
   MAP-T BRs.  CEs and BRs that share MAP configuration parameters,
   referred to as "MAP Rules", form a MAP-T domain.

   Functionally, the MAP-T CE and BR utilize and extend some
   well-established technology building blocks to allow the IPv4 users
   to correspond with nodes on the public IPv4 network or on the IPv6
   network as follows:

   o  A (NAT44) Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) [<a href="./rfc2663" title='"IP Network Address Translator (NAT) Terminology and Considerations"'>RFC2663</a>]
      function on a MAP CE is extended with support for restricting the
      allowable TCP/UDP ports for a given IPv4 address.  The IPv4
      address and port range used are determined by the MAP provisioning
      process and identical to MAP-E [<a href="./rfc7597" title='"Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)"'>RFC7597</a>].

   o  A stateless NAT64 function [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>] is extended to allow
      stateless mapping of IPv4 and transport-layer port ranges to the
      IPv6 address space.

   configured with a TCP/UDP port range that is identified by means of a
   MAP Port Set Identifier (PSID) value.  Each CE is responsible for
   forwarding traffic between a given user's private IPv4 address space
   and the MAP domain's IPv6 address space.  The IPv4-IPv6 adaptation
   uses stateless NAT64, in conjunction with the MAP algorithm for
   address computation.

   The MAP-T BR connects one or more MAP-T domains to external IPv4
   networks using stateless NAT64 as extended by the MAP-T behavior
   described in this document.

   In contrast to MAP-E, NAT64 technology is used in the architecture
   for two purposes.  First, it is intended to diminish encapsulation
   overhead and allow IPv4 and IPv6 traffic to be treated as similarly
   as possible.  Second, it is intended to allow IPv4-only nodes to
   correspond directly with IPv6 nodes in the MAP-T domain that have
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses as per [<a href="./rfc6052" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>].

   The MAP-T architecture is based on the following key properties:

   1.  Algorithmic IPv4-IPv6 address mapping codified as MAP Rules, as
       described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>

   2.  A MAP IPv6 address identifier, as described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>

   3.  MAP-T IPv4-IPv6 forwarding behavior, as described in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>

   The MAP-T algorithmic mapping rules are identical to those in
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> of the MAP-E specification [<a href="./rfc7597" title='"Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)"'>RFC7597</a>], with the following
   exception: the forwarding of traffic to and from IPv4 destinations
   outside a MAP-T domain is to be performed as described in this
   document, instead of <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a> of the MAP-E specification.

   IPv4 traffic sent by MAP nodes that are all within one MAP domain is
   translated to IPv6, with the sender's MAP IPv6 address, derived via
   the Basic Mapping Rule (BMR), as the IPv6 source address and the
   recipient's MAP IPv6 address, derived via the Forwarding Mapping Rule
   (FMR), as the IPv6 destination address.

   IPv4-addressed destinations outside of the MAP domain are represented
   by means of IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses as per [<a href="./rfc6052" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>], using the
   BR's IPv6 prefix.  For a CE sending traffic to any such destination,
   the source address of the IPv6 packet will be that of the CE's MAP
   IPv6 address, and the destination IPv6 address will be the

   destination IPv4-embedded IPv6 address.  This address mapping is said
   to be following the MAP-T Default Mapping Rule (DMR) and is defined
   in terms of the IPv6 prefix advertised by one or more BRs, which
   provide external connectivity.  A typical MAP-T CE will install an
   IPv4 default route using this rule.  A BR will use this rule when
   translating all outside IPv4 source addresses to the IPv6 MAP domain.

   The DMR IPv6 prefix length SHOULD be 64 bits long by default and in
   any case MUST NOT exceed 96 bits.  The mapping of the IPv4
   destination behind the IPv6 prefix will by default follow the /64
   rule as per [<a href="./rfc6052" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>].  Any trailing bits after the IPv4 address are
   set to 0x0.

   The interface identifier format of a MAP-T node is the same as the
   format described in <a href="./rfc7597#section-6">SectionÂ 6 of [RFC7597]</a>.  The format diagram is
   provided here for convenience:

                   |          128-n-o-s bits          |

                   +--------+----------------+--------+

                    Figure 2: IPv6 Interface Identifier

   In the case of an IPv4 prefix, the IPv4 address field is right-padded
   with zeros up to 32 bits.  The PSID is left-padded with zeros to
   create a 16-bit field.  For an IPv4 prefix or a complete IPv4
   address, the PSID field is zero.

   If the End-user IPv6 prefix length is larger than 64, the most
   significant parts of the interface identifier are overwritten by the
   prefix.

   For a given MAP domain, the BR and CE MUST be configured with the
   following MAP parameters.  The values for these parameters are
   identical for all CEs and BRs within a given MAP-T domain.

   o  The Basic Mapping Rule and, optionally, the Forwarding Mapping
      Rules, including the Rule IPv6 prefix, Rule IPv4 prefix, and
      Length of embedded address bits

   o  Use of hub-and-spoke mode or Mesh mode (if all traffic should be
      sent to the BR, or if direct CE-to-CE correspondence should be
      supported)

   o  Use of IPv4-IPv6 translation (MAP-T)

   o  The BR's IPv6 prefix used in the DMR

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.1.%20%20MAP%20CE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" id="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  MAP CE</span>

   For a given MAP domain, the MAP configuration parameters are the same
   across all CEs within that domain.  These values may be conveyed and
   configured on the CEs using a variety of methods, including DHCPv6,
   the Broadband Forum's "TR-69" Residential Gateway management
   interface [<a href="#ref-TR069" title='"CPE WAN Management Protocol"'>TR069</a>], the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), or
   manual configuration.  This document does not prescribe any of these
   methods but recommends that a MAP CE SHOULD implement DHCPv6 options
   as per [<a href="./rfc7598" title='"DHCPv6 Options for Configuration of Softwire Address and Port-Mapped Clients"'>RFC7598</a>].  Other configuration and management methods may use
   the data model described by this option for consistency and
   convenience of implementation on CEs that support multiple
   configuration methods.

   Besides the MAP configuration parameters, a CE requires an IPv6
   prefix to be assigned to the CE.  This End-user IPv6 prefix is
   configured as part of obtaining IPv6 Internet access and is acquired
   using standard IPv6 means applicable in the network where the CE is
   located.

   The MAP provisioning parameters, and hence the IPv4 service itself,
   are tied to the End-user IPv6 prefix; thus, the MAP service is also
   tied to this in terms of authorization, accounting, etc.

   A single MAP CE MAY be connected to more than one MAP domain, just as
   any router may have more than one IPv4-enabled service-provider-
   facing interface and more than one set of associated addresses
   assigned by DHCPv6.  Each domain within which a given CE operates

   generate its own IPv4 address.  Each MAP domain requires a distinct
   End-user IPv6 prefix.

   The MAP BR MUST be configured with the same MAP elements as the MAP
   CEs operating within the same domain.

   For increased reliability and load balancing, the BR IPv6 prefix MAY
   be shared across a given MAP domain.  As MAP is stateless, any BR may
   be used for forwarding to/from the domain at any time.

   Since MAP uses provider address space, no specific IPv6 or IPv4
   routes need to be advertised externally outside the service
   provider's network for MAP to operate.  However, the BR prefix needs
   to be advertised in the service provider's IGP.

   The end-to-end packet flow in MAP-T involves an IPv4 or IPv6 packet
   being forwarded by a CE or BR in one of two directions for each such
   case.  This section presents a conceptual view of the operations
   involved in such forwarding.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.1.%20%20IPv4%20to%20IPv6%20at%20the%20CE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" id="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  IPv4 to IPv6 at the CE</span>

   A MAP-T CE receiving IPv4 packets SHOULD perform NAPT44 processing
   and create any necessary NAPT44 bindings.  The source address and
   source port range of packets resulting from the NAPT44 processing
   MUST correspond to the source IPv4 address and source transport port
   range assigned to the CE by means of the MAP Basic Mapping Rule
   (BMR).

   The IPv4 packet is subject to a longest IPv4 destination address +
   port match MAP Rule selection, which then determines the parameters
   for the subsequent NAT64 operation.  By default, all traffic is
   matched to the DMR and is subject to the stateless NAT64 operation
   using the DMR parameters for NAT64 (<a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>).  Packets that are
   matched to (optional) Forwarding Mapping Rules (FMRs) are subject to
   the stateless NAT64 operation using the FMR parameters (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>)
   for the MAP algorithm.  In all cases, the CE's MAP IPv6 address
   (<a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>) is used as a source address.

   A MAP-T CE MUST support a Default Mapping Rule and SHOULD support one
   or more Forwarding Mapping Rules.

   A MAP-T CE receiving an IPv6 packet performs its regular IPv6
   operations (filtering, pre-routing, etc.).  Only packets that are
   addressed to the CE's MAP-T IPv6 addresses, and with source addresses
   matching the IPv6 MAP Rule prefixes of a DMR or FMR, are processed by
   the MAP-T CE, with the DMR or FMR being selected based on a longest
   match.  The CE MUST check that each MAP-T received packet's
   transport-layer destination port number is in the range allowed for
   by the CE's MAP BMR configuration.  The CE MUST silently drop any
   nonconforming packet and increment an appropriate counter.  When
   receiving a packet whose source IP address longest matches an FMR
   prefix, the CE MUST perform a check of consistency of the source
   address against the allowed values as per the derived allocated
   source port range.  If the source port number of a packet is found to
   be outside the allocated range, the CE MUST drop the packet and
   SHOULD respond with an ICMPv6 "Destination Unreachable, source
   address failed ingress/egress policy" (Type 1, Code 5).

   For each MAP-T processed packet, the CE's NAT64 function MUST compute
   an IPv4 source and destination address.  The IPv4 destination address
   is computed by extracting relevant information from the IPv6
   destination and the information stored in the BMR as per <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.
   The IPv4 source address is formed by classifying a packet's source as
   longest matching a DMR or FMR rule prefix, and then using the
   respective rule parameters for the NAT64 operation.

   The resulting IPv4 packet is then forwarded to the CE's NAPT44
   function, where the destination IPv4 address and port number MUST be
   mapped to their original value before being forwarded according to
   the CE's regular IPv4 rules.  When the NAPT44 function is not
   enabled, by virtue of MAP configuration, the traffic from the
   stateless NAT64 function is directly forwarded according to the CE's
   IPv4 rules.

   A MAP-T BR receiving an IPv6 packet MUST select a matching MAP Rule
   based on a longest address match of the packet's source address
   against the MAP Rules present on the BR.  In combination with the
   Port Set ID derived from the packet's source IPv6 address, the
   selected MAP Rule allows the BR to verify that the CE is using its
   allowed address and port range.  Thus, the BR MUST perform a
   validation of the consistency of the source against the allowed
   values from the identified port range.  If the packet's source port
   number is found to be outside the range allowed, the BR MUST drop the

   packet and increment a counter to indicate the event.  The BR SHOULD
   also respond with an ICMPv6 "Destination Unreachable, source address
   failed ingress/egress policy" (Type 1, Code 5).

   When constructing the IPv4 packet, the BR MUST derive the source and
   destination IPv4 addresses as per <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> of this document and
   translate the IPv6-to-IPv4 headers as per [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>].  The resulting
   IPv4 packet is then passed to regular IPv4 forwarding.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.4.%20%20IPv4%20to%20IPv6%20at%20the%20BR"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.4" id="section-8.4">8.4</a>.  IPv4 to IPv6 at the BR</span>

   A MAP-T BR receiving IPv4 packets uses a longest match IPv4 +
   transport-layer port lookup to identify the target MAP-T domain and
   select the FMR and DMR rules.  The MAP-T BR MUST then compute and
   apply the IPv6 destination addresses from the IPv4 destination
   address and port as per the selected FMR.  The MAP-T BR MUST also
   compute and apply the IPv6 source addresses from the IPv4 source
   address as per <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> (i.e., using the IPv4 source and the BR's
   IPv6 prefix, it forms an IPv6-embedded IPv4 address).  The generic
   IPv4-to-IPv6 header translation procedures outlined in [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>]
   apply throughout.  The resulting IPv6 packets are then passed to
   regular IPv6 forwarding.

   Note that the operation of a BR, when forwarding to/from MAP-T
   domains that are defined without IPv4 address sharing, is the same as
   that of stateless NAT64 IPv4/IPv6 translation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20ICMP%20Handling"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  ICMP Handling</span>

   MAP-T CEs and BRs MUST follow ICMP/ICMPv6 translation as per
   [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>]; however, additional behavior is also required due to the
   presence of NAPT44.  Unlike TCP and UDP, which provide two transport-
   protocol port fields to represent both source and destination, the
   ICMP/ICMPv6 [<a href="./rfc792" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol"'>RFC792</a>] [<a href="./rfc4443" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC4443</a>] Query message header has only one ID
   field, which needs to be used to identify a sending IPv4 host.  When
   receiving IPv4 ICMP messages, the MAP-T CE MUST rewrite the ID field
   to a port value derived from the CE's Port Set ID.

   A MAP-T BR receiving an IPv4 ICMP packet that contains an ID field
   that is bound for a shared address in the MAP-T domain SHOULD use the
   ID value as a substitute for the destination port in determining the
   IPv6 destination address.  In all other cases, the MAP-T BR MUST
   derive the destination IPv6 address by simply mapping the destination
   IPv4 address without additional port information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10.%20%20Fragmentation%20and%20Path%20MTU%20Discovery"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" id="section-10">10</a>.  Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery</span>

   Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 headers, handling the
   maximum packet size is relevant for the operation of any system
   connecting the two address families.  There are three mechanisms to
   handle this issue: Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and
   transport-layer negotiation such as the TCP Maximum Segment Size
   (MSS) option [<a href="./rfc879" title='"The TCP Maximum Segment Size and Related Topics"'>RFC879</a>].  MAP can use all three mechanisms to deal with
   different cases.

   Note: The NAT64 [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>] mechanism is not lossless.  When
   IPv4-originated communication traverses a double NAT64 function
   (a.k.a. NAT464), any IPv4-originated ICMP-independent Path MTU
   Discovery, as specified in [<a href="./rfc4821" title='"Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery"'>RFC4821</a>], ceases to be entirely reliable.
   This is because the DF=1/MF=1 combination as defined in [<a href="./rfc4821" title='"Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery"'>RFC4821</a>]
   results in DF=0/MF=1 after a double NAT64 translation.

   Translating an IPv4 packet to carry it across the MAP domain will
   increase its size (typically by 20 bytes).  The MTU in the MAP domain
   should be well managed, and the IPv6 MTU on the CE WAN-side interface
   SHOULD be configured so that no fragmentation occurs within the
   boundary of the MAP domain.

   Fragmentation in MAP-T domains SHOULD be handled as described in
   Sections <a href="#section-4">4</a> and <a href="#section-5">5</a> of [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>].

   The forwarding of an IPv4 packet received from outside of the MAP
   domain requires the IPv4 destination address and the transport-
   protocol destination port.  The transport-protocol information is
   only available in the first fragment received.  As described in
   <a href="./rfc6346#section-5.3.3">SectionÂ 5.3.3 of [RFC6346]</a>, a MAP node receiving an IPv4 fragmented
   packet from outside SHOULD reassemble the packet before sending the
   packet onto the MAP domain.  If the first packet received contains
   the transport-protocol information, it is possible to optimize this
   behavior by using a cache and forwarding the fragments unchanged.  A
   description of such a caching algorithm is outside the scope of this
   document.

   Two IPv4 hosts behind two different MAP CEs with the same IPv4

   resulting in incorrect reassembly of the fragments at the destination

   field, it can be used similarly to port ranges.  Thus, a MAP CE
   SHOULD rewrite the IPv4 fragmentation identifier to a value

   The MAP solution supports the use and configuration of domains where
   a BMR expresses an EA-bit length of 0.  This results in independence
   between the IPv6 prefix assigned to the CE and the IPv4 address
   and/or port range used by MAP.  The k-bits of PSID information may in
   this case be derived from the BMR.

   The constraint imposed is that each such MAP domain be composed of
   just one MAP CE that has a predetermined IPv6 end-user prefix.  The
   BR would be configured with an FMR for each such Customer Premises
   Equipment (CPE), where the rule would uniquely associate the IPv4
   address + optional PSID and the IPv6 prefix of that given CE.

   The hub-and-spoke mode of communication, whereby all traffic sent by
   a MAP-T CE is forwarded via a BR, and the Mesh mode, whereby a CE is
   directly able to forward traffic to another CE, are governed by the
   activation of Forwarding Mapping Rules that cover the IPv4-prefix
   destination and port-index range.  By default, a MAP CE configured
   only with a BMR, as per this specification, will use it to configure
   its IPv4 parameters and IPv6 MAP address without enabling Mesh mode.

   By default, MAP-T allows communication between both IPv4-only and any
   IPv6-enabled devices, as well as with native IPv6-only servers,
   provided that the servers are configured with an IPv4-mapped IPv6
   address.  This address could be part of the IPv6 prefix used by the
   DMR in the MAP-T domain.  Such IPv6 servers (e.g., an HTTP server or
   a web content cache device) are thus able to serve IPv6 users and

   The MAP-T CE's NAT64 function is by default compatible for use with
   [<a href="./rfc6146" title='"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6146</a>] stateful NAT64 devices that are placed in the operator's
   network.  In such a case, the MAP-T CE's DMR prefix is configured to
   correspond to the NAT64 device prefix.  This in effect allows the use
   of MAP-T CEs in environments that need to perform statistical
   multiplexing of IPv4 addresses, while utilizing stateful NAT64
   devices, and can take the role of a customer-side translator (CLAT)
   as defined in [<a href="./rfc6877" title='"464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation"'>RFC6877</a>].

   Spoofing attacks:  With consistency checks between IPv4 and IPv6
      sources that are performed on IPv4/IPv6 packets received by MAP
      nodes, MAP does not introduce any new opportunity for spoofing
      attacks that would not already exist in IPv6.

   Denial-of-service attacks:  In MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are
      shared, the fact that IPv4 datagram reassembly may be necessary
      introduces an opportunity for DoS attacks.  This is inherent in
      address sharing and is common with other address-sharing
      approaches such as Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) and NAT64/DNS64.  The
      best protection against such attacks is to accelerate IPv6 support
      in both clients and servers.

   Routing loop attacks:  Routing loop attacks may exist in some
      "automatic tunneling" scenarios and are documented in [<a href="./rfc6324" title='"Routing Loop Attack Using IPv6 Automatic Tunnels: Problem Statement and Proposed Mitigations"'>RFC6324</a>].
      They cannot exist with MAP because each BR checks that the IPv6
      source address of a received IPv6 packet is a CE address based on
      the Forwarding Mapping Rule.

   Attacks facilitated by restricted port set:  From hosts that are not
      subject to ingress filtering [<a href="./rfc2827" title='"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing"'>RFC2827</a>], an attacker can inject
      spoofed packets during ongoing transport connections [<a href="./rfc4953" title='"Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks"'>RFC4953</a>]
      [<a href="./rfc5961" title="&quot;Improving TCP's Robustness to Blind In-Window Attacks&quot;">RFC5961</a>] [<a href="./rfc6056" title='"Recommendations for Transport- Protocol Port Randomization"'>RFC6056</a>].  The attacks depend on guessing which ports
      are currently used by target hosts.  Using an unrestricted port
      set is preferable, i.e., using native IPv6 connections that are
      not subject to MAP port-range restrictions.  To minimize these
      types of attacks when using a restricted port set, the MAP CE's
      NAT44 filtering behavior SHOULD be "Address-Dependent Filtering"
      as described in <a href="./rfc4787#section-5">SectionÂ 5 of [RFC4787]</a>.  Furthermore, the MAP CEs
      SHOULD use a DNS transport proxy function to handle DNS traffic

      MAP-T.  Practicalities of these methods are discussed in
      Section 5.9 of [<a href="#ref-Stateless-4Via6">Stateless-4Via6</a>].

   ICMP Flooding:  Given the necessity to process and translate ICMP and
      ICMPv6 messages by the BR and CE nodes, a foreseeable attack
      vector is that of a flood of such messages leading to a saturation
      of the node's ICMP computing resources.  This attack vector is not
      specific to MAP, and its mitigation lies in a combination of
      policing the rate of ICMP messages, policing the rate at which
      such messages can get processed by the MAP nodes, and of course
      identifying and blocking off the source(s) of such traffic.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Examples%20of%20MAP-T%20Translation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Examples of MAP-T Translation</span>

   Example 1 - Basic Mapping Rule:

   Given the following MAP domain information and IPv6 end-user prefix
   assigned to a MAP CE:

   End-user IPv6 prefix:  2001:db8:0012:3400::/56
   Basic Mapping Rule:    {2001:db8:0000::/40 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
                           192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix),
                           16 (Rule EA-bit length)}
   PSID length:           (16 - (32 - 24) = 8 (sharing ratio of 256)
   PSID offset:           6 (default)

   A MAP node (CE or BR) can, via the BMR or equivalent FMR, determine
   the IPv4 address and port set as shown below:

   EA bits offset:        40
   IPv4 suffix bits (p):  Length of IPv4 address (32) -
                          IPv4 prefix length (24) = 8
   IPv4 address:          192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)
   PSID start:            40 + p = 40 + 8 = 48
   PSID length (q):       o - p = (End-user prefix len -
                          Rule IPv6 prefix len) - p
                          = (56 - 40) - 8 = 8
   PSID:                  0x34

   Available ports (63 ranges): 1232-1235, 2256-2259, ...... ,
                                63696-63699, 64720-64723

   The BMR information allows a MAP CE to determine (complete) its
   IPv6 address within the indicated End-user IPv6 prefix.

   IPv6 address of MAP CE:  2001:db8:0012:3400:0000:c000:0212:0034

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7599">RFC 7599</a>                          MAP-T                        July 2015</span>


   Example 2 - BR:

   Another example is a MAP-T BR configured with the following FMR
   when receiving a packet with the following characteristics:

   IPv4 source address:       10.2.3.4 (0x0a020304)
   TCP source port:           80
   IPv4 destination address:  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)
   TCP destination port:      1232

   Forwarding Mapping Rule:   {2001:db8::/40 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
                               192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix),
                               16 (Rule EA-bit length)}

   MAP-T BR Prefix (DMR):     2001:db8:ffff::/64

   The above information allows the BR to derive the mapped destination
   IPv6 address for the corresponding MAP-T CE, and also the source
   IPv6 address for the mapped IPv4 source address, as follows:

   IPv4 suffix bits (p):     32 - 24 = 8 (18 (0x12))
   PSID length:              8
   PSID:  0                  x34 (1232)

   The resulting IPv6 packet will have the following header fields:

   IPv6 source address:      2001:db8:ffff:0:000a:0203:0400::
   IPv6 destination address: 2001:db8:0012:3400:0000:c000:0212:0034
   TCP source port:          80
   TCP destination port:     1232


   Example 3 - FMR:

   An IPv4 host behind a MAP-T CE (configured as per the previous
   examples) corresponding with IPv4 host 10.2.3.4 will have its
   packets converted into IPv6 using the DMR configured on the MAP-T
   CE as follows:

   Default Mapping Rule:         {2001:db8:ffff::/64 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
                                  0.0.0.0/0 (Rule IPv4 prefix)}

   IPv4 source address:          192.0.2.18
   IPv4 destination address:     10.2.3.4
   IPv4 source port:             1232
   IPv4 destination port:        80
   MAP-T CE IPv6 source address: 2001:db8:0012:3400:0000:c000:0212:0034
   IPv6 destination address:     2001:db8:ffff:0:000a:0203:0400::

   Example 4 - Rule with no embedded address bits and no address
   sharing:

   End-user IPv6 prefix:    2001:db8:0012:3400::/56
   Basic Mapping Rule:      {2001:db8:0012:3400::/56 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
                             192.0.2.1/32 (Rule IPv4 prefix),
                             0 (Rule EA-bit length)}
   PSID length:             0 (sharing ratio is 1)
   PSID offset:             n/a

   A MAP node can, via the BMR or equivalent FMR, determine the
   IPv4 address and port set as shown below:

   EA bits offset:          0
   IPv4 suffix bits (p):    Length of IPv4 address -
                            IPv4 prefix length = 32 - 32 = 0
   IPv4 address:            192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)
   PSID start:              0
   PSID length:             0
   PSID:                    null

   The BMR information allows a MAP CE to also determine (complete) its
   full IPv6 address by combining the IPv6 prefix with the MAP interface
   identifier (that embeds the IPv4 address).

   IPv6 address of MAP CE:  2001:db8:0012:3400:0000:c000:0201:0000

   Example 5 - Rule with no embedded address bits and address sharing
   (sharing ratio of 256):

   End-user IPv6 prefix:    2001:db8:0012:3400::/56
   Basic Mapping Rule:      {2001:db8:0012:3400::/56 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
                             192.0.2.18/32 (Rule IPv4 prefix),
                             0 (Rule EA-bit length)}
   PSID length:             (16 - (32 - 24)) = 8 (sharing ratio of 256;
                            provisioned with DHCPv6)
   PSID offset:             6 (default)
   PSID:                    0x20 (provisioned with DHCPv6)

   A MAP node can, via the BMR, determine the IPv4 address and port set
   as shown below:

   EA bits offset:          0
   IPv4 suffix bits (p):    Length of IPv4 address -
                            IPv4 prefix length = 32 - 32 = 0
   IPv4 address             192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)
   PSID start:              0
   PSID length:             8
   PSID:                    0x34

   Available ports (63 ranges): 1232-1235, 2256-2259, ...... ,
                                63696-63699, 64720-64723

   The BMR information allows a MAP CE to also determine (complete) its
   full IPv6 address by combining the IPv6 prefix with the MAP interface
   identifier (that embeds the IPv4 address and PSID).

   IPv6 address of MAP CE:  2001:db8:0012:3400:0000:c000:0212:0034

   Note that the IPv4 address and PSID are not derived from the IPv6
   prefix assigned to the CE but are provisioned separately, using, for
   example, MAP options in DHCPv6.
