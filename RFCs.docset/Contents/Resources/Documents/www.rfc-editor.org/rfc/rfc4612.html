<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   ITU-T Recommendation T.38 [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Procedures for real-time Group 3 facsimile communication over IP networks"'>1</a>] defines the Internet Facsimile Protocol
   (IFP) for carriage of facsimile data over IP networks.  As one
   option, IFP packets may be carried within an RTP [<a href="#ref-3" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>3</a>] stream, either
   as the only content within the media stream or switched with other
   audio payload types.

   This memo provides rationale for using RTP as a transport for fax
   signaling and specifies the MIME type associated with said signaling.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Conventions%20Used%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>4</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Mechanisms%20for%20Transporting%20T.38%20over%20an%20IP%20Network"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Mechanisms for Transporting T.38 over an IP Network</span>

   When T.38 was first approved in 1998, it allowed for the transport of
   T.38 via UDP (using UDP Transport Layer (UDPTL), rather than RTP) or
   TCP.  As of the time of this publication, UDPTL is the predominant
   means for transporting T.38 data over an IP network.  In support of
   that, <a href="./rfc3362">RFC 3362</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Real-time Facsimile (T.38) - image/t38 MIME Sub- type Registration"'>11</a>] was published in order to allow devices to signal
   their desire to use UDPTL to transport T.38.

   A number of issues were raised with respect to the usage of UDPTL for
   the long-term, though.  Specifically, there were concerns over the
   fact that UDPTL does not provide the same kind of statistics
   reporting as RTP Control Protocol (RTCP).  Further, there are no
   procedures in place for encrypting and protecting the integrity of
   the UDPTL stream.  While the latter could be addressed in UDPTL,
   doing so would require a lot of effort and would largely be a
   duplication of the security work already completed within the IETF;
   e.g., Secure RTP (SRTP) [<a href="#ref-10" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>10</a>].

   There are clear advantages in using RTP for T.38 today.  For example,
   using RTP allows one to take advantage of the redundancy [<a href="#ref-12" title='"RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data"'>12</a>], header
   compression [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links"'>13</a>][14], and other RTP-related work within the IETF.
   Using RTP, as opposed to UDPTL, for transport provides better
   interoperability with a wider range of devices that know and
   understand RTP.  This includes applications such as firewalls,
   Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, and gateways that bridge
   two IP networks, which generally support RTP before most other real-
   time media.






<span class="grey">Jones &amp; Tamura                  Historic                        [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-3"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4612">RFC 4612</a>        Real-time Facsimile (T.38) - audio /t38      August 2006</span>


   Lastly, since today most T.38 data is generated by gateways that
   bridge two Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) networks, it is
   quite natural to expect that the transition from audio to fax should
   happen within the same media stream.  The reason is that the T.38
   data is simply an alternative representation of information received
   on the PSTN circuit.  If the T.38 data is encapsulated in RTP, the
   gateways can easily transition from audio to fax and back again and
   can simply use the payload type to indicate the type of media that it
   is currently transmitting.

   With these considerations in mind, the ITU-T amended T.38 [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Procedures for real-time Group 3 facsimile communication over IP networks"'>1</a>] to
   allow RTP to be used to transport T.38.  With that, a new MIME
   registration (audio/t38) is needed to allow for T.38 to be switched
   along with audio within the same RTP session.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   One new MIME type and associated RTP payload format has been
   registered, by the IANA as described below.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media
   type audio/t38

   MIME media type name: audio

   MIME subtype name: t38

   Required parameters:

      rate:  The RTP timestamp clock rate, which SHOULD be 8000Hz.  The
      clock frequency MAY be set to any value, but it SHOULD be set to
      the same value as that for any audio packets in the same RTP
      stream in order to avoid RTP timestamp rate switching.

      T38FaxRateManagement: Indicates the fax rate management model as
      defined in T.38.  Values may be "localTCF" or "transferredTCF".
      This parameter is defined in ITU-T Recommendation T.38.

   Optional parameters:

      T38FaxFillBitRemoval: Indicates the capability to remove and
      insert fill bits in Phase C (refer to [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Procedures for document facsimile transmission in the general switched telephone network"'>6</a>]), non-ECM data to reduce
      bandwidth.  This is a boolean parameter (inclusion = true,
      exclusion = false).  This parameter is defined in ITU-T
      Recommendation T.38.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4612">RFC 4612</a>        Real-time Facsimile (T.38) - audio /t38      August 2006</span>


      T38FaxTranscodingMMR: Indicates the ability to convert to/from MMR
      from/to the line format for increasing the compression of the data
      and reducing the bandwidth in the packet network.  This is a
      boolean parameter (inclusion = true, exclusion = false).  This
      parameter is defined in ITU-T Recommendation T.38.

      T38FaxTranscodingJBIG: Indicates the ability to convert to/from
      JBIG to reduce bandwidth.  This is a boolean parameter (inclusion
      = true, exclusion = false).  This parameter is defined in ITU-T
      Recommendation T.38.

      T38FaxVersion: This is the version number of ITU-T Rec. T.38.  New
      versions shall be compatible with previous versions.  Absence of
      this parameter indicates version 0.  The version is expressed as
      an integer value.  This parameter is defined in ITU-T
      Recommendation T.38.

      T38FaxMaxBuffer: Indicates the maximum number of octets that can
      be stored on the remote device before an overflow condition
      occurs.  It is the responsibility of the transmitting application
      to limit the transfer rate to prevent an overflow.  The negotiated
      data rate should be used to determine the rate at which data is
      being removed from the buffer.  Value is an integer.  This
      parameter is defined in ITU-T Recommendation T.38.

      T38FaxMaxDatagram: The maximum size of the payload within an RTP
      packet that can be accepted by the remote device.  This is an
      integer value.  This parameter is defined in ITU-T Recommendation
      T.38.

   Encoding considerations:

      The encoding of the IFP RTP packets is defined in ITU-T
      Recommendation T.38.  This sub-type is not intended for use with
      e-mail.

   Security considerations:

      See <a href="./rfc4612#section-6">Section 6 of RFC 4612</a>.

   Interoperability considerations:

      ITU-T Recommendation T.38 defines the procedures, syntax, and
      parameters for the carriage of T.38 over RTP within the context of
      H.323 [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Packet-based multimedia communications systems"'>8</a>], SIP [<a href="#ref-9" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>9</a>], and H.248 [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Gateway Control Protocol"'>7</a>] systems.

   The MIME information described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> is utilized in SDP in
   order to establish T.38 media streams.  Specifically:

   o  The MIME type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The MIME subtype ("t38") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
      name.

   o  The parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as clock rate.

   The MIME type defines several required and optional parameters to
   qualify the operation of T.38; these are to be used as defined in <a href="./rfc3555">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3555">3555</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"MIME Type Registration of RTP Payload Formats"'>5</a>], Section 2.  The parameters are provided as a semi-colon
   separated list of "parameter" or "parameter=value" pairs using the
   "a=fmtp" parameter defined in SDP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>2</a>]; the "parameter" form is used
   for boolean values, where presence equals "true" and absence "false".

   Consider the following example, which describes a media stream that
   allows the transport of G.711 audio and T.38 fax information:

   m=audio 6800 RTP/AVP 0 98 a=rtpmap:98 t38/8000 a=fmtp:98
   T38FaxVersion=2;T38FaxRateManagement=transferredTCF

   T.38 is vulnerable to attacks that are common to other types of RTP
   and SRTP payloads.  However, unlike audio, T.38 data may be
   manipulated in ways that are more obtrusive than audio.  For example,
   rogue packets may cause transmission failure, and manipulated packets
   may alter terminal identity.

   The security considerations discussed in the RTP specification and
   any applicable RTP profile (for example, [<a href="#ref-10" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>10</a>]) are applicable to
   T.38.  Regarding SRTP configuration, fax payloads SHOULD NOT use an
   HMAC-SHA1 authentication tag that is shorter than 80 bits.
