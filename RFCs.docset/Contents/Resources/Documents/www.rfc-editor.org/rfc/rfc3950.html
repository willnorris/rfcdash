   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this
   section as background information, the reader is directed to the
   original TIFF-FX specification (File Format for Internet Fax) to
   obtain complete feature and technical details.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20TIFF-FX%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  TIFF-FX Scope</span>

   This document defines a TIFF-based file format specification for
   enabling standardized messaging-based fax over the Internet.  It
   specifies the TIFF fields and field values required for compatibility
   with the existing ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 black-and-white,
   grayscale and color facsimile.  TIFF has historically been used for
   handling fax image files in applications such as store-and-forward
   messaging.  Implementations that support this file format
   specification for import/export may elect to support it as a native
   format.  This document recommends a TIFF file structure that is
   compatible with low-memory and page-level streaming implementations.

   Unless otherwise noted, the current TIFF specification [<a href="#ref-TIFF" title="June 3">TIFF</a>] and
   selected TIFF Technical Notes [<a href="#ref-TTN1" title="1995">TTN1</a>, <a href="#ref-TTN2" title="2002">TTN2</a>] are the primary references
   for describing TIFF and defining TIFF fields.  This document is the
   primary reference for defining TIFF field values for fax
   applications.

   Some of the features of TIFF-FX are:

   -  TIFF-FX is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-
      color, full-color and mixed content image data.

   -  TIFF-FX includes a number of compression schemes that allow
      developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff for their
      applications.

   -  TIFF-FX is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as
      new needs arise.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20MIME%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  MIME Definition</span>

   This document defines the image/tiff-fx MIME sub-type to refer to
   TIFF-FX Profiles J, C, L and M encoded image data and any future
   TIFF-FX extensions, or a subset.  The image/tiff-fx content type MAY
   be used when black-and-white image data is encoded using TIFF-FX
   Profiles S or F, or a subset, however, the image/tiff content type
   SHOULD be used.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/tiff-fx

   MIME media type name: image

   MIME subtype name: tiff-fx

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding Considerations:

      This media type consists of binary data.  The base64 encoding
      should be used on transports that cannot accommodate binary data
      directly.

   Security considerations:

      TIFF-FX utilizes a structure which can store image data and
      attributes of this image data.  The fields defined in the TIFF-FX
      specification are of a descriptive nature and provide information
      that is useful to facilitate viewing and rendering of images by a
      recipient.  As such, the fields currently defined in the TIFF-FX
      specification do not in themselves create additional security
      risks, since the fields are not used to induce any particular
      behavior by the recipient application.

      TIFF-FX has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically
      possible that fields could be defined in the future which could be
      used to induce particular actions on the part of the recipient,
      thus presenting additional security risks, but this type of
      capability is not supported in the referenced TIFF-FX
      specification.  Indeed, the definition of fields which would
      include such processing instructions is inconsistent with the
      goals and spirit of the TIFF-FX specification.

      The MIME type and file extension defined by this document MUST NOT
      be used to blindly select a processing program.  It is up to the
      implementation to determine the application (if necessary) and
      render the image to the user.

   Interoperability considerations:

      The ability of implementations to handle all the defined
      applications (or profiles within applications) of TIFF-FX may not
      be ubiquitous.  As a result, implementations may decode and
      attempt to display the encoded TIFF-FX image data only to
      determine that the image cannot be rendered.

   Published specification:

      TIFF-FX (Tag Image File Format Fax eXtended) is defined in:

      R., Venable, D., McIntyre, L., Parsons, G., and J. Rafferty.

   Applications which use this media type:

      Imaging, fax, messaging and multi-media
