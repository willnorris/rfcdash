   This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>] for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on de-jitter buffer
   configuration and performance.

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end-system
   metrics defined in [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

   Instances of this metrics block refer by synchronization source
   (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information Block
   [<a href="./rfc6776" title='"Measurement Identity and Information Reporting Using a Source Description (SDES) Item and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block"'>RFC6776</a>], which contains information such as the SSRC of the
   measured stream, and RTP sequence numbers and time intervals
   indicating the span of the report.

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>]
   defines an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].

   "Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"
   [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] provides guidance on the definition and specification of

   Framework" [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>] provides guidance on the reporting block format
   using RTCP XR.  Metrics described in this document are in accordance
   with the guidelines in [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>]and [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

   Real-time applications employ a de-jitter buffer [<a href="./rfc5481" title='"Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement"'>RFC5481</a>] to absorb
   jitter introduced on the path from source to destination.  These
   metrics are used to report how the de-jitter buffer at the receiving
   end of the RTP stream behaves as a result of jitter in the network;
   they are applicable to a range of RTP applications.

   These metrics correspond to terminal-related factors that affect
   real-time application quality and are useful for providing a better
   end-user quality of experience (QoE) when these terminal-related
   factors are used as inputs to calculate QoE metrics [<a href="#ref-QMB" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Blocks for QoE Metric Reporting"'>QMB</a>].

   A de-jitter buffer is required to absorb delay variation in the
   network delivery of media packets.  A de-jitter buffer works by
   holding media data for a period of time after it is received and
   before it is played out.  Packets that arrive early are held in the
   de-jitter buffer longer.  If packets arrive too early, they may be
   discarded if there is no available de-jitter buffer space.  If
   packets are delayed excessively by the network, they may be discarded
   if they miss their playout time.

   The de-jitter buffer can be considered a time window with the early
   edge aligned with the delay corresponding to the earliest arriving
   packet and the late edge representing the maximum permissible delay
   before a late arriving packet would be discarded.  The delay applied
   to packets that arrive on time or at their expected arrival time is
   known as the nominal delay, and this is equivalent to the time
   difference/buffer size difference between the insertion point of the
   on-time packets and the point at which the packets are read out.

   The reference for the expected arrival time may be, for example, the
   first packet in the session or the running average delay.  If all
   packets arrived at their expected arrival time, then every packet
   would be held in the de-jitter buffer exactly the nominal delay.

   The de-jitter buffer maximum delay is the delay that is applied to
   the earliest arriving packet that is not discarded and corresponds to
   the early edge of the de-jitter buffer time window.

   In practice, de-jitter buffer implementations vary considerably;
   however, they should behave in a manner conceptually consistent with
   an idealized de-jitter buffer, which is described as follows:











<span class="grey">Clark, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>

   (i)    Receive the first packet and delay playout by D ms.  Keep the
          RTP timestamp (TS) and receive time as a reference.

          RTP TS[1]

          receive time[1]

          Assume that both are normalized in ticks (there are 10,000
          ticks in a millisecond).

   (ii)   Receive the next packet.

   (iii)  Calculate r = RTP TS[n] - RTP TS[1] and t = receive time[n] -
          receive time[1].  If r == t, then the packet arrived on time.
          If r &lt; t, then the packet arrived late, and if r &gt; t, then the
          packet arrived early.

   (iv)   Delay playout of packet by D + (r-t).

   (v)    Go back to (ii).

   Note that this idealized implementation assumes that the sender's RTP
   clock is synchronized to the clock in the receiver, which is used to
   timestamp packet arrivals.  If there is no such inherent
   synchronization, the system may need to use an adaptive de-jitter
   buffer or other techniques to ensure reliable reception.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Fixed%20De-Jitter%20Buffer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Fixed De-Jitter Buffer</span>

   A fixed de-jitter buffer lacks provision to track the condition of
   the network and has a fixed size, and packets leaving the de-jitter
   buffer have a constant delay.  For fixed de-jitter buffer
   implementation, the nominal delay is set to a constant value
   corresponding to the packets that arrive at their expected arrival
   time, while the maximum delay is set to a constant value
   corresponding to the fixed size of the de-jitter buffer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Adaptive%20De-Jitter%20Buffer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Adaptive De-Jitter Buffer</span>

   An adaptive de-jitter buffer can adapt to the change in the network's
   delay and has variable size or variable delay.  It allows the nominal
   delay to be set to a low value initially to minimize user perceived
   delay; however, it can automatically extend the late edge (and
   possibly also retract the early edge) of a buffer window if a
   significant proportion of the packets are arriving late (and hence
   being discarded).

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits

      A De-Jitter Buffer Metrics Report Block is identified by the
      constant 23.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the de-jitter buffer
      metrics are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics:

         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
         instantaneous value.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7005">RFC 7005</a>                  RTCP XR Jitter Buffer           September 2013</span>


         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

      In this document, de-jitter buffer metrics can only be sampled and
      cannot be measured over definite intervals.  Also, the value I=00
      is reserved for future use.  Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00,
      I=10, or I=11.  If a block is received with I=00, I=10, or I=11,
      the receiver MUST discard the block.

   Jitter Buffer Configuration (C): 1 bit

      This field is used to identify the de-jitter buffer method in use
      at the receiver, according to the following code:

         0 = Fixed de-jitter buffer

         1 = Adaptive de-jitter buffer

   Reserved (resv): 5 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers (see <a href="./rfc6709#section-4.2">[RFC6709], SectionÂ 4.2</a>).

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one, in
      accordance with the definition in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].  This field MUST be
      set to 3 to match the fixed length of the report block.

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in <a href="./rfc3611#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of [RFC3611]</a>.

   De-jitter buffer nominal delay (DJB nominal): 16 bits

      This is the current nominal de-jitter buffer delay (in
      milliseconds) that corresponds to the nominal de-jitter buffer
      delay for packets that arrive exactly on time.  It is calculated
      based on the time spent in the de-jitter buffer for the packet
      that arrives exactly on time.  This parameter MUST be provided for
      both fixed and adaptive de-jitter buffer implementations.

      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an
      over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the
      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

   De-jitter buffer maximum delay (DJB maximum): 16 bits

      This is the current maximum de-jitter buffer delay (in
      milliseconds) that corresponds to the earliest arriving packet
      that would not be discarded.  It is calculated based on the time
      spent in the de-jitter buffer for the earliest arriving packet.
      In simple queue implementations, this may correspond to the size
      of the de-jitter buffer.  In adaptive de-jitter buffer
      implementations, this value may vary dynamically.  This parameter
      MUST be provided for both fixed and adaptive de-jitter buffer
      implementations.

      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an
      over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the
      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

   De-jitter buffer high-water mark (DJB high-water mark): 16 bits

      This is the highest value of the de-jitter buffer nominal delay
      (in milliseconds) that occurred at any time during the reporting
      interval.  This parameter MUST be provided for adaptive de-jitter
      buffer implementations, and its value MUST be set to DJB maximum
      for fixed de-jitter buffer implementations.

      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an
      over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the
      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

   De-jitter buffer low-water mark (DJB low-water mark): 16 bits

      This is the lowest value of the de-jitter buffer nominal delay (in
      milliseconds) that occurred at any time during the reporting
      interval.  This parameter MUST be provided for adaptive de-jitter
      buffer implementations, and its value MUST be set to DJB maximum
      for fixed de-jitter buffer implementations.

      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an
      over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the
      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

          that an RTP packet would arrive if there was no delay
          variation.  The delay applied to packets that arrive at their
          expected time is known as the Nominal Delay.

       *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: See <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>,
          de-jitter buffer nominal delay definition.

       *  Units of Measurement: See <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>, de-jitter buffer
          nominal delay definition.

   d.  De-Jitter Buffer Low-Water Mark Metric

       *  Metric Name: De-jitter buffer low-water mark in RTP.

       *  Metric Description: It is the lowest value of the de-jitter
          buffer nominal delay (for RTP traffic) that occurred at any
          time during the reporting interval.
