<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> defines the Content-Disposition response header field
   (<a href="./rfc2616#section-19.5.1">Section 19.5.1 of [RFC2616]</a>) but points out that it is not part of
   the HTTP/1.1 Standard (<a href="#section-15.5">Section 15.5</a>):

      Content-Disposition is not part of the HTTP standard, but since it
      is widely implemented, we are documenting its use and risks for
      implementers.

   This specification takes over the definition and registration of
   Content-Disposition, as used in HTTP.  Based on interoperability
   testing with existing user agents (UAs), it fully defines a profile
   of the features defined in the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
   (MIME) variant ([<a href="./rfc2183" title='"Communicating Presentation Information in Internet Messages: The Content-Disposition Header Field"'>RFC2183</a>]) of the header field, and also clarifies
   internationalization aspects.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6266">RFC 6266</a>               Content-Disposition in HTTP             June 2011</span>


      Note: This document does not apply to Content-Disposition header
      fields appearing in payload bodies transmitted over HTTP, such as
      when using the media type "multipart/form-data" ([<a href="./rfc2388" title='"Returning Values from Forms: multipart/ form-data"'>RFC2388</a>]).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Notational%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Notational Conventions</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   This specification uses the augmented BNF (ABNF) notation defined in
   <a href="./rfc2616#section-2.1">Section 2.1 of [RFC2616]</a>, including its rules for implied linear
   whitespace (LWS).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Conformance%20and%20Error%20Handling"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Conformance and Error Handling</span>

   This specification defines conformance criteria for both senders
   (usually, HTTP origin servers) and recipients (usually, HTTP user
   agents) of the Content-Disposition header field.  An implementation
   is considered conformant if it complies with all of the requirements
   associated with its role.

   This specification also defines certain forms of the header field
   value to be invalid, using both ABNF and prose requirements
   (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>), but it does not define special handling of these invalid
   field values.

   Senders MUST NOT generate Content-Disposition header fields that are
   invalid.

   Recipients MAY take steps to recover a usable field value from an
   invalid header field, but SHOULD NOT reject the message outright,
   unless this is explicitly desirable behavior (e.g., the
   implementation is a validator).  As such, the default handling of
   invalid fields is to ignore them.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Header%20Field%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Header Field Definition</span>

   The Content-Disposition response header field is used to convey
   additional information about how to process the response payload, and
   also can be used to attach additional metadata, such as the filename
   to use when saving the response payload locally.

     content-disposition = "Content-Disposition" ":"
                            disposition-type *( ";" disposition-parm )

     disposition-type    = "inline" | "attachment" | disp-ext-type

   Defined in [<a href="./rfc2616" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>]:

     token         = &lt;token, defined in <a href="./rfc2616#section-2.2">[RFC2616], Section 2.2</a>&gt;
     quoted-string = &lt;quoted-string, defined in <a href="./rfc2616#section-2.2">[RFC2616], Section 2.2</a>&gt;
     value         = &lt;value, defined in <a href="./rfc2616#section-3.6">[RFC2616], Section 3.6</a>&gt;
                   ; token | quoted-string

   Defined in [<a href="./rfc5987" title='"Character Set and Language Encoding for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Header Field Parameters"'>RFC5987</a>]:

     ext-value   = &lt;ext-value, defined in <a href="./rfc5987#section-3.2">[RFC5987], Section 3.2</a>&gt;

   Content-Disposition header field values with multiple instances of
   the same parameter name are invalid.

   Note that due to the rules for implied linear whitespace (<a href="./rfc2616#section-2.1">Section 2.1
   of [RFC2616]</a>), OPTIONAL whitespace can appear between words (token or
   quoted-string) and separator characters.

   Furthermore, note that the format used for ext-value allows
   specifying a natural language (e.g., "en"); this is of limited use
   for filenames and is likely to be ignored by recipients.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6266">RFC 6266</a>               Content-Disposition in HTTP             June 2011</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Disposition%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Disposition Type</span>

   If the disposition type matches "attachment" (case-insensitively),
   this indicates that the recipient should prompt the user to save the
   response locally, rather than process it normally (as per its media
   type).

   On the other hand, if it matches "inline" (case-insensitively), this
   implies default processing.  Therefore, the disposition type "inline"
   is only useful when it is augmented with additional parameters, such
   as the filename (see below).

   Unknown or unhandled disposition types SHOULD be handled by
   recipients the same way as "attachment" (see also <a href="./rfc2183#section-2.8">[RFC2183],
   Section 2.8</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20%20Disposition%20Parameter%3A%20%27Filename%27"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Disposition Parameter: 'Filename'</span>

   The parameters "filename" and "filename*", to be matched case-
   insensitively, provide information on how to construct a filename for
   storing the message payload.

   Depending on the disposition type, this information might be used
   right away (in the "save as..." interaction caused for the
   "attachment" disposition type), or later on (for instance, when the
   user decides to save the contents of the current page being
   displayed).

   The parameters "filename" and "filename*" differ only in that
   "filename*" uses the encoding defined in [<a href="./rfc5987" title='"Character Set and Language Encoding for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Header Field Parameters"'>RFC5987</a>], allowing the use
   of characters not present in the ISO-8859-1 character set
   ([<a href="#ref-ISO-8859-1" title='"Information technology -- 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets -- Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1"'>ISO-8859-1</a>]).

   Many user agent implementations predating this specification do not
   understand the "filename*" parameter.  Therefore, when both
   "filename" and "filename*" are present in a single header field
   value, recipients SHOULD pick "filename*" and ignore "filename".
   This way, senders can avoid special-casing specific user agents by
   sending both the more expressive "filename*" parameter, and the
   "filename" parameter as fallback for legacy recipients (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>
   for an example).










<span class="grey">Reschke                      Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6266">RFC 6266</a>               Content-Disposition in HTTP             June 2011</span>


   It is essential that recipients treat the specified filename as
   advisory only, and thus be very careful in extracting the desired
   information.  In particular:

   o  Recipients MUST NOT be able to write into any location other than
      one to which they are specifically entitled.  To illustrate the
      problem, consider the consequences of being able to overwrite
      well-known system locations (such as "/etc/passwd").  One strategy
      to achieve this is to never trust folder name information in the
      filename parameter, for instance by stripping all but the last
      path segment and only considering the actual filename (where 'path
      segments' are the components of the field value delimited by the
      path separator characters "\" and "/").

   o  Many platforms do not use Internet Media Types ([<a href="./rfc2046" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>RFC2046</a>]) to hold
      type information in the file system, but rely on filename
      extensions instead.  Trusting the server-provided file extension
      could introduce a privilege escalation when the saved file is
      later opened (consider ".exe").  Thus, recipients that make use of
      file extensions to determine the media type MUST ensure that a
      file extension is used that is safe, optimally matching the media
      type of the received payload.

   o  Recipients SHOULD strip or replace character sequences that are
      known to cause confusion both in user interfaces and in filenames,
      such as control characters and leading and trailing whitespace.

   o  Other aspects recipients need to be aware of are names that have a
      special meaning in the file system or in shell commands, such as
      "." and "..", "~", "|", and also device names.  Recipients SHOULD
      ignore or substitute names like these.

      Note: Many user agents do not properly handle the escape character
      "\" when using the quoted-string form.  Furthermore, some user
      agents erroneously try to perform unescaping of "percent" escapes
      (see <a href="#appendix-C.2">Appendix C.2</a>), and thus might misinterpret filenames
      containing the percent character followed by two hex digits.

   To enable future extensions, recipients SHOULD ignore unrecognized
   parameters (see also <a href="./rfc2183#section-2.8">[RFC2183], Section 2.8</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.5.%20%20Extensibility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" id="section-4.5">4.5</a>.  Extensibility</span>

   Note that <a href="./rfc2183#section-9">Section 9 of [RFC2183]</a> defines IANA registries both for
   disposition types and disposition parameters.  This registry is
   shared by different protocols using Content-Disposition, such as MIME
   and HTTP.  Therefore, not all registered values may make sense in the
   context of HTTP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Examples</span>

   Direct the UA to show "save as" dialog, with a filename of
   "example.html":

     Content-Disposition: Attachment; filename=example.html

   Direct the UA to behave as if the Content-Disposition header field
   wasn't present, but to remember the filename "an example.html" for a
   subsequent save operation:

     Content-Disposition: INLINE; FILENAME= "an example.html"

   Note: This uses the quoted-string form so that the space character
   can be included.

   Direct the UA to show "save as" dialog, with a filename containing
   the Unicode character U+20AC (EURO SIGN):

     Content-Disposition: attachment;
                          filename*= UTF-8''%e2%82%ac%20rates

   Here, the encoding defined in [<a href="./rfc5987" title='"Character Set and Language Encoding for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Header Field Parameters"'>RFC5987</a>] is also used to encode the
   non-ISO-8859-1 character.

   This example is the same as the one above, but adding the "filename"
   parameter for compatibility with user agents not implementing
   <a href="./rfc5987">RFC 5987</a>:

     Content-Disposition: attachment;
                          filename="EURO rates";
                          filename*=utf-8''%e2%82%ac%20rates

   Note: Those user agents that do not support the <a href="./rfc5987">RFC 5987</a> encoding
   ignore "filename*" when it occurs after "filename".

   The "filename*" parameter (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>), using the encoding defined
   in [<a href="./rfc5987" title='"Character Set and Language Encoding for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Header Field Parameters"'>RFC5987</a>], allows the server to transmit characters outside the
   ISO-8859-1 character set, and also to optionally specify the language
   in use.

   Future parameters might also require internationalization, in which
   case the same encoding can be used.

   Using server-supplied information for constructing local filenames
   introduces many risks.  These are summarized in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.

   Furthermore, implementers ought to be aware of the security
   considerations applying to HTTP (see <a href="./rfc2616#section-15">Section 15 of [RFC2616]</a>), and
   also the parameter encoding defined in [<a href="./rfc5987" title='"Character Set and Language Encoding for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Header Field Parameters"'>RFC5987</a>] (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Changes%20from%20the%20RFC%202616%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Changes from the <a href="./rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> Definition</span>

   Compared to <a href="./rfc2616#section-19.5.1">Section 19.5.1 of [RFC2616]</a>, the following normative
   changes reflecting actual implementations have been made:

   o  According to <a href="./rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>, the disposition type "attachment" only
      applies to content of type "application/octet-stream".  This
      restriction has been removed, because recipients in practice do
      not check the content type, and it also discourages properly
      declaring the media type.

   o  <a href="./rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> only allows "quoted-string" for the filename parameter.
      This would be an exceptional parameter syntax, and also doesn't
      reflect actual use.

   o  The definition for the disposition type "inline" (<a href="./rfc2183#section-2.1">[RFC2183],
      Section 2.1</a>) has been re-added with a suggestion for its
      processing.

   o  This specification requires support for the extended parameter
      encoding defined in [<a href="./rfc5987" title='"Character Set and Language Encoding for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Header Field Parameters"'>RFC5987</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20B.%20%20Differences%20Compared%20to%20RFC%202183"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B" id="appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Differences Compared to <a href="./rfc2183">RFC 2183</a></span>

   <a href="./rfc2183#section-2">Section 2 of [RFC2183]</a> defines several additional disposition
   parameters: "creation-date", "modification-date", "quoted-date-time",
   and "size".  The majority of user agents do not implement these;
   thus, they have been omitted from this specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20C.%20%20Alternative%20Approaches%20to%20Internationalization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C" id="appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.  Alternative Approaches to Internationalization</span>

   By default, HTTP header field parameters cannot carry characters
   outside the ISO-8859-1 ([<a href="#ref-ISO-8859-1" title='"Information technology -- 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets -- Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1"'>ISO-8859-1</a>]) character encoding (see
   <a href="./rfc2616#section-2.2">[RFC2616], Section 2.2</a>).  For the "filename" parameter, this of
   course is an unacceptable restriction.

   Unfortunately, user agent implementers have not managed to come up
   with an interoperable approach, although the IETF Standards Track
   specifies exactly one solution ([<a href="./rfc2231" title='"MIME Parameter Value and Encoded Word Extensions: Character Sets, Languages, and Continuations"'>RFC2231</a>], clarified and profiled for
   HTTP in [<a href="./rfc5987" title='"Character Set and Language Encoding for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Header Field Parameters"'>RFC5987</a>]).

   For completeness, the sections below describe the various approaches
   that have been tried, and explain how they are inferior to the
   <a href="./rfc5987">RFC 5987</a> encoding used in this specification.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/C.1.%20%20RFC%202047%20Encoding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C.1" id="appendix-C.1">C.1</a>.  <a href="./rfc2047">RFC 2047</a> Encoding</span>

   <a href="./rfc2047">RFC 2047</a> defines an encoding mechanism for header fields, but this
   encoding is not supposed to be used for header field parameters --
   see <a href="./rfc2047#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC2047]</a>:

      An 'encoded-word' MUST NOT appear within a 'quoted-string'.

      ...

      An 'encoded-word' MUST NOT be used in parameter of a MIME Content-
      Type or Content-Disposition field, or in any structured field body
      except within a 'comment' or 'phrase'.

   In practice, some user agents implement the encoding, some do not
   (exposing the encoded string to the user), and some get confused by
   it.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/C.2.%20%20Percent%20Encoding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C.2" id="appendix-C.2">C.2</a>.  Percent Encoding</span>

   Some user agents accept percent-encoded (<a href="./rfc3986#section-2.1">[RFC3986], Section 2.1</a>)
   sequences of characters.  The character encoding being used for
   decoding depends on various factors, including the encoding of the
   referring page, the user agent's locale, its configuration, and also
   the actual value of the parameter.

   In practice, this is hard to use because those user agents that do
   not support it will display the escaped character sequence to the
   user.  For those user agents that do implement this, it is difficult
   to predict what character encoding they actually expect.

   Some user agents inspect the value (which defaults to ISO-8859-1 for
   the quoted-string form) and switch to UTF-8 when it seems to be more
   likely to be the correct interpretation.

   As with the approaches above, this is not interoperable and,
   furthermore, risks misinterpreting the actual value.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20D.%20%20Advice%20on%20Generating%20Content-Disposition%20Header%20Fields"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-D" id="appendix-D">Appendix D</a>.  Advice on Generating Content-Disposition Header Fields</span>

   To successfully interoperate with existing and future user agents,
   senders of the Content-Disposition header field are advised to:

   o  Include a "filename" parameter when US-ASCII ([<a href="#ref-US-ASCII" title='"Coded Character Set -- 7-bit American Standard Code for Information Interchange"'>US-ASCII</a>]) is
      sufficiently expressive.

   o  Use the 'token' form of the filename parameter only when it does
      not contain disallowed characters (e.g., spaces); in such cases,
      the quoted-string form should be used.

   o  Avoid including the percent character followed by two hexadecimal
      characters (e.g., %A9) in the filename parameter, since some
      existing implementations consider it to be an escape character,
      while others will pass it through unchanged.

   o  Avoid including the "\" character in the quoted-string form of the
      filename parameter, as escaping is not implemented by some user
      agents, and "\" can be considered an illegal path character.

   o  Avoid using non-ASCII characters in the filename parameter.
      Although most existing implementations will decode them as
      ISO-8859-1, some will apply heuristics to detect UTF-8, and thus
      might fail on certain names.

   o  Include a "filename*" parameter where the desired filename cannot
      be expressed faithfully using the "filename" form.  Note that
      legacy user agents will not process this, and will fall back to
      using the "filename" parameter's content.

   o  When a "filename*" parameter is sent, to also generate a
      "filename" parameter as a fallback for user agents that do not
      support the "filename*" form, if possible.  This can be done by
      substituting characters with US-ASCII sequences (e.g., Unicode
      character point U+00E4 (LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIARESIS) by
      "ae").  Note that this may not be possible in some locales.

   o  When a "filename" parameter is included as a fallback (as per
      above), "filename" should occur first, due to parsing problems in
      some existing implementations.

   o  Use UTF-8 as the encoding of the "filename*" parameter, when
      present, because at least one existing implementation only
      implements that encoding.
