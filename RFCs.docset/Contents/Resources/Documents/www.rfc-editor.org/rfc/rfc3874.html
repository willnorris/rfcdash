Abstract

   This document specifies a 224-bit one-way hash function, called
   SHA-224.  SHA-224 is based on SHA-256, but it uses a different
   initial value and the result is truncated to 224 bits.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document specifies a 224-bit one-way hash function, called
   SHA-224.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   announced the FIPS 180-2 Change Notice on February 28, 2004 which
   specifies the SHA-224 one-way hash function.  One-way hash functions
   are also known as message digests.  SHA-224 is based on SHA-256, the
   256-bit one-way hash function already specified by NIST [<a href="#ref-SHA2" title="Secure Hash Standard">SHA2</a>].
   Computation of a SHA-224 hash value is two steps.  First, the SHA-256
   hash value is computed, except that a different initial value is
   used.  Second, the resulting 256-bit hash value is truncated to 224
   bits.

   NIST is developing guidance on cryptographic key management, and NIST
   recently published a draft for comment [<a href="#ref-NISTGUIDE" title='"Key Management Guideline, Part 1: General Guidance."'>NISTGUIDE</a>].  Five security
   levels are discussed in the guidance: 80, 112, 128, 192, and 256 bits
   of security.  One-way hash functions are available for all of these
   levels except one.  SHA-224 fills this void.  SHA-224 is a one-way
   hash function that provides 112 bits of security, which is the
   generally accepted strength of Triple-DES [<a href="#ref-3DES">3DES</a>].

   This document makes the SHA-224 one-way hash function specification
   available to the Internet community, and it publishes the object
   identifiers for use in ASN.1-based protocols.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Usage%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Usage Considerations</span>

   Since SHA-224 is based on SHA-256, roughly the same amount of effort
   is consumed to compute a SHA-224 or a SHA-256 digest message digest
   value.  Even though SHA-224 and SHA-256 have roughly equivalent
   computational complexity, SHA-224 is an appropriate choice for a
   one-way hash function that provides 112 bits of security.  The use of
   a different initial value ensures that a truncated SHA-256 message
   digest value cannot be mistaken for a SHA-224 message digest value
   computed on the same data.

   Some usage environments are sensitive to every octet that is
   transmitted.  In these cases, the smaller (by 4 octets) message
   digest value provided by SHA-224 is important.

   These observations lead to the following guidance:

   *  When selecting a suite of cryptographic algorithms that all offer
      112 bits of security strength, SHA-224 is an appropriate choice
      for one-way hash function.

   *  When terseness is not a selection criteria, the use of SHA-256 is
      a preferred alternative to SHA-224.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-STDWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>STDWORDS</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20SHA-224%20Description"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  SHA-224 Description</span>

   SHA-224 may be used to compute a one-way hash value on a message
   whose length less than 2^64 bits.

   SHA-224 makes use of SHA-256 [<a href="#ref-SHA2" title="Secure Hash Standard">SHA2</a>].  To compute a one-way hash
   value, SHA-256 uses a message schedule of sixty-four 32-bit words,
   eight 32-bit working variables, and produces a hash value of eight
   32-bit words.

   The function is defined in the exact same manner as SHA-256, with the
   following two exceptions:

      First, for SHA-224, the initial hash value of the eight 32-bit
      working variables, collectively called H, shall consist of the
      following eight 32-bit words (in hex):

         H_0 = c1059ed8               H_4 = ffc00b31
         H_1 = 367cd507               H_5 = 68581511
         H_2 = 3070dd17               H_6 = 64f98fa7
         H_3 = f70e5939               H_7 = befa4fa4

      Second, SHA-224 simply makes use of the first seven 32-bit words
      in the SHA-256 result, discarding the remaining 32-bit words in
      the SHA-256 result.  That is, the final value of H is used as
      follows, where || denotes concatenation:

         H_0 || H_1 || H_2 || H_3 || H_4 || H_5 || H_6

   used to test implementations of SHA-224.

   NIST has assigned an ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-X.208-88">X.208-88</a>, <a href="#ref-X.209-88">X.209-88</a>] object identifier for
   SHA-224.  Some protocols use object identifiers to name one-way hash
   functions.  One example is CMS [<a href="#ref-CMS" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>CMS</a>].  Implementations of such
   protocols that make use of SHA-224 MUST use the following object
   identifier.

      id-sha224  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
                      country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101)

   One-way hash functions are typically used with other cryptographic
   algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed-hash
   message authentication codes, or in the generation of random values.
   When a one-way hash function is used in conjunction with another
   algorithm, there may be requirements specified elsewhere that require
   the use of a one-way hash function with a certain number of bits of
   security.  For example, if a message is being signed with a digital
   signature algorithm that provides 128 bits of security, then that
   signature algorithm may require the use of a one-way hash algorithm
   that also provides the same number of bits of security.  SHA-224 is
   intended to provide 112 bits of security, which is the generally
   accepted strength of Triple-DES [<a href="#ref-3DES">3DES</a>].

   This document is intended to provide the SHA-224 specification to the
   Internet community.  No independent assertion of the security of this
   one-way hash function is intended by the author for any particular
   use.  However, as long as SHA-256 provides the expected security,
   SHA-224 will also provide its expected level of security.
