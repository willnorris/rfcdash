   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      STD 16/RFC 1155 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>3</a>] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>13</a>] defines a more concise description mechanism,
      which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

      <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>4</a>] which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects
      for the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>6</a>] defines
      MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience
      and new operational requirements.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>5</a>] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Objects</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-7" title=" International Organization for Standardization">7</a>]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>3</a>] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-8" title=" International Standard 8825">8</a>],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>13</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1398">RFC 1398</a>                   Ethernet-Like MIB                January 1993</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface
   to an ethernet-like communications medium.  At present, ethernet-like
   media are identified by three values of the ifType object in the
   Internet-standard MIB:

          ethernet-csmacd(6)
          iso88023-csmacd(7)
          starLan(11)

   For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the
   MIB-II [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>6</a>] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

          dot3    OBJECT IDENTIFER ::= { transmission 7 }

   The definitions presented here are based on the IEEE 802.3 Layer
   Management Specification [<a href="#ref-9" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management"'>9</a>], as originally interpreted by Frank
   Kastenholz of Interlan in [<a href="#ref-10" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks"'>10</a>].  Implementors of these MIB objects
   should note that the IEEE document explicitly describes (in the form
   of Pascal pseudocode) when, where, and how various MAC attributes are
   measured.  The IEEE document also describes the effects of MAC
   actions that may be invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB
   objects defined here.

   To the extent that some of the attributes defined in [<a href="#ref-9" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management"'>9</a>] are
   represented by previously defined objects in the Internet- standard
   MIB or in the Generic Interface Extensions MIB [<a href="#ref-11" title="Inc.">11</a>], such attributes
   are not redundantly represented by objects defined in this memo.
   Among the attributes represented by objects defined in other memos
   are the number of octets transmitted or received on a particular
   interface, the number of frames transmitted or received on a
   particular interface, the promiscuous status of an interface, the MAC
   address of an interface, and multicast information associated with an
   interface.

   The relationship between an ethernet-like interface and an interface
   in the context of the Internet-standard MIB is one-to-one.  As such,
   the value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to
   identify corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Change%20Log"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Change Log</span>

  (1)  Replace old "Historical Perspective" boilerplate with the
       new "The Network Management Framework" boilerplate.

  (2)  Remove the "slime text".

  (3)  Updated the reference to the Interface Extensions mib to
       reflect its new RFC status.

  (4)  Change the status of the memo section to hold the new
       suggested text.

  (5)  References in ASN.1 comments were changed from the [#]
       form to name the actual document being referred to. These
       references are now meaningful when the ASN.1 is read
       outside of the RFC.

  (6)  The IMPORTS section of the ASN.1 has been updated to
       reflect that the OBJECT-TYPE macro is imported from <a href="./rfc1212">RFC-</a>
       <a href="./rfc1212">1212</a>.

  (7)  The the Generic Ethernet-like group, containing
       dot3Index, dot3InitializeMac, dot3MacSubLayerStatus,
       dot3MulticastReceiveStatus, dot3TxEnabled, and
       dot3TestTdrValue has been deprecated as a result of the
       implementation experience presented at the San Diego IETF
       meeting.

  (8)  dot3StatsInRangeLengthErrors and
       dot3StatsOutOfRangeLengthFields have been deprecated as a
       result of the implementation experience presented at the
       San Diego IETF meeting.

  (9)  Update the acknowledgements section to reflect this
       document's history, etc.

  (10) REFERENCE clauses have been added to all of the MIB
       objects which are being retained.

  12 August 1992

  (1)  Removed all deprecated objects.

  (2)  Rephrased the description of the TDR test OID to reflect
       the fact that dot3TestTdrValue is no more.
       ifExtnsTestResult still points to the object containing
       the result, the text simply does not refer to
       dot3TestTdrValue. I could have deleted the Test, but the
       OID should then remain reserved. I figured that it would
       be just as easy to rephrase the definition of the test.

  13 august 1992

  (1)  Add fuji. 86960

   This document was produced by the Ethernet MIB Working Group.

   This document is based on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB, <a href="./rfc1284">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc1284">1284</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Ethernet- Like Interface Types"'>14</a>], of which John Cook of Chipcom was the editor.  The
   Ethernet MIB Working Group gathered implementation experience of the
   variables specified in <a href="./rfc1284">RFC 1284</a> and used that information to develop
   this revised MIB.

   <a href="./rfc1284">RFC 1284</a>, in turn, is based on a document written by Frank Kastenholz
   of Interlan entitled IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft M compatible
   MIB for TCP/IP Networks [<a href="#ref-10" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks"'>10</a>].  This document has been modestly
   reworked, initially by the SNMP Working Group, and then by the
   Transmission Working Group, to reflect the current conventions for
   defining objects for MIB interfaces.  James Davin, of the MIT
   Laboratory for Computer Science, and Keith McCloghrie of Hughes LAN
   Systems, contributed to later drafts of this memo. Marshall Rose of
   Performance Systems International, Inc. converted the document into
   its current concise format. Anil Rijsinghani of DEC contributed text
   that more adequately describes the TDR test.  Thanks to Frank
   Kastenholz of Interlan and Louis Steinberg of IBM for their
   experimentation.
