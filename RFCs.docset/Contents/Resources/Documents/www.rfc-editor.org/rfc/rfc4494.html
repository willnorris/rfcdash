Abstract

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
   recently specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code
   (CMAC), which is equivalent to the One-Key CBC-MAC1 (OMAC1) algorithm
   submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa.  OMAC1 efficiently reduces the key
   size of Extended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC).  This memo
   specifies the use of CMAC mode on the authentication mechanism of the
   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication
   Header (AH) protocols.  This new algorithm is named AES-CMAC-96.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
   recently specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code
   (CMAC).  CMAC [<a href="#ref-NIST-CMAC" title='"Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The CMAC Method for Authentication"'>NIST-CMAC</a>] is a message authentication code that is
   based on a symmetric key block cipher such as the Advanced Encryption
   Standard [<a href="#ref-NIST-AES" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)"'>NIST-AES</a>].  CMAC is equivalent to the One-Key CBC MAC1
   (OMAC1) submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa [<a href="#ref-OMAC1a" title='"OMAC: One-Key CBC MAC"'>OMAC1a</a>, <a href="#ref-OMAC1b" title='"OMAC: One-Key CBC MAC"'>OMAC1b</a>].  OMAC1 is
   an improvement of the eXtended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC)
   submitted by Black and Rogaway [<a href="#ref-XCBCa" title='"A Suggestion for Handling Arbitrary-Length Messages with the CBC MAC"'>XCBCa</a>, <a href="#ref-XCBCb" title='"CBC MACs for Arbitrary- Length Messages: The Three-Key Constructions"'>XCBCb</a>], which itself is an
   improvement of the basic CBC-MAC.  XCBC efficiently addresses the
   security deficiencies of CBC-MAC, and OMAC1 efficiently reduces the
   key size of XCBC.

   This memo specifies the usage of CMAC on the authentication mechanism
   of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload [<a href="#ref-ESP" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>ESP</a>] and Authentication
   Header [<a href="#ref-AH" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>AH</a>] protocols.  This new algorithm is named AES-CMAC-96.  For
   further information on AH and ESP, refer to [<a href="#ref-AH" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>AH</a>] and [<a href="#ref-ROADMAP" title='"IP Security Document Roadmap"'>ROADMAP</a>].

   Truncated T     The truncated output of AES-CMAC-128 in MSB-first
                   order.

   AES-CMAC        CMAC generation function based on AES block cipher
                   with 128-bit key.

   AES-CMAC-96     IPsec AH and ESP MAC generation function based on
                   AES-CMAC, which truncates the 96 most significant
                   bits of the 128-bit output.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20AES-CMAC"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  AES-CMAC</span>

   The core of AES-CMAC-96 is the AES-CMAC [<a href="#ref-AES-CMAC" title='"The AES-CMAC Algorithm"'>AES-CMAC</a>].  The underlying
   algorithms for AES-CMAC are the Advanced Encryption Standard cipher
   block [<a href="#ref-NIST-AES" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)"'>NIST-AES</a>] and the recently defined CMAC mode of operation
   [<a href="#ref-NIST-CMAC" title='"Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The CMAC Method for Authentication"'>NIST-CMAC</a>].  AES-CMAC provides stronger assurance of data integrity
   than a checksum or an error detecting code.  The verification of a
   checksum or an error detecting code detects only accidental
   modifications of the data, while CMAC is designed to detect
   intentional, unauthorized modifications of the data, as well as
   accidental modifications.  The output of AES-CMAC can validate the
   input message.  Validating the message provides assurance of the
   integrity and authenticity over the message from the source.
   According to [<a href="#ref-NIST-CMAC" title='"Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The CMAC Method for Authentication"'>NIST-CMAC</a>], at least 64 bits should be used against
   guessing attacks.  AES-CMAC achieves the similar security goal of
   HMAC [<a href="#ref-RFC-HMAC" title='"HMAC: Keyed- Hashing for Message Authentication"'>RFC-HMAC</a>].  Since AES-CMAC is based on a symmetric key block
   cipher (AES), while HMAC is based on a hash function (such as SHA-1),
   AES-CMAC is appropriate for information systems in which AES is more
   readily available than a hash function.  Detailed information about
   AES-CMAC is available in [<a href="#ref-AES-CMAC" title='"The AES-CMAC Algorithm"'>AES-CMAC</a>] and [<a href="#ref-NIST-CMAC" title='"Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The CMAC Method for Authentication"'>NIST-CMAC</a>].

   For IPsec message authentication on AH and ESP, AES-CMAC-96 should be
   used.  AES-CMAC-96 is a AES-CMAC with 96-bit truncated output in
   MSB-first order.  The output is a 96-bit MAC that will meet the
   default authenticator length as specified in [<a href="#ref-AH" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>AH</a>].  The result of
   truncation is taken in MSB-first order.  For further information on
   AES-CMAC, refer to [<a href="#ref-AES-CMAC" title='"The AES-CMAC Algorithm"'>AES-CMAC</a>] and [<a href="#ref-NIST-CMAC" title='"Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The CMAC Method for Authentication"'>NIST-CMAC</a>].

   Figure 1 describes AES-CMAC-96 algorithm:

   In step 1, AES-CMAC is applied to the message M in length len with
   key K.

   In step 2, the output block T is truncated to 12 octets in MSB-first
   order, and Truncated T (TT) is returned.
