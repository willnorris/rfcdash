Abstract

   This document obsoletes <a href="./rfc3330">RFC 3330</a>.  It describes the global and other
   specialized IPv4 address blocks that have been assigned by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  It does not address IPv4
   address space assigned to operators and users through the Regional
   Internet Registries, nor does it address IPv4 address space assigned
   directly by IANA prior to the creation of the Regional Internet
   Registries.  It also does not address allocations or assignments of
   IPv6 addresses or autonomous system numbers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Throughout its history, the Internet has employed a central Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) responsible for the allocation and
   assignment of various identifiers needed for the operation of the
   Internet [<a href="./rfc1174" title='"IAB recommended policy on distributing internet identifier assignment and IAB recommended policy change to internet "'>RFC1174</a>].  In the case of the IPv4 address space, the IANA
   allocates parts of the address space to Regional Internet Registries
   (RIRs) according to their established needs.  These RIRs are
   responsible for the registration of IPv4 addresses to operators and
   users of the Internet within their regions.

   On an ongoing basis, the IANA has been designated by the IETF to make
   assignments in support of the Internet Standards Process [<a href="./rfc2860" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>].
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of that document describes that assignment process.

   Small portions of the IPv4 address space have been allocated or
   assigned directly by the IANA for global or other specialized
   purposes.  These allocations and assignments have been documented in
   a variety of RFCs and other documents.  This document is intended to
   collect these scattered references and provide a current list of
   special use IPv4 addresses.

   This document is a revision of <a href="./rfc3330">RFC 3330</a> [<a href="./rfc3330" title='"Special-Use IPv4 Addresses"'>RFC3330</a>], which it
   obsoletes; its primary purpose is to reflect the changes to the list
   of special IPv4 assignments since the publication of <a href="./rfc3330">RFC 3330</a>.  It is
   a companion to [<a href="./rfc5156" title='"Special-Use IPv6 Addresses"'>RFC5156</a>], which describes special IPv6 addresses.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Global%20and%20Other%20Specialized%20Address%20Blocks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks</span>

   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on "this"
   network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32 may be used as a source address for this
   host on this network; other addresses within 0.0.0.0/8 may be used to
   refer to specified hosts on this network ([<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>], <a href="#section-3.2.1.3">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-3.2.1.3">3.2.1.3</a>).

   10.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [<a href="./rfc1918" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>].  As described in that
   RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear on the
   public Internet.  These addresses can be used without any
   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   127.0.0.0/8 - This block is assigned for use as the Internet host
   loopback address.  A datagram sent by a higher-level protocol to an
   address anywhere within this block loops back inside the host.  This
   is ordinarily implemented using only 127.0.0.1/32 for loopback.  As
   described in <a href="./rfc1122#section-3.2.1.3">[RFC1122], Section 3.2.1.3</a>, addresses within the entire
   127.0.0.0/8 block do not legitimately appear on any network anywhere.

   169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "link local" block.  As described in
   [<a href="./rfc3927" title='"Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses"'>RFC3927</a>], it is allocated for communication between hosts on a
   single link.  Hosts obtain these addresses by auto-configuration,
   such as when a DHCP server cannot be found.

   172.16.0.0/12 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [<a href="./rfc1918" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>].  As described in that
   RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear on the
   public Internet.  These addresses can be used without any
   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   192.0.0.0/24 - This block is reserved for IETF protocol assignments.
   At the time of writing this document, there are no current
   assignments.  Allocation policy for future assignments is given in
   [<a href="./rfc5736" title='"IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry"'>RFC5736</a>].

   192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET-1" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  As described in [<a href="./rfc5737" title='"IPv4 Address Blocks Reserved for Documentation"'>RFC5737</a>], addresses within this
   block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be
   used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.  See
   [<a href="./rfc1166" title='"Internet numbers"'>RFC1166</a>].

   192.88.99.0/24 - This block is allocated for use as 6to4 relay
   anycast addresses, in [<a href="./rfc3068" title='"An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers"'>RFC3068</a>].  In contrast with previously
   described blocks, packets destined to addresses from this block do
   appear in the public Internet.  <a href="./rfc3068#section-7">[RFC3068], Section 7</a>, describes
   operational practices to prevent the malicious use of this block in
   routing protocols.

   192.168.0.0/16 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [<a href="./rfc1918" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>].  As described in that
   RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear on the
   public Internet.  These addresses can be used without any
   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated for use in benchmark
   tests of network interconnect devices.  [<a href="./rfc2544" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>RFC2544</a>] explains that this
   range was assigned to minimize the chance of conflict in case a

   testing device were to be accidentally connected to part of the
   Internet.  Packets with source addresses from this range are not
   meant to be forwarded across the Internet.

   198.51.100.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET-2" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  As described in [<a href="./rfc5737" title='"IPv4 Address Blocks Reserved for Documentation"'>RFC5737</a>], addresses within this
   block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be
   used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   203.0.113.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET-3" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  As described in [<a href="./rfc5737" title='"IPv4 Address Blocks Reserved for Documentation"'>RFC5737</a>], addresses within this
   block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be
   used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   224.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class D address
   space, is allocated for use in IPv4 multicast address assignments.
   The IANA guidelines for assignments from this space are described in
   [<a href="./rfc3171" title='"IANA Guidelines for IPv4 Multicast Address Assignments"'>RFC3171</a>].

   240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class E address
   space, is reserved for future use; see <a href="./rfc1112#section-4">[RFC1112], Section 4</a>.

   The one exception to this is the "limited broadcast" destination
   address 255.255.255.255.  As described in [<a href="./rfc0919" title='"Broadcasting Internet Datagrams"'>RFC0919</a>] and [<a href="./rfc0922" title='"Broadcasting Internet datagrams in the presence of subnets"'>RFC0922</a>],
   packets with this destination address are not forwarded at the IP
   layer.

   The IANA has responsibility for making assignments of protocol
   parameters used in the Internet according to the requirements of the
   "Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority" [<a href="./rfc2860" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>].  Among other things,
   [<a href="./rfc2860" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>] requires that protocol parameters be assigned according to
   the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including Proposed,
   Draft, and full Internet Standards and Best Current Practice
   documents, and any other RFC that calls for IANA assignment.

   The domain name and IP address spaces involve policy issues (in
   addition to technical issues) so that the requirements of [<a href="./rfc2860" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>]
   do not apply generally to those spaces.  Nonetheless, the IANA is
   responsible for ensuring assignments of IPv4 addresses as needed in
   support of the Internet Standards Process.  When a portion of the
   IPv4 address space is specifically required by an RFC, the technical
   requirements (e.g., size, prefix length) for the portion should be
   described [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  Immediately before the RFC is published, the
   IANA will, in consultation with the Regional Internet Registries,
   make the necessary assignment and notify the RFC Editor of the
   particulars for inclusion in the RFC as published.

   As required by [<a href="./rfc2860" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>], the IANA will also make necessary
   experimental assignments of IPv4 addresses, also in consultation with
   the Regional Internet Registries.

   This document describes the IANA's past and current practices and
   does not create any new requirements for assignments or allocations
   by the IANA.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The particular assigned values of special use IPv4 addresses
   cataloged in this document do not directly raise security issues.
   However, the Internet does not inherently protect against abuse of
   these addresses.  If you expect (for instance) that all packets from
   a private address space such as the 10.0.0.0/8 block or the link
   local block 169.254.0.0/16 originate within your subnet, all routers
   at the border of your network should filter such packets that
   originate from outside your network.  Attacks have been mounted that
   depend on the unexpected use of some of these addresses.

   It should also be noted that some of these address spaces may be used
   legitimately outside a single administrative domain, and may appear
   on the global Internet.  Security policy SHOULD NOT blindly filter
   all of these address spaces without due consideration, and network
   operators are encouraged to review this document, and references
   contained therein, and determine what security policies should be
   associated with each of these address blocks within their specific
   operating environments.
