NWG/RFC #429                                 Jonathan B. Postel (UCLA-NMC)
NIC #13281                                   12-DEC-72



                      Character Generator Process



I hereby propose that there be a standard process implemented on
whatever hosts desire which generates character data with out any
regard to input. In some sense the process is the converse of the
discard process [<a href="./rfc348">RFC 348</a>]. Many hosts have an existing terminal
testing program [e.g. TTYTST] which would suit this function
adequately.

This Character Generator process would listen for a request for
connection and execute the Initial Connection Protocol (ICP) as
specified in NIC 7104 the "Current Network Protocols" notebook.  Upon
completion of the ICP the Character Generator process would begin to
send characters into the network as buffer space is made available .
The Character Generator process is terminated by closing the
connections.
