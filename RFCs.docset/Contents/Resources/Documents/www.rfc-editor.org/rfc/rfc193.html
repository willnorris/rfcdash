                            NETWORK CHECKOUT

Notes

   SRI-10:   The Telnet-like protocol differs from Telnet in
             that lines are terminated by X'OD' rather than
             X'ODOA'.  John Melvin will have it fixed by
             the time you read this.

   LL-67:    Joel Winett telles me NCP, ICP, EBCDIC, Telnet and
             access to a virtual 360 are working.  Due to hard-
             ware difficulties we have not verified this.
   BBN-10:   Same difference as SRI with respect to Telnet.
             Under certain conditions, the ICP generates a
             zero byte size.  Ray Tomlinson tells me these
             idiosyncracies will be taken care of in about
             a week.  Three sites have commented that TENEX
             assigns the same local socket to multiple connec-
             tions, when acting as a server.  Ray says that
             this is the design -- not an error.  BBN TENEX
             is currently being used productively via the
             Net, for some non-Network related problems.
   UTAH:     Our tests with UTAH were pre-TENEX.  TENEX is
             currently being installed at UTAH.
   MIT-645:  Our understanding is that most software is
             working; we have not verified this.
