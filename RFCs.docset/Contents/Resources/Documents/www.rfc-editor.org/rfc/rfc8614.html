   "Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and
   Signaling" [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] describes the concepts and signaling for using
   the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to set up a VPLS.  It specifies the
   BGP VPLS Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) by which a
   Provider Edge (PE) router may require other PEs in the same VPLS to
   include (or not) the Control Word (CW) and sequencing information in
   VPLS frames sent to this PE.

   The use of the CW helps prevent the misordering of IPv4 or IPv6
   Pseudowire (PW) traffic over Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) paths or
   Link Aggregation Group (LAG) bundles.  [<a href="./rfc4385" title='"Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Control Word for Use over an MPLS PSN"'>RFC4385</a>] describes the format
   for the CW that may be used over point-to-point PWs and over a VPLS.
   Along with [<a href="./rfc3985" title='"Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture"'>RFC3985</a>], [<a href="./rfc4385" title='"Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Control Word for Use over an MPLS PSN"'>RFC4385</a>] also describes sequence number usage
   for VPLS frames.

   However, [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] does not specify the behavior of PEs in a mixed
   environment where some PEs support CW/sequencing and others do not.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Problem%20Description"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Problem Description</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC4761">RFC4761</a>] specifies the VPLS BGP NLRI by which a given PE advertises
   the behavior expected by the multiple PEs participating in the same
   VPLS.  The NLRI indicates the VPLS label that the various PE routers,
   which are referred to in the NLRI, should use when forwarding VPLS
   traffic to this PE.  Additionally, by using the Control Flags, this
   PE specifies whether the other PEs (in the same VPLS) should use the
   CW or sequenced delivery for frames forwarded to this PE.  These are
   indicated by the C-bits and the S-bits, respectively, in the Control
   Flags, as specified in <a href="./rfc4761#section-3.2.4">Section 3.2.4 in [RFC4761]</a>.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4761">RFC4761</a>] requires that if the advertising PE sets the C-bits and
   S-bits, the receiving PE MUST, respectively, insert a CW and include
   sequence numbers when forwarding VPLS traffic to the advertising PE.

   However, in a BGP VPLS deployment, there would often be cases where a
   PE receiving the VPLS BGP NLRI may not have the ability to insert a
   CW or include sequencing information inside PW frames.  Thus, the
   behavior of CW processing and sequencing needs to be further
   specified.

   This document updates the meaning of the Control Flags in the Layer2
   Info Extended Community in the BGP VPLS NLRI.  It also specifies the
   forwarding behavior for a mixed-mode environment where not every PE
   in a VPLS has the ability or the configuration to honor the Control
   Flags received from the PE advertising the BGP NLRI.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Updated%20Meaning%20of%20Control%20Flags%20in%20the%20Layer2%20Info%20Extended"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Updated Meaning of Control Flags in the Layer2 Info Extended</span>
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Community"></a>    Community</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC4761">RFC4761</a>] does not allow for the CW setting to be negotiated.  In a
   typical implementation, if a PE sets the C-bit, it expects to receive
   VPLS frames with a CW and will send frames the same way.  If the PEs
   at the two ends of a PW do not agree on the setting of the C-bit, the
   PW does not come up.  The behavior is similar for the S-bit.

   This memo updates the meaning of the C-bit and the S-bit in the
   Control Flags.




<span class="grey">Singh, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8614">RFC 8614</a>               Control Flags for BGP VPLS              June 2019</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Control%20Word%20%28C-Bit%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Control Word (C-Bit)</span>

   If a PE sets the C-bit in its NLRI, it means that the PE has the
   ability to send and receive frames with a CW.

   -  If the PEs at both ends of a PW set the C-bit, CWs MUST be used in
      both directions of the PW.

   -  If both PEs send a C-bit of 0, CWs MUST NOT be used on the PW.

   These two cases behave as before.

   However, if the PEs at both ends of the PW do not agree on the
   setting of the C-bit, CWs MUST NOT be used in either direction on
   that PW, but the PW MUST NOT be prevented from coming up due to this
   mismatch.  So, the PW will still come up but will not use the CW in
   either direction.  This behavior is changed from the behavior
   described in [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] where the PW does not come up.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Sequence%20Flag%20%28S-Bit%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Sequence Flag (S-Bit)</span>

   If a PE sets the S-bit in its NLRI, it means that the PE has the
   ability to set sequence numbers as described in <a href="./rfc4385#section-4.1">Section 4.1 in
   [RFC4385]</a> and process sequence numbers as described in <a href="./rfc4385#section-4.2">Section 4.2 in
   [RFC4385]</a>.

   -  If the PEs at both ends of a PW set the S-bit, non-zero sequence
      numbers MUST be used in both directions of the PW.

   -  If both PEs send an S-bit of 0, sequence numbers MUST NOT be used
      on the PW.

   These two cases behave as before.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4761">RFC4761</a>] does not allow for the S-bit setting to be negotiated
   either.  In a typical implementation, if the PE sets the S-bit in the
   advertised NLRI, it expects to receive VPLS frames with non-zero
   sequence numbers and will send outgoing frames over the PW with
   non-zero sequence numbers.

   This memo further specifies the expected behavior when the PEs at the
   ends of the PW advertise differing S-bit values.  If the PEs at both
   ends of the PW do not agree on the setting of the S-bit, then the PW
   SHOULD NOT come up.  This is to avoid running into out-of-sequence
   ordering scenarios when the multiple PEs that are enabling
   multihoming for a site have differing S-bit advertisements as
   described in <a href="./rfc4385#section-4.2">Section 4.2 in [RFC4385]</a>.  However, if a deployment is
   known to not utilize multihoming, a user-configurable way to override

   this recommendation MAY be provided by an implementation whereby the
   PW is allowed to come up.  In that case, the PE advertising the S-bit
   as 0 should set sequence numbers in the frames as 0, and the PW
   receiving the frames should not expect to receive non-zero sequence
   numbers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Using%20Point-to-Multipoint%20%28P2MP%29%20LSPs%20as%20Transport%20for%20BGP%20VPLS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Using Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) LSPs as Transport for BGP VPLS</span>

   BGP VPLS can be used over point-to-point Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   acting as transport between the VPLS PEs.  Alternately, BGP VPLS may
   also be used over Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) LSPs with the source of
   the P2MP LSP rooted at the PE advertising the VPLS BGP NLRI.

   In a network that uses P2MP LSPs as transport for a VPLS, there may
   be some PEs that support the CW while others may not.  The behavior
   is similar for the sequencing of VPLS frames.

   In such a setup, a source PE that supports CW should set up two
   different P2MP LSPs such that:

   -  One P2MP LSP will transport CW-marked frames to those PEs that
      advertised the C-bit as 1.

   -  The other P2MP LSP will transport frames without the CW to those
      PEs that advertised the C-bit as 0.

   Using two different P2MP LSPs to deliver frames with and without the
   CW to different PEs ensures that a P2MP root PE honors the C-bit
   advertised by the other P2MP PEs.

   However, the set of leaves on the two P2MP LSPs (rooted at the given
   PE) MUST NOT contain any PEs that advertised a value for the S-bit
   different from what the root PE itself is advertising.  PEs that
   advertised their S-bit values differently (from what the P2MP root PE
   advertised) will not be on either of the P2MP LSPs.  This ensures
   that the P2MP root PE is sending VPLS frames only to those PEs that
   agree on the setting of the S-bit.

   The ingress router for the P2MP LSP should send separate NLRIs for
   the cases of using the CW and for not using the CW.

                        Figure 1: Example of a VPLS

   In the above topology, let there be a VPLS configured with the PEs as
   displayed.  Let PE1 be the PE under consideration that is CW enabled
   and sequencing enabled.  Let PE2 and PE3 also be CW enabled and
   sequencing enabled.  Let PE4 not be CW enabled or have the ability to
   include sequence numbers.  PE1 will advertise a VPLS BGP NLRI,
   containing the C/S-bits marked as 1.  PE2 and PE3, on learning of the
   NLRI from PE1, will include the CW and non-zero sequence numbers in
   the VPLS frames being forwarded to PE1 as described in <a href="./rfc4385#section-4">Section 4 in
   [RFC4385]</a>.  However, PE4, which does not have the ability to include
   a CW or include non-zero sequence numbers, will not.

   As per [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>], PE1 would expect all other PEs to forward
   CW-containing frames that have non-zero sequence numbers.  That
   expectation cannot be met by PE4 in this example.  Thus, as per
   [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>], the PW between PE1 and PE4 does not come up.

   However, this document addresses how an implementation should support
   BGP VPLS in a network where a subset of the BGP VPLS PEs support the
   CW and/or frame sequencing.  PE1 will not bring up the PW with PE4
   due to the S-bit mismatch, unless overridden by local configuration
   on PE1 and PE4 as specified in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.  If PE4 instead was to
   advertise a C-bit of 0 and an S-bit of 1, then the PW between PE1 and
   PE4 would come up despite the CW mismatch.  Additionally, PE1 would
   set up its data plane such that it will strip the CW only for those

   VPLS frames that are received from PEs that have indicated their
   desire to receive CW-marked frames.  So, PE1 will set up its data
   plane to strip the CW only for VPLS frames received from PE2 and PE3,
   and it will expect to process PW frames containing non-zero sequence
   numbers as described in <a href="./rfc4385#section-4.2">Section 4.2 in [RFC4385]</a>.  PE1 will set up
   its data plane to not strip the CW from frames received from PE4, and
   it would expect PE4 to send frames with non-zero sequence numbers.
   All frames sent by PE4 to PE1 over the PW would have a non-zero
   sequence number.

   In a multihomed environment, different PEs may effectively represent
   the same service destination endpoint.  It could be assumed that the
   end-to-end PW establishment process should follow the same rules when
   it comes to CW requirements, meaning that setting the C-bit would be
   enforced equally toward both primary and backup designated
   forwarders.

   However, in the multihoming case, each PW SHOULD be evaluated
   independently.  Assuming the network topology specified in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>,
   there could be the case where the PW between PE2 and PE1 could have
   the CW signaled via the extended community and would be used in the
   VPLS frame, while the PE2-to-PE4 PW would not insert the CW in the
   VPLS frame due to a C-bit mismatch.  The multihoming behavior of the
   rest of the PEs should simply follow the rules specified in
   [<a href="#ref-VPLS-MULTIHOMING">VPLS-MULTIHOMING</a>].

   In a multihomed environment, different PEs may effectively represent
   the same service destination endpoint.  In this case, the rules for
   end-to-end PW establishment SHOULD follow the same behavior as that
   described in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> when it comes to S-bit requirements.
   Consider the case described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> with CE5 having a connection
   to multiple PEs (multihomed) to PE4 and PE1.  The PW's behavior is
   similar to that for the CW scenario such that the S-bit evaluation
   SHOULD be independent per PW.  So, in the case where PE4 does not set
   the S-bit in its advertised NLRI, there is an S-bit mismatch between
   PE1 and PE4.  This mismatch prevents the PW establishment between PE1
   and PE4.  So, only one PW -- between PE1 and PE2 -- would be
   established for the multihomed site shown.  Thus, even though CE5 is
   physically multihomed, due to PE4's lack of support for sending
   frames with non-zero sequence numbers, there would be no PW between
   PE2 and PE4.  CE5 would effectively not be multihomed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document updates the behavior specified in [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>].  The
   security considerations discussed in [<a href="./rfc4761" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] apply.  This document
   essentially addresses BGP VPLS behavior for PEs when the C-bit value,
   the S-bit value, or both values advertised by a given PE are
   different from what another PE in the VPLS is advertising.  Any
   bit-flipping media errors leading to causing this mismatch of
   C/S-bits between PEs do not adversely affect the availability of the
   PWs.  Rather, they cause CWs to not be used or cause the
   NLRI-advertising PE to not expect non-zero sequenced frames, for the
   C-bit and the S-bit, respectively, being mismatched across PEs.  This
   is no worse than the previous behavior where any bit-flipping media
   errors leading to a mismatch of the C/S-bits between PEs would cause
   the PW to not come up.
