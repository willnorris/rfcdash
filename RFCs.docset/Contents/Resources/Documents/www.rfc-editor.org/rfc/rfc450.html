                    <span class="h1">MULTICS SAMPLING TIMEOUT CHANGE</span>


In response to popular demand, and in view of the fact that we've found
an extra bit of budget, the timeout on sampling ("anonymous") use of
Multics via the Net has been increased to 5 cpu minutes (from 1 cpu
minute); coupled with various internal speedups, this change should
allow the performance of substantive experiments in a single session.
