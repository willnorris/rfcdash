This memo describes a technique for dynamically discovering the maximum
transmission unit (MTU) of an arbitrary internet path.  It specifies a
small change to the way routers generate one type of ICMP message.  For
a path that passes through a router that has not been so changed, this
technique might not discover the correct Path MTU, but it will always
choose a Path MTU as accurate as, and in many cases more accurate than,
the Path MTU that would be chosen by current practice.  [STANDARDS-

                              the Network Time Protocol

This memo describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP) designed to
distribute time information in a large, diverse internet system
operating at speeds from mundane to lightwave.  It uses a returnable-
time architecture in which a distributed subnet of time servers
operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave configuration
synchronizes local clocks within the subnet and to national time
standards via wire or radio.  The servers can also redistribute time
information within a network via local routing algorithms and time
daemons.

The architectures, algorithms and protocols which have evolved to NTP
over several years of implementation and refinement are described in
this paper.  The synchronization subnet which has been in regular
operation in the Internet for the last several years is described along
with performance data which shows that timekeeping accuracy throughout
most portions of the Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a
few tens of milliseconds, even in cases of failure or disruption of
clocks, time servers or networks.

This memo describes the Network Time Protocol in <a href="./rfc1119">RFC-1119</a>.

                              Protocol in the Internet System

This paper describes a series of experiments involving over 100,000
hosts of the Internet system and located in the U.S., Europe and the
Pacific.  The experiments are designed to evaluate the availability,
accuracy and reliability of international standard time distribution
using the DARPA/NSF Internet and the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which
is specified in <a href="./rfc1119">RFC-1119</a>.  NTP is designed specifically for use in a
large, diverse internet system operating at speeds from mundane to
lightwave.  In NTP a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a
self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave configuration exchange
precision timestamps in order to synchronize subnet clocks to each other
and national time standards via wire or radio.

The experiments are designed to locate Internet hosts and gateways that
provide time by one of three time distribution protocols and evaluate
the accuracy of their indications.  For those hosts that support NTP,
the experiments determine the distribution of errors and other
statistics over paths spanning major portions of the globe.  Finally,
the experiments evaluate the accuracy and reliability of precision
timekeeping using NTP and typical Internet paths involving DARPA, NSFNET
and other agency networks.  The experiments demonstrate that timekeeping
accuracy throughout most portions of the Internet can be ordinarily
maintained to within a few tens of milliseconds, even in cases of
failure or disruption of clocks, time servers or networks.
