Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing
   multiple logical and physical entities managed by a single SNMP
   agent.  This document specifies version 3 of the Entity MIB, which
   obsoletes version 2 (<a href="./rfc2737">RFC 2737</a>).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4133">RFC 4133</a>                 Entity MIB (Version 3)              August 2005</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20The%20SNMP%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  The SNMP Management Framework</span>

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="./rfc3410#section-7">section 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="./rfc3410" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

   There is a need for a standardized way of representing a single
   agent, which supports multiple instances of one MIB.  This is
   presently true for at least 3 standard MIBs, and is likely to become
   true for more and more MIBs as time passes.  For example:

   - multiple instances of a bridge supported within a single device
     that has a single agent;

   - multiple repeaters supported by a single agent;

   - multiple OSPF backbone areas, each operating as part of its own
     Autonomous System, and each identified by the same area-id (e.g.,
     0.0.0.0), supported inside a single router with one agent.

   The single agent present in each of these cases implies a
   relationship binds these entities.  Effectively, there is some
   "overall" physical entity which houses the sum of the things managed
   by that one agent, i.e., there are multiple "logical" entities within
   a single physical entity.  Sometimes, the overall physical entity
   contains multiple (smaller) physical entities, and each logical
   entity is associated with a particular physical entity.  Sometimes,
   the overall physical entity is a "compound" of multiple physical
   entities (e.g., a stack of stackable hubs).

   What is needed is a way to determine exactly which logical entities
   are managed by the agent (with some version of SNMP) in order to
   communicate with the agent about a particular logical entity.  When
   different logical entities are associated with different physical
   entities within the overall physical entity, it is also useful to be
   able to use this information to distinguish between logical entities.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4133">RFC 4133</a>                 Entity MIB (Version 3)              August 2005</span>


   In these situations, there is no need for varbinds for multiple
   logical entities to be referenced in the same SNMP message (although
   that might be useful in the future).  Rather, it is sufficient, and
   in some situations preferable, to have the context/community in the
   message identify the logical entity to which the varbinds apply.

   Version 2 of this MIB addresses new requirements, which have emerged
   since the publication of the first Entity MIB (<a href="./rfc2037">RFC 2037</a> [<a href="./rfc2037" title='"Entity MIB using SMIv2"'>RFC2037</a>]).
   There is a need for a standardized way of providing non-volatile,
   administratively-assigned identifiers for physical components
   represented with the Entity MIB.  There is also a need to align the
   Entity MIB with the SNMPv3 administrative framework (STD 62, <a href="./rfc3411">RFC 3411</a>
   [<a href="./rfc3411" title='"An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks"'>RFC3411</a>]).  Implementation experience has shown that additional
   physical component attributes are also desirable.

   Version 3 of this MIB addresses new requirements, which have emerged
   since the publication of the second Entity MIB (<a href="./rfc2737">RFC 2737</a> [<a href="./rfc2737" title='"Entity MIB (Version 2)"'>RFC2737</a>]).
   There is a need to identify physical entities that are central
   processing units (CPUs) and a need to provide a textual convention
   that identifies an entPhysicalIndex value or zero, where the value
   zero has application-specific semantics.  Two new objects have been
   added to the entPhysicalTable to identify the manufacturing date and
   provide additional URIs for a particular physical entity.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Terms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Terms</span>

   Some new terms are used throughout this document:

   - Naming Scope
     A "naming scope" represents the set of information that may be
     potentially accessed through a single SNMP operation.  All
     instances within the naming scope share the same unique identifier
     space.  For SNMPv1, a naming scope is identified by the value of
     the associated 'entLogicalCommunity' instance.  For SNMPv3, the
     term 'context' is used instead of 'naming scope'.  The complete
     definition of an SNMP context can be found in section 3.3.1 of <a href="./rfc3411">RFC</a>
     <a href="./rfc3411">3411</a> [<a href="./rfc3411" title='"An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks"'>RFC3411</a>].

   - Multi-Scoped Object
     A MIB object, for which identical instance values identify
     different managed information in different naming scopes, is called
     a "multi-scoped" MIB object.

   - Single-Scoped Object
     A MIB object, for which identical instance values identify the same
     managed information in different naming scopes, is called a
     "single-scoped" MIB object.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4133">RFC 4133</a>                 Entity MIB (Version 3)              August 2005</span>


   - Logical Entity
     A managed system contains one or more logical entities, each
     represented by at most one instantiation of each of a particular
     set of MIB objects.  A set of management functions is associated
     with each logical entity.  Examples of logical entities include
     routers, bridges, print-servers, etc.

   - Physical Entity
     A "physical entity" or "physical component" represents an
     identifiable physical resource within a managed system.  Zero or
     more logical entities may utilize a physical resource at any given
     time.  Determining which physical components are represented by an
     agent in the EntPhysicalTable is an implementation-specific matter.
     Typically, physical resources (e.g., communications ports,
     backplanes, sensors, daughter-cards, power supplies, the overall
     chassis), which can be managed via functions associated with one or
     more logical entities, are included in the MIB.

   - Containment Tree
     Each physical component may be modeled as 'contained' within
     another physical component.  A "containment-tree" is the conceptual
     sequence of entPhysicalIndex values that uniquely specifies the
     exact physical location of a physical component within the managed
     system.  It is generated by 'following and recording' each
     'entPhysicalContainedIn' instance 'up the tree towards the root',
     until a value of zero indicating no further containment is found.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Relationship%20to%20Community%20Strings"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Relationship to Community Strings</span>

   For community-based SNMP, differentiating logical entities is one
   (but not the only) purpose of the community string (<a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a>
   [<a href="./rfc1157" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>]).  This is accommodated by representing each community
   string as a logical entity.

   Note that different logical entities may share the same naming scope
   and, therefore, the same values of entLogicalCommunity.  This is
   possible, providing they have no need for the same instance of a MIB
   object to represent different managed information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Relationship%20to%20SNMP%20Contexts"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Relationship to SNMP Contexts</span>

   Version 2 of the Entity MIB contains support for associating SNMPv3
   contexts with logical entities.  Two new MIB objects, defining an
   SnmpEngineID and ContextName pair, are used together to identify an
   SNMP context associated with a logical entity.  This context can be
   used (in conjunction with the entLogicalTAddress and
   entLogicalTDomain MIB objects) to send SNMPv3 messages on behalf of a
   particular logical entity.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4133">RFC 4133</a>                 Entity MIB (Version 3)              August 2005</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20Relationship%20to%20Proxy%20Mechanisms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Relationship to Proxy Mechanisms</span>

   The Entity MIB is designed to allow functional component discovery.
   The administrative relationships between different logical entities
   are not visible in any Entity MIB tables.  A Network Management
   System (NMS) cannot determine whether MIB instances in different
   naming scopes are realized locally or remotely (e.g., via some proxy
   mechanism) by examining any particular Entity MIB objects.

   The management of administrative framework functions is not an
   explicit goal of the Entity MIB WG at this time.  This new area of
   functionality may be revisited after some operational experience with
   the Entity MIB is gained.

   Note that for community-based versions of SNMP, a network
   administrator will likely be able to associate community strings with
   naming scopes that have proprietary mechanisms, as a matter of
   configuration.  There are no mechanisms for managing naming scopes
   defined in this MIB.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.%20%20Relationship%20to%20a%20Chassis%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5" id="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Relationship to a Chassis MIB</span>

   Some readers may recall that a previous IETF working group attempted
   to define a Chassis MIB.  No consensus was reached by that working
   group, possibly because its scope was too broad.  As such, it is not
   the purpose of this MIB to be a "Chassis MIB replacement", nor is it
   within the scope of this MIB to contain all the information which
   might be necessary to manage a "chassis".  On the other hand, the
   entities represented by an implementation of this MIB might well be
   contained in a chassis.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.6.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20Interfaces%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6" id="section-2.6">2.6</a>.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB</span>

   The Entity MIB contains a mapping table identifying physical
   components that have 'external values' (e.g., ifIndex) associated
   with them within a given naming scope.  This table can be used to
   identify the physical location of each interface in the ifTable (<a href="./rfc2863">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc2863">2863</a> [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>]).  Because ifIndex values in different contexts are
   not related to one another, the interface to physical component
   associations are relative to the same logical entity within the
   agent.

   The Entity MIB also contains 'entPhysicalName' and 'entPhysicalAlias'
   objects, which approximate the semantics of the 'ifName' and
   'ifAlias' objects (respectively) from the Interfaces MIB [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>],
   for all types of physical components.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4133">RFC 4133</a>                 Entity MIB (Version 3)              August 2005</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.7.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20Other%20MIBs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7" id="section-2.7">2.7</a>.  Relationship to the Other MIBs</span>

   The Entity MIB contains a mapping table identifying physical
   components that have identifiers from other standard MIBs associated
   with them.  For example, this table can be used along with the
   physical mapping table to identify the physical location of each
   repeater port in the rptrPortTable, or each interface in the ifTable.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.8.%20%20Relationship%20to%20Naming%20Scopes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.8" id="section-2.8">2.8</a>.  Relationship to Naming Scopes</span>

   There is some question as to which MIB objects may be returned within
   a given naming scope.  MIB objects which are not multi-scoped within
   a managed system are likely to ignore context information in
   implementation.  In such a case, it is likely such objects will be
   returned in all naming scopes (e.g., not just the 'default' naming
   scope or the SNMPv3 default context).

   For example, a community string used to access the management
   information for logical device 'bridge2' may allow access to all the
   non-bridge related objects in the 'default' naming scope, as well as
   a second instance of the Bridge MIB (<a href="./rfc1493">RFC 1493</a> [<a href="./rfc1493" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>RFC1493</a>]).

   The isolation of single-scoped MIB objects by the agent is an
   implementation-specific matter.  An agent may wish to limit the
   objects returned in a particular naming scope to only the multi-
   scoped objects in that naming scope (e.g., system group and the
   Bridge MIB).  In this case, all single-scoped management information
   would belong to a common naming scope (e.g., 'default'), which itself
   may contain some multi-scoped objects (e.g., system group).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.9.%20%20Multiple%20Instances%20of%20the%20Entity%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.9" id="section-2.9">2.9</a>.  Multiple Instances of the Entity MIB</span>

   It is possible that more than one agent may exist in a managed
   system.  In such cases, multiple instances of the Entity MIB
   (representing the same managed objects) may be available to an NMS.

   In order to reduce complexity for agent implementation, multiple
   instances of the Entity MIB are not required to be equivalent or even
   consistent.  An NMS may be able to 'align' instances returned by
   different agents by examining the columns of each table, but vendor-
   specific identifiers and (especially) index values are likely to be
   different.  Each agent may be managing different subsets of the
   entire chassis as well.

   When all of a physically-modular device is represented by a single
   agent, the entry (for which entPhysicalContainedIn has the value
   zero) would likely have 'chassis' as the value of its
   entPhysicalClass.  Alternatively, for an agent on a module where the

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4133">RFC 4133</a>                 Entity MIB (Version 3)              August 2005</span>


   agent represents only the physical entities on that module (not those
   on other modules), the entry (for which entPhysicalContainedIn has
   the value zero) would likely have 'module' as the value of its
   entPhysicalClass.

   An agent implementation of the entLogicalTable is not required to
   contain information about logical entities managed primarily by other
   agents.  That is, the entLogicalTAddress and entLogicalTDomain
   objects in the entLogicalTable are provided to support an historical
   multiplexing mechanism, not to identify other SNMP agents.

   Note that the Entity MIB is a single-scoped MIB, in the event an
   agent represents the MIB in different naming scopes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.10.%20%20Re-Configuration%20of%20Entities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.10" id="section-2.10">2.10</a>.  Re-Configuration of Entities</span>

   Most of the MIB objects defined in this MIB have, at most, a read-
   only MAX-ACCESS clause.  This is a conscious decision by the working
   group to limit this MIB's scope.  The second version of the Entity
   MIB allows a network administrator to configure some common
   attributes of physical components.

   Version 1 of the Entity MIB contains three MIB objects defined with
   the (now obsolete) DisplayString textual convention.  In version 2 of
   the Entity MIB, the syntax for these objects has been updated to use
   the (now preferred) SnmpAdminString textual convention.

   The working group realizes that this change is not strictly supported
   by SMIv2.  In our judgment, the alternative of deprecating the old
   objects and defining new objects would have a more adverse impact on
   backward compatibility and interoperability, given the particular
   semantics of these objects.

   The Entity MIB contains five groups of MIB objects:

   - entityPhysical group
     Describes the physical entities managed by a single agent.

   - entityLogical group
     Describes the logical entities managed by a single agent.

   - entityMapping group
     Describes the associations between the physical entities, logical
     entities, interfaces, and non-interface ports managed by a single
     agent.

   - entityGeneral group
     Describes general system attributes shared by potentially all types
     of entities managed by a single agent.

   - entityNotifications group
     Contains status indication notifications.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.12.1.%20%20entityPhysical%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.12.1" id="section-2.12.1">2.12.1</a>.  entityPhysical Group</span>

   This group contains a single table to identify physical system
   components, called the entPhysicalTable.

   The entPhysicalTable contains one row per physical entity, and must
   always contain at least one row for an "overall" physical entity,
   which should have an entPhysicalClass value of 'stack(11)',
   'chassis(3)' or 'module(9)'.

   Each row is indexed by an arbitrary, small integer, and contains a
   description and type of the physical entity.  It also optionally
   contains the index number of another entPhysicalEntry, indicating a
   containment relationship between the two.

   Version 2 of the Entity MIB provides additional MIB objects for each
   physical entity.  Some common read-only attributes have been added,
   as well as three writable string objects.

   - entPhysicalAlias
     This string can be used by an NMS as a non-volatile identifier for
     the physical component.  Maintaining a non-volatile string for
     every physical component represented in the entPhysicalTable can be
     costly and unnecessary.  An agent may algorithmically generate
     'entPhysicalAlias' strings for particular entries (e.g., based on
     the entPhysicalClass value).

   - entPhysicalAssetID
     This string is provided to store a user-specific asset identifier
     for removable physical components.  In order to reduce the non-
     volatile storage needed by a particular agent, a network
     administrator should only assign asset identifiers to physical
     entities that are field-replaceable (i.e., not permanently
     contained within another physical entity).

   - entPhysicalSerialNum
     This string is provided to store a vendor-specific serial number
     string for physical components.  This writable object is used when
     an agent cannot identify the serial numbers of all installed
     physical entities, and a network administrator wishes to configure
     the non-volatile serial number strings manually (via an NMS
     application).

   Version 3 of the Entity MIB provides two additional MIB objects for
   each physical entity:

   - entPhysicalMfgDate
     This object contains the date of manufacturing of the managed
     entity.  If the manufacturing date is unknown or not supported the
     object is not instantiated.  The special value '0000000000000000'H
     may also be returned in this case.

   - entPhysicalUris
     This object provides additional identification information about
     the physical entity.

     This object contains one or more Uniform Resource Identifiers
     (URIs) and, therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to
     <a href="./rfc3986">RFC 3986</a> <a href="./rfc3986#section-2">[RFC3986] section 2</a>.  Uniform Resource Names (URNs), <a href="./rfc3406">RFC</a>
     <a href="./rfc3406">3406</a> [<a href="./rfc3406" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms"'>RFC3406</a>], are resource identifiers with the specific
     requirements for enabling location independent identification of a
     resource, as well as longevity of reference.  URNs are part of the
     larger URI family with the specific goal of providing persistent
     naming of resources.  URI schemes and URN name spaces are
     registered by IANA (see <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes">http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes</a>
     and <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces">http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces</a>).

     For example, the entPhysicalUris object may be used to encode a URI
     containing a Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) URN for
     the managed physical entity.  The URN name space for CLEIs is
     defined in [<a href="./rfc4152" title='"A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for the CLEI Code"'>RFC4152</a>], and the CLEI format is defined in
     [<a href="#ref-T1.213" title='"Coded Identification of Equipment Entities in the North American Telecommunications System for Information Exchange"'>T1.213</a>][T1.213a].  For example, an entPhysicalUris instance may
     have the value of

        URN:CLEI:D4CE18B7AA

     [<a id="ref-RFC3986">RFC3986</a>] and [<a href="./rfc4152" title='"A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for the CLEI Code"'>RFC4152</a>] identify this as a URI in the CLEI URN name
     space.  The specific CLEI code, D4CE18B7AA, is based on the example
     provided in [<a href="#ref-T1.213a" title='"Supplement to T1.213-2001, Coded Identification of Equipment Entities in the North American Telecommunications System for Information Exchange, to correct the representation of the Basic Code in Figure B.1"'>T1.213a</a>].

     Multiple URIs may be present and are separated by white space
     characters.  Leading and trailing white space characters are
     ignored.

     If no additional identification information is known about the
     physical entity or supported, the object is not instantiated.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.12.2.%20%20entityLogical%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.12.2" id="section-2.12.2">2.12.2</a>.  entityLogical Group</span>

   This group contains a single table to identify logical entities,
   called the entLogicalTable.

   The entLogicalTable contains one row per logical entity.  Each row is
   indexed by an arbitrary, small integer and contains a name,
   description, and type of the logical entity.  It also contains
   information to allow access to the MIB information for the logical
   entity.  This includes SNMP versions that use a community name (with
   some form of implied context representation) and SNMP versions that
   use the SNMP ARCH [<a href="./rfc3411" title='"An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks"'>RFC3411</a>] method of context identification.

   If an agent represents multiple logical entities with this MIB, then
   this group must be implemented for all logical entities known to the
   agent.

   If an agent represents a single logical entity, or multiple logical
   entities within a single naming scope, then implementation of this
   group may be omitted by the agent.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.12.3.%20%20entityMapping%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.12.3" id="section-2.12.3">2.12.3</a>.  entityMapping Group</span>

   This group contains three tables to identify associations between
   different system components.

   - entLPMappingTable
     This table contains mappings between entLogicalIndex values
     (logical entities) and entPhysicalIndex values (the physical
     components supporting that entity).  A logical entity can map to
     more than one physical component, and more than one logical entity
     can map to (share) the same physical component.  If an agent
     represents a single logical entity, or multiple logical entities
     within a single naming scope, then implementation of this table may
     be omitted by the agent.

   - entAliasMappingTable
     This table contains mappings between entLogicalIndex,
     entPhysicalIndex pairs, and 'alias' object identifier values.  This
     allows resources managed with other MIBs (e.g., repeater ports,
     bridge ports, physical and logical interfaces) to be identified in
     the physical entity hierarchy.  Note that each alias identifier is
     only relevant in a particular naming scope.  If an agent represents

     a single logical entity, or multiple logical entities within a
     single naming scope, then implementation of this table may be
     omitted by the agent.

   - entPhysicalContainsTable
     This table contains simple mappings between
     'entPhysicalContainedIn' values for each container/'containee'
     relationship in the managed system.  The indexing of this table
     allows an NMS to quickly discover the 'entPhysicalIndex' values for
     all children of a given physical entity.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.12.4.%20%20entityGeneral%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.12.4" id="section-2.12.4">2.12.4</a>.  entityGeneral Group</span>

   This group contains general information relating to the other object
   groups.

   At this time, the entGeneral group contains a single scalar object
   (entLastChangeTime), which represents the value of sysUptime when any
   part of the Entity MIB configuration last changed.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.12.5.%20%20entityNotifications%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.12.5" id="section-2.12.5">2.12.5</a>.  entityNotifications Group</span>

   This group contains notification definitions relating to the overall
   status of the Entity MIB instantiation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.13.%20%20Multiple%20Agents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.13" id="section-2.13">2.13</a>.  Multiple Agents</span>

   Even though a primary motivation for this MIB is to represent the
   multiple logical entities supported by a single agent, another
   motivation is to represent multiple logical entities supported by
   multiple agents (in the same "overall" physical entity).  Indeed, it
   is implicit in the SNMP architecture that the number of agents is
   transparent to a network management station.

   However, there is no agreement at this time as to the degree of
   cooperation that should be expected for agent implementations.
   Therefore, multiple agents within the same managed system are free to
   implement the Entity MIB independently.  (For more information, refer
   to <a href="#section-2.9">Section 2.9</a>, "Multiple Instances of the Entity MIB".)

   The PhysicalClass TC text has been clarified, and a new enumeration
   to support 'stackable' components has been added.  The
   SnmpEngineIdOrNone TC has been added to support SNMPv3.

   The entPhysicalHardwareRev, entPhysicalFirmwareRev, and
   entPhysicalSoftwareRev objects have been added for revision
   identification.

   The entPhysicalSerialNum, entPhysicalMfgName, entPhysicalModelName,
   and entPhysicalIsFru objects have been added for better vendor
   identification for physical components.  In the event the agent
   cannot identify this information, the entPhysicalSerialNum object can
   be set by a management station.

   The entPhysicalAlias and entPhysicalAssetID objects have been added
   for better user component identification.  These objects are intended
   to be set by a management station and preserved by the agent across
   restarts.

   A bug was fixed in the entLogicalCommunity object.  The subrange was
   incorrect (1..255) and is now (0..255).  The description clause has
   also been clarified.  This object is now deprecated.

   The entLastChangeTime object description has been changed to
   generalize the events that cause an update to the last change
   timestamp.

   The syntax was changed from DisplayString to SnmpAdminString for the
   entPhysicalDescr, entPhysicalName, and entLogicalDescr objects.

            "An enumerated value which provides an indication of the
            general hardware type of a particular physical entity.
            There are no restrictions as to the number of
            entPhysicalEntries of each entPhysicalClass, which must be
            instantiated by an agent.

            The enumeration 'other' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is known, but does not match any of the supported
            values.

            The enumeration 'unknown' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is unknown to the agent.

            The enumeration 'chassis' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is an overall container for networking
            equipment.  Any class of physical entity, except a stack,
            may be contained within a chassis; and a chassis may only
            be contained within a stack.

            The enumeration 'backplane' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of device for aggregating and
            forwarding networking traffic, such as a shared backplane in
            a modular ethernet switch.  Note that an agent may model a
            backplane as a single physical entity, which is actually
            implemented as multiple discrete physical components (within
            a chassis or stack).

            The enumeration 'container' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is capable of containing one or more removable
            physical entities, possibly of different types.  For
            example, each (empty or full) slot in a chassis will be
            modeled as a container.  Note that all removable physical
            entities should be modeled within a container entity, such
            as field-replaceable modules, fans, or power supplies.  Note
            that all known containers should be modeled by the agent,
            including empty containers.

            The enumeration 'powerSupply' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is a power-supplying component.

            The enumeration 'fan' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is a fan or other heat-reduction component.

            The enumeration 'sensor' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of sensor, such as a temperature
            sensor within a router chassis.

            The enumeration 'module' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of self-contained sub-system.  If
            the enumeration 'module' is removable, then it should be
            modeled within a container entity, otherwise it should be
            modeled directly within another physical entity (e.g., a
            chassis or another module).

            The enumeration 'port' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is some sort of networking port, capable of receiving
            and/or transmitting networking traffic.

            The enumeration 'stack' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is some sort of super-container (possibly virtual),
            intended to group together multiple chassis entities.  A
            stack may be realized by a 'virtual' cable, a real
            interconnect cable, attached to multiple chassis, or may in
            fact be comprised of multiple interconnect cables.  A stack
            should not be modeled within any other physical entities,
            but a stack may be contained within another stack.  Only
            chassis entities should be contained within a stack.

    DESCRIPTION
            "An indication of the relative position of this 'child'
            component among all its 'sibling' components.  Sibling
            components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the
            same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn
            and entPhysicalClass objects.

            An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering
            for all sibling components of a particular parent
            (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each
            sibling entry).

            If possible, this value should match any external labeling
            of the physical component.  For example, for a container
            (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3',
            entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'.  Note
            that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3
            should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'.

            If the physical position of this component does not match
            any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then
            user documentation or other external reference material
            should be used to determine the parent-relative position.
            If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a
            consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set
            of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal
            representation of the components.

            If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position
            for some reason, or if the associated value of
            entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is
            returned.  Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned,
            indicating the parent-relative position of this physical
            entity.

            Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and
            continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest
            positioned child entity.  However, if the physical entities
            (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero,
            then the first sibling should be associated with an
            entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'.  Note that this
            ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent
            implementation.

            The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as
            each 'parent' component may use different numbering
            algorithms.  The ordering is only meaningful among siblings
            of the same parent component.

            The agent should retain parent-relative position values
            across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use
            of non-volatile storage."

            actually printed on the component itself (if present).

            On the first instantiation of an physical entity, the value
            of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set
            to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this

            is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be
            set to a zero-length string instead.

            Note that implementations that can correctly identify the
            serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not
            need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum
            object.  Agents which cannot provide non-volatile storage
            for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to
            implement write access for this object.

            Not every physical component will have a serial number, or
            even need one.  Physical entities for which the associated
            value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)'
            (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module), do not
            need their own unique serial number.  An agent does not have
            to provide write access for such entities, and may return a
            zero-length string.

            If write access is implemented for an instance of

            A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by

            no object instances in common.  For example, 'bridge1' and
            'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at
            least one additional community string is needed to represent
            'bridge2' and 'repeater2'.

            Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be
            represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default'
            naming scope.

            been assigned by the agent, or if no community string with

            request.

            Note that this object is deprecated.  Agents which implement

            known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the
            physical resources, which are used to realize that logical
            entity.

            An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in
            this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant
            information is returned.  For example, in a system that
            contains a single power supply, mappings between logical
            entities and the power supply are not useful and should not
            be included.

            Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is
            closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should
            be identified in an entLPMapping entry.

            For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular
            module, and all ports on that module are ports on this
            bridge.  A mapping between the bridge and the module would
            be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and
            each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because
            the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same
            information).  On the other hand, if more than one bridge
            were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between
            each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate.

            Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping
            for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not
            necessary."

    DESCRIPTION
            "The value of this object identifies the logical entity
            that defines the naming scope for the associated instance
            of the 'entAliasMappingIdentifier' object.

            If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the
            logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex.

            If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between
            the physical component and the alias identifier for this
            entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified
            logical entities.  That is, a value of zero (the default
            mapping) identifies any logical entity that does not have
            an explicit entry in this table for a particular
            entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair.

            For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g.,
            physical component 33) is identified by the same value of
            ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance
            might exist:

                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5

            In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently
            for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping
            entries may exist, e.g.:

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual
            row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and
            entLogicalIndex pair.

            Because only physical ports are modeled in this table, only
            entries that represent interfaces or ports are allowed.  If
            an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port,
            then this object should identify the associated 'ifEntry'.
            For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the
            'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead.

            For example, suppose a physical port was represented by
            entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a
            repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge.  Then
            there might be two related instances of
            entAliasMappingIdentifier:
               entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2
               entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17
            It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and
            repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required.

            Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and
            appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort',
            and are thus not represented in this table."

            to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls.

            An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange
            'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds
            is the suggested default).  A 'notification-event' is the
            transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of
            notification destinations.

            If additional configuration changes occur within the
            throttling period, then notification-events for these
            changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current
            throttling period expires.  At the end of a throttling
            period, one notification-event should be generated if any
            configuration changes occurred since the start of the
            throttling period.  In such a case, another throttling
            period is started right away.

            An NMS should periodically check the value of
            entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange
            notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission

   The following sections iterate the instance values for two example
   networking devices.  These examples are kept simple to make them more
   understandable.  Auxiliary components such as fans, sensors, empty
   slots, and sub-modules are not shown, but might be modeled in real
   implementations.

   The first example is a router containing two slots.  Each slot
   contains a 3 port router/bridge module.  Each port is represented in
   the ifTable.  There are two logical instances of OSPF running and two
   logical bridges:

   The second example is a 3-slot Hub with 2 backplane ethernet
   segments.  Slot three is empty, and the remaining slots contain
   ethernet repeater modules.

   Note that this example assumes an older Repeater MIB implementation,
   (<a href="./rfc1516">RFC 1516</a> [<a href="./rfc1516" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Repeater Devices"'>RFC1516</a>]) rather than the new Repeater MIB (<a href="./rfc2108">RFC 2108</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2108" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Repeater Devices using SMIv2"'>RFC2108</a>]).  The new version contains an object called
   'rptrPortRptrId', which should be used to identify repeater port
   groupings, rather than using community strings or contexts.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  These are:

   entPhysicalDescr
   entPhysicalVendorType
   entPhysicalHardwareRev
   entPhysicalFirmwareRev
   entPhysicalSoftwareRev
   entPhysicalSerialNum
   entPhysicalMfgName
   entPhysicalModelName

      These objects expose information about the physical entities
      within a managed system, which may be used to identify the vendor,
      model, and version information of each system component.

   entPhysicalAssetID

      This object can allow asset identifiers for various system
      components to be exposed, in the event this MIB object is actually
      configured by an NMS application.

   entLogicalDescr
   entLogicalType

      These objects expose the type of logical entities present in the
      managed system.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4133">RFC 4133</a>                 Entity MIB (Version 3)              August 2005</span>


   entLogicalCommunity

      This object exposes community names associated with particular
      logical entities within the system.

   entLogicalTAddress
   entLogicalTDomain

      These objects expose network addresses that can be used to
      communicate with an SNMP agent on behalf of particular logical
      entities within the system.

   entLogicalContextEngineID
   entLogicalContextName

      These objects identify the authoritative SNMP engine that contains
      information on behalf of particular logical entities within the
      system.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP
   provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the
   use of the User-based Security Model <a href="./rfc3414">RFC 3414</a> [<a href="./rfc3414" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC3414</a>] and the
   View-based Access Control Model <a href="./rfc3415">RFC 3415</a> [<a href="./rfc3415" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC3415</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
