              <span class="h1">BBN IMP (#5) AND NCC SCHEDULE MARCH 4, 1971</span>

   On Saturday morning, March 4, 1972, at 0800 EST the BBN IMP (#5)
   will go off the air to allow for a move of the equipment to a
   new location in BBN's facilities.  The NCC telephone and operators
   will be available as usual during this period.  We hope to have
   the IMP back on the Network by early Saturday afternoon; the
   choice of Saturday morning was made intentionally so that if by
   some stroke of fate all our wideband lines stay down longer than
   anticipated, the impact on others in the network will be minimized.
   We anticipate that all other sites will operate normally through
   this period.

   Shortly subsequent to this move, a new Host will be connected to
   the net.  This is a PDP-1D at BBN which will be used for certain
   additional NCC functions.  It will not be a Server site.  We
   prefer the Host name "BBN-1D"; its network address will be 197.
