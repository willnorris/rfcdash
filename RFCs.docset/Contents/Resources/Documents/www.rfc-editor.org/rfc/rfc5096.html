   When experimenting with a protocol or defining a new extension to a
   protocol, one needs either a protocol number, a new message, or an
   option to carry the information related to the experiment.  Most
   implementations end up using unassigned values for the new messages.
   Many times this creates problems when the same value is assigned
   through the IETF standards action, by IANA, or if the implementation
   gets deployed with these messages.  Therefore, it is considered a
   good practice to set aside some code points that identify the
   experimental protocols or messages for experimental purposes.  The
   need for experimental messages is shown in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful"'>3</a>].

   This document defines new messages for experimenting with extensions
   to the Mobile IPv6 protocol.  These messages should be strictly used
   for experiments.  Experiments that are successful should be
   standardized in the IETF.  An implementation MUST NOT be released or
   deployed with the experimental messages.

   This document defines a new Mobility Header message, which is the
   Experimental Mobility message that can be sent at any time by the
   mobile node, the home agent or the correspondent node.  Since
   Mobility Header messages cannot be combined and sent in one packet,
   there is always only one Mobility Header message in any Mobile IPv6
   packet.  Home agent or correspondent node implementations that do not
   recognize the mobility message type, discard the message and send a
   Binding Error message as described in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>2</a>], with the Status field set
   to 2 (unrecognized MH Type value).  Mobile nodes that do not
   recognize the mobility message type should discard the message and
   send an ICMP Parameter problem with code 0.

   This document also defines a new mobility option, the Experimental
   Mobility option, which can be carried in any Mobility Header message.
   Mobility options, by definition, can be skipped if an implementation
   does not recognize the mobility option type [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>2</a>].

   The messages defined in this document can also be used for Network
   Mobility (NEMO) [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support Protocol"'>4</a>] and Proxy Mobile IPv6 [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Proxy Mobile IPv6"'>5</a>] since these protocols
   also use Mobility Header messages.

   Experimental code points could potentially disrupt a deployed network
   when experiments using these code points are performed in the
   network.  Therefore, the network scope of support for experimental
   values should carefully be evaluated before deploying any experiment
   across extended network domains, such as the public Internet.

   Experimental mechanisms should only be used for actual
   experimentation.  By design, only a single code point is allocated
   for the message and another one for the option.  This limits the
   number of experiments among a set of peers to one at a time.  When
   experimental mechanisms are shown to be useful, and there is a desire
   to deploy them beyond the experiment they should be standardized and
   given new code points.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>1</a>].

   The Experimental Mobility Header message is based on the Mobility
   Header message defined in <a href="./rfc3775#section-6.1">SectionÂ 6.1 of RFC 3775</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>2</a>].  There are no
   fields in the message beyond the required fields in the Mobility
   Header.  The 'MH Type' field in the Mobility Header indicates that it
   is an Experimental Mobility Header message.

   If no data is present in the message, two bytes of padding are
   required.  The 'Header Len' field in the Mobility Header is set to 0
   since the first 8 octets are excluded while calculating the length of
   the Mobility Header message.

   See <a href="./rfc3775">RFC 3775</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>2</a>] for a description of the 'Payload Proto', 'Header
   Len', 'MH Type', 'Reserved', and 'Checksum' fields.

   The 'Message Data' field carries the data specific to the
   experimental protocol extension.  The total length of the message is
   indicated by the 'Header Len' field in the Mobility Header.

   The Experimental Mobility option can be included in any Mobility
   Header message.  If the Mobility Header message includes a Binding
   Authorization Data option [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>2</a>], then the Experimental Mobility option
   should appear before the Binding Authorization Data option.

   Type

      An 8-bit field indicating that it is an experimental mobility
      option.

   Length

      An 8-bit field indicating the length of the option in octets
      excluding the Type and Length fields.

   Data

      Data related to the experimental protocol extension.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Protection for the Experimental Mobility Header message and Mobility
   option depends on the experiment that is being carried out and the
   kind of information that is being carried in the messages.  If these
   messages carry information that should not be revealed on the wire,
   or that can affect the binding cache entry at the home agent or the
   correspondent node, they should be protected in a manner similar to
   Binding Updates and Binding Acknowledgements.

   Security analyzers such as firewalls and network intrusion detection
   monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of the fields
   described in this document.  As new values for the fields are
   assigned, existing security analyzers that do not understand the new
   values may fail, resulting in either loss of connectivity, if the
   analyzer declines to forward the unrecognized traffic, or in loss of
   security if it does forward the traffic and the new values are used
   as part of an attack.

   When experimental code points are deployed within an administratively
   self-contained network domain, it must be ensured that each code
   point is used consistently to avoid interference between experiments.
   When experimental code points are used in traffic that crosses
   multiple administrative domains, the experimenters should assume that
   there is a risk that the same code points will be used simultaneously
   by other experiments and that there is a possibility that the
   experiments will interfere.  Particular attention should be given to
   security threats that such interference might create.  Please see <a href="./rfc4727">RFC</a>
