Abstract

   This document registers the media types application/dns and text/dns
   in accordance with <a href="./rfc2048">RFC 2048</a>.  The application/dns media type is used
   to identify data on the detached Domain Name System (DNS) format
   described in <a href="./rfc2540">RFC 2540</a>.  The text/dns media type is used to identify
   master files as described in <a href="./rfc1035">RFC 1035</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Domain Name System (DNS) [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>1</a>] information is traditionally stored in
   text files, so-called master files or zone files.  The format is
   described in <a href="./rfc1035#section-5">section 5 of RFC 1035</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>2</a>].

   DNS data can also be stored in a "detached" format, intended for
   archiving purposes, described in <a href="./rfc2540">RFC 2540</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Detached Domain Name System (DNS) Information"'>4</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4027">RFC 4027</a>             Domain Name System Media Types           April 2005</span>


   This document registers MIME media types for the two data formats,
   with the registration procedures described in <a href="./rfc2048">RFC 2048</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures"'>3</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20MIME%20Type%20Registration%20of%20application%2Fdns"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  MIME Type Registration of application/dns</span>

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/dns

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: dns

   Required parameters: None.

   Optional parameters: None.

   Encoding considerations: The data format is binary, and data must be
   transfered unmodified.  Using encodings intended for textual parts is
   not recommended.

   Security considerations: This media type identifies content as being
   detached DNS information, as documented in <a href="./rfc2540">RFC 2540</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Detached Domain Name System (DNS) Information"'>4</a>].  This data
   may be security relevant as per <a href="./rfc2538">RFC 2538</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Storing Certificates in the Domain Name System (DNS)"'>7</a>] or may be secured
   information as per <a href="./rfc2535">RFC 2535</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Domain Name System Security Extensions"'>6</a>].  Securing the content further may be
   done with standard techniques, such as OpenPGP [<a href="#ref-5" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>5</a>] or CMS [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>9</a>], but
   this is outside of the scope here.  Further security assessments are
   not available at this point.

   Interoperability considerations: The encoding of detached DNS
   information is, unlike textual master files, well defined.  No
   further interoperability considerations are known.

   Published specification: The format of data that could be tagged with
   this media type is documented in <a href="./rfc2540">RFC 2540</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Detached Domain Name System (DNS) Information"'>4</a>].

   Applications that use this media type: DNS-related software,
   including software storing and using certificates stored in DNS.

   Additional information:
     Magic number(s): None.
     File extension(s): Unknown.
     Macintosh File Type Code(s): Unknown.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/dns

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: dns

   Required parameters: None.

   Optional parameters: None.

   Encoding considerations: The data is textual and should be transfered
   in a line-oriented mode.  Text literals may contain CRLF within the
   text.  Binary transport is possible between systems that use the same
   end-of-line conventions.  Master files are in general ASCII, but
   non-ASCII octet values may occur and are treated as opaque values by
   DNS software (compare <a href="./rfc1035#section-5">RFC 1035, section 5</a>).  The master file format
   permits encoding arbitrary octet values by using the "\DDD" encoding.
   The use of "\DDD" encoding can be more reliable than transporting
   non-ASCII through MIME transports, if data passes through a gateway
   that re-encodes the character data.

   Security considerations: This media type identifies content as being
   DNS information in "master file" format, as documented in <a href="./rfc1035">RFC 1035</a>
   [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>2</a>].  The DNS data may be security relevant as per to <a href="./rfc2538">RFC 2538</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Storing Certificates in the Domain Name System (DNS)"'>7</a>],
   or may be secured information as per to <a href="./rfc2535">RFC 2535</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Domain Name System Security Extensions"'>6</a>].  Securing the
   content further may be done with standard techniques, such as OpenPGP
   [<a href="#ref-5" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>5</a>] or CMS [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>9</a>], but this is outside of the scope here.  Further
   security assessments are not available at this point.

   Interoperability considerations: There are interoperability concerns
   with master files, due to the widespread use of vendor-specific
   extensions.  Non-ASCII comments within master files may have been
   encoded in locally chosen character sets, which may be difficult to
   transport interoperably.  Non-ASCII data in general can become
   corrupted by re-encoding gateways.  To achieve interoperability, one
   can use the master file format described in the specification and the
   "\DDD" encoding for non-ASCII octets.  Further interoperability
   issues with unrecognized RR types exist, which may be handled as
   discussed in <a href="./rfc3597#section-5">section 5 of RFC 3597</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Handling of Unknown DNS Resource Record (RR) Types"'>8</a>].

   Published specification: The format of data that could be tagged with
   this MIME type is documented in <a href="./rfc1035">RFC 1035</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>2</a>].
