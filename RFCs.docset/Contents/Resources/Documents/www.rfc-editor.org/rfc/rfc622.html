                      <span class="h1">Scheduling IMP/TIP Down Time</span>


From time to time it is necessary for an IMP or TIP to be taken down
other than during its scheduled Preventive Maintenance period.  Examples
of such cases are retrofit programs and the off-line diagnosis and
repair of intermittent problems. In the past we have scheduled these
downs with our "primary site contact" at the affected site; in our view
this individual was responsible for representing all of the hosts (and
TIP users) connected to that IMP/TIP. Although this policy has worked
well in the past, the recent proliferation of Very Distant Hosts,
together with complaints from representatives of other (local or
distant) Hosts, has caused us to review our procedures.

This note announces a modification of the previous policy. We will
continue to schedule IMP/TIP downs with our "primary site contact."  We
will continue to consider this individual a representative of all Hosts
connected to that IMP/TIP, with the following exception. Any Host
organization wishing to be notified by telephone that down time has been
scheduled for their IMP/TIP may nominate some individual as a "secondary
contact."  The name of the secondary contact, together with a telephone
number where he/she can be reached, should be submitted to me by any of
the following methods:

    US mail

    Network mail

The NCC operators will notify the secondary contact by telephone after
scheduling down time with the primary contact.
