   The scope of this MIB is targeted for network operators responsible
   for managing the operations of network resources.  This document
   defines an alarm reporting control (ARC) MIB module, which provides a
   mechanism for a manager to suppress or defer the reporting of alarm
   conditions based on the resource ID and alarm condition type.

   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="./rfc3410#section-7">sectionÂ 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="./rfc3410" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>

   There is a need to provide a mechanism for controlling the reporting
   of alarm conditions of resources in a network device.  For example,
   (a) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource until
   the resource is problem-free, (b) inhibiting the reporting of alarm
   conditions of a resource for a specified time period, or (c)
   inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource
   indefinitely until explicitly allowed by the managing system at a
   later time.

   The alarm reporting control (ARC) feature provides an automatic in-
   service provisioning capability.  It allows sufficient time for
   service setup, customer testing, and other maintenance activities in
   an "alarm-free" state.  Once a resource is "problem-free", alarm
   reporting can be automatically or manually turned on (i.e., allowed).





<span class="grey">Lam, et al.                 Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-3"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3878">RFC 3878</a>              Alarm Reporting Control MIB         September 2004</span>


   By putting a network resource in ARC mode, (i.e., in nalm, nalmTI,
   nalmQI, or nalmQICD states, as described in the MIB), the technicians
   and managing systems will not be flooded with unnecessary work items
   during operations activities such as service provisioning and network
   setup/teardown.  This will reduce maintenance costs and improve the
   operation and maintenance of these systems.  Putting a network
   resource in ARC mode shall not affect the availability of active
   alarm condition information for potential retrieval.

   ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3] provides the
   business requirements, analysis, and design of the Alarm Reporting
   Control feature.

   This document defines the MIB objects to support a subset of the ARC
   functions described in M.3100 Amd3.  In particular, it defines a
   table that can be used to specify the ARC settings for the resources
   in a system.

   Defined in M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3], there are five ARC
   states: alm, nalm, nalmQI, nalmQICD and nalmTI.  In the ARC MIB
   module, the arcState object is defined to model the M.3100 ARC
   states. Note that the state alm (alarm reporting is allowed) is not
   listed in the enumeration of the value of this object.  However, this
   state is implicitly supported by the mib.  Once a resource enters the
   normal reporting mode (i.e., into the alm state) for the specified
   alarm type, the corresponding row will be automatically deleted from
   the arc table.  Also the manual setting of arcState to alm can be
   achieved through setting the RowStatus object to 'destroy'.

   The ARC MIB module defined in this document provides a way to control
   the reporting of alarm conditions.  A set of applicable alarm
   conditions is defined in ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 [<a href="#ref-M.3100" title='"Generic Network Information Model"'>M.3100</a>] and is
   named "probable causes".  These probable causes (alarm conditions)
   have been included in the IANAItuProbableCause TC, which is defined
   in the IANA-ITU-ALARM-TC MIB module [<a href="./rfc3877" title='"Alarm Management Information Base (MIB)"'>RFC3877</a>].  The IANA-ITU-ALARM-TC
   MIB module is maintained in the IANA web-site [<a href="#ref-ITUALARMTC">ITUALARMTC</a>].
   [<a href="./rfc3877" title='"Alarm Management Information Base (MIB)"'>RFC3877</a>].

   The ARC MIB module defines an IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero TC which can
   take any value of IANAItuProbableCause or 0.  The ARC MIB module
   further uses IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero to define the ARC settings
   for the managed resource in the network elements.  Specification of
   objects for defining and storing alarms, including active and history
   alarms, standing and transient alarms, and alarm notifications are
   out of the scope of this document.

   When the ARC MIB module is used in a managed system, the following
   rules apply:

   For alarm condition raised prior to entering ARC mode, reporting of
   alarm raised and alarm cleared will be sent as usual.

   For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and also cleared
   before exiting ARC mode, no reporting of alarm raised will be sent
   and no reporting of alarm cleared will be sent.

   For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and not cleared
   when exiting ARC mode, the reporting of alarm raised will be deferred
   until the moment of exiting ARC mode.  The reporting of alarm cleared
   will be sent as usual (i.e., at the time of alarm cleared).

   Further details of the ARC function can be found in M.3100 Amd3
   [M.3100 Amd3].

             if qualified problem-free (if nalmQICD is not supported) or
             if the CD timer expired (if nalmQICD is supported)

     nalmTI may transition to alm or nalm by management request.

     nalmTI may transition to alm automatically if the TI timer expired.

     Further details of ARC state transitions are defined in Figure 3
     of M.3100 Amd3 [M.3100 Amd3].

     According to the requirements in M.3100 Amd3, a resource
     supporting the ARC feature shall support the alm state and at
     least one of the nalm, nalmTI, and nalmQI states. The nalmQICD
     state is an optional substate of nalmQI.

     The arcState object controls the alarm reporting state of a
     resource. Note that the state alm (alarm reporting is allowed) is
     not listed in the enumeration of the value of this object. However,
     this state is implicitly supported by the mib.
     Once a resource enters the normal reporting mode (i.e., in the alm
     state) for the specified alarm type, the corresponding
     row will be automatically deleted from the arc table.
     Also the manual setting of arcState to alm can be achieved through
     setting the RowStatus object to 'destroy'.

     The nalamQICD state is a transitional state from nalmQI to alm. It
     is optional depending on the resource type and the implementation
     of the resource.  If it is supported, before the state
     transitions from nalmQI to alm, a count down period is activated
     for a duration set by the object arcNalmCDTimeInterval.  When the
     time is up, the arcState transitions to alm."

  DESCRIPTION
    "This columnar object is used for creating and deleting a conceptual
     row of the arcTable.  It is used to create and delete an arc
     setting.

     Setting RowStatus to createAndGo or createAndWait implies creating
     a new ARC setting for the specified resource and alarm type.
     Setting RowStatus to destroy implies removing the ARC setting and
     thus has the effect of resuming normal reporting behaviour of the
     resource for the alarm type.

     Only the objects arcState, arcNalmTimeRemaining, and arcRowStatus
     can be updated when a row is active. All the objects, except

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      arcTITimeInterval,
      arcCDTimeInterval,
      arcState,
      arcNalmTimeRemaining,
      arcRowStatus,
      arcStorageType.

   Setting these objects may have disruptive effects on network
   operation that range from omission of alarm notifications to flooding
   of unwanted alarm notifications from the network.  The consequence of
   suppressing or deferring the reporting of an alarm can prevent the
   timely delivery of important diagnostic information, including
   information that can help identify an attack.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      arcTITimeInterval,
      arcCDTimeInterval,
      arcState,
      arcNalmTimeRemaining,
      arcRowStatus,
      arcStorageType.

   Reading these objects will provide information about the setting
   which affects alarm notification generation.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-14"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3878">RFC 3878</a>              Alarm Reporting Control MIB         September 2004</span>


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="./rfc3410#section-8">[RFC3410], sectionÂ 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
