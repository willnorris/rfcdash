Abstract

   The registration policy for the "Network Configuration Protocol
   (NETCONF) Capability URNs" registry, set up by <a href="./rfc6241">RFC 6241</a>, has turned
   out to be unnecessarily strict.  This document changes that
   registration policy to "IETF Review", allowing registrations from
   certain well-reviewed Experimental RFCs, in addition to Standards
   Track RFCs.

   The "Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs"
   registry [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>] was set up with a registration policy of
   "Standards Action" [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>], allowing registrations only from
   Standards Track RFCs.  This provided thorough review of the
   specifications that are requesting NETCONF Capability URNs.  It has
   turned out to be desirable to allocate capability URNs for certain
   Experimental RFCs also, provided those specifications are also
   carefully reviewed.  The existing registration policy is, therefore,
   unnecessarily strict, requiring exception handling by the IESG.  This
   document changes that registration policy to "IETF Review", which
   also allows registrations from certain well-reviewed Experimental
   RFCs, or, for example, corrections to registry errors from
   Informational RFCs, with IETF review and consensus.

   IANA has changed the registration policy for the "Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs" registry to "IETF
   Review" and has added this document to the registry's reference
   field.

   Registrations made from RFCs that are not on the Standards Track need
   to be carefully reviewed through IETF Last Call and in consultation
   with relevant working groups, such as NETCONF.  The Operations and
   Management Area Directors should confirm that the document has
   received the appropriate level of review during IESG Evaluation.

   This document is purely procedural, and there are no related security
   considerations.
