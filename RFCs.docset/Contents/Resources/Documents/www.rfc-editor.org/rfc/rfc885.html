                      <span class="h1">TELNET END OF RECORD OPTION</span>


This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on
the ARPA Internet that need to mark record boundaries within Telnet
protocol data are expected to adopt and implement this standard.

   IAC WILL END-OF-RECORD

      The sender of this command requests permission to begin
      transmission of the Telnet END-OF-RECORD (EOR) code when
      transmitting data characters, or the sender of this command
      confirms it will now begin transmission of EORs with transmitted
      data characters.

   IAC WON'T END-OF-RECORD

      The sender of this command demands to stop transmitting, or to
      refuses to begin transmitting, the EOR code when transmitting data
      characters.

   IAC DO END-OF-RECORD

      The sender of this command requests that the sender of data start
      transmitting the EOR code when transmitting data, or the sender of
      this command confirms that the sender of data is expected to
      transmit EORs.

   IAC DON'T END-OF-RECORD

      The sender of this command demands that the receiver of the
      command stop or not start transmitting EORs when transmitting
      data.

   WON'T END-OF-RECORD

   DON'T END-OF-RECORD

   END-OF-RECORD is not transmitted.

   Many interactive systems use one (or more) of the normal data
   characters to indicate the end of an effective unit of data (i.e., a
   record), for example, carriage-return (or line-feed, or escape).
   Some systems, however, have some special means of indicating the end
   of an effective data unit, for example, a special key.  This Telnet
   option provides a means of communicating the end of data unit in a
   standard way.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Description%20of%20the%20Option"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Description of the Option</span>

   When the END-OF-RECORD option is in effect on the connection between
   a sender of data and the receiver of the data, the sender transmits
   EORs.

   It seems probable that the parties to the Telnet connection will
   transmit EORs in both directions of the Telnet connection if EORs are
   used at all;  however, the use of EORs must be negotiated
   independently for each direction.

   When the END-OF-RECORD option is not in effect, the IAC EOR command
   should be treated as a NOP if received, although IAC EOR should not
   normally be sent in this mode.

   As the EOR code indicates the end of an effective data unit, Telnet
   should attempt to send the data up to and including the EOR code
   together to promote communication efficiency.

   The end of record is indicated by the IAC EOR 2-octet sequence.  The
   code for EOR is 239 (decimal).
