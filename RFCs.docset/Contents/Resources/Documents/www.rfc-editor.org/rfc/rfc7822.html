        <span class="h1">Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) Extension Fields</span>

Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol version 4 (NTPv4) defines the optional
   usage of extension fields.  An extension field, as defined in <a href="./rfc5905">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc5905">5905</a>, is an optional field that resides at the end of the NTP header
   and that can be used to add optional capabilities or additional
   information that is not conveyed in the standard NTP header.  This
   document updates <a href="./rfc5905">RFC 5905</a> by clarifying some points regarding NTP
   extension fields and their usage with Message Authentication Codes
   (MACs).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The NTP header format consists of a set of fixed fields that may be
   followed by some optional fields.  Two types of optional fields are
   defined: Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and extension fields as
   defined in Section 7.5 of [<a href="#ref-NTPv4" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>NTPv4</a>].

   If a MAC is used, it resides at the end of the packet.  This field
   can be either 24 octets long, 20 octets long, or a 4-octet
   crypto-NAK.

   NTP extension fields were defined in [<a href="#ref-NTPv4" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>NTPv4</a>] as a generic mechanism
   that allows the addition of future extensions and features without
   modifying the NTP header format (Section 16 of [<a href="#ref-NTPv4" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>NTPv4</a>]).

   The only currently defined extension fields are those fields used by
   the Autokey protocol [<a href="#ref-Autokey" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey Specification"'>Autokey</a>] and the Checksum Complement [<a href="./rfc7821" title='"UDP Checksum Complement in the Network Time Protocol (NTP)"'>RFC7821</a>].
   The Autokey extension field is always followed by a MAC, and
   Section 10 of [<a href="#ref-Autokey" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey Specification"'>Autokey</a>] specifies the parsing rules that allow a host
   to distinguish between an extension field and a MAC.  However, a MAC
   is not mandatory after an extension field; an NTPv4 packet can
   include one or more extension fields without including a MAC.  This
   behavior is specified in Section 7.5 of [<a href="#ref-NTPv4" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>NTPv4</a>] and in [<a href="#ref-Err3627" title="Erratum ID 3627">Err3627</a>], and
   is further clarified in this document.

   This document updates [<a href="#ref-NTPv4" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>NTPv4</a>] (<a href="./rfc5905">RFC 5905</a>) by clarifying some points
   regarding the usage of extension fields.  These updates include
   changes to address errors found after the publication of [<a href="#ref-NTPv4" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>NTPv4</a>] with
   respect to extension fields.  Specifically, this document updates
   Section 7.5 of [<a href="#ref-NTPv4" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>NTPv4</a>], clarifying the relationship between extension
   fields and MACs, and defining the behavior of a host that receives an
   unknown extension field.

   7.5.  NTP Extension Field Format

      In NTPv4, one or more extension fields can be inserted after the
      header and before the MAC, which is always present when an
      extension field is present.  Other than defining the field format,
      this document makes no use of the field contents.  An extension
      field contains a request or response message in the format shown
      in Figure 14.

      boundary.  The Field Type field is specific to the defined
      function and is not elaborated here.  While the minimum field
      length containing required fields is four words (16 octets), a
      maximum field length remains to be established.

      All extension fields are zero-padded to a word (four octets)
      boundary.

      The Field Type, Value, and Padding fields are specific to the
      defined function and are not elaborated here; the Field Type value
      is defined in an IANA registry, and its Length, Value, and Padding
      values are defined by the document referred to by the registry.
      If a host receives an extension field with an unknown Field Type,
      the host SHOULD ignore the extension field and MAY drop the packet
      altogether if policy requires it.

      While the minimum field length containing required fields is
      four words (16 octets), the maximum field length cannot be longer
      than 65532 octets, due to the maximum size of the Length field.

      The Length field is a 16-bit unsigned integer that indicates the
      length of the entire extension field in octets, including the
      Padding field.

   7.5.1.  Extension Fields and MACs

   7.5.1.1.  Extension Fields in the Presence of a MAC

      An extension field can be used in an NTP packet that includes a
      MAC -- for example, as defined in [<a href="#ref-Autokey" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey Specification"'>Autokey</a>].  A specification that
      defines a new extension field MUST specify whether the extension
      field requires a MAC or not.  If the extension field requires a
      MAC, the extension field specification MUST define the algorithm
      to be used to create the MAC and the length of the MAC thus
      created.  An extension field MAY allow for the use of more than
      one algorithm, in which case the information about which algorithm
      was used MUST be included in the extension field itself.

   7.5.1.2.  Multiple Extension Fields with a MAC

      If there are multiple extension fields that require a MAC, they
      MUST all require the use of the same algorithm and MAC length.
      Extension fields that do not require a MAC can be included with
      extension fields that do require a MAC.

      An NTP packet MUST NOT be sent with two or more extension fields
      that require a MAC with different algorithms.

      If an NTP packet is received with two or more extension fields
      that this receiver recognizes and those fields require a MAC with
      different algorithms, the packet MUST be discarded.

   7.5.1.3.  MAC in the Absence of an Extension Field

      A MAC MUST NOT be longer than 24 octets if there is no extension
      field present, unless a longer MAC is agreed upon by both client
      and server.  The client and server can negotiate this behavior
      using a previous exchange of packets with an extension field that
      defines the size and algorithm of the MAC transmitted in NTP
      packets.

   7.5.1.4.  Extension Fields in the Absence of a MAC

      If a MAC is not present, one or more extension fields can be
      inserted after the header, according to the following rules:

      o  If the packet includes a single extension field, the length of
         the extension field MUST be at least 7 words, i.e., at least
         28 octets.

      o  If the packet includes more than one extension field, the
         length of the last extension field MUST be at least 28 octets.
         The length of the other extension fields in this case MUST be
         at least 16 octets each.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations of time protocols in general are
   discussed in [<a href="#ref-SecTime" title='"Security Requirements of Time Protocols in Packet Switched Networks"'>SecTime</a>], and the security considerations of NTP are
   discussed in [<a href="#ref-NTPv4" title='"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification"'>NTPv4</a>].

   Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on NTP servers involve
   flooding a server with a high rate of NTP packets.  Malicious usage
   of extension fields cannot amplify such DDoS attacks; such malicious
   attempts are mitigated by NTP servers, since the servers ignore
   unknown extension fields (as discussed in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) and only
   respond, if needed, with known extension fields.  Extension fields
   from incoming packets are neither propagated by NTP servers nor
   included in any response.  NTP servers create their own extension
   fields if needed for a response.  A large number of extension fields
   should be flagged by an NTP server as a potential attack.  Large
   extension field sizes should also be flagged, unless they are
   expected to be large.

   Middleboxes such as firewalls MUST NOT filter NTP packets based on
   their extension fields.  Such middleboxes should not examine
   extension fields in the packets, since NTP packets may contain new
   extension fields that the middleboxes have not been updated to
   recognize.
