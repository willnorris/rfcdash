NIC # 30445                                               April 10, 1974


               <span class="h1">Change in Network Address for Haskins Lab</span>


Sometime between May 8 and May 22, probably toward the end of that
period, the Haskins Laboratory "Very Distant Host" connection will be
moved from BBN (IMP #5) to Harvard (IMP #9).  The Host Number of the
Haskins machine will remain Host 3 (numbering from zero to three).
Thus, the Network Address of the Haskins Laboratory Host will change
from 197 to 201.  Since the date of the change is dependent on
installation of new circuits by the local telephone company, I am unable
to give the actual date more precisely.
