Abstract

   This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) to support absolute True and False filters based upon similar
   capabilities found in X.500 directory systems.  The document also
   extends the String Representation of LDAP Search Filters to support
   these filters.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Background</span>

   The X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [<a href="#ref-X.511" title='"The Directory: Abstract Service Definition"'>X.511</a>] supports absolute
   True and False assertions.  An 'and' filter with zero elements always
   evaluates to True.  An 'or' filter with zero elements always
   evaluates to False.  These filters are commonly used when requesting
   DSA-specific Entries (DSEs) that do not necessarily have
   'objectClass' attributes; that is, where "(objectClass=*)" may
   evaluate to False.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4526">RFC 4526</a>          LDAP Absolute True and False Filters         June 2006</span>


   Although LDAPv2 [<a href="./rfc1777" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol"'>RFC1777</a>][RFC3494] placed no restriction on the
   number of elements in 'and' and 'or' filter sets, the LDAPv2 string
   representation [<a href="./rfc1960" title='"A String Representation of LDAP Search Filters"'>RFC1960</a>][RFC3494] could not represent empty 'and' and
   'or' filter sets.  Due to this, absolute True or False filters were
   (unfortunately) eliminated from LDAPv3 [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>].

   This documents extends LDAPv3 to support absolute True and False
   assertions by allowing empty 'and' and 'or' in Search filters
   [<a href="./rfc4511" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"'>RFC4511</a>] and extends the filter string representation [<a href="./rfc4515" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation of Search Filters"'>RFC4515</a>] to
   allow empty filter lists.

   It is noted that certain search operations, such as those used to
   retrieve subschema information [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>], require use of particular
   filters.  This document does not change these requirements.

   This feature is intended to allow a more direct mapping between DAP
   and LDAP (as needed to implement DAP-to-LDAP gateways).

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   Implementations of this extension SHALL allow 'and' and 'or' choices
   with zero filter elements.

   An 'and' filter consisting of an empty set of filters SHALL evaluate
   to True.  This filter is represented by the string "(&amp;)".

   An 'or' filter consisting of an empty set of filters SHALL evaluate
   to False.  This filter is represented by the string "(|)".

   Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the Object Identifier
   1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.3 as a value of the 'supportedFeatures'
   [<a href="./rfc4512" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models"'>RFC4512</a>] attribute in the root DSE.

   Clients supporting this feature SHOULD NOT use the feature unless
   they know that the server supports it.

   The (re)introduction of absolute True and False filters is not
   believed to raise any new security considerations.

   Implementors of this (or any) LDAPv3 extension should be familiar
   with general LDAPv3 security considerations [<a href="./rfc4510" title='"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"'>RFC4510</a>].
