Request for Comments:  361                         MIT-DMCG
NIC:  10603                                        5 July 1972


     <span class="h1">In response to RFCs 347 and 348, ECHO and DISCARD, MIT-DMCG</span>
(Host 106) now has deamon processes that will respond to RFCs on
sockets 7 and 9.

     A few administrative type decisions were made, to which I
would like to solicit comments.

     First, if our machine is too full to support another deamon
process, the pro-offered connection will be refused;  that is, a
CLS will be sent in response to the RFC on socket 7 or 9.
Second, if no activity takes place for two consecutive minutes
(no characters received on input, or output blocked waiting for
allocation), the connection will be aborted.

     Does anyone see the need or desirability for the third
service in this set:  a random character generator?  Many systems
provide programs like "TTYTST" available over the standard login
connection, but there would be no difficulty in creating a server
connection (like ECHO) offering just this limited service.  I'm
sure that it would be useful for new NCPs, as well as statistics
gathering.
