NIC #10423                                                   22 May 1972

Obsoletes:  None

                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

   This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from
   May 8 to May 19.  No testing was done on May 15 due to the attempt
   to install the new IMP system on that day.

   During this interval the PDP-10 of the MIT Artificial
   Intelligence Group (Network address 134) and the PDP-10 at
   Stanford (Network address 11) each became Network Servers.

   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.
   These Hosts fall into two categories:

        1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the
            Network as servers (available for use from other sites)
            on a regular basis for at least two weeks.  The only
            Host in this category is the PDP-10 at Case (Network
            address 13).

        2)  Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.
            Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently
            in the Network (AMES, MITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, and
            BBN*).  This category also includes the Network Control
            Center computer (Network address 5) which is used solely
            for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally,
            included among these Hosts are the following:

            Network
            Address              Site                   Computer
            -------              ----                   --------
               7                Rand                    IBM-360/65
              73                Harvard                 PDP-1
              12                Illinois                PDP-11
              19                NBS                     PDP-11
              23                USC                     IBM-360/44

   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status
   for this period.

   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used
   to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

where
D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)

F = Full (Destination Host opened a connection, informed user that all
    Network ports were in use, and immediately closed the connection.)

H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to
    users.)

R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
    connection with 60 seconds.)

   * The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a
      Network Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not
      equipped to test (NETRJS).  We are assuming that initial
      connection to the NETRJS logger indicates that NETRJS is also
      functioning.
