Abstract

   This document describes a type-length-value (TLV) for use in the IS-
   IS routing protocol that allows for the proper use of the
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.  There exist
   certain scenarios in which IS-IS will not react appropriately to a
   BFD-detected forwarding plane failure without use of either this TLV
   or some other method.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>] is a
   protocol that allows for detection of a forwarding plane failure
   between two routers.  A router can use [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>] to validate that a
   peer router's forwarding ability is functioning.

   One specific application of BFD as described in [<a href="./rfc5882" title='"Generic Application of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5882</a>] is to
   verify the forwarding ability of an IS-IS [<a href="./rfc1195" title='"Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP and dual environments"'>RFC1195</a>] router's
   adjacencies; however, the method described in [<a href="./rfc5882" title='"Generic Application of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5882</a>] does not
   allow for certain failure scenarios.  We will define a TLV that will
   allow for proper response to the detection of all forwarding failures
   where the use of BFD is employed with IS-IS.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Requirements%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Requirements Language</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20Problem"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The Problem</span>

   We observe that, in order to allow for mixed use (i.e., some routers
   running BFD and some not), [<a href="./rfc5882" title='"Generic Application of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5882</a>] does not require a BFD session
   be established prior to the establishment of an IS-IS adjacency.
   Thus, if a router A has neighbors B and C, and B does not support
   BFD, A would still form adjacencies with B and C, and it would only
   establish a BFD session with C.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6213">RFC 6213</a>                  IS-IS BFD-Enabled TLV               April 2011</span>


   The problem with this solution is that it assumes that the
   transmission and receipt of IS-IS Hellos (IIHs) shares fate with
   forwarded data packets.  This is not a fair assumption to make given
   that the primary use of BFD is to protect IPv4 (and IPv6) forwarding,
   and IS-IS does not utilize IPv4 or IPv6 for sending or receiving its
   hellos.

   Thus, if we consider our previous example, and if C is currently
   experiencing an IPv4 forwarding failure that allows for IIHs to be
   sent and received, when A first starts (or restarts), A will assume
   that C simply does not support BFD, will form an adjacency with C,
   and may incorrectly forward IPv4 traffic through C.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20The%20Solution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  The Solution</span>

   A simple solution to this problem is for an IS-IS router to advertise
   that it has BFD enabled on a given interface.  It can do this through
   the inclusion of a TLV in its IIHs as described in this document.

   When sending an IIH on a BFD enabled interface, a router that
   supports this extension MUST include the BFD-enabled TLV in its IIH.
   The contents of the TLV MUST indicate what topologies/protocols
   [<a href="./rfc5120" title='"M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs)"'>RFC5120</a>] have been enabled for BFD by including the appropriate
   Multi-Topology Identifier (MTID)/ Network Layer Protocol Identifier
   (NLPID) pairs.

   When sending an IIH on an interface on which BFD is NOT enabled, a
   router MUST NOT include the BFD-enabled TLV.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20State%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  State Definitions</span>

   The following definitions apply to each IS-IS neighbor:

   For each locally supported MTID/NLPID pair, an
   "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_BFD_REQUIRED" variable is assigned.  If BFD is
   supported by both the local system and the neighbor of the MTID/
   NLPID, this variable is set to "TRUE".  Otherwise, the variable is
   set to "FALSE".

   For each locally supported MTID, an "ISIS_TOPO_BFD_REQUIRED" variable
   is set to the logical "OR" of all "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_BFD_REQUIRED"
   variables associated with that MTID.

   An "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" variable is set to the logical "AND" of all
   "ISIS_TOPO_BFD_REQUIRED" variables.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6213">RFC 6213</a>                  IS-IS BFD-Enabled TLV               April 2011</span>


   For each locally supported MTID/NLPID pair, an
   "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_STATE" variable is assigned.  If
   "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_BFD_REQUIRED" is "TRUE", this variable follows the
   BFD session state for that MTID/NLPID ("UP == TRUE").  Otherwise, the
   variable is set to "TRUE".

   For each locally supported topology (MTID), an "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE"
   variable is set to the logical "AND" of the set of
   "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_STATE" variables associated with that MTID.

   An "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" variable is set to the logical "OR" of all
   "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE" variables.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Adjacency%20Establishment%20and%20Maintenance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Adjacency Establishment and Maintenance</span>

   Whenever "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" is "TRUE", the following extensions to
   the rules for adjacency establishment and maintenance MUST apply:

   o  "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" MUST be "TRUE" before the adjacency can
      transition from "INIT" to "UP" state.

   o  When the IS-IS adjacency is "UP" and "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE"
      becomes "FALSE", the IS-IS adjacency MUST transition to "DOWN".

   o  On a Point-to-Point circuit whenever "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" is
      "FALSE", the Three-Way adjacency state MUST be set to "DOWN" in
      the Point-to-Point Three-Way Adjacency TLV [<a href="./rfc5303" title='"Three-Way Handshake for IS-IS Point-to-Point Adjacencies"'>RFC5303</a>] in all
      transmitted IIHs.

   o  On a LAN circuit whenever "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" is "FALSE", the
      IS Neighbors TLV advertising the Media Access Control (MAC)
      address of the neighbor MUST be omitted in all transmitted IIHs.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Advertisement%20of%20Topology-Specific%20IS%20Neighbors"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Advertisement of Topology-Specific IS Neighbors</span>

   The advertisement of a topology-specific IS neighbor (as well as the
   use of the neighbor in the topology-specific decision process) is
   determined by the value of "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE" for each topology.  If
   "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE" is "TRUE", then the topology-specific neighbor is
   advertised.  If "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE" is "FALSE", then the topology-
   specific neighbor is not advertised.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Transition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Transition</span>

   To allow for a non-disruptive transition to the use of BFD, some
   amount of time should be allowed before bringing down an "UP"
   adjacency on a BFD enabled interface when the value of
   "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" becomes "TRUE" as a result of the introduction of

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6213">RFC 6213</a>                  IS-IS BFD-Enabled TLV               April 2011</span>


   the BFD TLV or the modification (by adding a new supported MTID/
   NLPID) of an existing BFD TLV in a neighbor's IIH.  A simple way to
   do this is to not update the adjacency hold time when receiving such
   an IIH from a neighbor with whom we have an "UP" adjacency until
   "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" becomes "TRUE".

   If the value of "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" becomes "FALSE" as a result of
   the removal the BFD TLV or the modification (by removing a supported
   MTID/NLPID) of an existing BFD TLV in a neighbor's IIH, then BFD
   session establishment is no longer required to maintain the adjacency
   or transition the adjacency to the "UP" state.

   If a BFD session is administratively shut down [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>] and the BFD
   session state change impacts the value of "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE",
   then IS-IS SHOULD allow time for the corresponding MTID/NLPID to be
   removed from the neighbor's BFD TLV by not updating the adjacency
   hold time until "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" becomes "FALSE".  Note that while
   this allows a non-disruptive transition, it still enforces
   consistency between the administrative state of the BFD session and
   the MTID/NLPID(s) advertised in the BFD TLV.  This is necessary to
   provide consistent behavior regardless of whether the BFD AdminDown
   state is introduced before or after an IS-IS adjacency "UP" state has
   been achieved.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Graceful%20Restart"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Graceful Restart</span>

   This section describes IS-IS implementation considerations when both
   IS-IS graceful restart [<a href="./rfc5306" title='"Restart Signaling for IS-IS"'>RFC5306</a>] and BFD are co-deployed.

   In cases where BFD shares fate with the control plane, it can be
   expected that BFD session failure may occur in conjunction with the
   control-plane restart.  In such cases, premature abort of IS-IS
   graceful restart as a result of BFD session failure is undesirable.
   Therefore, some mechanism to ignore the BFD session failure for a
   limited period of time would be beneficial.  The issue of the
   interaction between graceful restart and BFD is described at length
   in <a href="./rfc5882">RFC 5882</a>.  The implementation of this interaction is outside the
   scope of this document.

   The BFD-enabled TLV is formatted as shown below.  The TLV SHALL only
   be included in an IIH and only when BFD is enabled for one or more
   supported MTID/protocols on the interface over which the IIH is being
   sent.  The NLPIDs encoded in the TLV are defined in [<a href="#ref-ISO9577" title='"Protocol identification in the network layer(ISO/IEC 9577)"'>ISO9577</a>].

   The TLV defined within this document describes an addition to the
   IS-IS Hello protocol.  Inappropriate use of this TLV could prevent an
   IS-IS adjacency from forming or lead to failure to detect
   bidirectional forwarding failures -- each of which is a form of
   denial of service.  However, a party who can manipulate the contents
   of this TLV is already in a position to create such a denial of
   service by disrupting IS-IS routing in other ways.

   Note that the introduction of this TLV has no impact on the use/
   non-use of authentication either by IS-IS or by BFD.
