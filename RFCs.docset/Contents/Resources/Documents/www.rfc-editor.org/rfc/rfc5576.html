Abstract

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to
   describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media
   streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a
   multimedia session, but does not provide any mechanism to describe
   individual media sources within a media stream.  This document
   defines a mechanism to describe RTP media sources, which are
   identified by their synchronization source (SSRC) identifiers, in
   SDP, to associate attributes with these sources, and to express
   relationships among sources.  It also defines several source-level
   attributes that can be used to describe properties of media sources.

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] provides mechanisms
   to describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of media streams
   (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] sessions) within
   a multimedia session, but does not provide any mechanism to describe
   individual media sources within a media stream.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5576">RFC 5576</a>             Source-Specific SDP Attributes            June 2009</span>


   Several recently proposed protocols, notably RTP single-source
   multicast [<a href="#ref-EXT-SSM" title='"RTCP Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast Feedback"'>EXT-SSM</a>], have found it useful to describe specific media
   sources in SDP messages.  Single-source multicast, in particular,
   needs to ensure that receivers' RTP synchronization source (SSRC)
   identifiers do not collide with those of media senders, as the RTP
   specification [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] requires that colliding sources change their
   SSRC values after a collision has been detected.  Earlier work has
   used mechanisms specific to each protocol to describe the individual
   sources of an RTP session.

   Moreover, whereas the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] is
   defined as allowing multiple sources in an RTP session (for example,
   if a user has more than one camera), SDP has no existing mechanism
   for an endpoint to indicate that it will be using multiple sources or
   to describe their characteristics individually.

   To address all these problems, this document defines a mechanism to
   describe RTP sources, identified by their synchronization source
   (SSRC) identifier, in SDP, to associate attributes with these
   sources, and to express relationships among individual sources.  It
   also defines a number of new SDP attributes that apply to individual
   sources ("source-level" attributes), describes how a number of
   existing media stream ("media-level") attributes can also be applied
   at the source level, and establishes IANA registries for source-level
   attributes and source grouping semantics.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   In the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], an association
   among a group of communicating participants is known as an RTP
   Session.  An RTP session is typically associated with a single
   transport address (in the case of multicast) or communication flow
   (in the case of unicast), though RTP translators and single-source
   multicast [<a href="#ref-EXT-SSM" title='"RTCP Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast Feedback"'>EXT-SSM</a>] can make the situation more complex.  RTP
   topologies are discussed in more detail in [<a href="./rfc5117" title='"RTP Topologies"'>RFC5117</a>].

   Within an RTP session, the source of a single stream of RTP packets
   is known as a synchronization source (SSRC).  Every synchronization
   source is identified by a 32-bit numeric identifier.  In addition,
   receivers (who may never send RTP packets) also have source

   identifiers, which are used to identify their RTP Control Protocol
   (RTCP) receiver reports and other feedback messages.

   Messages of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>], known
   as session descriptions, describe multimedia sessions.  A multimedia
   session is a set of multimedia senders and receivers as well as the
   data streams flowing from senders to receivers.  A multimedia session
   contains a number of media streams, which are the individual RTP
   sessions or other media paths over which one type of multimedia data
   is carried.  Information that applies to an entire multimedia session
   is called session-level information, while information pertaining to
   one media stream is called media-level information.  The collection
   of all the information describing a media stream is known as a media
   description.  (Media descriptions are also sometimes known informally
   as SDP "m"-lines, after the SDP syntax that begins a media
   description.)  Several standard information elements are defined at
   both the session level and the media level.  Extended information can
   be included at both levels through the use of attributes.

   (The term "media stream" does not appear in the SDP specification
   itself, but is used by a number of SDP extensions, for instance,
   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [<a href="#ref-ICE" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>ICE</a>], to denote the
   object described by an SDP media description.  This term is
   unfortunately rather confusing, as the RTP specification [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>]
   uses the term "media stream" to refer to an individual media source
   or RTP packet stream, identified by an SSRC, whereas an SDP media
   stream describes an entire RTP session, which can contain any number
   of RTP sources.  In this document, the term "media stream" means an
   SDP media stream, i.e., the thing described by an SDP media
   description, whereas "media source" is used for a single source of
   media packets, i.e., an RTP media stream.)

   The core SDP specification does not have any way of describing
   individual media sources, particularly RTP synchronization sources,
   within a media stream.  To address this problem, in this document we
   introduce a third level of information, called source-level
   information.  Syntactically, source-level information is described by
   a new SDP media-level attribute, "ssrc", which identifies specific
   synchronization sources within an RTP session and acts as a meta-
   attribute mapping source-level attribute information to these
   sources.

   This document also defines an SDP media-level attribute, "ssrc-
   group", which can represent relationships among media sources within
   an RTP session in much the same way as the "group" attribute
   [<a href="./rfc3388" title='"Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3388</a>] represents relationships among media streams within a
   multimedia session.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Media%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Media Attributes</span>

   This section defines two media-level attributes, "ssrc" and "ssrc-
   group".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20The%20%22ssrc%22%20Media%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  The "ssrc" Media Attribute</span>

   a=ssrc:&lt;ssrc-id&gt; &lt;attribute&gt;
   a=ssrc:&lt;ssrc-id&gt; &lt;attribute&gt;:&lt;value&gt;

   The SDP media attribute "ssrc" indicates a property (known as a
   "source-level attribute") of a media source (RTP stream) within an
   RTP session. &lt;ssrc-id&gt; is the synchronization source (SSRC) ID of the
   source being described, interpreted as a 32-bit unsigned integer in
   network byte order and represented in decimal. &lt;attribute&gt; or
   &lt;attribute&gt;:&lt;value&gt; represents the source-level attribute specific to
   the given media source.  The source-level attribute follows the
   syntax of the SDP "a=" line.  It thus consists of either a single
   attribute name (a flag) or an attribute name and value, e.g.,
   "cname:user@example.com".  No attributes of the former type are
   defined by this document.

   Within a media stream, "ssrc" attributes with the same value of
   &lt;ssrc-id&gt; describe different attributes of the same media sources.
   Across media streams, &lt;ssrc-id&gt; values are not correlated (unless
   correlation is indicated by media-stream grouping or some other
   mechanism) and MAY be repeated.

   Each "ssrc" media attribute specifies a single source-level attribute
   for the given &lt;ssrc-id&gt;.  For each source mentioned in SDP, the
   source-level attribute "cname", defined in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>, MUST be
   provided.  Any number of other source-level attributes for the source
   MAY also be provided.

   The "ssrc" media attribute MAY be used for any RTP-based media
   transport.  It is not defined for other transports.

   If any other SDP attributes also mention RTP SSRC values (for
   example, Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) [<a href="./rfc3830" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>] [<a href="./rfc4567" title='"Key Management Extensions for Session Description Protocol (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)"'>RFC4567</a>]), the
   values used MUST be consistent.  (These attributes MAY provide
   additional information about a source described by an "ssrc"
   attribute or MAY describe additional sources.)

   Though the source-level attributes specified by the ssrc property
   follow the same syntax as session-level and media-level attributes,
   they are defined independently.  All source-level attributes MUST be
   registered with IANA, using the registry defined in <a href="#section-12.2">Section 12.2</a>.

   Figure 4 in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> gives a formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] grammar for the "ssrc" attribute.

   The "ssrc" media attribute is not dependent on charset.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20The%20%22ssrc-group%22%20Media%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  The "ssrc-group" Media Attribute</span>

   a=ssrc-group:&lt;semantics&gt; &lt;ssrc-id&gt; ...

   The SDP media attribute "ssrc-group" expresses a relationship among
   several sources of an RTP session.  It is analogous to the "group"
   session-level attribute [<a href="./rfc3388" title='"Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3388</a>], which expresses a relationship
   among media streams in an SDP multimedia session (i.e., a
   relationship among several logically related RTP sessions).  As
   sources are already identified by their SSRC IDs, no analogous
   property to the "mid" attribute is necessary; groups of sources are
   identified by their SSRC IDs directly.

   The &lt;semantics&gt; parameter is taken from the specification of the
   "group" attribute [<a href="./rfc3388" title='"Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3388</a>].  The initial semantic values defined for
   the "ssrc-group" attribute are FID (Flow Identification) [<a href="./rfc3388" title='"Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3388</a>]
   and FEC (Forward Error Correction) [<a href="./rfc4756" title='"Forward Error Correction Grouping Semantics in Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4756</a>].  In each case, the
   relationship among the grouped sources is the same as the
   relationship among corresponding sources in media streams grouped
   using the SDP "group" attribute.

   Though the "ssrc-group" semantic values follow the same syntax as
   "group" semantic values, they are defined independently.  All "ssrc-
   group" semantic values MUST be registered with IANA, using the
   registry defined in <a href="#section-12.3">Section 12.3</a>.

   (The other "group" semantics registered with IANA as of this writing
   are not useful for source grouping.  LS (Lip Synchronization)
   [<a href="./rfc3388" title='"Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3388</a>] is redundant for sources within a media stream as RTP
   sources with the same CNAME are implicitly synchronized in RTP.  SRF
   (Single Reservation Flow) [<a href="./rfc3524" title='"Mapping of Media Streams to Resource Reservation Flows"'>RFC3524</a>] and ANAT (Alternative Network
   Address Types) [<a href="./rfc4091" title='"The Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework"'>RFC4091</a>] refer specifically to the media stream's
   transport characteristics.  CS (Composite Session) [<a href="#ref-FLUTE" title='"SDP Descriptors for FLUTE"'>FLUTE</a>] is used to
   group FLUTE sessions, and so is not applicable to RTP.)

   The "ssrc-group" attribute indicates the sources in a group by
   listing the &lt;ssrc-id&gt;s of the sources in the group.  It MUST list at
   least one &lt;ssrc-id&gt; for a group and MAY list any number of additional
   ones.  Every &lt;ssrc-id&gt; listed in an "ssrc-group" attribute MUST be
   defined by a corresponding "ssrc:" line in the same media
   description.

   The "ssrc-group" media attribute is not dependent on charset.

   Figure 5 in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> gives a formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] grammar for the "ssrc-group" attribute.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Usage%20of%20Identified%20Source%20Identifiers%20in%20RTP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Usage of Identified Source Identifiers in RTP</span>

   The synchronization source identifiers used in an RTP session are
   chosen randomly and independently by endpoints.  As such, it is
   possible for two RTP endpoints to choose the same SSRC identifier.
   Though the probability of this is low, the RTP specification
   [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] requires that all RTP endpoints MUST be prepared to detect
   and resolve collisions.

   As a result, all endpoints MUST be prepared for the fact that
   information about specific sources identified in a media stream might
   be out of date.  The actual binding between SSRCs and source CNAMEs
   can only be identified by the source description (SDES) RTCP packets
   transmitted on the RTP session.

   When endpoints are choosing their own local SSRC values for media
   streams for which source-level attributes have been specified, they
   MUST NOT use for themselves any SSRC identifiers mentioned in media
   descriptions they have received for the media stream.

   However, sources identified by SDP source-level attributes do not
   otherwise affect RTP transport logic.  Specifically, sources that are
   only known through SDP, for which neither RTP nor RTCP packets have
   been received, MUST NOT be counted for RTP group size estimation, and
   report blocks MUST NOT be sent for them in SR or RR RTCP messages.

   Endpoints MUST NOT assume that only the sources mentioned in SDP will
   be present in an RTP session; additional sources, with previously
   unmentioned SSRC IDs, can be added at any time, and endpoints MUST be
   prepared to receive packets from these sources.  (How endpoints
   handle such packets is not specified here; they SHOULD be handled in
   the same manner as packets from additional sources would be handled
   had the endpoint not received any a=ssrc: attributes at all.)

   An endpoint that observes an SSRC collision between its explicitly
   signaled source and another entity that has not explicitly signaled
   an SSRC MAY delay its RTP collision-resolution actions [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] by
   5*1.5*Td, where Td is the deterministic, calculated, reporting
   interval for receivers defined in <a href="#section-6.3.1">Section 6.3.1</a> of the RTP
   specification [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], to see whether the conflict still exists.
   (This gives precedence to explicitly signaled sources and places the
   burden of collision resolution on non-signaled sources.)  SSRC
   collisions between multiple explicitly-signaled sources, however,
   MUST be acted upon immediately.

   If, following RTP's collision-resolution procedures [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], a
   source identified by source-level attributes has been forced to
   change its SSRC identifier, the author of the SDP containing the
   source-level attributes for these sources SHOULD send out an updated
   SDP session description with the new SSRC if the mechanism by which
   SDP is being distributed for the multimedia session has a mechanism
   to distribute updated SDP.  This updated SDP MUST include a
   "previous-ssrc" source-level attribute, described in <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>,
   listing the source's previous SSRC ID.  (If only a single source with
   a given CNAME has collided, the other RTP session members can infer a
   correspondence between the source's old and new SSRC IDs without
   requiring an updated session description.  However, if more than one
   source collides at once, or if sources are leaving and re-joining,
   this inference is not possible.  To avoid confusion, therefore,
   sending updated SDP messages is always RECOMMENDED.)

   Endpoints MUST NOT reuse the same SSRC ID for identified sources with
   the same CNAME for at least the duration of the RTP session's
   participant timeout interval (see <a href="./rfc3550#section-6.3.5">Section 6.3.5 of [RFC3550]</a>).  They
   SHOULD NOT reuse any SSRC ID ever mentioned in SDP (either by
   themselves or by other endpoints) for the entire lifetime of the RTP
   session.

   Endpoints MUST be prepared for the possibility that other parties in
   the session do not understand SDP source-level attributes, unless
   some higher-level mechanism normatively requires them.  See <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>
   for more discussion of this.

   This section describes specific source attributes that can be applied
   to RTP sources.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20The%20%22cname%22%20Source%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  The "cname" Source Attribute</span>

   a=ssrc:&lt;ssrc-id&gt; cname:&lt;cname&gt;

   The "cname" source attribute associates a media source with its
   Canonical End-Point Identifier (CNAME) source description (SDES)
   item.  This MUST be the CNAME value that the media sender will place
   in its RTCP SDES packets; it therefore MUST follow the syntax
   conventions of CNAME defined in the RTP specification [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  If
   a session participant receives an RTCP SDES packet associating this
   SSRC with a different CNAME, it SHOULD assume there has been an SSRC
   collision and that the description of the source that was carried in
   the SDP description is not applicable to the actual source being
   received.  This source attribute is REQUIRED to be present if any
   source attributes are present for a source.  The "cname" attribute

   media stream.

   The "cname" source attribute is not dependent on charset.

   a=ssrc:&lt;ssrc-id&gt; previous-ssrc:&lt;ssrc-id&gt; ...

   The "previous-ssrc" source attribute associates a media source with
   previous source identifiers used for the same media source.
   Following an SSRC change due to an SSRC collision involving a media
   source described in SDP, the updated session description describing
   the source's new SSRC (described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>) MUST include the
   "previous-ssrc" attribute associating the new SSRC with the old one.
   If further updated SDP descriptions are published describing the
   media source, the "previous-ssrc" attribute SHOULD be included if the
   session description was generated before the participant timeout of
   the old SSRC, and MAY be included after that point.  This attribute,
   if present, MUST list at least one previous SSRC and MAY list any
   number of additional SSRCs for the source if the source has collided
   more than once.  This attribute MUST be present only once for each
   source.

   The "previous-ssrc" source attribute is not dependent on charset.

   (ABNF) [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] grammar for the previous-ssrc attribute.

   a=ssrc:&lt;ssrc&gt; fmtp:&lt;format&gt; &lt;format specific parameters&gt;

   The "fmtp" source attribute allows format-specific parameters to be
   conveyed about a given source.  The &lt;format&gt; parameter MUST be one of
   the media formats (i.e., RTP payload types) specified for the media
   stream.  The meaning of the &lt;format specific parameters&gt; is unique
   for each media type.  This parameter MUST only be used for media
   types for which source-level format parameters have explicitly been
   specified; media-level format parameters MUST NOT be carried over
   blindly.

   The "fmtp" source attribute is not dependent on charset.

   This document only defines source attributes that are necessary or
   useful for an endpoint to decode and render the sources in a media
   stream.  It does not include any attributes that would contribute to
   an endpoint's decision to accept or reject a stream, e.g., in an
   offer/answer exchange.  Such attributes are for future consideration.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Examples</span>

   This section gives several examples of SDP descriptions of media
   sessions containing source attributes.  For brevity, only the media
   sections of the descriptions are given.

   The example in Figure 2 shows a video stream where one participant

   could be further distinguished by RTCP Source Description (SDES)
   information.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5576">RFC 5576</a>             Source-Specific SDP Attributes            June 2009</span>


   The example in Figure 3 shows how the relationships among sources
   used for RTP retransmission [<a href="./rfc4588" title='"RTP Retransmission Payload Format"'>RFC4588</a>] can be explicitly signaled.
   This prevents the complexity of associating original sources with
   retransmission sources when SSRC multiplexing is used for RTP
   retransmission, as is described in <a href="./rfc4588#section-5.3">Section 5.3 of [RFC4588]</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Usage%20With%20the%20Offer%2FAnswer%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Usage With the Offer/Answer Model</span>

   When used with the SDP Offer/Answer Model [<a href="./rfc3264" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>], SDP source-
   specific attributes describe only the sources that each party is
   willing to send (whether it is sending RTP data or RTCP report
   blocks).  No mechanism is provided by which an answer can accept or
   reject individual sources within a media stream; if the set of
   sources in a media stream is unacceptable, the answerer's only option
   is to reject the media stream or the entire multimedia session.

   The SSRC IDs for sources described by an SDP answer MUST be distinct
   from the SSRC IDs for sources of that media stream in the offer.
   Similarly, new SSRC IDs in an updated offer MUST be distinct from the
   SSRC IDs for that media stream established in the most recent offer/
   answer exchange for the session and SHOULD be distinct from any SSRC
   ID ever used by either party within the multimedia session (whether
   or not it is still being used).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Backward%20Compatibility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Backward Compatibility</span>

   According to the definition of SDP, interpreters of SDP session
   descriptions ignore unknown attributes.  Thus, endpoints MUST be
   prepared that recipients of their RTP media session may not
   understand their explicit source descriptions, unless some external
   mechanism indicates that they were understood.  In some cases (such
   as RTP Retransmission [<a href="./rfc4588" title='"RTP Retransmission Payload Format"'>RFC4588</a>]), this may constrain some choices
   about the bitstreams that are transmitted.

   Source descriptions are specified in this document such that RTP
   endpoints that are compliant with the RTP specification [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>]
   will be able to decode the media streams they describe whether or not
   they support explicit source descriptions.  However, some deployed
   RTP implementations may not actually support multiple media sources
   in a media stream.  Media senders MAY wish to restrict themselves to
   a single source at a time unless they have some means of concluding
   that the receivers of the media stream support source multiplexing.

   This document defines two SDP media-level attributes: "ssrc" and
   "ssrc-group".  These attributes have been registered by IANA under
   "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" under "att-field
   (media level only)".

   The "ssrc" attribute is used to identify characteristics of media
   sources within a media stream.  Its format is defined in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   The "ssrc-group" attribute is used to identify relationships among
   media sources within a media stream.  Its format is defined in
   <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/12.2.%20%20Registry%20for%20Source-Level%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.2" id="section-12.2">12.2</a>.  Registry for Source-Level Attributes</span>

   This specification creates a new IANA registry named "att-field
   (source level)" within the SDP parameters registry.  Source
   attributes MUST be registered with IANA and documented under the same
   rules as for SDP session-level and media-level attributes as
   specified in [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>].

   New attribute registrations are accepted according to the
   "Specification Required" policy of [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>], provided that the
   specification includes the following information:

   o  contact name, email address, and telephone number

   o  attribute name (as it will appear in SDP)

   o  long-form attribute name in English

   o  whether the attribute value is subject to the charset attribute

   o  a one-paragraph explanation of the purpose of the attribute

   o  a specification of appropriate attribute values for this attribute

   The above is the minimum that IANA will accept.  The Expert Reviewer
   will determine if the proposed attributes are expected to see
   widespread use and interoperability; in that case, the attributes
   MUST be specified in a Standards Track RFC.

   Submitters of registrations should ensure that the specification is
   in the spirit of SDP attributes, most notably that the attribute is
   platform independent in the sense that it makes no implicit
   assumptions about operating systems and does not name specific pieces
   of software in a manner that might inhibit interoperability.

   Source-level attributes that are substantially similar in semantics
   to existing session-level or media-level attributes SHOULD reuse the
   same attribute name as those session-level or media-level attributes.
   Source-level attributes SHOULD NOT reuse attribute names of session-
   level or media-level attributes that are unrelated or substantially
   different.

   The initial set of source attribute names, with definitions in
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> of this document, is in Figure 8.

   This specification creates a new IANA registry named 'Semantics for
   the "ssrc-group" SDP Attribute' within the SDP parameters registry.
   Source group semantics MUST be defined in Standards Track RFCs, under
   the same rules as [<a href="./rfc3388" title='"Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3388</a>].

   The IANA Considerations section of the RFC MUST include the following
   information, which appears in the IANA registry along with the RFC
   number of the publication:

   o  A brief description of the semantics.

   o  Token to be used within the group attribute.  This token may be of
      any length, but SHOULD be no more than four characters long.

   o  Reference to a Standards Track RFC.

   Source grouping semantic values that are substantially similar to
   existing media grouping semantic values SHOULD reuse the same
   semantics name as those media grouping semantics.  Source grouping
   semantics SHOULD NOT reuse source grouping semantic names that are
   unrelated or substantially different.
