       <span class="h1">Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol Extensions</span>

Abstract

   An important class of location-based services answers the question,
   "What instances of this service are closest to me?"  Examples include
   finding restaurants, gas stations, stores, automated teller machines,
   wireless access points (hot spots), or parking spaces.  Currently,
   the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol only supports
   mapping locations to a single service based on service regions.  This
   document describes an extension that allows queries of the type "N
   nearest", "within distance X", and "served by".

   The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>] maps
   service identifiers (URNs) and civic or geospatial information to
   service URIs, based on service regions.  While motivated by mapping
   locations to the public safety answering point (PSAP) serving that
   location, the protocol has been designed to generalize to other
   location-mapping services.

   However, the current LoST query model assumes that each service URI
   has a service region and that service regions do not overlap.  This
   fits the emergency services model, where the service region of a PSAP
   is given by jurisdictional boundaries, but does not work as well for
   other services that do not have clearly defined boundaries.  For
   example, any given location is likely served by a number of different
   restaurants, depending on how far the prospective customer is willing
   to travel.

   We extend LoST with three additional &lt;findService&gt; query types,
   giving the protocol the ability to find the N nearest instances of a
   particular service, all services within a given distance, and all
   services whose service region includes the user's current location.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Service%20Regions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Service Regions</span>

   Generally speaking, service regions apply only to a subset of
   services.

   In <a href="./rfc5222#section-1">Section 1 of [RFC5222]</a>, a service region is defined as follows:

   "To minimize round trips and to provide robustness against network
   failures, LoST supports caching of individual mappings and indicates
   the region for which the same answer would be returned ("service
   region")."

   <a href="./rfc5222#section-5.5">Section 5.5 of [RFC5222]</a> further defines a service region:

   "A response MAY indicate the region for which the service URL
   returned would be the same as in the actual query, the so-called
   service region."

   For emergency services, service region and service area, as defined
   in [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>], represent the same geographical area.  This is due to
   the fact that each PSAP serves its own area without overlapping with
   the service area of any other PSAP.  For as long as the client is
   located in the service area of a PSAP, the same PSAP is returned by
   the LoST server, that is, the service region does not change.  A
   service region is the service area of a PSAP.

   For non-emergency services, different points of service may have
   different overlapping service areas.  This means that one service
   region will probably include a large number of service areas.  Since
   we can get a large number of service URIs for each query, a service
   region per the definition above would be the region within which a
   user would get the same set of service URIs.  If one or more of the
   URIs in the set changes, the set of URIs changes, i.e., the service
   region changes.  Therefore, for non-emergency services, the service
   region defined in [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>] would change frequently, thus greatly
   reducing the benefit of caching responses by service region.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6451">RFC 6451</a>                     LoST Extensions               December 2011</span>


   Generally speaking, we can divide location-based services into two
   main categories based on:

   o  how far they are from the user (e.g., automatic teller machine,
      food takeout);

   o  whether or not their service area includes the user's current
      location (e.g., pizza delivery, PSAP).

   For services included in the first category, service areas and
   therefore service regions are not relevant while they are important
   for services included in the second category.  This distinction
   becomes obvious if we consider, for example, the difference between
   takeout (first category) and delivery (second category).  In the case
   of takeout, the user wants to go to a particular restaurant and buy
   dinner, regardless of whether his location falls into the delivery
   service area of the restaurant or not.  For delivery, the user cares
   about the restaurant service area as the restaurant will deliver food
   to him only if his location falls within the restaurant service area.

   There is a clear distinction between services that require service
   areas and services that do not.  The LoST extensions defined in this
   document take this into account by using the service classification
   mentioned above.

New &lt;findService&gt; Query Types: "N nearest", "within distance X", and</span>
    "served by"

   We introduce three new types of &lt;findService&gt; queries: "N nearest",
   "within distance X", and "served by".  The first query returns the N
   points of interest (POIs) closest to the client's physical location;
   the second query discovers all the points of interest located within
   a given distance from the client's physical location; and the third
   query returns all the points of interest whose service area includes
   the client's current location.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20LoST%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  LoST Extensions</span>

   For "within distance X" queries, the LoST client needs to specify to
   the server the range within which instances of a particular service
   should be searched.  In order to do this, we make use of various
   shapes [<a href="./rfc5491" title='"GEOPRIV Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) Usage Clarification, Considerations, and Recommendations"'>RFC5491</a>] in LoST queries.

   For "served by" queries, the LoST client needs to let the server know
   that it MUST return only those services whose service area includes
   the user's current location.  In order to do this, we introduce the

   &lt;region&gt; element in &lt;findService&gt; queries.  Service region boundaries
   MAY be returned in a LoST &lt;findServiceResponse&gt; as described in
   [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>].

   For "N nearest" queries, the LoST client needs to let the server know
   N, i.e., the maximum number of service URIs to be returned in a
   response.  In order to specify this, we introduce the &lt;limit&gt; element
   in &lt;findService&gt; queries.

   Also, we introduce a new element in LoST responses, namely
   &lt;serviceLocation&gt;.  This new element is used by the server to
   indicate to the client the physical location of points of interest.
   In doing so, the client can compute the distance and other metrics
   between its current location and the points of interest.

   The new elements &lt;region&gt;, &lt;limit&gt;, and &lt;serviceLocation&gt; are defined
   in the "lost-ext" namespace.  This new namespace is defined in
   <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20New%20Use%20of%20Shapes%20in%20Queries"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  New Use of Shapes in Queries</span>

   In [<a href="./rfc5491" title='"GEOPRIV Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) Usage Clarification, Considerations, and Recommendations"'>RFC5491</a>], different shapes are defined in order to represent a
   point and an area of uncertainty within which the user might be
   situated.  While this remains true for "served by" queries, for
   "within distance X" queries, such shapes can be interpreted as the
   area within which we want to find a service.  In particular, we want
   to search for points of service within that area because our location
   is within that area with a certain probability.  We can think of the
   area of uncertainty in a shape as the probability that a user might
   be within that area, so we want to look for services within that
   area.  Thus, the "within distance X" query manually sets the
   uncertainty in user location to an uncertainty shape with
   parameter X.

   For example, Figure 1 shows a "within distance X" &lt;findService&gt;
   geodetic query using the circular shape.  With the query shown in
   Figure 1, we are asking the LoST server to send us a list of service
   URIs for pizza places within 200 meters from our approximate position
   specified in &lt;gml:pos&gt;.

   Figure 1: A "within distance X" &lt;findService&gt; geodetic query using
   the circular shape (a hypothetical service URN of
   "urn:service:food.pizza" is used)

   Aside from the circular shape, other shapes are also useful.  In
   particular, there are situations in which it is useful to query for
   services in a certain direction of movement rather than in an exact
   physical location.  For example, if a user is driving north from New
   York City to Boston, it would be useful for this user to be able to
   query for services north of where he currently is, that is, not at
   his current physical location nor at his final destination.

   In order to implement such direction-of-travel searches, this
   document supports the use of shapes such as an ellipse.  The ellipse
   has a major and a minor dimension, thus allowing for defining a
   "privileged" direction by having the major dimension in the direction
   of movement.  In the present context, the circular shape allows a
   device to search for services in any direction surrounding its
   physical location, while shapes such as the ellipse allow the device
   to search for services in a more specific direction.  Figure 2 shows
   a "within distance X" &lt;findService&gt; geodetic query using the
   elliptical shape.  The ellipse shape is defined in <a href="./rfc5491#section-5.2.4">Section 5.2.4 of
   [RFC5491]</a>.

   As mentioned in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, we can divide location-based services into
   two main categories based on:

   o  how far they are from the user;

   o  whether or not their service area includes the user's current
      location.

   A "within distance X" query addresses services included in the first
   category, while a "served by" query addresses services included in
   the second category.

   When querying LoST regarding a specific service, we need to specify
   if such service belongs to either the first or the second category.
   This is necessary since depending on the category to which the

   service belongs, the LoST server has to follow a different metric in
   selecting the results to include in the response.

   For example, Figure 3 shows three points of interest with their
   service areas.  The user location (i.e., the LoST client location) is
   represented by a circular shape (e.g., GPS).  If POI 1, POI 2, and
   POI 3 belong to the first category of service ("within distance X"
   query), their service area is irrelevant; what matters is how far
   they are from the user.  For such services, the shape representing
   the user location represents the distance within which the user wants
   to search for services (see <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>).  In the example shown in
   Figure 3, the LoST server returns only POI 3, as POI 3 is the only
   point of interest falling within the user location represented by the
   circle, i.e., the area within which the user wants to search for
   services.  On the other hand, if the three points of service belong
   to the second category ("served by" query), then what matters is
   their service area.  In this second scenario, since the circle
   representing the user location overlaps with all three service areas,
   all three POIs can serve the location of the user, and the LoST
   server has to return all three POIs, that is, POI 1, POI 2, and
   POI 3.

   Figure 3: LoST client location (circle) overlapping three service
   areas of three different points of interest (POI 1, POI 2, POI 3)

   In order for the client to specify which of the two categories the
   service belongs to, we introduce the &lt;region&gt; element.  This new
   element is of type boolean.  When its value is false, the LoST server
   MUST perform a search based on the distance between the user and the
   points of service ("within distance X" query).  When its value is
   either true or the &lt;region&gt; element is missing (see <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>), the

   requested service belongs to the second category, and a search based
   on service areas MUST be performed by the LoST server ("served by"
   query).  When present, the &lt;region&gt; element MUST be conveyed inside
   the &lt;findService&gt; element defined in [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>].

   For a search based on service regions, the LoST server MUST return
   only those services whose service area includes the user's current
   location.  Service region boundaries MAY be returned in a LoST
   &lt;findServiceResponse&gt; as described in [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>].

Difference between "within distance X" and "served by" Queries</span>

   Figures 1 and 4 show examples of a "within distance X" query and a
   "served by" query, respectively.  Although very similar, these two
   types of queries have three important differences:

   o  A "served by" query can support all the shapes a "within distance
      X" query can support plus the point shape.  The point shape does
      not make sense for a "within distance X" query and SHOULD NOT be
      used for this query as it would be equivalent to a within-zero-
      meters search.

   o  In a "within distance X" query, we manually set the uncertainty
      level in user location to X, and we search for services within the
      area represented by such uncertain location.  In all other types

      of queries, including a "served by" query, the level of
      uncertainty in user location cannot be changed by the user, and a
      search based on service areas is performed.

   o  In a "within distance X" query, the value of the &lt;region&gt; element
      MUST be set to false.  A "served by" query SHALL have the value of
      the &lt;region&gt; element set to true.  If the &lt;region&gt; element is not
      present, its value MUST be assumed to be equal to true, and the
      query will be a "served by" query.  This behavior is consistent
      with [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>].

   Limiting the number of results is helpful, particularly for mobile
   devices with limited bandwidth.  For "N nearest" queries, the client
   needs to be able to tell the server to return no more than N service
   URIs.  In order to specify such a limit, we introduce a new element,
   namely &lt;limit&gt;.  This new element is OPTIONAL, but when present, it
   MUST be conveyed inside the &lt;findService&gt; element defined in
   [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>].

   Figures 5, 6, and 7 show a &lt;findService&gt; geodetic query where the
   client asks the server to return no more than 20 service URIs.  In
   particular, Figure 5 shows an "N nearest" query; Figure 6 shows a
   query that is a combination of "N nearest" and "within distance X";
   and Figure 7 shows a query that is a combination of "N nearest" and
   "served by".  When receiving such queries, the LoST server will
   return a list of no more than 20 points of interest.

   If the available points of interest are more than N, the server has
   to identify, among those, the N points of interest closest to the
   client's physical location and MUST return those in the response.

   When the &lt;limit&gt; element is not present in a &lt;findService&gt; query,
   then all available points of interest for the requested type of
   service SHOULD be returned by the LoST server.  This behavior is
   consistent with [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>].

   It is important for the LoST client to know the location of a point
   of interest so that distance, route, and other metrics can be
   computed.  We introduce a new element, namely &lt;serviceLocation&gt;.  The
   &lt;serviceLocation&gt; element contains the location of a point of
   service.  When it is used, it MUST be contained in a &lt;mapping&gt;
   element.  In responses such as &lt;findServiceResponse&gt; [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>], a
   list of service URIs, each with its own &lt;serviceLocation&gt; element,
   SHOULD be returned.  The order of service URIs in the list is not
   significant.

   The &lt;serviceLocation&gt; element has a single attribute, "profile", that
   specifies the profile used.  Both civic and geodetic profiles can be
   used.  The geodetic profiles SHOULD be used in order to compute
   distance, route, and other metrics as, at some point, computing such
   metrics would require geocoding of the civic address in geodetic
   coordinates.  Because of this, the position specified in
   &lt;serviceLocation&gt; with a geodetic profile SHOULD be represented by
   the &lt;Point&gt; element.  The &lt;Point&gt; element is described in Section

   12.2 of [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>] and in <a href="./rfc5491#section-5.2.1">Section 5.2.1 of [RFC5491]</a>.  Figure 8 shows
   a &lt;findServiceResponse&gt; answer containing two location-to-service-URI
   mappings.

   [NOTE: The &lt;locationUsed&gt; element cannot be extended for this
   purpose, as it is defined outside of the &lt;mapping&gt; element.  In
   particular, in a response, the &lt;locationUsed&gt; element is always one,
   while the number of service URIs is typically more than one.]

   There are situations, however, in which it is helpful to include a
   civic address together with the geodetic coordinates of a point of
   service.  Usually, databases already contain the civic address of
   points of interest, and for devices with limited capabilities, it is
   not always possible to perform decoding of geocoordinates in order to
   determine the civic address.  Because of this, including the civic
   address in a response can be useful.  In order to do this, we use a
   civic profile for the &lt;serviceLocation&gt; element and specify the POI
   civic address in a &lt;civicAddress&gt; element contained in the
   &lt;serviceLocation&gt; element.  The basic civic location profile is
   defined in <a href="./rfc5222#section-12.3">Section 12.3 of [RFC5222]</a>.

   Per [<a href="./rfc5139" title='"Revised Civic Location Format for Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO)"'>RFC5139</a>], it is RECOMMENDED to use multiple &lt;serviceLocation&gt;
   elements when multiple forms of service location are available, and
   it is RECOMMENDED to provide a geodetic form whenever possible.  When
   multiple &lt;serviceLocation&gt; elements are present for one POI, all of
   them MUST be contained in the same &lt;mapping&gt; element, that is, the
   &lt;mapping&gt; element for that POI.  Figure 8 shows a
   &lt;findServiceResponse&gt; answer with both geodetic and civic locations.

   The LoST extensions defined in this document SHOULD NOT be used when
   routing emergency sessions, as there may be LoST servers that do not
   support these extensions.

   Figure 9 shows a &lt;findService&gt; query for emergency services as
   defined in [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>].  In such a query, both the &lt;region&gt; element and
   the &lt;limit&gt; element are missing.  According to the LoST extensions
   defined in this document, when the &lt;region&gt; element is missing, its
   value defaults to true, and the query is a "served by" query (see
   <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>).  When the &lt;limit&gt; element is missing, no limit is
   specified, that is, the LoST server can return any number of results
   (see <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>).  This behavior is consistent with [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>] so
   that PSAPs are selected according to their service area, and when a
   user's location overlaps multiple service areas, the LoST server MAY
   return multiple PSAPs.

   The LoST extensions defined in this document are consistent with the
   behavior defined in [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>], and, as such, they do not modify LoST
   behavior for emergency services.

   Unlike emergency services, where information such as service
   boundaries of PSAPs and locations of fire stations does not change
   very often, if at all, non-emergency services have information that

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The overall LoST architecture and framework are defined in [<a href="./rfc5582" title='"Location-to-URL Mapping Architecture and Framework"'>RFC5582</a>].
   All LoST queries for both emergency and non-emergency services, if
   not cached, are sent from the LoST client to a first-hop LoST server.
   In [<a href="./rfc5582" title='"Location-to-URL Mapping Architecture and Framework"'>RFC5582</a>] terminology, a LoST client is called Seeker, and the
   first-hop LoST server is called Resolver (for more rigorous
   definitions, please refer to [<a href="./rfc5582" title='"Location-to-URL Mapping Architecture and Framework"'>RFC5582</a>]).  The Resolver will contact
   other LoST servers, and eventually an authoritative LoST server will
   be found.  A response will then be sent back to the Seeker.

   When considering both emergency and non-emergency services, there is
   the possibility of the Resolver getting overloaded by non-emergency-
   service queries, thus being unable to process emergency-service
   queries.  Such a situation can be addressed in several ways.  For
   example, the service provider could dimension the LoST server to
   accommodate anticipated combined traffic loads and then give priority
   to emergency service requests during overload situations, possibly
   with the help of HTTP load balancers.

   The security considerations in [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>] apply.  In particular, in
   order to maintain integrity and confidentiality of requests and
   responses, Transport Layer Security (TLS) MUST be implemented and
   SHOULD be used as described in Sections <a href="#section-1">1</a>, <a href="#section-14">14</a>, and <a href="#section-18">18</a> of [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>].
