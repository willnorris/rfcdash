   described in the NAOL and NAOP Telnet Options specifications.
      IAC DO NAOVTD
         The data sender requests or agrees to negotiate about output
         vertical tab character disposition with the data receiver.
         In the case where agreement has been reached and in the
         absence of further subnegotiations, the data receiver is
         assumed to be handling output vertical tab character considerations.
      IAC DON'T NAOVTD
         The data sender refuses to negotiate about output vertical tab
         character disposition with the data receiver, or demands a
         return to the unnegotiated default mode.
      IAC WILL NAOVTD
         The data receiver requests or agrees to negotiate about output
         vertical tab character disposition with the sender.  In the
         case where agreement has been reached and in the absence of further
         subnegotiations, the data receiver alone is assumed to be
         handling output vertical tab character considerations.
      IAC WON'T NAOVTD
         The data receiver refuses to negotiate about output vertical
         tab character disposition, or demands a return to the unnegotiated
         default mode.
      IAC SB NAOVTD DS &lt;8-bit value&gt; IAC SE
         The data sender specifies, with the 8-bit value, which party
         should handle output vertical tab characters and what their
         disposition should be.  The code for DS is 1.
      IAC SB NAOVTD DR &lt;8-bit value&gt; IAC SE
         The data receiver specifies, with the 8-bit value, which party
         should handle output vertical tab characters and what their
         disposition should be.  The code for DR is 0.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Default"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Default</span>
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/DON%27T%20NAOVTD%2FWON%27T%20NAOVTD"></a>   DON'T NAOVTD/WON'T NAOVTD</span>
      In the default absence of negotiations concerning which party,
      data sender or data receiver, is handling output vertical tab character
      considerations, neither party is required to handle vertical tab
      characters and neither party is prohibited from handling them; but
      it is appropriate if at least the data receiver handles vertical tab
      character considerations, albeit primitively.

   the DS and DR SB commands as follows:

      8 bit value   Meaning

      0             Command sender suggests that he alone will handle
                    vertical tab characters, for the connection.
      1 to 250      Command sender suggests that the other party alone
                    should handle tab characters, but suggests that a
                    delay of the indicated value be used. The value is
                    the number of character-times to wait or number of
                    NULs to insert in the data stream before sending the
                    next data character.
      251           Command sender suggests that the other party alone
                    handle vertical tabs, but suggests that each
                    occurrence of the character be replaced by
                    carriage-return/linefeed.
      252           Command sender suggests that the other party alone
                    handle vertical tabs, but suggests that they be discarded.
      253           Command sender suggests that the other party alone
                    should handle tab characters, but suggests that
                    tabbing be simulated.
      254           Command sender suggests that the other party alone
                    should handle the output disposition but suggests
                    waiting for a character to be transmitted (on the
                    other simplex connection) before sending more data.
                    Note that, due to the assynchrony of the two
                    simplex connections, phase problems can occur with
                    this option.
      255           Command sender suggests that the other party alone
                    should handle the output disposition and suggests
                    nothing about how it should be done.

   The guiding rules are that:

      1. if neither data receiver nor data sender wants to handle the
      output vertical tab characters, the data receiver must do it, and
      2. if both data receiver and data sender want to handle the output
      vertical tab characters, the data sender gets to do it.

   The reasoning for the former rule is that if neither want to do it, then
   the default in the NAOVTD option dominates.  If both want to do it, the
   sender, who is presumed to have special knowledge about the data, should
   be allowed to do it, taking into account any suggestions the receiver may
   make.  Simulation is defined as the replacement of the character by
   enough line-feeds (only) to advance the paper (or line-pointer) to the
   next vertical tab stop.
   Note that delays, controlled by the data sender, must consist of NUL
   characters, inserted immediately after the line-feed character.  This is
   necessary due to the assynchrony of network transmissions.  As with all
   option negotiations, neither party should suggest a state already in
   effect except to refuse to negotiate; changes should be acknowledged; and
   once refused, an option should not be resuggested until "something
   changes" (e.g., another process starts).  At any time, either party can
   disable further negotiation by giving the appropriate WON'T NAOVTD or
   DON'T NAOVTD command.
