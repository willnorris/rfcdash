Introduction

   Discussion of the standardization process and the RFC document series
   is presented first, then the explanation of the terms is presented,
   the lists of protocols in each stage of standardization follows and
   finally come pointers to references and contacts for further
   information.

   This memo is issued quarterly, please be sure the copy you are
   reading is dated within the last three months.  Current copies may be
   obtained from the Network Information Center or from the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (see the contact information at the end of
   this memo).  Do not use this edition after 31-Aug-90.

   See <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> for a description of recent changes.

   The Internet Activities Board maintains this list of documents that
   define standards for the Internet protocol suite (see <a href="./rfc1120">RFC-1120</a> for an
   explanation of the role and organization of the IAB and its
   subsidiary groups, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the
   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)).  The IAB provides these
   standards with the goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the
   Internet protocols; this co-ordination has become quite important as
   the Internet protocols are increasingly in general commercial use.

   The majority of Internet protocol development and standardization



<span class="grey">Internet Activities Board                                       [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1140">RFC 1140</a>                     IAB Standards                      May 1990</span>


   activity takes place in the working groups of the Internet
   Engineering Task Force.

   Protocols which are to become standards in the Internet go through a
   series of states (proposed standard, draft standard, and standard)
   involving increasing amounts of scrutiny and experimental testing.
   At each step, the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) of the
   IETF must make a recommendation for advancement of the protocol and
   the IAB must ratify it.  If a recommendation is not ratified, the
   protocol is remanded to the IETF for further work.

   To allow time for the Internet community to consider and react to
   standardization proposals, the IAB imposes a minimum delay of 4
   months before a proposed standard can be advanced to a draft standard
   and 6 months before a draft standard can be promoted to standard.

   It is general IAB practice that no proposed standard can be promoted
   to draft standard without at least two independent implementations
   (and the recommendation of the IESG).  Promotion from draft standard
   to standard generally requires operational experience and
   demonstrated interoperability of two or more implementations (and the
   recommendation of the IESG).

   In cases where there is uncertainty as to the proper decision
   concerning a protocol the IAB may convene a special review committee
   consisting of experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with the
   purpose of recommending an explicit action to the IAB.

   Advancement of a protocol to proposed standard is an important step
   since it marks a protocol as a candidate for eventual standardization
   (it puts the protocol "on the standards track").  Advancement to
   draft standard is a major step which warns the community that, unless
   major objections are raised or flaws are discovered, the protocol is
   likely to be advanced to standard in six months.

   Some protocols have been superseded by better ones or are otherwise
   unused.  Such protocols are still documented in this memorandum with
   the designation "historic".

   Because the IAB believes it is useful to document the results of
   early protocol research and development work, some of the RFCs
   document protocols which are still in an experimental condition.  The
   protocols are designated "experimental" in this memorandum.  They
   appear in this report as a convenience to the community and not as
   evidence of their standardization.

   In addition to the working groups of the IETF, protocol development
   and experimentation may take place as a result of the work of the



<span class="grey">Internet Activities Board                                       [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1140">RFC 1140</a>                     IAB Standards                      May 1990</span>


   research groups of the Internet Research Task Force, or the work of
   other individuals interested in Internet protocol development.  The
   IAB encourages the documentation of such experimental work in the RFC
   series, but none of this work is considered to be on the track for
   standardization until the IESG has made a recommendation to advance
   the protocol to the proposed standard state, and the IAB has approved
   this step.

   A few protocols have achieved widespread implementation without the
   approval of the IESG and the IAB.  For example, some vendor protocols
   have become very important to the Internet community even though they
   have not been recommended by the IESG or ratified by the IAB.
   However, the IAB strongly recommends that the IAB standards process
   be used in the evolution of the protocol suite to maximize
   interoperability (and to prevent incompatible protocol requirements
   from arising).  The IAB reserves the use of the terms "standard",
   "draft standard", and "proposed standard" in any RFC or other
   publication of Internet protocols to only those protocols which the
   IAB has approved.

   In addition to a state (like "proposed standard") a protocol is also
   assigned a status, or requirement level.  A protocol can be required,
   meaning that all systems in the Internet must implement it.  For
   example, the Internet Protocol (IP) is required.  A protocol may be
   recommended, meaning that systems should implement this protocol.  A
   protocol may be elective, meaning that systems may implement this
   protocol; that is, if (and only if) the functionality of this
   protocol is needed or useful for a system it must use this protocol
   to provide the functionality.  A protocol may be termed limited use
   or even not recommended if it is not intended to be generally
   implemented; for example, experimental or historic protocols.

   When a protocol is on the standards track, that is in the proposed
   standard, draft standard, or standard state (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), the
   status is the current status.  However, the IAB will also endeavor to
   indicate the eventual status this protocol will have when the
   standardization is completed.

   The IAB realizes that a one word label is not sufficient to
   characterize the implementation requirements for a protocol in all
   situations.  In many cases, an additional paragraph about the status
   will be provided, and in some cases reference will be made to
   separate requirements documents.

   Few protocols are required to be implemented in all systems.  This is
   because there is such a variety of possible systems; for example,
   gateways, terminal servers, workstations, multi-user hosts.  It is
   not necessary for a gateway to implement TCP or the protocols that



<span class="grey">Internet Activities Board                                       [Page 4]</span></pre>

   use TCP (though it may be useful).  It is expected that general
   purpose hosts will implement at least IP (including ICMP and IGMP),
   TCP and UDP, Telnet, FTP, NTP, SMTP, Mail, and the Domain Name System
   (DNS).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20Request%20for%20Comments%20Documents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The Request for Comments Documents</span>

   The documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs) are the working
   notes of the "Network Working Group", that is the Internet research
   and development community.  A document in this series may be on
   essentially any topic related to computer communication, and may be
   anything from a meeting report to the specification of a standard.

   Notice:

      All standards are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify
      standards.

   Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC.  Submissions
   must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor (see the contact
   information at the end of this memo).

   While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive technical
   review from the task forces, individual technical experts, or the RFC
   Editor, as appropriate.

   The RFC series comprises a wide range of documents such as
   informational documents of general interests to specifications of
   standard Internet protocols.  In cases where submission is intended
   to document a proposed standard, draft standard, or standard
   protocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document only with the
   approval of both the IESG and the IAB.  For documents describing
   experimental work, the RFC Editor will typically request review
   comments from the relevant IETF working group or IRTF research group
   and provide those comments to the author prior to committing to
   publication.  See <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> for more detail.

   Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC is
   never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is never a
   question of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.
   However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be
   improved and re-documented many times in several different RFCs.  It
   is important to verify that you have the most recent RFC on a
   particular protocol.  This "IAB Official Protocol Standards" memo is
   the reference for determining the correct RFC to refer to for the
   current specification of each protocol.

   The RFCs are available from the Network Information Center at SRI

   There are four other reference documents of interest in checking the
   current status of protocol specifications and standardization.  These
   are the Assigned Numbers, the Annotated Internet Protocols, the
   Gateway Requirements, and the Host Requirements.  Note that these
   documents are revised and updated at different times; in case of
   differences between these documents, the most recent must prevail.

   Also, one should be aware of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,
   Telnet, FTP, and SMTP.  These are described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Assigned%20Numbers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Assigned Numbers</span>

   This document lists the assigned values of the parameters used in the
   various protocols.  For example, IP protocol codes, TCP port numbers,
   Telnet Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and Terminal Type names.
   Assigned Numbers was most recently issued as <a href="./rfc1060">RFC-1060</a>.

   Another document, Internet Numbers, lists the assigned IP network
   numbers, and the autonomous system numbers.  Internet Numbers was
   most recently issued as <a href="./rfc1117">RFC-1117</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Annotated%20Internet%20Protocols"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Annotated Internet Protocols</span>

   This document lists the protocols and describes any known problems
   and ongoing experiments.  This document was most recently issued as
   <a href="./rfc1011">RFC-1011</a> under the title "Official Internet Protocols".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Gateway%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Gateway Requirements</span>

   This document reviews the specifications that apply to gateways and
   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.  Gateway
   Requirements is <a href="./rfc1009">RFC-1009</a>.  A working group of the IETF is actively
   preparing a revision.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Host%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Host Requirements</span>

   This pair of documents reviews the specifications that apply to hosts
   and supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.  Host
   Requirements was recently issued as <a href="./rfc1122">RFC-1122</a> and <a href="./rfc1123">RFC-1123</a>.

   The Internet community specifications for IP (<a href="./rfc791">RFC-791</a>) and TCP (<a href="./rfc793">RFC-</a>
   <a href="./rfc793">793</a>) and the DoD MIL-STD specifications are intended to describe
   exactly the same protocols.  Any difference in the protocols
   specified by these sets of documents should be reported to DCA and to
   the IAB.  The RFCs and the MIL-STDs for IP and TCP differ in style
   and level of detail.  It is strongly advised that the two sets of
   documents be used together.

   The IAB and the DoD MIL-STD specifications for the FTP, SMTP, and
   Telnet protocols are essentially the same documents (RFCs 765, 821,
   854).  The MIL-STD versions have been edited slightly.  Note that the
   current Internet specification for FTP is <a href="./rfc959">RFC-959</a>.

          Internet Protocol (IP)                      MIL-STD-1777
          Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)         MIL-STD-1778
          File Transfer Protocol (FTP)                MIL-STD-1780
          Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)        MIL-STD-1781
          Telnet Protocol and Options (TELNET)        MIL-STD-1782

   These documents are available from the Naval Publications and Forms
   Center.  Requests can be initiated by telephone, telegraph, or mail;
   however, it is preferred that private industry use form DD1425, if
   possible.  These five documents are included in the 1985 DDN Protocol
   Handbook (available from the Network Information Center, see <a href="#section-7.4">Section</a>

   There are two independent categorization of protocols.  The first is
   the STATE of standardization which is one of "standard", "draft
   standard", "proposed standard", "experimental", or "historic".  The
   second is the STATUS of this protocol which is one of "required",
   "recommended", "elective", "limited use", or "not recommended".

   The IAB notes that the status or requirement level is difficult to
   portray in a one word label.  These status labels should be
   considered only as an indication, and a further description should be
   consulted.

   When a protocol is advanced to proposed standard or draft standard,

   it is labeled with a current status and when possible, the IAB also
   notes the status that that protocol is expected to have when it
   reaches the standard state.

   At any given time a protocol is a cell of the following matrix.
   Protocols are likely to be in cells in about the following
   proportions (indicated by the relative number of Xs).  A new protocol
   is most likely to start in the (proposed standard, elective) cell, or
   the (experimental, not recommended) cell.

   What is a "system"?

      Some protocols are particular to hosts and some to gateways; a few
      protocols are used in both.  The definitions of the terms below
      will refer to a "system" which is either a host or a gateway (or
      both).  It should be clear from the context of the particular
      protocol which types of systems are intended.

   There are two independent categorizations of protocols.  The first is
   the STATE of standardization, which is one of "standard", "draft
   standard", "proposed standard", "experimental", or "historic".

   4.1.1.  Standard Protocol

      The IAB has established this as an official standard protocol for
      the Internet.  These are separated into two groups: (1) IP
      protocol and above, protocols that apply to the whole Internet;
      and (2) network-specific protocols, generally specifications of
      how to do IP on particular types of networks.

   4.1.2.  Draft Standard Protocol

      The IAB is actively considering this protocol as a possible
      Standard Protocol.  Substantial and widespread testing and comment
      are desired.  Comments and test results should be submitted to the
      IAB.  There is a possibility that changes will be made in a Draft
      Standard Protocol before it becomes a Standard Protocol.

   4.1.3.  Proposed Standard Protocol

      These are protocol proposals that may be considered by the IAB for
      standardization in the future.  Implementation and testing by
      several groups is desirable.  Revision of the protocol
      specification is likely.

   4.1.4.  Experimental Protocol

      A system should not implement an experimental protocol unless it
      is participating in the experiment and has coordinated its use of
      the protocol with the developer of the protocol.

      Typically, experimental protocols are those that are developed as
      part of an ongoing research project not related to an operational
      service offering.  While they may be proposed as a service
      protocol at a later stage, and thus become proposed standard,
      draft standard, and then standard protocols, the designation of a
      protocol as experimental may sometimes be meant to suggest that
      the protocol, although perhaps mature, is not intended for
      operational use.

   4.1.5.  Historic Protocol

      These are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards in
      the Internet either because they have been superseded by later
      developments or due to lack of interest.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Definitions%20of%20Protocol%20Status"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Definitions of Protocol Status</span>

      There are two independent categorizations of protocols.  The
      second is the STATUS of this protocol which is one of "required",
      "recommended", "elective", "limited use", or "not recommended".

   4.2.1.  Required Protocol

      A system must implement the required protocols.

   4.2.2.  Recommended Protocol

      A system should implement the recommended protocols.

   4.2.3.  Elective Protocol

      A system may or may not implement an elective protocol. The
      general notion is that if you are going to do something like this,
      you must do exactly this.  There may be several elective protocols
      in a general area, for example, there are several electronic mail
      protocols, and several routing protocols.

   4.2.4.  Limited Use Protocol

      These protocols are for use in limited circumstances.  This may be
      because of their experimental state, specialized nature, limited
      functionality, or historic state.

   4.2.5.  Not Recommended Protocol

      These protocols are not recommended for general use.  This may be
      because of their limited functionality, specialized nature, or
      experimental or historic state.

          not.

   Of course, in all cases the RFC Editor can request or make minor
   changes for style, format, and presentation purposes.

   The IESG has designated Greg Vaudreuil as its agent for forwarding
   documents with IESG approval and for registering protest in response
   to notifications (5) to the RFC Editor.  Documents from Area
   Directors or Working Group Chairs may be considered in the same way
   as documents from "other".

   There is a part of the STATUS and STATE categorization that is called
   the standards track.  Actually, only the changes of state are
   significant to the progression along the standards track, though the
   status assignments may be changed as well.

   The states illustrated by single line boxes are temporary states,
   those illustrated by double line boxes are long term states.  A
   protocol will normally be expected to remain in a temporary state for
   several months (minimum four months for proposed standard, minimum
   six months for draft standard).  A protocol may be in a long term
   state for many years.

   A protocol may enter the standards track only on the recommendation
   of the IESG and by action of the IAB; and may move from one state to
   another along the track only on the recommendation of the IESG and by
   action of the IAB.  That is, it takes both the IESG and the IAB to
   either start a protocol on the track or to move it along.

   Generally, as the protocol enters the standards track a decision is
   made as to the eventual STATUS (elective, recommended, or required)
   the protocol will have, although a somewhat less stringent current
   status may be assigned, and it then is placed in the the proposed
   standard STATE with that status.  So the initial placement of a
   protocol is into state 1.  At any time the STATUS decision may be
   revisited.

   The transition from proposed standard (1) to draft standard (2) can
   only be by action of the IAB on the recommendation of the IESG and
   only after the protocol has been proposed standard (1) for at least
   four months.

   The transition from draft standard (2) to standard (3) can only be by
   action of the IAB on the recommendation of the IESG and only after
   the protocol has been draft standard (2) for at least six months.

   Occasionally, the decision may be that the protocol is not ready for
   standardization and will be assigned to the experimental state (4).
   This is off the standards track, and the protocol may be resubmitted
   to enter the standards track after further work.  There are other
   paths into the experimental and historic states that do not involve
   IAB action.

   Sometimes one protocol is replaced by another and thus becomes
   historic, it may happen that a protocol on the standards track is in
   a sense overtaken by another protocol (or other events) and becomes
   historic (state 5).

Notes:

   IGMP -- The Internet Activities Board intends to move towards general
   adoption of IP multicasting, as a more efficient solution than
   broadcasting for many applications.  The host interface has been
   standardized in <a href="./rfc1112">RFC-1112</a>; however, multicast-routing gateways are in
   the experimental stage and are not widely available.  An Internet
   host should support all of <a href="./rfc1112">RFC-1112</a>, except for the IGMP protocol
   itself which is optional; see <a href="./rfc1122">RFC-1122</a> for more details.  Even
   without IGMP, implementation of <a href="./rfc1112">RFC-1112</a> will provide an important
   advance: IP-layer access to local network multicast addressing.  It

   is expected that IGMP will become recommended for all hosts and
   gateways at some future date.

   SMI, MIB, SNMP -- The Internet Activities Board recommends that all
   IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.  This implies
   implementation of the Internet MIB (<a href="./rfc1156">RFC-1156</a>) and at least one of the
   two recommended management protocols SNMP (<a href="./rfc1157">RFC-1157</a>) or CMOT (<a href="./rfc1095">RFC-</a>

   Internet standard and CMOT is a draft standard.  See also the Host
   and Gateway Requirements RFCs for more specific information on the
   applicability of this standard.

Notes:

   It is expected that a system will support one or more physical
   networks and for each physical network supported the appropriate
   protocols from the above list must be supported.  That is, it is
   elective to support any particular type of physical network, and for
   the physical networks actually supported it is required that they be
   supported exactly according to the protocols in the above list.  See
   also the Host and Gateway Requirements RFCs for more specific
   information on network-specific ("link layer") protocols.

Notes:

   CMOT -- The Internet Activities Board recommends that all IP and TCP
   implementations be network manageable.  This implies implementation
   of the Internet MIB (<a href="./rfc1156">RFC-1156</a>) and at least one of the two
   recommended management protocols SNMP (<a href="./rfc1157">RFC-1157</a>) or CMOT (<a href="./rfc1095">RFC-1095</a>).
   It should be noted that, at this time, SNMP is a full Internet
   standard and CMOT is a draft standard.  See also the Host and Router
   Requirements RFCs for more specific information on the applicability
   of this standard.

   RIP -- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implemented
   and used in the Internet.  However, both implementors and users
   should be aware that RIP has some serious technical limitations as a
   routing protocol.  The IETF is currently developing several
   candidates for a new standard "open" routing protocol with better
   properties than RIP.  The IAB urges the Internet community to track
   these developments, and to implement the new protocol when it is
   standardized; improved Internet service will result for many users.

   TP-TCP -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented and used,
   there will be an increasing need to support interoperation with the
   TCP/IP protocols.  The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulating
   strategies for interoperation.  <a href="./rfc1006">RFC-1006</a> provides one interoperation
   mode, in which TCP/IP is used to emulate TP0 in order to support OSI
   applications.  Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-oriented
   applications in this mode should use the procedure described in <a href="./rfc1006">RFC-</a>
   <a href="./rfc1006">1006</a>.  In the future, the IAB expects that a major portion of the
   Internet will support both TCP/IP and OSI (inter-)network protocols
   in parallel, and it will then be possible to run OSI applications
   across the Internet using full OSI protocol "stacks".

Notes:

   This section is being reviewed by the IESG, which will recommend that
   some of these protocols be moved to either the draft standard, or the
   experimental or historic categories.

   MIB-II -- This memo defines a mandatory extension to the base MIB
   (<a href="./rfc1156">RFC-1156</a>) and is a Proposed Standard for the Internet community.
   The extensions described here are currently Elective, but when they
   become a standard, they will have the same status as <a href="./rfc1156">RFC-1156</a>, that
   is, Recommended.  The Internet Activities Board recommends that all
   IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.  This implies
   implementation of the Internet MIB (<a href="./rfc1156">RFC-1156</a> and the extensions in
   RFC-xxxx) and at least one of the two recommended management
   protocols SNMP (<a href="./rfc1157">RFC-1157</a>) or CMOT (<a href="./rfc1095">RFC-1095</a>).

   PPP -- Point to Point Protocol is a method of sending IP over serial
   lines, which are a type of physical network.  It is expected that a
   system will support one or more physical networks and for each
   physical network supported the appropriate protocols from the
   network-specific standard protocols (<a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>) must be supported.
   That is, it is elective to support any particular type of physical
   network, and for the physical networks actually supported it is
   required that they be supported exactly according to the protocols
   listed.  It is anticipated that PPP will be advanced to the network-
   specific standard protocol state in the future.

         NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL

   The Network Information Center (NIC) provides many information
   services for the Internet community.  Among them is maintaining the
   Requests for Comments (RFC) library.

   RFCs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname
   RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT where "nnnn" refers to the number of the RFC.  A list
   of all RFCs may be obtained by copying the file RFC:RFC-INDEX.TXT.
   Log in with FTP username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.

   The NIC also provides an automatic mail service for those sites which
   cannot use FTP.  Address the request to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and in
   the subject field of the message indicate the file name, as in
