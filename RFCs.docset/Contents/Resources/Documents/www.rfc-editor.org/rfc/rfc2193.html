   When dealing with large amounts of users, messages and geographically
   dispersed IMAP4 [<a href="./rfc2060">RFC-2060</a>] servers, it is often desirable to
   distribute messages amongst different servers within an organization.
   For example an administrator may choose to store user's personal
   mailboxes on a local IMAP4 server, while storing shared mailboxes
   remotely on another server.  This type of configuration is common
   when it is uneconomical to store all data centrally due to limited
   bandwidth or disk resources.

   Mailbox referrals allow clients to seamlessly access mailboxes that
   are distributed across several IMAP4 servers.

   A referral mechanism can provide efficiencies over the alternative
   "proxy method", in which the local IMAP4 server contacts the remote
   server on behalf of the client, and then transfers the data from the
   remote server to itself, and then on to the client.  The referral
   mechanism's direct client connection to the remote server is often a
   more efficient use of bandwidth, and does not require the local
   server to impersonate the client when authenticating to the remote
   server.

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   A home server, is an IMAP4 server that contains the user's inbox.

   A remote mailbox is a mailbox that is not hosted on the user's home
   server.

   A remote server is a server that contains remote mailboxes.

   A shared mailbox, is a mailbox that multiple users have access to.

   An IMAP mailbox referral is when the server directs the client to
   another IMAP mailbox.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119">RFC-2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Introduction%20and%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Introduction and Overview</span>

   IMAP4 servers that support this extension MUST list the keyword
   MAILBOX-REFERRALS in their CAPABILITY response.  No client action is
   needed to invoke the MAILBOX-REFERRALS capability in a server.

   A MAILBOX-REFERRALS capable IMAP4 server MUST NOT return referrals
   that result in a referrals loop.

   A referral response consists of a tagged NO response and a REFERRAL
   response code.  The REFERRAL response code MUST contain as an
   argument a one or more valid URLs separated by a space as defined in
   [<a href="./rfc1738">RFC-1738</a>]. If a server replies with multiple URLs for a particular
   object, they MUST all be of the same type. In this case, the URL MUST
   be an IMAP URL as defined in [<a href="./rfc2192">RFC-2192</a>].  A client that supports the
   REFERRALS extension MUST be prepared for a URL of any type, but it
   need only be able to process IMAP URLs.

   A server MAY respond with multiple IMAP mailbox referrals if there is
   more than one replica of the mailbox.  This allows the implementation
   of a load balancing or failover scheme. How a server keeps multiple
   replicas of a mailbox in sync is not addressed by this document.

   If the server has a preferred order in which the client should
   attempt to access the URLs, the preferred URL SHOULD be listed in the
   first, with the remaining URLs presented in descending order of
   preference.  If multiple referrals are given for a mailbox, a server
   should be aware that there are synchronization issues for a client if
   the UIDVALIDITY of the referred mailboxes are different.

   An IMAP mailbox referral may be given in response to an IMAP command
   that specifies a mailbox as an argument.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2193">RFC 2193</a>                IMAP4 Mailbox Referrals           September 1997</span>


   Example:

      A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/REMOTE]Remote Mailbox

   NOTE: user;AUTH=* is specified as required by [<a href="./rfc2192">RFC-2192</a>] to avoid a
   client falling back to anonymous login.

   Remote mailboxes and their inferiors, that are accessible only via
   referrals SHOULD NOT appear in LIST and LSUB responses issued against
   the user's home server.  They MUST appear in RLIST and RLSUB
   responses issued against the user's home server. Hierarchy referrals,
   in which a client would be required to connect to the remote server
   to issue a LIST to discover the inferiors of a mailbox are not
   addressed in this document.

   For example, if shared mailboxes were only accessible via referrals
   on a remote server, a RLIST "" "#SHARED/%" command would return the
   same response if issued against the user's home server or the remote
   server.

   Note: Mailboxes that are available on the user's home server do not
   need to be available on the remote server.  In addition, there may be
   additional mailboxes available on the remote server, but they will
   not accessible to the client via referrals unless they appear in the
   LIST response to the RLIST command against the user's home server.

   A MAILBOX-REFERRALS capable client will issue the RLIST and RLSUB
   commands in lieu of LIST and LSUB.  The RLIST and RLSUB commands
   behave identically to their LIST and LSUB counterparts, except remote
   mailboxes are returned in addition to local mailboxes in the LIST and
   LSUB responses.  This avoids displaying to a non MAILBOX-REFERRALS
   enabled client inaccessible remote mailboxes.

SELECT, EXAMINE, DELETE, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, STATUS and APPEND</span>
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Referrals"></a>     Referrals</span>

   An IMAP4 server MAY respond to the SELECT, EXAMINE, DELETE,
   SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, STATUS or APPEND command with one or more
   IMAP mailbox referrals to indicate to the client that the mailbox is
   hosted on a remote server.

   When a client processes an IMAP mailbox referral, it will open a new
   connection or use an existing connection to the remote server so that
   it is able to issue the commands necessary to process the remote
   mailbox.

   An IMAP4 server MAY respond to the CREATE command with one or more
   IMAP mailbox referrals, if it wishes to direct the client to issue
   the CREATE against another server.  The server can employ any means,
   such as examining the hierarchy of the specified mailbox name, in
   determining which server the mailbox should be created on.

   Example:

      C: A001 CREATE "SHARED/FOO"
      S: A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/SHARED/FOO]
         Mailbox should be created on remote server

   Alternatively, because a home server is required to maintain a
   listing of referred remote mailboxes, a server MAY allow the creation
   of a mailbox that will ultimately reside on a remote server against
   the home server, and provide referrals on subsequent commands that
   manipulate the mailbox.

   Example:

      C: A001 CREATE "SHARED/FOO"
      S: A001 OK CREATE succeeded

      C: A002 SELECT "SHARED/FOO"
      S: A002 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/SHARED/FOO]
         Remote mailbox.  Try SERVER2

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.3.%20RENAME%20Referrals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" id="section-4.3">4.3</a>. RENAME Referrals</span>

   An IMAP4 server MAY respond to the RENAME command with one or more
   pairs of IMAP mailbox referrals.  In each pair of IMAP mailbox
   referrals, the first one is an URL to the existing mailbox name and
   the second is an URL to the requested new mailbox name.

   If within an IMAP mailbox referral pair, the existing and new mailbox
   URLs are on different servers, the remote servers are unable to
   perform the RENAME operation.   To achieve the same behavior of
   server RENAME, the client MAY issue the constituent CREATE, FETCH,
   APPEND, and DELETE commands against both servers.

   If within an IMAP mailbox referral pair, the existing and new mailbox
   URLs are on the same server it is an indication that the currently
   connected server is unable to perform the operation.  The client can
   simply re-issue the RENAME command on the remote server.

   Example:

      C: A001 RENAME FOO BAR
      S: A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER1/FOO
              IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/BAR] Unable to rename mailbox
              across servers

   Since the existing and new mailbox names are on different servers,
   the client would be required to make a connection to both servers and
   issue the constituent commands require to achieve the RENAME.

   Example:

      C: A001 RENAME FOO BAR
      S: A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/FOO
              IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/BAR] Unable to rename mailbox
              located on SERVER2

   Since both the existing and new mailbox are on the same remote
   server, the client can simply make a connection to the remote server
   and re-issue the RENAME command.

   An IMAP4 server MAY respond to the COPY command with one or more IMAP
   mailbox referrals.  This indicates that the destination mailbox is on
   a remote server.  To achieve the same behavior of a server COPY, the
   client MAY issue the constituent FETCH and APPEND commands against
   both servers.

   The IMAP4 referral mechanism makes use of IMAP URLs, and as such,
   have the same security considerations as general internet URLs [RFC-
   1738], and in particular IMAP URLs [<a href="./rfc2192">RFC-2192</a>].

   With the MAILBOX-REFERRALS capability, it is potentially easier to
   write a rogue server that injects a bogus referral response that
   directs a user to an incorrect mailbox.  Although referrals reduce
   the effort to write such a server, the referral response makes
   detection of the intrusion easier.
