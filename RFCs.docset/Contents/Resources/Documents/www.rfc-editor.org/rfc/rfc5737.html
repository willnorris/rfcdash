<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5737">RFC 5737</a>                     IPv4 Examples                  January 2010</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document describes three IPv4 address blocks that are provided
   for use in documentation.  The use of designated address ranges for
   documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and
   confusion arising from the use of addresses assigned for some other
   purpose.

   [<a id="ref-RFC1166">RFC1166</a>] reserves the first of the three address blocks,
   192.0.2.0/24.  The other two address blocks have recently been
   allocated for this purpose, primarily to ease the writing of examples
   involving addresses from multiple networks.

   Other documentation ranges have been defined in the IETF, including
   the IPv6 documentation prefix [<a href="./rfc3849" title='"IPv6 Address Prefix Reserved for Documentation"'>RFC3849</a>] and example domain names
   [<a href="./rfc2606" title='"Reserved Top Level DNS Names"'>RFC2606</a>].  Documentation also makes use of the ranges reserved in
   [<a href="./rfc1918" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Documentation%20Address%20Blocks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Documentation Address Blocks</span>

   The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2),
   and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use in
   documentation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Operational%20Implications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Operational Implications</span>

   Addresses within the TEST-NET-1, TEST-NET-2, and TEST-NET-3 blocks
   SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and are used without any
   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry [<a href="./rfc2050" title='"INTERNET REGISTRY IP ALLOCATION GUIDELINES"'>RFC2050</a>].  Network
   operators SHOULD add these address blocks to the list of non-
   routeable address spaces, and if packet filters are deployed, then
   this address block SHOULD be added to packet filters.

   These blocks are not for local use, and the filters may be used in
   both local and public contexts.

   Note that 128.66.0.0/16 has been used for some examples in the past.
   However, this block did not appear in the list of special prefixes in
   [<a href="./rfc3330" title='"Special-Use IPv4 Addresses"'>RFC3330</a>] or its successors, and the block is therefore not reserved
   for any special purpose.  The block can be used for regular address
   assignments with caution.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document has no security implications.

   IANA has recorded the allocation of the three address blocks in the
   IPv4 address registry.  No end party is to be assigned these
   addresses.
