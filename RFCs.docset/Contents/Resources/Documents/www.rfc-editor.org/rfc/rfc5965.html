            <span class="h1">An Extensible Format for Email Feedback Reports</span>

Abstract

   This document defines an extensible format and MIME type that may be
   used by mail operators to report feedback about received email to
   other parties.  This format is intended as a machine-readable
   replacement for various existing report formats currently used in
   Internet email.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   As the spam problem continues to expand and potential solutions
   evolve, mail operators are increasingly exchanging abuse reports
   among themselves and other parties.  However, different operators
   have defined their own formats, and thus the receivers of these
   reports are forced to write custom software to interpret each of
   them.  In addition, many operators use various other report formats
   to provide non-abuse-related feedback about processed email.  This
   memo uses the "multipart/report" content type defined in [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>],
   and in that context defines a standard extensible format by creating
   the "message/feedback-report" [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME</a>] type for these reports.

   While there has been previous work in this area (e.g., [<a href="#ref-STRADS-BCP" title='"Proposed Spam Reporting BCP Document"'>STRADS-BCP</a>]
   and [<a href="#ref-ASRG-ABUSE" title='"Abuse Reporting Standards Subgroup of the ASRG"'>ASRG-ABUSE</a>]), none of it has yet been successful.  It is hoped
   that this document will have a better fate.

   This format is intended primarily as an Abuse Reporting Format (ARF)
   for reporting email abuse but also includes support for direct
   feedback via end user mail clients, reports of some types of virus
   activity, and some similar issues.  This memo also contains provision
   for extensions should other specific types of reports be desirable in
   the future.

   This document only defines the format and [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME</a>] content type to be
   used for these reports.  Determination of where these reports should
   be sent, validation of their contents, and how trust among report
   generators and report recipients is established are outside the scope
   of this document.  It is assumed that best practices will evolve over
   time, and will be codified in future documents.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Purpose"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Purpose</span>

   The reports defined in this document are intended to inform mail
   operators about:

   o  email abuse originating from their networks;

   o  potential issues with the perceived quality of outbound mail, such
      as email service providers sending mail that attracts the
      attention of automated abuse detection systems.

   Please note that while the parent "multipart/report" content type
   defined in [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>] is used for all kinds of administrative messages,
   this format is intended specifically for communications among
   providers regarding email abuse and related issues, and SHOULD NOT be
   used for other reports.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5965">RFC 5965</a>               Format for Feedback Reports           August 2010</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Requirements</span>

   The following requirements are necessary for feedback reports (the
   actual specification is defined later in this document):

   o  They must be both human and machine readable;

   o  A copy of the original email message (both body and header) or the
      message header must be enclosed in order to allow the receiver to
      handle the report properly;

   o  The machine-readable section must provide ability for the report
      generators to share meta-data with receivers;

   o  The format must be extensible.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.3.%20%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" id="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Definitions</span>

   This section defines various terms used throughout this document.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.3.1.%20%20General"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3.1" id="section-1.3.1">1.3.1</a>.  General</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORDS</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.3.2.%20%20Email%20Specific"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3.2" id="section-1.3.2">1.3.2</a>.  Email Specific</span>

   [<a id="ref-EMAIL-ARCH">EMAIL-ARCH</a>] introduces several terms and concepts that are used in
   this memo, and thus readers are advised to become familiar with it as
   well.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Format%20of%20Email%20Feedback%20Reports"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Format of Email Feedback Reports</span>

   To satisfy the requirements, an email feedback report is defined as a
   [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME</a>] message with a top-level MIME content type of "multipart/
   report" (as defined in [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>]).  The following apply:

   a.  The "report-type" parameter of the "multipart/report" type is set
       to "feedback-report";

   b.  The first MIME part of the message contains a human-readable
       description of the report and MUST be included.








<span class="grey">Shafranovich, et al.         Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5965">RFC 5965</a>               Format for Feedback Reports           August 2010</span>


   c.  The second MIME part of the message is a machine-readable section
       with the content type of "message/feedback-report" (defined later
       in this memo) and MUST be included.  This section is intended to
       convey meta-data about the report in question that may not be
       readily available from the included email message itself.

   d.  The third MIME part of the message is either of type "message/
       <a href="./rfc822">rfc822</a>" (as defined in [<a href="#ref-MIME-TYPES" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>MIME-TYPES</a>]) and contains the original
       message in its entirety OR is of type "text/rfc822-headers" (as
       defined in [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>]) and contains a copy of the entire header
       block from the original message.  This part MUST be included
       (contrary to [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>]).  While some operators may choose to
       modify or redact this portion for privacy or legal reasons, it is
       RECOMMENDED that the entire original email message be included
       without any modification as such modifications can impede
       forensic work by the recipient of this report.  See <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> for
       further discussion.

   e.  Except as discussed below, each feedback report MUST be related
       to only a single email message.  Summary and aggregate formats
       are outside of the scope of this specification.

   f.  The Subject header field of the feedback report SHOULD be the
       same as the included email message about which the report is
       being generated.  If it differs, the difference MUST be limited
       to only a typical forwarding prefix used by Mail User Agents
       (MUAs) such as "FW:".  (Many smaller operators using MUAs for
       abuse handling rely on the subject lines for processing.)

   g.  The primary evidence of the abuse being reported is found in the
       third part of the report, which contains the original message.
       The second part contains additional derived data that may help
       the receiver, but in terms of selecting actionable report data,
       report recipients SHOULD use the content of the third part first,
       then data from the second part.  The first part is meant to
       contain explanatory text for human use but is not itself a part
       of the report, and SHOULD NOT be used if it is in conflict with
       the other parts.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20The%20%27message%2Ffeedback-report%27%20Content%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  The 'message/feedback-report' Content Type</span>

   A new [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME</a>] content type called "message/feedback-report" is
   defined.  This content type provides a machine-readable section
   intended to let the report generator convey meta-data to the report
   receiver.  The intent of this section is to convey information that
   may not be obvious or may not be easily extracted from the original
   email message body or header.




<span class="grey">Shafranovich, et al.         Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5965">RFC 5965</a>               Format for Feedback Reports           August 2010</span>


   The body of this content type consists of multiple "fields" formatted
   according to the ABNF of [<a href="#ref-MAIL" title='"Internet Message Format"'>MAIL</a>] header fields.  This section defines
   the initial set of fields provided by this specification.  Additional
   fields may be registered according to the procedure described later
   in this memo.  Although these fields have a syntax similar to those
   of mail message header fields, they are semantically distinct; hence,
   they SHOULD NOT be repeated as header fields of the message
   containing the report.  Note that these fields represent information
   that the receiver is asserting about the report in question, but are
   not necessarily verifiable.  Report receivers MUST NOT assume that
   these assertions are always accurate.

   Note that the above limitation in no way restricts the use of message
   header fields that are registered in the IANA header field registry
   with the same field names.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Required%20Fields"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Required Fields</span>

   The following report header fields MUST appear exactly once:

   o  "Feedback-Type" contains the type of feedback report (as defined
      in the corresponding IANA registry and later in this memo).  This
      is intended to let report parsers distinguish among different
      types of reports.

   o  "User-Agent" indicates the name and version of the software
      program that generated the report.  The format of this field MUST
      follow section 14.43 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>HTTP</a>].  This field is for documentation
      only; there is no registry of user agent names or versions, and
      report receivers SHOULD NOT expect user agent names to belong to a
      known set.

   o  "Version" indicates the version of specification that the report
      generator is using to generate the report.  The version number in
      this specification is set to "1".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Optional%20Fields%20Appearing%20Once"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Optional Fields Appearing Once</span>

   The following header fields are optional and MUST NOT appear more
   than once:

   o  "Original-Envelope-Id" contains the envelope ID string used in the
      original [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>] transaction (see section 2.2.1 of [<a href="#ref-DSN" title='"An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications"'>DSN</a>]).

   o  "Original-Mail-From" contains a copy of the email address used in
      the MAIL FROM portion of the original SMTP transaction.  The
      format of this field is defined in section 4.1.2 of [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>] as
      "Reverse-path".



<span class="grey">Shafranovich, et al.         Standards Track                    [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-7"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5965">RFC 5965</a>               Format for Feedback Reports           August 2010</span>


   o  "Arrival-Date" indicates the date and time at which the original
      message was received by the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) of the
      generating ADMD (Administrative Management Domain).  This field
      MUST be formatted as per section 3.3 of [<a href="#ref-MAIL" title='"Internet Message Format"'>MAIL</a>].

   o  "Reporting-MTA" indicates the name of the MTA generating this
      feedback report.  This field is defined in section 2.2.2 of [<a href="#ref-DSN" title='"An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications"'>DSN</a>],
      except that it is an optional field in this report.

   o  "Source-IP" contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address of the MTA from which
      the original message was received.  Addresses MUST be formatted as
      per section 4.1.3 of [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>].

   o  "Incidents" contains an unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the
      number of incidents this report represents.  The absence of this
      field implies the report covers a single incident.

   The historic field "Received-Date" SHOULD also be accepted and
   interpreted identically to "Arrival-Date".  However, if both are
   present, the report is malformed and SHOULD be treated as described
   in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Optional%20Fields%20Appearing%20Multiple%20Times"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Optional Fields Appearing Multiple Times</span>

   The following set of header fields are optional and may appear any
   number of times as appropriate:

   o  "Authentication-Results" indicates the result of one or more
      authentication checks run by the report generator.  The format of
      this field is defined in [<a href="#ref-AUTH-RESULTS" title='"Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status"'>AUTH-RESULTS</a>].  Report receivers should
      note that this field only indicates an assertion made by the
      report generator.

   o  "Original-Rcpt-To" includes a copy of the email address used in
      the RCPT TO portion of the original [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>] transaction.  The
      format of this field is a "Reverse-path" defined in <a href="#section-4.1.2">section 4.1.2</a>
      of that memo.  This field SHOULD be repeated for every SMTP
      recipient seen by the report generator.

   o  "Reported-Domain" includes a domain name that the report generator
      believes to be relevant to the report, e.g., the domain whose
      apparent actions provoked the generation of the report.  It is
      unspecified how the report generator determines this information,
      and thus the report receiver cannot be certain how it was chosen.
      It is often used as a means of suggesting to the report receiver
      how this report might be handled.  In cases where the derivation





<span class="grey">Shafranovich, et al.         Standards Track                    [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-8"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5965">RFC 5965</a>               Format for Feedback Reports           August 2010</span>


      is not obvious, the report generator is encouraged to clarify in
      the text section of the report.  Domain format is defined in
      section 2.3.1 of [<a href="#ref-DNS" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>DNS</a>].

   o  "Reported-URI" indicates a URI that the report generator believes
      to be relevant to the report, e.g., a suspect URI that was found
      in the message that caused the report to be generated.  The same
      caveats about the origin of the value of "Reported-Domain" apply
      to this field.  The URI format is defined in [<a href="#ref-URI" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>URI</a>].

   Implementors should be aware that the Reported-URI field can carry
   many different types of data depending on the URI scheme used.  For
   more information, please consult the "URI Schemes" registry
   maintained by IANA.

   Furthermore, it is outside the scope of this standard whether the
   data carried in this field implies any additional information.
   Implementors may negotiate their own agreements surrounding the
   interpretation of this data.

   When an agent that accepts and handles ARF messages receives a
   message that purports (by MIME type) to be an ARF message but
   syntactically deviates from this specification, that agent SHOULD
   ignore or reject the message.  Where rejection is performed, the
   rejection notice (either via an [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>] reply or generation of a
   [<a href="#ref-DSN" title='"An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications"'>DSN</a>]) SHOULD identify the specific cause for the rejection.

   See <a href="#section-8.9">Section 8.9</a> for further discussion.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Transport%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Transport Considerations</span>

   [<a id="ref-DSN">DSN</a>] requires that its reports be sent with the empty [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>]
   envelope sender to avoid bounce loops.  A similar requirement was
   considered for this specification, but it seems unlikely that an ARF
   report would be generated in response to receipt of an ARF report,
   and furthermore such a requirement would prevent an ARF generator
   from ever determining that an ARF report was not actually received.

   On the other hand, if an ARF report is generated without the empty
   envelope sender and is sent to an address that actually does not
   work, then the generating address can also be overwhelmed by DSNs as
   a denial-of-service attack (see <a href="#section-8.6">Section 8.6</a>).

   This specification therefore makes no requirement related to the
   envelope sender of a generated report.  Operators will have to
   consider what envelope sender to use within the context of their own
   installations.

   Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be
   extended over time to fit the ever-changing landscape of the
   Internet.  Therefore, extensibility is provided via two IANA
   registries: one for feedback types and a second for report header
   fields.  The feedback type registry is to be used in conjunction with
   the "Feedback-Type" field above.  The header name registry is

   intended for registration of new meta-data fields to be used in the
   machine-readable portion (part 2) of this format.  Please note that
   version numbers do not change with new field registrations unless a
   new specification of this format is published.  Also, note that all
   new field registrations may only be registered as optional fields.
   Any new required fields REQUIRE a new version of this specification
   to be published.

   In order to encourage extensibility and interoperability of this
   format, implementors MUST ignore any fields or report types they do
   not explicitly support.

   Additional report types (extension report types) or report header
   fields might be defined in the future by later revisions to this
   specification, or by registrations as described above.  Such types
   and fields MUST be registered as described above and published in an
   Open Specification such as an RFC.

   Experimental report types and report header fields MUST only be used
   between ADMDs that have explicitly consented to use them.  These
   names and the parameters associated with them are not documented in
   RFCs.  Therefore, they are subject to change at any time and are not
   suitable for general use.

   IANA has created the "Feedback Report Header Fields" registry.  This
   registry contains header fields for use in feedback reports, as
   defined by this memo.

   New registrations or updates MUST be published in accordance with the
   "Specification Required" guidelines as described in [<a href="#ref-IANA" title="">IANA</a>].  Any new
   field thus registered is considered optional by this specification
   unless a new version of this memo is published.

   New registrations and updates MUST contain the following information:

   1.  Name of the field being registered or updated

   2.  Short description of the field

   The following security considerations apply when generating or
   processing a feedback report:

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.1.%20%20Inherited%20from%20RFC%203462"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" id="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Inherited from <a href="./rfc3462">RFC 3462</a></span>

   All of the Security Considerations from [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>] are inherited here.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.2.%20%20Interpretation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" id="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Interpretation</span>

   This specification describes a report format.  The authentication and
   validity of the content of the report SHOULD be established through
   other means.  The content of an unvetted report could be wrong,
   incomplete or deliberately false, including the alleged abuse
   incident in the third part, derived data in the second part or the
   human-readable first part.

   There will be some desire to perform some actions in an automated
   fashion in order to enact timely responses to common feedback
   reports.  Caution must be taken, however, as there is no substantial
   security around the content of these reports.  An attacker could
   craft a report meant to generate undesirable actions on the part of a
   report recipient.

   It is suggested that the origin of an ARF report be vetted, such as
   by using common message authentication schemes like [<a href="#ref-SMIME" title='"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Message Specification"'>SMIME</a>], [<a href="#ref-DKIM" title='"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures"'>DKIM</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-SPF" title='"Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in E-Mail, Version 1"'>SPF</a>], or [<a href="#ref-SENDERID" title='"Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail"'>SENDERID</a>], prior to the undertaking of any kind of
   automated action in response to receipt of the report.  In
   particular, S/MIME offers the strongest authentication and the cost
   of key exchange is assumed in the process of establishing a bilateral
   reporting relationship that uses this specification; however, it is
   not as transparent as the others and thus will interfere with the
   parsing capabilities of code that is designed specifically to handle
   multipart/report messages.

   The details of the required validation to achieve this are a matter
   of local policy and are thus outside the scope of this specification.

   If an attack becomes known against an authentication method, clearly
   then the agent verifying that method can be fooled into thinking an
   inauthentic message is authentic, and thus the value of this header
   field can be misleading.  It follows that any attack against an
   authentication method that might be used to protect the authenticity
   of an abuse report is also a security consideration here.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5965">RFC 5965</a>               Format for Feedback Reports           August 2010</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.4.%20%20Intentionally%20Malformed%20Reports"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.4" id="section-8.4">8.4</a>.  Intentionally Malformed Reports</span>

   It is possible for an attacker to generate an ARF message field that
   is extraordinarily large or otherwise malformed in an attempt to
   discover or exploit weaknesses in recipient parsing code.
   Implementors SHOULD thoroughly verify all such messages and be robust
   against intentionally as well as unintentionally malformed messages.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.5.%20%20Omitting%20Data%20from%20ARF%20Reports"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.5" id="section-8.5">8.5</a>.  Omitting Data from ARF Reports</span>

   The sending of these reports can reveal possibly private information
   about the person sending the report.  For example, such a report sent
   in response to a mailing list posting will reveal to the report
   recipient a valid email address on the list that might otherwise have
   remained hidden.

   For this reason, report generators might wish to redact portions of
   the report to conceal private information.  Doing so could be
   necessary where privacy trumps operational necessity, but, as
   mentioned in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, it might impede a timely or meaningful
   response from the report recipient.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.6.%20%20Automatically%20Generated%20ARF%20Reports"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.6" id="section-8.6">8.6</a>.  Automatically Generated ARF Reports</span>

   Systems have been implemented that generate ARF reports automatically
   in response to an event.  For example, software monitoring a honeypot
   email address might generate an ARF report immediately upon delivery
   of any message to it.  An attacker that becomes aware of such a
   configuration can exploit it to attack an ARF recipient with
   automatically generated ARF reports.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.7.%20%20Attached%20Malware"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.7" id="section-8.7">8.7</a>.  Attached Malware</span>

   As this format is sometimes used to automatically report malware, ARF
   processors (human or otherwise) SHOULD ensure that attachments are
   processed in a manner appropriate for unverified and potentially
   hostile data.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.8.%20%20The%20User-Agent%20Field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.8" id="section-8.8">8.8</a>.  The User-Agent Field</span>

   Further to <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>, the User-Agent field is an assertion of the
   generating software and is neither specified in this memo nor derived
   from the message represented in the third part of the report.  It is
   intended for documentation and debugging, and since it is trivially
   forged by a malicious agent, it SHOULD NOT be interpreted by
   recipients.

   Further to the discussion in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>, there might be cases where an
   ARF processing agent elects to accept messages not consistent with
   this specification, such as during transition periods where some
   fields are moving toward "historic" or "deprecated" status, or the
   introduction of new non-standard extension or experimental fields.
   Such choices need to be implemented with extreme caution; where two
   different fields have related meaning (e.g., "Received-Date", which
   is historic, and "Arrival-Date", which is current), an attacker could
   craft a report that makes a confusing claim in an attempt to exploit
   such liberal parsing logic.
