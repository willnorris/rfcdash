Abstract

   This memo defines an extension object that can be appended to
   selected multi-part ICMP messages.  This extension permits Label
   Switching Routers to append MPLS information to ICMP messages, and
   has already been widely deployed.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4950">RFC 4950</a>                       ICMP MPLS                     August 2007</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   IP routers use the Internet Control Message Protocol, ICMPv4
   [<a href="./rfc0792" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol"'>RFC0792</a>] and ICMPv6 [<a href="./rfc4443" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC4443</a>], to convey control information to
   source hosts.  Network operators use this information to diagnose
   routing problems.

   When a router receives an undeliverable IP datagram, it can send an
   ICMP message to the host that originated the datagram.  The ICMP
   message indicates why the datagram could not be delivered.  It also
   contains the IP header and leading payload octets of the "original
   datagram" to which the ICMP message is a response.

   MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSR) also use ICMP to convey control
   information to source hosts.  <a href="./rfc3032#section-2.3">Section 2.3 of [RFC3032]</a> describes the
   interaction between MPLS and ICMP, and Sections <a href="#section-2.4">2.4</a> and <a href="#section-3">3</a> of
   [<a href="./rfc3032" title='"MPLS Label Stack Encoding"'>RFC3032</a>] provide applications of that interaction.

   When an LSR receives an undeliverable MPLS-encapsulated datagram, it
   removes the entire MPLS label stack, exposing the previously
   encapsulated IP datagram.  The LSR then submits the IP datagram to an
   error processing module.  Error processing can include ICMP message
   generation.

   The ICMP message indicates why the original datagram could not be
   delivered.  It also contains the IP header and leading octets of the
   original datagram.

   The ICMP message, however, contains no information regarding the MPLS
   label stack that encapsulated the original datagram when it arrived
   at the LSR.  This omission is significant because the LSR would have
   forwarded the original datagram based upon information contained by
   the MPLS label stack.

   This memo defines an ICMP extension object that permits an LSR to
   append MPLS information to ICMP messages.  Selected ICMP messages
   SHOULD include the MPLS label stack, as it arrived at the router that
   is sending the ICMP message.  The ICMP message MUST also include the
   IP header and leading payload octets of the original datagram.

   The ICMP extensions defined in this document must be preceded by an
   ICMP Extension Structure Header and an ICMP Object Header.  Both are
   defined in [<a href="./rfc4884" title='"Extended ICMP to Support Multi-Part Messages"'>RFC4884</a>].

   The ICMP extension defined in this document is equally applicable to
   ICMPv4 [<a href="./rfc0792" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol"'>RFC0792</a>] and ICMPv6 [<a href="./rfc4443" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC4443</a>].  Throughout this document,
   unless otherwise specified, the acronym ICMP refers to multi-part
   ICMP messages, encompassing both ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.

   The ICMP extension defined in this memo supports enhancements to
   TRACEROUTE.  Enhanced TRACEROUTE applications, like older
   implementations, indicate which nodes the original datagram visited
   en route to its destination.  They differ from older implementations
   in that they also reflect the original datagram's MPLS encapsulation
   status as it arrived at each node.

   Figure 1 contains sample output from an enhanced TRACEROUTE
   implementation.

   This memo does not define the general relationship between ICMP and
   MPLS.  <a href="./rfc3032#section-2.3">Section 2.3 of [RFC3032]</a> defines this relationship.

   The current memo does not define encapsulation-specific TTL (Time to
   Live) manipulation procedures.  It defers to <a href="./rfc3034#section-5.4">Section 5.4 of RFC 3034</a>
   [<a href="./rfc3034" title='"Use of Label Switching on Frame Relay Networks Specification"'>RFC3034</a>] and <a href="./rfc3035#section-10">Section 10 of [RFC3035]</a> in this matter.

   When encapsulation-specific TTL manipulation procedures defeat the
   basic TRACEROUTE mechanism, they will also defeat enhanced TRACEROUTE
   implementations.

   The MPLS Label Stack Object can be appended to the ICMP Time Exceeded
   and Destination Unreachable messages.  A single instance of the MPLS
   Label Stack Object represents the entire MPLS label stack, formatted
   exactly as it was when it arrived at the LSR that sends the ICMP
   message.

   Figure 2 depicts the MPLS Label Stack Object.  It must be preceded by
   an ICMP Extension Structure Header and an ICMP Object Header.  Both
   are defined in [<a href="./rfc4884" title='"Extended ICMP to Support Multi-Part Messages"'>RFC4884</a>].

   In the object payload, octets 0-3 depict the first member of the MPLS
   label stack.  Each remaining member of the MPLS label stack is
   represented by another 4 octets that share the same format.

   This memo does not specify the conditions that trigger the generation
   of ICMP Messages for Labeled IP Packets.  It does not define the
   interaction between MPLS and ICMP.  However, this document defines an
   extension that allows an MPLS router to append MPLS information to
   multi-part ICMP messages, and therefore can provide the user of the
   TRACEROUTE application with additional information.  Consequently, a
   network operator may wish to provide this information selectively
   based on some policy; for example, only include the MPLS extensions
   in ICMP messages destined to addresses within the network management
   blocks with administrative control over the router.  An
   implementation could determine whether to include the MPLS Label
   Stack extensions based upon the destination address of the ICMP
   message, or based on a global configuration option in the router.
   Alternatively, an implementation may determine whether to include
   these MPLS extensions when TTL expires based on the number of label
   stack entries (depth of the label stack) of the incoming packet.
   Finally, an operator can make use of the TTL treatment on MPLS Pipe
   Model LSPs defined in [<a href="./rfc3443" title='"Time To Live (TTL) Processing in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Networks"'>RFC3443</a>] for a TTL-transparent mode of
   operation that would prevent ICMP Time Exceeded altogether when
   tunneled over the MPLS LSP.

   IANA has assigned the following object Class-num in the ICMP
   Extension Object registry:

             Class-Num   Description
                     1   MPLS Label Stack Class

   IANA has established a registry for the corresponding class sub-type
   (C-Type) space, as follows:

             MPLS Label Stack Class Sub-types:

                C-Type  Description

             0x02-0xF6  Available for assignment
             0xF7-0xFF  Reserved for private use

   C-Type values are assignable on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) basis
   [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC2434</a>].
