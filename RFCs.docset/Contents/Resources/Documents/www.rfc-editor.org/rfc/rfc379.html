NIC 11121                                                 AUGUST 11, 1972

                            USING TSO AT CCN

    IBM's Time Sharing Option ("TSO") is now available at CCN for use via
the Network with Telnet Protocol.  TSO is not yet considered "production"
by CCN, since there are a number of restrictions and glitches to be removed
or documented.  However, TSO is now quite stable and is up on a regularly
scheduled basis; the system will allow an experienced programmer to work
productively at CCN.  To use TSO, you will need a valid CCN charge (billing)
number, and a user-id.  To obtain a charge number (if you do not already
have one), or to obtain a TSO user-id, contact Barbara Noble at (213)
825-7438 or (213) 825-7452.  At present we are not charging for TSO use
(although any batch jobs submitted from TSO will be charged to your account).
Barbara can assign on overhead charge number for experimental use of TSO if
you do not have a paid account.

Modes of TSO Use
----------------

    (1)  Conversational Remote Job Entry
         -------------------------------

         Using TSO you can prepare an OS job stream using the TSO EDIT command,
         SUBMIT the job to batch execution, monitor its STATUS, and ship the
         OUTPUT back to EDIT for examination.  This allows those of you with
         TIP'S to process jobs at CCN without using NETRJS via a friendly
         TENEX machine.  Any batch job can be submitted this way.


    (2)  Foreground Execution
         --------------------

         Many OS/360 programs can be run, with varying degrees of inconvenience,
         directly from the terminal.  There are TSO commands providing the
         facilities of EXEC and DD cards; the output stream can be directed to
         the user's terminal.  There are some important limitations to fore-
         ground operation, however:

              (1)  The foreground region size is limited; at present, it is
                   128K, though this will be expanded.

<span class="grey">              (2)  All datasets referenced must be on resident disk packs;</span>
                   no disks or tapes can be mounted.

              (3)  Since you are time-sliced and swapped, it can be very
                   slow.

    There are two important cases of foreground execution:

         (A)  The TEST command provides DDT-like debugging capability
              for foreground programs.

         (B)  The user's own program can interact with his terminal.

NOTE:  It is not yet possible for a program, either in batch or foreground,
       to open direct Network connections.

Hours of Operation
------------------

     Monday through Friday, 6 A.M. - Noon PDT (or 9 A.M. - 3 P.M. EDT).
     These hours will be extended before September 1, 1972.

Telnet Protocol
---------------

     The document "USING TSO VIA ARPA NETWORK VIRTUAL TERMINAL", RFC #377
     describes the use of a Telnet NVT to access TSO.  There are some signi-
     ficant differences from using a real 2741 locally.  RFC #377 describes
     the current server Telnet, complete with an annoying bug.  A later
     version will include the following capabilities not presently available:

          (a)  "FULL DUPLEX", i.e., CCN echoing.

          (b)  Lower case input.

          (c)  The special character translation included in NETRJS
               users with Model 33 Teletypes. (see RFC #338).

          (d)  Optional specification of single CR or single LF as end-of-line
               indication

          (e)  Hopefully, the input attention bug described in RFC #377 will
               be fixed.

<span class="grey">Disk Space</span>
----------

     TSO will automatically place datasets created in the foreground (e.g., by
     EDIT or ALLOC) on the proper resident disk pack.  All TSO datasets are
     cataloged, and can be referenced by name alone (no volume or unit specifi-
     cation is necessary).  For most purposes, you can pretend we have one big
     disk.                                                             --- ---
     ----

Dataset Names
-------------

     The standard IBM version of TSO uses the TSO user-id as the highest
     index of each dataset name.  At CCN, the _two_ highest levels are the
     charge number and the user-id of the person who created the dataset.
     TSO has been modified accordingly.

Dataset Access Control
----------------------

     In general, under TSO a user can access for reading, writing, or
     execution any dataset named with the charge number with which he is
     logged on.  In addition, he can rename or scratch any dataset with the
     logon charge number.  There is no provision for public or read-only
     datasets a present.

Logging On
----------

     Most Network users will need only the simple form of LOGON:

                   logon     &lt;user-id&gt;

     EXAMPLE:                         NOTES:
     -------                          -----

          user:  logon uid            (Use your user-id)

          TSO:   LOGON UID            (TSO repeats line for reasons of its own)

          TSO:  ENTER PASSWORD        (TSO asks for password)

          user:  xyz

          TSO:  UID LOGON IN PROGRESS AT 11:37:43 ON AUGUST 9, 1984

<span class="grey">          TSO:  LOGON PROCEEDING      (It may take a while.  This message will</span>
                                      come every 30 seconds.)

          TSO:  WELCOME TO TSO.  GOOD LUCK

          TSO:  READY

     User-id's are created in TSO with a blank password.  To add or change your
     password, use the CHANGE command.  If you have TSO access under more than
     one charge number, LOGON will prompt you for the charge number to be used
     for the session.

Where to Get Help
-----------------

    1.  To obtain a list of TSO commands enter:  "help commands"

    2.  To get detailed information on syntax and function of a particular
        command, enter: "help &lt;command name&gt; &lt;qualifiers&gt;"
        Type "help help" for details.

    3.  The SEND command may be useful for on-line help from PCN (Pete Nielsen)
        or WDD (Bill Drain), when they are signed on.  You can find out if PCN
        or WDD is on by sending them a trial message.

        EXAMPLE:
        -------

               User:  send 'hello' user(wdd)

               TSO:   USER WDD NOT LOGGED ON

               TSO:   READY

               user:  send 'hello' user(pcn)

               TSO:   READY

               user:  send 'edit is acting funny' user(pcn)

               TSO:   READY

        Here "PCN" was logged on and got your message.  You can, therefore,
        converse with him through SEND.  The text in one SEND is limited to
        115 characters.

    4.  You can also leave a message for wdd to receive when he logs on by
        typing:  send '&lt;message&gt;' user(wdd) logon.

<span class="grey">    5.  To send a message to the CCN operator, enter simply:  send '&lt;message&gt;'</span>

    6.  You can call the CCN Telephone Consultant at (213) 825-7452, Monday
        through Friday during the hours 10-12 A.M. PDT and 1-4 P.M. (except
        3-4 P.M. on Thursday).  If the consultant does not know the answer,
        he/she will investigate and call you back.

    7.  You can call the general contact for Network user problems, Barbara
        Noble, at (213) 825-7438.  Barbara is also one of the Telephone
        consultants.

    8.  If all else fails, call Bill Drain, the CCN Systems Programmer in
        charge of TSO installation.  His telephone is (213) 825-7474 (if no
        answer, call my secretary at (213) 825-7518 and leave a message for
        Bill).

    9.  You can also send a message to someone at CCN by submitting the
        following pseudo-job through RJS at TSO:

                   //&lt;charge number&gt;  JOB 'BIN=9906',MSGLASS=C
                   //*  &lt;message&gt;
                   //*
                   //*
                   //*
                   //*
                   etc.
