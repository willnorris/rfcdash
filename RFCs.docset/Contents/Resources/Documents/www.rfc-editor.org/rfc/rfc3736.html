Abstract

   Stateless Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol service for IPv6
   (DHCPv6) is used by nodes to obtain configuration information, such
   as the addresses of DNS recursive name servers, that does not require
   the maintenance of any dynamic state for individual clients.  A node
   that uses stateless DHCP must have obtained its IPv6 addresses
   through some other mechanism, typically stateless address
   autoconfiguration.  This document explains which parts of <a href="./rfc3315">RFC 3315</a>
   must be implemented in each of the different kinds of DHCP agents so
   that agent can support stateless DHCP.

   Nodes that have obtained IPv6 addresses through some other mechanism,
   such as stateless address autoconfiguration [<a href="#ref-6" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>6</a>] or manual
   configuration, can use stateless DHCP to obtain other configuration
   information such as a list of DNS recursive name servers or SIP
   servers.  A stateless DHCP server provides only configuration
   information to nodes and does not perform any address assignment.
   Such a server is called "stateless" because it need not maintain any
   dynamic state for individual clients.

   While the DHCP specification [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>1</a>] defines more than 10 protocol
   messages and 20 options, only a subset of those messages and options
   are required for stateless DHCP service.  This document explains
   which messages and options defined in <a href="./rfc3315">RFC 3315</a> are required for
   stateless DHCP service.  The intended use of the document is to guide

   the interoperable implementation of clients and servers that use
   stateless DHCP service.

   The operation of relay agents is the same for stateless and stateful
   DHCP service.  The operation of relay agents is described in the DHCP
   specification.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of this document lists the sections of the DHCP document
   that an implementor should read for an overview of the DHCP
   specification and the basic requirements of a DHCP service.  <a href="#section-5">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-5">5</a> lists the specific messages and options that are specifically
   required for stateless DHCP service.  <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> describes how
   stateless and stateful DHCP servers interact to provide service to
   clients that require address assignment and clients that require only
   stateless service.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   Throughout this document, "DHCP" refers to DHCP for IPv6.

   This document uses the terminology defined in <a href="./rfc2460">RFC 2460</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>2</a>], the DHCP
   specification [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>1</a>], and the DHCP DNS configuration options
   specification [<a href="#ref-3" title='"DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>3</a>].

   "Stateless DHCP" refers to the use of DHCP to provide configuration
   information to clients that does not require the server to maintain
   dynamic state about the DHCP clients.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   This document assumes that a node using stateless DHCP configuration
   is not using DHCP for address assignment, and that a node has
   determined at least a link-local address as described in <a href="./rfc2461#section-5.3">section 5.3
   of RFC 2461</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>4</a>].

   To obtain configuration parameters through stateless DHCP, a node
   uses the DHCP Information-request message.  DHCP servers respond to
   the node's message with a Reply message that carries configuration
   parameters for the node.  The Reply message from the server can carry
   configuration information, such as a list of DNS recursive name
   servers [<a href="#ref-3" title='"DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>3</a>] and SIP servers [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) Options for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers"'>5</a>].

   This document does not apply to the function of DHCP relay agents as
   described in <a href="./rfc3315">RFC 3315</a>.  A network element can provide both DHCP
   server and DHCP relay service.  For example, a network element can
   provide stateless DHCP service to hosts requesting stateless DHCP
   service, while relaying messages from hosts requesting address
   assignment through DHCP to another DHCP server.

   Several sections of the DHCP specification provide background
   information or define parts of the specification that are common to
   all implementations:

   1-4:   give an introduction to DHCP and an overview of DHCP message
          flows

   5:     defines constants used throughout the protocol specification

   6, 7:  illustrate the format of DHCP messages

   8:     describes the representation of Domain Names

   9:     defines the "DHCP unique identifier" (DUID)

   13-16: describe DHCP message transmission, retransmission, and
          validation

   21:    describes authentication for DHCP

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Implementation%20of%20Stateless%20DHCP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Implementation of Stateless DHCP</span>

   The client indicates that it is requesting configuration information
   by sending an Information-request message that includes an Option
   Request option specifying the options that it wishes to receive from
   the DHCP server.  For example, if the client is attempting to obtain
   a list of DNS recursive name servers, it identifies the DNS Recursive
   Name Server option in the Information-request message.  The server
   determines the appropriate configuration parameters for the client
   based on its configuration policies and responds with a Reply message
   containing the requested parameters.  In this example, the server
   would respond with DNS configuration parameters.

   As described in <a href="./rfc3315#section-18.1.5">section 18.1.5 of RFC 3315</a>, a node may include a
   Client Identifier option in the Information-request message to
   identify itself to a server, because the server administrator may
   want to customize the server's response to each node, based on the
   node's identity.

   <a href="./rfc3315">RFC 3315</a> does not define any mechanisms through which the time at
   which a host uses an Information-request message to obtain updated
   configuration parameters can be controlled.  The DHC WG has
   undertaken the development of such a mechanism or mechanisms which
   will be published as Standards-track RFC(s).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3736">RFC 3736</a>            Stateless DHCP Service for IPv6           April 2004</span>


   <a href="./rfc3315">RFC 3315</a> also does not provide any guidance about when a host might
   use an Information-request message to obtain updated configuration
   parameters when the host has moved to a new link.  The DHC WG is
   reviewing a related document, "Detection of Network Attachment (DNA)
   in IPv4" [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Detection of Network Attachment (DNA) in IPv4"'>8</a>], which describes how a host using IPv4 can determine
   when to use DHCPv4.  Either the DHC WG or a WG formed from the DNA
   BOF will undertake development of a similar document for IPv6.

   Clients and servers use the following options to pass configuration
   information to clients; note that other options for configuration
   information may be specified in future Internet Standards:

   DNS Recursive Name Servers: specifies the DNS recursive name servers
                               [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>7</a>] the client uses for name resolution;

   In some networks, there may be both clients that are using stateless
   address autoconfiguration and DHCP for DNS configuration and clients
   that are using DHCP for stateful address configuration.  Depending on
   the deployment and configuration of relay agents, DHCP servers that
   are intended only for stateless configuration may receive messages
   from clients that are performing stateful address configuration.

   A DHCP server that is only able to provide stateless configuration
   information through an Information-request/Reply message exchange
   discards any other DHCP messages it receives.  Specifically, the
   server discards any messages other than Information-Request or
   Relay-forward it receives, and the server does not participate in any
   stateful address configuration message exchanges.  If there are other
   DHCP servers that are configured to provide stateful address
   assignment, one of those servers will provide the address assignment.

   described in the DHCP specification, <a href="./rfc3315">RFC 3315</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>1</a>].  Therefore,
   stateless DHCP service introduces no additional security
   considerations beyond those discussed in sections <a href="#section-21">21</a>, <a href="#section-22.11">22.11</a>, and <a href="#section-23">23</a>
   of the DHCP specification [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>1</a>].

   Configuration information provided to a node through stateless DHCP
   service may be used to mount spoofing, man-in-the-middle, denial-of-
   service, and other attacks.  These attacks are described in more
   detail in the specifications for each of the options that carry
   configuration information.  Authenticated DHCP, as described in
   sections <a href="#section-21">21</a> and <a href="#section-22.11">22.11</a> of the DHCP specification [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>1</a>], can be used to
   avoid attacks mounted through the stateless DHCP service.
