   This memo describes how a BEEP [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol Core"'>1</a>] session is mapped onto a single
   TCP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>2</a>] connection.  Refer to Section 2.5 of [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol Core"'>1</a>] for an explanation

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Session%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Session Management</span>

   The mapping of BEEP session management onto the TCP service is
   straight-forward.

   A BEEP session is established when a TCP connection is established
   between two BEEP peers:

   o  the BEEP peer that issues a passive TCP OPEN call is termed the
      listener; and,

   o  the BEEP peer that issues an active TCP OPEN call is termed the
      initiator.

   A simultaneous TCP OPEN would result in both BEEP peers believing
   they are the initiator and neither peer will be able to start any
   channels.  Because of this, services based on BEEP must be designed
   so that simultaneous TCP OPENs cannot occur.

   If both peers agree to release a BEEP session (c.f., [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol Core"'>1</a>]'s <a href="#section-2.4">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-2.4">2.4</a>), the peer sending the "ok" reply, immediately issues the TCP
   CLOSE call.  Upon receiving the reply, the other peer immediately
   issues the TCP CLOSE call.

   A BEEP session is terminated when either peer issues the TCP ABORT
   call, and the TCP connection is subsequently aborted.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Message%20Exchange"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Message Exchange</span>

   The mapping of BEEP exchanges onto the TCP service is less straight-
   forward.

   Messages are reliably sent and received using TCP's SEND and RECEIVE
   calls.  (This also provides ordered delivery of messages on the same
   channel.)

   Although TCP imposes flow control on a per-connection basis, if
   multiple channels are simultaneously in use on a BEEP session, BEEP
   must provide a mechanism to avoid starvation and deadlock.  To
   achieve this, BEEP re-introduces a mechanism used by the TCP:
   window-based flow control -- each channel has a sliding window that
   indicates the number of payload octets that a peer may transmit
   before receiving further permission.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3081">RFC 3081</a>             Mapping the BEEP Core onto TCP           March 2001</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1%20Flow%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a> Flow Control</span>

   Recall from Section 2.2.1.2 of [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol Core"'>1</a>] that every payload octet sent in
   each direction on a channel has an associated sequence number.
   Numbering of payload octets within a data frame is such that the
   first payload octet is the lowest numbered, and the following payload
   octets are numbered consecutively.

   The actual sequence number space is finite, though very large,
   ranging from 0..4294967295 (2**32 - 1).  Since the space is finite,
   all arithmetic dealing with sequence numbers is performed modulo
   2**32.  This unsigned arithmetic preserves the relationship of
   sequence numbers as they cycle from 2**32 - 1 to 0 again.  Consult
   Sections <a href="#section-2">2</a> through <a href="#section-5">5</a> of [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Serial Number Arithmetic"'>3</a>] for a discussion of the arithmetic
   properties of sequence numbers.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.1%20Channel%20Creation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" id="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a> Channel Creation</span>

   When a channel is created, the sequence number associated with the
   first payload octet of the first data frame is 0, and the initial
   window size for that channel is 4096 octets.  After channel creation,
   a BEEP peer may update the window size by sending a SEQ frame
   (<a href="#section-3.1.3">Section 3.1.3</a>).

   If a BEEP peer is asked to create a channel and it is unable to
   allocate at least 4096 octets for that channel, it must decline
   creation of the channel, as specified in Section 2.3.1.2 of [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol Core"'>1</a>].
   Similarly, during establishment of the BEEP session, if the BEEP peer
   acting in the listening role is unable to allocate at least 4096
   octets for channel 0, then it must return a negative reply, as
   specified in Section 2.4 of [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol Core"'>1</a>], instead of a greeting.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.2%20Sending%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2" id="section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a> Sending Messages</span>

   Before a message is sent, the sending BEEP peer must ensure that the
   size of the payload is within the window advertised by the receiving
   BEEP peer.  If not, it has three choices:

   o  if the window would allow for at least one payload octet to be
      sent, the BEEP peer may segment the message and start by sending a
      smaller data frame (up to the size of the remaining window);

   o  the BEEP peer may delay sending the message until the window
      becomes larger; or,

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3081">RFC 3081</a>             Mapping the BEEP Core onto TCP           March 2001</span>


   o  the BEEP peer may signal to its application that it is unable to
      send the message, allowing the application to try again at a later
      time (or perhaps signaling its application when a larger window is
      available).

   The choice is implementation-dependent, although it is recommended
   that the application using BEEP be given a mechanism for influencing
   the decision.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.3%20Processing%20SEQ%20Frames"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.3" id="section-3.1.3">3.1.3</a> Processing SEQ Frames</span>

   As an application accepts responsibility for incoming data frames,
   its BEEP peer should send SEQ frames to advertise a new window.

   The ABNF [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>4</a>] for a SEQ frame is:

      seq        = "SEQ" SP channel SP ackno SP window CR LF

      ackno      = seqno

      window     = size

      ; channel, seqno, and size are defined in Section 2.2.1 of [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol Core"'>1</a>].

   The SEQ frame has three parameters:

   o  a channel number;

   o  an acknowledgement number, that indicates the value of the next
      sequence number that the sender is expecting to receive on this
      channel; and,

   o  a window size, that indicates the number of payload octets
      beginning with the one indicated by the acknowledgement number
      that the sender is expecting to receive on this channel.

   A single space character (decimal code 32, " ") separates each
   component.  The SEQ frame is terminated with a CRLF pair.

   When a SEQ frame is received, if any of the channel number,
   acknowledgement number, or window size cannot be determined or is
   invalid, then the BEEP session is terminated without generating a
   response, and it is recommended that a diagnostic entry be logged.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.4%20Use%20of%20Flow%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.4" id="section-3.1.4">3.1.4</a> Use of Flow Control</span>

   The key to successful use of flow control within BEEP is to balance
   performance and fairness:



<span class="grey">Rose                        Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3081">RFC 3081</a>             Mapping the BEEP Core onto TCP           March 2001</span>


   o  large messages should be segmented into frames no larger than
      two-thirds of TCP's negotiated maximum segment size;

   o  frames for different channels with traffic ready to send should be
      sent in a round-robin fashion;

   o  each time a frame is received, a SEQ frame should be sent whenever
      the window size that will be sent is at least one half of the
      buffer space available to this channel; and,

   o  if the transport service presents multiple frames to a BEEP peer
      simultaneously, then a single consolidating SEQ frame may be sent.

   In order to avoid pathological interactions with the transport
   service, it is important that a BEEP peer advertise windows based on
   available buffer space, to allow data to be read from the transport
   service as soon as available.  Further, SEQ frames for a channel must
   have higher priority than messages for that channel.

   Implementations may wish to provide queue management facilities to
   the application using BEEP, e.g., channel priorities, (relative)
   buffer allocations, and so on.  In particular, implementations should
   not allow a given channel to monopolize the underlying transport
   window (e.g., slow readers should get small windows).

   In addition, where possible, implementations should support transport
   layer APIs that convey congestion information.  These APIs allow an
   implementation to determine its share of the available bandwidth, and
   also be notified of changes in the estimated path bandwidth.  Note
   that when a BEEP session has multiple channels that are
   simultaneously exchanging large messages, implementations without
   access to this information may have uncertain fairness and progress
   properties during times of network congestion.

   Finally, implementors should follow the guidelines given in the
   relevant portions of <a href="./rfc1122">RFC1122</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers"'>5</a>] that deal with flow control (and
   bear in mind that issues such as retransmission, while they interact
   with flow control in TCP, are not applicable to this memo).  For
   example, <a href="./rfc1122#section-4.2.2.16">Section 4.2.2.16 of RFC1122</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers"'>5</a>] indicates that a "receiver
   SHOULD NOT shrink the window, i.e., move the right window edge to the
   left" and then discusses the impact of this rule on unacknowledged
   data.  In the context of mapping BEEP onto a single TCP connection,
   only the portions concerning flow control should be implemented.
