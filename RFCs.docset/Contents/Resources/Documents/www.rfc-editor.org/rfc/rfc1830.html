Status of this Memo

   This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
   community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any
   kind.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Abstract"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Abstract</span>

   This memo defines two extensions to the SMTP service.  The first
   service enables a SMTP client and server to negotiate the use of an
   alternate DATA command "BDAT" for efficiently sending large MIME
   messages.  The second extension takes advantage of the BDAT command
   to permit the negotiated sending of unencoded binary data.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Introduction</span>

   The MIME extensions to the Internet message protocol provides for the
   transmission of many kinds of data which were previously unsupported
   in Internet mail.  Anticipating the need to more efficiently
   transport the new media made possible with MIME, the SMTP protocol
   has been extended to provide transport for new message types.  <a href="./rfc1426">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc1426">1426</a> defines one such extension for the transmission of unencoded 8
   bit MIME messages [<a href="#ref-8BIT" title='"SMTP Service Extension for 8bit-MIMEtransport"'>8BIT</a>].  This service extension permits the
   receiver SMTP to declare support for 8 bit body parts and the sender
   to request 8 bit transmission of a particular message.

   One expected result of the use of MIME is that the Internet mail
   system will be expected to carry very large mail messages.  In such
   transactions, there is a need to eliminate the requirement that the
   message be scanned for "CR LF . CR LF" sequences upon sending and
   receiving to detect the end of message.

   Independent of the need to send large messages, Internet mail is
   increasingly multi-media there is a need to avoid the overhead of
   base64 and quoted-printable encoding of binary objects sent using the
   MIME message format over SMTP between hosts which support binary
   message processing.

   This memo uses the mechanism defined in [<a href="#ref-ESMTP" title='"SMTP Service Extensions"'>ESMTP</a>] to define two
   extensions to the SMTP service whereby a client ("sender-SMTP") may
   declare support for the message chunking transmission mode using the
   BDAT command and support for the sending of Binary messages.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Framework%20for%20the%20Large%20Message%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Framework for the Large Message Extensions</span>

   The following service extension is hereby defined:

          1) The name of the data chunking service extension is
          "CHUNKING".

          2) The EHLO keyword value associated with this extension is
          "CHUNKING".

          3) A new SMTP verb is defined "BDAT" as an alternative to
          the "DATA" command of [<a href="./rfc821" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>RFC821</a>]. The BDAT verb takes two
          arguments.  The first argument indicates the length of the
          binary data packet.  The second optional argument indicates
          that the data packet is the last.

               bdat-cmd   ::= "BDAT" SP chunk-size
                              [ SP end-marker ] CR LF
               chunk-size ::= 1*DIGIT
               end-marker ::= "LAST"


   The CHUNKING service extension enables the use of the BDAT
   alternative to the DATA command.  This extension can be used for any
   message, whether 7 bit, 8BITMIME or BINARYMIME.

   When a client SMTP wishes to submit (using the MAIL command) a large
   message using the CHUNKING extension, it first issues the EHLO
   command to the server SMTP.  If the server SMTP responds with code
   250 to the EHLO command, and the response includes the EHLO keyword
   value CHUNKING, then the server SMTP is indicating that it supports
   the BDAT command and will accept the sending of messages in chunks.

   After all MAIL FROM and RCPT TO responses are collected and
   processed, the message is sent using a series of BDAT commands.  The
   BDAT command takes one argument, the exact length of the data segment
   in octets.  The message data is sent immediately after the BDAT
   command.  Once the receiver-SMTP receives the specified number of
   octets, it will return a 250 reply code.

   The LAST parameter on the BDAT command indicates that this is the
   last chunk of message data to be sent.  Any BDAT command sent after
   the BDAT LAST is illegal and must be replied to with a 503 "Bad



<span class="grey">Vaudreuil                     Experimental                      [Page 2]</span></pre>

   sequence of commands" reply code. The state resulting from this error
   is indeterminate.  A RSET command must be sent to clear the
   transaction before continuing.

   A 250 response should be sent to each BDAT data block.  If a 5XX code
   is sent in response to a BDAT chunk the message should be considered
   failed and, the sender SMTP must not send any additional BDAT
   segments.  If using the ESMTP pipelining extensions [<a href="#ref-PIPE" title='"SMTP Service Extensions for Command Pipelining"'>PIPE</a>], the
   sender SMTP must complete the sending of the current segment and not
   send any more BDATs.  When streaming, the receiver SMTP must accept
   and discard additional BDAT chunks after the failed BDAT.  After
   receiving a 5XX error in response to a BDAT command, the resulting
   state is indeterminate.  A RSET command must be issued to clear the
   transaction before additional commands may be sent.

      Note that an error on the receiver SMTP such as disk full or
      imminent shutdown can only be reported after the BDAT segment has
      been sent.  It is therefore important to choose a reasonable chunk
      size given the expected end to end bandwidth.

   The RSET command when issued during after the first BDAT and before
   the BDAT LAST clears all segments sent during that transaction and
   resets the session.

   DATA and BDAT commands cannot be used in the same transaction.  If a
   DATA statement is issued after a BDAT for the current transaction, a
   503 "Bad sequence of commands" must be issued.  The state resulting
   from this error is indeterminate.  A RSET command must be sent to
   clear the transaction before continuing.  There is no prohibition on
   using DATA and BDAT in the same session, so long as they are not
   mixed in the same transaction.

   The local storage size of a message may not accurately reflect the
   actual size of the message sent due to local storage conventions.  In
   particular, text messages sent with the BDAT command must be sent in
   the canonical MIME format with lines delimited with a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.  It
   may not be possible to convert the entire message to the canonical
   format at once. Chunking provides a mechanism to convert the message
   to canonical form, accurately count the bytes, and send the message a
   single chunk at a time.

      Note that correct byte counting is essential.  If too many bytes
      are indicated by the sender SMTP, the receiver SMTP will continue
      to wait for the remainder of the data or will read the subsequent
      command as additional message data.  In the case where a portion
      of the previous command was read as data, the parser will return a
      syntax error when the incomplete command is read.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1830">RFC 1830</a>           Binary and Large Message Transport        August 1995</span>


      If too few bytes are indicated by the sender SMTP, the receiver
      SMTP will interpret the remainder of the message data as invalid
      commands.  Note that the remainder of the message data may be
      binary and as such lexigraphical parsers must be prepared to
      receive, process, and reject lines of arbitrary octets.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Framework%20for%20the%20Binary%20Service%20Extension"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Framework for the Binary Service Extension</span>

   The following service extension is hereby defined:

      1) The name of the binary service extension is "BINARYMIME".

      2) The EHLO keyword value associated with this extension is
         "BINARYMIME".

      3) The BINARYMIME service extension can only be used with
         the "CHUNKING" service extension.

      4) No parameter is used with the BINARYMIME keyword.

      5) One additional parameter to the BODY keyword defined
         [<a href="#ref-8BIT" title='"SMTP Service Extension for 8bit-MIMEtransport"'>8BIT</a>] for the MAIL FROM command is defined, "BINARYMIME".
         The value "BINARYMIME" associated with this parameter
         indicates that this message is a Binary MIME message (in
         strict compliance with [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"'>MIME</a>]) with arbitrary octet content
         being sent. The revised syntax of the value is as follows,
         using the ABNF notation of [<a href="./rfc822" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>RFC822</a>]:

         body-value ::= "7BIT" / "8BITMIME" / "BINARYMIME"

      6) No new verbs are defined for the BINARYMIME extension.

   A sender SMTP may request that a binary MIME message be sent without
   transport encoding by sending a BINARYMIME parameter with the MAIL
   FROM command.  When the receiver SMTP accepts a MAIL FROM command
   with the BINARYMIME body type requested, it agrees to preserve all
   bits in each octet passed using the BDAT command.

   BINARYMIME cannot be used with the DATA command.  If a DATA command
   is issued after a MAIL FROM command containing the body-value of
   "BINARYMIME", a 501 response should be sent.  The resulting state
   from this error condition is indeterminate and the transaction should
   be reset with the RSET command.

      It is important to note that when using BINARYMIME, it is
      especially important to ensure that the MIME message itself is
      properly formed.  In particular, it is essential that text be
      canonically encoded with each line properly terminated with &lt;CR&gt;



<span class="grey">Vaudreuil                     Experimental                      [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-5"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1830">RFC 1830</a>           Binary and Large Message Transport        August 1995</span>


      &lt;LF&gt;.  Any transformation of text into non-canonical MIME to
      observe local storage conventions must be reversed before sending
      as BINARYMIME.  The usual line-oriented shortcuts will break if
      used with BINARYMIME.

   The syntax of the extended MAIL command is identical to the MAIL
   command in [<a href="./rfc821" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>RFC821</a>], except that a BODY parameter must appear after
   the address.  The complete syntax of this extended command is defined
   in [<a href="#ref-ESMTP" title='"SMTP Service Extensions"'>ESMTP</a>]. The ESMTP-keyword is BODY and the syntax for ESMTP-value
   is given by the syntax for body-value in [<a href="#ref-ESMTP" title='"SMTP Service Extensions"'>ESMTP</a>].

   If a receiver SMTP does not support the BINARYMIME message format
   (either by not responding with code 250 to the EHLO command, or by
   rejecting the BINARYMIME parameter to the MAIL FROM command, then the
   client SMTP must not, under any circumstances, send binary data using
   the DATA or BDAT commands.

   If the receiver-SMTP does not support BINARYMIME and the message
   content is a MIME object with a binary encoding, a client SMTP has
   two options in this case: first, it may implement a gateway
   transformation to convert the message into valid 7bit encoded MIME,
   or second, it may treat this as a permanent error and handle it in
   the usual manner for delivery failures.  The specifics of the
   transformation from Binary MIME to 7bit MIME are not described by
   this RFC; the conversion is nevertheless constrained in the following
   ways:

     o  The conversion must cause no loss of information; MIME
        transport encodings must be employed as needed to insure this
        is the case.

     o  The resulting message must be valid 7bit MIME.

   As of present there are no mechanisms for converting a binary MIME
   object into a 8 bit-MIME object.  Such a transformation will require
   the specification of a new MIME content-transfer-encoding, the
   standardization of which is discouraged by [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"'>MIME</a>].
