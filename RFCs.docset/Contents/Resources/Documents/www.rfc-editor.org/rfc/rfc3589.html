Abstract

   This document describes the IANA's allocation of a block of Diameter
   Command Codes for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
   Release 5.  This document does not pass judgment on the usage of
   these command codes.  Further more, these command codes are for use
   for Release 5.  For future releases, these codes cannot be reused,
   but must be allocated according to the Diameter Base specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the
   Internet Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as part of their Release 5
   architecture.  As part of this architecture, they have defined a
   Diameter application [<a href="#ref-29.229">29.229</a>] and [<a href="#ref-29.329">29.329</a>] which requires the use of
   new Diameter Command Codes [<a href="#ref-DIAM" title='"Diameter Base Protocol"'>DIAM</a>].

   The IANA has allocated Diameter Command Codes 300 through 313, for
   use in 3GPP Release 5.  The protocols defined by these command codes
   have not been carefully reviewed by the IETF community and are not
   considered to be general mechanisms appropriate for broad usage.
   More work is needed to develop general mechanisms and may become a
   work item of an IETF Working Group.  These command codes are intended
   to be used for 3GPP Release 5 only [29.228], [<a href="#ref-29.229">29.229</a>].  Future 3GPP
   releases are expected to make use of alternate mechanisms.

   Command codes for 3GPP Release 6 are expected to be allocated from
   the standard command space, with IETF documentation.  The current
   intent as agreed with 3GPP is to develop a standards track
   application addressing the needs of AAA for SIP/SDP and encompassing
   the requirements of the cellular community.

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any

   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp11">BCP-11</a>.  Copies of
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights, which may cover technology that may be required to practice
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive
   Director [<a href="#ref-2026" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>2026</a>].
