<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This specification formalizes an ad hoc practice used to provide
   advice to the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom) about the operations
   of the IAOC (described in [<a href="./rfc4071" title='"Structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)"'>RFC4071</a>]).

   This document updates [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>].

   Proposed future changes to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp10">BCP 10</a> should be discussed on the public
   IETF NomCom discussion mailing list, at
   &lt;<a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-nomcom">https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-nomcom</a>&gt;.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Background%20on%20%27IAOC%20Liaisons%27%20to%20Nominating%20Committees"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Background on 'IAOC Liaisons' to Nominating Committees</span>

   When <a href="./rfc7437">RFC 7437</a> [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>] was approved, it explicitly charged the
   nominating committee with selecting and reviewing certain members of
   the IAOC.  However, [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>] did not provide for the IAOC to send a
   liaison to the nominating committee.

   This was not thought to be an obstacle because [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>] allowed any
   committee member to propose a liaison from the IAOC:

      Any committee member may propose the addition of a liaison from
      other unrepresented organizations to participate in some or all of
      the deliberations of the committee.  The addition must be approved
      by the committee according to its established voting mechanism.
      Liaisons participate as representatives of their respective
      organizations.

   Beginning in 2010, the IAOC provided a liaison to each nominating
   committee.  In 2016, the IAOC did not provide a liaison because the
   nominating committee was not appointing an IAOC member.  The previous
   nominating committee had filled a mid-term vacancy (using the process
   described in <a href="./rfc7437#section-3.5">Section 3.5. of [RFC7437]</a>) by appointing an IAOC member
   for a term longer than two years.  In 2017, the NomCom was selecting
   an IAOC member, but the opportunity to request a liaison from the
   IAOC was overlooked, because this practice wasn't part of the
   documented process in [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>].

   This specification adds the previously ad hoc role to [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>] so
   that future nominating committees will be less likely to overlook it.

   Although past ad hoc practice has characterized this role as a
   "liaison", this specification labels the role as an "advisor".  The
   rationale for this change in nomenclature is provided in
   <a href="#appendix-A.1">Appendix A.1</a>.

      may select any advisor they vote to approve.

   This section preserves discussions and explanations that came up
   during document discussions.  Ordinarily, this section might be
   deleted during the evaluation process, but some questions came up
   repeatedly, so the editor has included them for anyone who also
   shares those questions.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.1.%20%20Why%20Is%20This%20Role%20an%20Advisor%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" id="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Why Is This Role an Advisor?</span>

   The editor of this document briefly considered proposing a new and
   IAOC-specific role to [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>] but considered such a proposal to be
   complex.  Anticipating every corner case in IETF process BCPs is
   challenging and prone to error, and as this specification was being
   written, the IETF Chair was sponsoring a design team reviewing all
   aspects of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA).
   Therefore, the structure and membership of the IAOC itself could
   change in the near future.  Instead, the specification describes how
   the nominating committee requests advisors and builds on mature text
   that has survived many nominating committee cycles.

   After choosing to reuse existing roles defined in [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>], the
   definition of "advisor" in <a href="./rfc7437#section-4.9">Section 4.9 of [RFC7437]</a> seemed
   appropriate.

      An advisor is responsible for such duties as specified by the
      invitation that resulted in the appointment.

      Advisors do not vote on the selection of candidates.

   The position described in this specification could be filled by an
   advisor who would be a non-voting member of the nominating committee,
   who is knowledgeable about the operations of the IAOC, and who has
   duties that could evolve over time as the IAOC itself evolves.

   The only difference between this advisor that requires an update to
   [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>], and any other advisor is that committee members are
   explicitly encouraged to suggest that this advisor be appointed as
   described in this specification.  The text updating [<a href="./rfc7437" title='"IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC7437</a>] is
   found in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.2.%20%20Why%20Is%20This%20Role%20Not%20a%20Liaison%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2" id="appendix-A.2">A.2</a>.  Why Is This Role Not a Liaison?</span>

   Discussions on the IETF NomCom mailing list led to the recognition
   that "liaison" was not the best description of this role.

   The role of liaison defined in <a href="./rfc7437#section-4.7">Section 4.7 of [RFC7437]</a> places some
   significant obligations on liaisons beyond what is necessary for
   someone to answer questions from the nominating committee about the
   IAOC.  These obligations include the following:

   o  Liaisons are responsible for ensuring the nominating committee in
      general and the Chair in particular execute their assigned duties
      in the best interest of the IETF community.

   o  Liaisons from the IESG, IAB, and Internet Society Board of
      Trustees (if one is appointed) are expected to review the
      operation and execution process of the nominating committee and to
      report any concerns or issues to the Chair of the nominating
      committee immediately.  If they cannot resolve the issue between
      themselves, liaisons must report it according to the dispute
      resolution process stated elsewhere in this document.

   o  Liaisons may have other nominating committee responsibilities as
      required by their respective organizations or requested by the
      nominating committee; such responsibilities may not conflict with
      any other provisions of this document.

   Finally, as mentioned in <a href="./rfc7437#section-4.6">Section 4.6 of [RFC7437]</a>, all of the
   liaisons are included in the pool of people who are eligible to be
   selected as a replacement for a Chair.

      There are a variety of ordinary circumstances that may arise from
      time to time that could result in a Chair being unavailable to
      oversee the activities of the committee.  The Chair, in
      consultation with the Internet Society President, may appoint a
      substitute from a pool comprised of the liaisons currently serving
      on the committee and the prior year's Chair or designee.

   Note: During discussion of this specification, we noted that any
   liaison would be part of the pool of potential substitute nominating
   committee Chairs.  It wasn't clear to the discussion participants
   whether there was an intentional decision to make liaisons voted onto
   the nominating committee eligible to be substitute Chairs.  That
   potential change is out of scope for this specification but may be a
   conversation worth having separately.

   All of these obligations are important, but there are always at least
   two full liaisons from the confirming bodies that are already
   responsible for those responsibilities.  It is simply not necessary
   to make the job of helping the nominating committee understand the
   role and operational practices of the IAOC more demanding than it
   must be.

   So, requiring the IAOC to name a formal liaison to the nominating
   committee isn't justified.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.3.%20%20Why%20Is%20This%20Role%20Not%20Required%20to%20Be%20a%20Sitting%20IAOC%20Member%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3" id="appendix-A.3">A.3</a>.  Why Is This Role Not Required to Be a Sitting IAOC Member?</span>

   In addition to the reasons given in <a href="#appendix-A.2">Appendix A.2</a>, the requirement
   that the IAB and IESG liaisons to the nominating committee be sitting
   members of the organizations they represent, whose positions are not
   being reviewed by this nominating committee, is especially
   challenging for the IAOC.

   Many IAOC positions are filled by members who are already members of
   IETF leadership and are subject to review by the nominating
   committee.  This means that limiting an IAOC liaison to one of the
   sitting members would mean that in some years the only individuals
   eligible to serve as liaison for the nominating committee would be
   sitting members of the IAOC that a) were appointed by the previous
   nominating committee and are not being by the current nominating
   committee, or b) were appointed by the IAB or IESG and are not being
   reviewed by the current IAB or IESG.  "Eligible" does not also mean
   "willing and able to serve", so it is possible that an IAOC might
   find itself with no sitting member to send as advisor in some years.

   Although all IAOC liaisons to the nominating committee have served as
   sitting members of the IAOC, given 10 years of IAOC operation, this
   specification assumes that other members of the community have
   sufficient experience to provide guidance if the IAOC chooses to
   suggest such a person.  If any given IAOC thought that was important,
   they could certainly continue to suggest sitting members, but if no
   sitting member was willing and able to serve, the IAOC would be free
   to do the next best thing and would likely be the best qualified
   group to decide who to send.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.4.%20%20Why%20Does%20the%20Nominating%20Committee%20Request%20an%20IAOC%20Advisor%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.4" id="appendix-A.4">A.4</a>.  Why Does the Nominating Committee Request an IAOC Advisor?</span>

   This specification could have described the mechanism in one of two
   ways:

   o  the IAOC could simply provide the name of the advisor to the
      nominating committee, or

   o  the nominating committee could request the name of an advisor from
      the IAOC.

   Either choice could work.  The reason that this specification chose
   to have the nominating committee make the first move is that this is
   more similar to the way other advisors to the nominating committee
   are selected, except that the nominating committee is asking the IAOC
   for a suggestion before inviting the advisor to join the nominating
   committee.

   The suggestion is, in fact, a suggestion; the nominating committee
   still votes to invite this advisor as they would vote to invite any
   advisor, as described in <a href="./rfc7437#section-4.3">Section 4.3 of [RFC7437]</a>.
