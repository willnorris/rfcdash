NETWORK INFORMATION CENTER SCHEDULE FOR NETWORK USERS

   The Network Information Center has planned to provide service for
   network users on a regular basis Monday through Friday.

   This service will begin on Monday, October 4, 1971.

   The daily schedule for network users will be:

      (times are Pacific Daylight / Pacific Standard Time)

      0500 to 1200      system available
                        except Tuesday, when hours are 0800 to 1200

      1200 to 1300      system not available

      1300 to 1800      system available

      1800 to 2200      system available on an irregular basis

      2200 to 0500      system not available

   This schedule is temporary and subject to change.

   The system is available on an irregular basis on weekends.

   Those periods marked as available on an irregular basis are generally
   devoted to system development.  Any user may be asked to log off on
   short notice.

ADDITIONAL NOTES

   As soon as the user's Telnet connection is established to the NIC,
   the system herald will be printed, followed immediately by a brief
   (possibly null) message to network users.  This message will contain
   any items that are of particular interest to network users.

<span class="grey">   In order to log in:</span>

      use your site ident as the user name

      the password is ARPA

      use an account number consisting of site ident-your last name

         for example, if we receive the string
                log ucla-nmc arpa ucla-postel
         the user will be logged in as John Postel from UCLA

   After logging in, the (possibly null) system message common to all
   logins will be printed.

   If you experience any trouble getting into the NIC, call us via the
   telephone numbers listed below.  If the number is not listed as a
   direct dial, you must contact your operator and ask for the appro-
   priate Zenith or Enterprise number.  If the operator is unfamiliar
   with the use of Enterprise or Zenith numbers, ask to speak to the
   supervisor.

      Dick Watson for administrative problems.

      John Melvin vor NCP or Telnet problems.

      Marily Auerbach or Dirk van Nouhuys for TNLS problems.

      If NIC personnel do not answer, a local answering service will
      take the call.  Give the name of the person to whom your question
      is directed and your question or comment.  We will contact the
      answering service every morning and reply as soon as possible.
