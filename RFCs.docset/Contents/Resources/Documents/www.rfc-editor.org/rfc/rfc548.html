RFC # 548                                                BBN-NET
NIC # 17794                                              August 16, 1973


                 <span class="h1">Hosts Using the IMP Going Down Message</span>


    As given in BBN Report 1822 (Specifications for the Interconnection
of a Host and an IMP), IMP to Host message type 2 specifies that the IMP
local to the Host is going down; the message further says when the IMP
is going down, for how long, and why.

    When the IMP goes down after sending the IMP Going Down message to
the Host, the Host's network users and local users of the network will
not, in general, be forewarned unless the Host sends a message to these
users.  We therefore urge all Hosts to warn their network users and
users of the network of impending IMP downs; just logging the received
IMP Going Down message on a logging teletype, as many Hosts currently
do, seems insufficient.

    Incidentally, please remember that Tuesday mornings from 7 a.m. to 9
a.m.  (Eastern Time) are reserved for Network Software Maintenance, as
announced in RFC #440.
