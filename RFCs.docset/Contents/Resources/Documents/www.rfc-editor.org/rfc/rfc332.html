RFC #332                                         25 April 1972

                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

     This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from April
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/10%20to%20April%2021."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" id="section-10">10</a> to April 21.  </span>During this interval the IBM 360/44 at the University
of Southern California (Network Address 23) was connected to the
Network; also, a Terminal IMP was installed in Omaha, Nebraska at
Global Weather Central (Network Address 152) on April 18.

     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.
These Hosts fall into two categories:

1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as
servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis for at
least two weeks.  Included here are:
         Network
         Address              Site                Computer
         -------              ----                --------
           134               MIT-AI               PDP-10
            13               Case                 PDP-10

2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here
are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,
MITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, and BBN*).  This category also includes
the Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is used
solely for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included
among these Hosts are the following:
         Network
         Address              Site                Computer
         -------              ----                --------
             7               Rand                 IBM-360/65
            73               Harvard              PDP-1
            12               Illinois             PDP-11
            19               NBS                  PDP-11
            23               USC                  IBM-360/44

     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for
this period.

*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as such
is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to refine
and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

where
D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal Imp.)

F = Full (Destination Host opened a connection, informed user that all
    Network ports were in use, and immediately closed the connection.)

H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)

R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
    connection within 60 seconds.)

*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a
Network Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not
equipped to test NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection to
the NETRJS logger indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
#These sites advertise that they may not have their system available
at these times.
