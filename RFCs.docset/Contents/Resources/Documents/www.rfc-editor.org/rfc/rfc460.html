                               NCP Survey

   1 This RFC is the first in a series which will request information on
   implementation of host to host protocol.  We would appreciate a reply
   to this RFC from all sites within two weeks.  One convenient way to
   reply is to make a copy of this RFC at the NIC and insert the replies
   at the appropriate spots.  The results of this survey will be
   published.  Please send replies to nic ident CSK or to

   Charles Kline

   2 This particular RFC will deal with implementations of Network
   Control Programs (NCPs).  Future RFCs will deal with .
   implementations of Telnet, RJE, etc.

   3 In order to ask questions about NCPs and get meaningful replies, I
   will here describe what I consider to be my concept of an NCP.

      3a An NCP is that part of the system which performs the tasks
      necessary for host to host protocol as specified by document NIC
      7104 (protocols notebook).

      3b NCPs contain the following parts (though not necessarily as
      separate pieces):

         3b1 Code which handles connection establishment including
         maintenance of the rendezvous table (table of open and pending
         connections).

         3b2 Code which handles transmission over open connections
         including buffer management and the sending of allocate and
         giveback commands.

         3b3 Code which handles the actual movement of messages in and
         out of the Imp (sometimes called the Imp handler and sometimes
         in a separate cpu).

         3b4 Other code including measurements, initialization, etc.

   4. Please answer the following questions.  It is probably appropriate
   to give this survey to the coder of the NCP or other knowledgeable
   person.  Write na (not applicable) where it is appropriate.  Circle
   the number of the appropriate choice when a choice is required.
   Thank you.

   9 NCP-Imp handler communications

            10a1c other (explain)

   11 Buffer space allocations

      11a initial allocation when connection (receive) is opened

      11b factors which will change this allocation

         11b1 up

         11b2 down

      11c conditions which would cause a giveback command to be sent

   12 Protocol facilities

      12a Errors

         12a1 Do you send error commands when you detect protocol
         errors?

         12a2 Do you log it (or take some other action) when you recieve
         error commands?

      12b Queuing

         12b1 do you allow queuing of connections (i.e. when an rts or
         str is received for which no request is pending, do you refuse
         it (send back a cls) or queue it? also do you queue when two or
         more requests match the same socket?)

            12b1a yes always

            12b1b no always

            12b1c yes for listens

         12c Are there hooks (code) in the NCP for:

            12c1 NCP measurement

            12c2 Network measurement

            12c3 MSP and other protocol experiments

            12c4 Do any of these hooks allow a user process to send a
            message with a given leader or look at all messages which
            arrive with a given leader?

   13 Time outs

      13a How long will the NCP hold a request for connection (INIT or
      LISTEN) from a user process before timing out if not matched by an
      RTS or STR from the net ----

      13b How long will the NCP hold an STR or RTS recieved from the net
      before timing out and sending a CLS ----

      13c How long will the NCP wait after sending a reset or echo
      command before declaring the host dead (assuming you got a RFNM at
      least) ----

      13d Any other timeouts? (explain)

   14 Have you made any measurements on the effect of network use on
   your system?

      14a effect of local users using telnet to go out to net

      14b effect of foreign users using your system via net

      14c bandwidth you have been able to achieve

   15 Are any changes planned or in progress in the design or coding of
   your NCP? (explain)

      16a Please feel free to add other comments on your NCP which you
      feel would be of interest to the network community.
