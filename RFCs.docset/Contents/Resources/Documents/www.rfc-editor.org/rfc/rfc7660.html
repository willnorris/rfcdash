               <span class="h1">Diameter Congestion and Filter Attributes</span>

Abstract

   This document defines optional Diameter attributes that can be used
   to help manage networks that use Explicit Congestion Notification
   (ECN) or Diameter traffic filters.  These new attributes allow for
   improved data traffic identification, support of ECN, and minimal
   Diameter filter administration.

   <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a> defines a Filter-Rule Attribute Value Pair (AVP) that
   accommodates extensions for classification, conditions, and actions.
   It, however, does not support traffic identification for packets
   using Explicit Congestion Notification as defined in <a href="./rfc3168">RFC 3168</a> and
   does not provide specific actions when the flow(s) described by the
   Filter-Rule are congested.

   Further, a Filter-Rule can describe multiple flows but not the exact
   number of flows.  Flow count and other associated data (e.g.,
   packets) are not captured by accounting applications, leaving
   administrators without useful information regarding the effectiveness
   or appropriateness of the filter definition.

   The optional attributes defined in this document are forward and
   backwards compatible with <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Two optional AVPs related to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
   [<a href="./rfc3168" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>RFC3168</a>] are specified in this document.  The first AVP provides
   direct support for filtering ECN-marked traffic [<a href="./rfc3168" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>RFC3168</a>] and the
   second AVP provides the ability to define alternate traffic treatment
   when congestion is experienced.

   This document also defines two optional AVPs, Flow-Count and Packet-
   Count, used for conveying flow information within the Diameter
   protocol [<a href="./rfc6733" title='"Diameter Base Protocol"'>RFC6733</a>].  These AVPs were found to be useful for a wide
   range of applications.  The AVPs provide a way to convey information
   of the group of flows described by the Filter-Rule, IPFilterRule, or
   other Diameter traffic filters.

   The semantics and encoding of all AVPs can be found in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   Such AVPs are, for example, needed by some congestion-management
   functions to determine the number of flows congested or used by
   administrators to determine the impact of filter definitions.

   Additional parameters may be defined in future documents as the need
   arises.  All parameters are defined as Diameter-encoded Attribute
   Value Pairs (AVPs), which are described using a modified version of
   the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF), see [<a href="./rfc6733" title='"Diameter Base Protocol"'>RFC6733</a>].  The data types
   are also taken from [<a href="./rfc6733" title='"Diameter Base Protocol"'>RFC6733</a>].

   The ECN-IP-Codepoint AVP (AVP Code 628) is of type Enumerated and
   specifies the ECN codepoint values to match in the IP header.

   When this AVP is used for classification in the Filter-Rule, it MUST
   be part of the Classifier Grouped AVP as defined in <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Congestion-Treatment%20AVP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Congestion-Treatment AVP</span>

   The Congestion-Treatment AVP (AVP Code 629) is of type Grouped.  It
   indicates how to treat traffic IP (5-tuple) flow(s) when congestion
   is detected.  The detection of congestion can be based on the
   reception of IP packets with the Congestion Experience (CE) codepoint
   set (see [<a href="./rfc3168" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>RFC3168</a>]) or by any other administratively defined
   criteria.

   A Filter-Rule may contain a Classifier that describes one or many
   5-tuples per <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a>.  This treatment applies to all packets
   associated to all 5-tuples (flows) captured by the Filter-Rule.

   If the Congestion-Treatment AVP is absent, the treatment of the
   congested traffic is left to the discretion of the node performing
   quality-of-service (QoS) treatment.

               Congestion-Treatment ::= &lt; AVP Header: 629 &gt;
                           { Treatment-Action }
                           [ QoS-Profile-Template ]
                           [ QoS-Parameters ]
                         * [ AVP ]

   Treatment-Action, QoS-Profile-Template, and QoS-Parameters are
   defined in <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a>.  The Congestion-Treatment AVP is an action and
   MUST be an attribute of the Filter-Rule Grouped AVP as defined in <a href="./rfc5777">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc5777">5777</a>.

   The Flow-Count AVP (AVP Code 630) is of type Unsigned64.

   It indicates the number of protocol-specific flows.  The protocol is
   determined by the filter (e.g., IPFilterRule, Filter-Id, etc.).

   The Packet-Count AVP (AVP Code 631) is of type Unsigned64.

   It indicates the number of protocol-specific packets.  The protocol

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7660">RFC 7660</a>            Congestion and Filter Attributes        October 2015</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Examples</span>

   The following examples illustrate the use of the AVPs defined in this
   document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Classifier%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Classifier Example</span>

   The Classifier AVP (AVP Code 511) specified in <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a> is a grouped
   AVP that consists of a set of attributes that specify how to match a
   packet.  The addition of the ECN-IP-Codepoint is shown here.

      Classifier ::= &lt; AVP Header: 511 &gt;
                     { Classifier-ID }
                     [ Protocol ]
                     [ Direction ]
                     [ ECN-IP-Codepoint ]
                   * [ From-Spec ]
                   * [ To-Spec ]
                   * [ Diffserv-Code-Point ]
                     [ Fragmentation-Flag ]
                   * [ IP-Option ]
                   * [ TCP-Option ]
                     [ TCP-Flags ]
                   * [ ICMP-Type ]
                   * [ ETH-Option ]
                   * [ AVP ]

   Setting the ECN-IP-Codepoint value to 'CE' would permit the capture
   of CE flags in the Flow.

   Another Classifier with the ECN-IP-Codepoint value of 'ECT' could be
   specified and, when coupled with the Flow-Count AVP, reports the
   number of ECT-capable flows.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Diameter%20Credit%20Control%20%28CC%29%20with%20Congestion%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Diameter Credit Control (CC) with Congestion Information</span>

   Diameter nodes using Credit Control can use the Congestion-Treatment
   AVP to trigger specific actions when congestion occurs.  This is
   similar to the Excess-Treatment Action.  The ability to detect when
   congestion occurs is specific to the AVPs in the Filter-Rule and
   Diameter Client and is no different than how 'Excess' can be
   determined for Excess-Treatment.  If conditions associated with
   Excess-Treatment [<a href="./rfc5777" title='"Traffic Classification and Quality of Service (QoS) Attributes for Diameter"'>RFC5777</a>] or Congestion-Treatment have occurred,
   Diameter Clients may autonomously send Credit-Control Requests (CCRs)
   during the Service Delivery session as interim events.  This is shown
   in Figure 1.

            Figure 1: Example of a Diameter Credit Control with
                          Congestion Information

   The 'Used-Service-Units' described in <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a> examples is
   customarily a Service-Units, Time-Units, or Byte-Count AVP.  This is
   insufficient to represent network state and does not differentiate
   between throughput and good-put (good or quality throughput) even
   though the filters may imply good or poor throughput.

   Flow-Count and Packet-Count AVPs defined in this document could be
   sent with a CCR when the triggering event is related to Congestion-
   Treatment.  This provides the CC Server with a better view of the
   type of congested traffic for improved decision making and charging.
   Sending such AVPs under any condition permits rudimentary traffic
   profiling regardless of network conditions.  For instance, low byte
   counts per packet is indicative of web traffic and high byte counts

   per packet with a small number of flows may be indicative of video
   traffic.  Enriched reporting described here provides relief from Deep
   Packet Inspection load and loss of information as traffic becomes
   increasingly encrypted.

   Some services, e.g., streaming services, limit the number of flows,
   Flow-Count, as opposed to other units, i.e. Byte-Count.  In such a
   case, the Flow-Count AVP may be used in place of Service-Units.

   This document describes an extension of <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a> that introduces a
   new filter parameter applied to ECN as defined by [<a href="./rfc3168" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>RFC3168</a>].  It also
   defines a new Grouped AVP that expresses what action to take should
   congestion be detected.  The Grouped AVP reuses attributes defined in
   <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a>.  As these are extensions to <a href="./rfc5777">RFC 5777</a>, they do not raise new
   security concerns.

   The Flow-Count and Packet-Count AVPs can be provided in conjunction
   with customary AVPs, e.g., Bytes, Time, Service units, during
   accounting activities as described in the base protocol [<a href="./rfc6733" title='"Diameter Base Protocol"'>RFC6733</a>] or
   other Diameter applications.  These new AVPs provide more information
   that can be privacy sensitive.  The privacy sensitivity is directly
   related to traffic captured by filters and associated reports.
   Narrow filtering, which creates the highest level of privacy
   sensitivity, is too resource intensive to be widely applied on large
   networks.  Paradoxically, improving reporting information lessens the
   depth of inspection required to characterize traffic for many
   congestion management activities as noted in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>.

   If an administrator can provide congestion actions without the need
   to report them to a Diameter application, they should use the
   Congestion-Treatment AVP, which also reduces Diameter traffic during
   congestion events.

   The Security Considerations of the Diameter protocol itself have been
   discussed in <a href="./rfc6733">RFC 6733</a> [<a href="./rfc6733" title='"Diameter Base Protocol"'>RFC6733</a>].  Use of the AVPs defined in this
   document MUST take into consideration the security issues and
   requirements of the Diameter base protocol.
