Abstract

   This document specifies a base profile for X.509 v3 Certificates and
   X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for use with the United
   States National Security Agency's Commercial National Security
   Algorithm (CNSA) Suite.  The profile applies to the capabilities,
   configuration, and operation of all components of US National
   Security Systems that employ such X.509 certificates.  US National
   Security Systems are described in NIST Special Publication 800-59.
   It is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that
   process high-value information.  It is made publicly available for
   use by developers and operators of these and any other system
   deployments.

   This document specifies a base profile for X.509 v3 Certificates and
   X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for use by applications
   that support the United States National Security Agency's Commercial
   National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite [<a href="#ref-CNSA" title='"Use of Public Standards for Secure Information Sharing"'>CNSA</a>].  The profile applies
   to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components
   of US National Security Systems that employ such X.509 certificates.
   US National Security Systems are described in NIST Special
   Publication 800-59 [<a href="#ref-SP80059" title='"Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System"'>SP80059</a>].  It is also appropriate for all other
   US Government systems that process high-value information.  It is
   made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these
   and any other system deployments.

   This document does not define any new cryptographic algorithm suite;
   instead, it defines a CNSA-compliant profile of "Internet X.509
   Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List
   (CRL) Profile" [<a href="./rfc5280" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>].  It applies to all CNSA Suite solutions
   that make use of X.509 v3 Certificates or X.509 v2 CRLs.  The reader
   is assumed to have familiarity with <a href="./rfc5280">RFC 5280</a>.  All MUST-level
   requirements of <a href="./rfc5280">RFC 5280</a> apply throughout this profile and are
   generally not repeated here.  In cases where a MUST-level requirement
   is repeated for emphasis, the text notes the requirement is "in
   adherence with <a href="./rfc5280">RFC 5280</a>".  This profile contains changes that elevate
   some SHOULD-level options in <a href="./rfc5280">RFC 5280</a> to MUST-level and also contains
   changes that elevate some MAY-level options in <a href="./rfc5280">RFC 5280</a> to SHOULD-
   level or MUST-level.  All options from <a href="./rfc5280">RFC 5280</a> that are not listed
   in this profile remain at the requirement level of <a href="./rfc5280">RFC 5280</a>.

   The reader is also assumed to have familiarity with these documents:

   The National Security Agency (NSA) profiles commercial cryptographic
   algorithms and protocols as part of its mission to support secure,
   interoperable communications for US Government National Security
   Systems.  To this end, it publishes guidance both to assist with
   transitioning the United States Government to new algorithms and to
   provide vendors, and the Internet community in general, with
   information concerning their proper use and configuration.

   Recently, cryptographic transition plans have become overshadowed by
   the prospect of the development of a cryptographically relevant
   quantum computer.  The NSA has established the Commercial National
   Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite to provide vendors and IT users near-
   term flexibility in meeting their cybersecurity interoperability
   requirements.  The purpose behind this flexibility is to avoid
   vendors and customers making two major transitions in a relatively
   short time frame, as we anticipate a need to shift to quantum-
   resistant cryptography in the near future.

   The NSA is authoring a set of RFCs, including this one, to provide
   updated guidance concerning the use of certain commonly available
   commercial algorithms in IETF protocols.  These RFCs can be used in
   conjunction with other RFCs and cryptographic guidance (e.g., NIST
   Special Publications) to properly protect Internet traffic and data-
   at-rest for US Government National Security Systems.

   The goal of this document is to define a base set of requirements for
   certificates and CRLs to support interoperability among CNSA Suite
   solutions.  Specific communities, such as those associated with US
   National Security Systems, may define community profiles that further
   restrict certificate and CRL contents by mandating the presence of
   extensions that are optional in this base profile, defining new
   optional or critical extension types, or restricting the values and/
   or presence of fields within existing extensions.  However,
   communications between distinct communities MUST conform with the
   requirements specified in this document when interoperability is

   desired.  Applications may add requirements for additional
   non-critical extensions, but they MUST NOT assume that a remote peer
   will be able to process them.

   Every CNSA Suite certificate MUST use the X.509 v3 format and contain
   one of the following:

   o  An ECDSA-capable signature verification key using curve P-384, or

   o  An ECDH-capable (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) key establishment
      key using curve P-384, or

   o  An RSA-capable signature verification key using RSA-3072 or
      RSA-4096, or

   o  An RSA-capable key transport key using RSA-3072 or RSA-4096.

   The signature applied to all CNSA Suite certificates and CRLs MUST be
   made with a signing key that is either generated on the curve P-384,
   or is an RSA-3072 or RSA-4096 key.  The SHA-384 hashing algorithm
   MUST be used for all certificate and CRL signatures irrespective of
   the type of key used.

   The RSA exponent "e" MUST satisfy 2^16&lt;e&lt;2^256 and be odd per
   [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title='"Digital Signature Standard (DSS)"'>FIPS186</a>].

   The requirements of this document are not intended to preclude use of
   RSASSA-PSS signatures.  However, Certification Authorities (CAs)
   conforming with this document will not issue certificates specifying
   that algorithm for subject public keys.  Protocols that use RSASSA-
   PSS should be configured to use certificates that specify
   rsaEncryption as the subject public key algorithm.  Protocols that
   use these keys with RSASSA-PSS signatures must use the following
   parameters: the hash algorithm (used for both mask generation and
   signature generation) must be SHA-384, the mask generation function 1
   from [<a href="./rfc8017" title='"PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.2"'>RFC8017</a>] must be used, and the salt length must be 48 octets.

   for applications that create or use CNSA Suite certificates.  Note
   that <a href="./rfc5280">RFC 5280</a> has varying mandates for marking extensions as critical
   or non-critical.  This profile changes some of those mandates for
   extensions that are included in CNSA Suite certificates.

   ECDSA digital signature generation is described in [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title='"Digital Signature Standard (DSS)"'>FIPS186</a>].  An
   ECDSA signature value is composed of two unsigned integers, denoted
   as "r" and "s".  "r" and "s" MUST be represented as ASN.1 INTEGERs.
   If the high-order bit of the unsigned integer is a 1, an octet with
   the value 0x00 MUST be prepended to the binary representation before
   encoding it as an ASN.1 INTEGER.  Unsigned integers for the P-384
   curves can be a maximum of 48 bytes.  Therefore, converting each "r"
   and "s" to an ASN.1 INTEGER will result in a maximum of 49 bytes for
   the P-384 curve.

   The ECDSA signatureValue in an X.509 certificate is encoded as a BIT
   STRING value of a DER-encoded SEQUENCE of the two INTEGERS.

   For ECDSA signature verification keys and ECDH key agreement keys,
   the algorithm ID id-ecPublicKey MUST be used.

   The parameters of the AlgorithmIdentifier in this field MUST use the
   namedCurve option.  The specifiedCurve and implicitCurve options
   described in [<a href="./rfc5480" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography Subject Public Key Information"'>RFC5480</a>] MUST NOT be used.  The namedCurve MUST be the
   OID for secp384r1 (curve P-384) [<a href="./rfc5480" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography Subject Public Key Information"'>RFC5480</a>].

   The elliptic curve public key, ECPoint, SHALL be the OCTET STRING
   representation of an elliptic curve point following the conversion
   routine in <a href="./rfc5480#section-2.2">SectionÂ 2.2 of [RFC5480]</a> and Sections <a href="#section-2.3.1">2.3.1</a> and <a href="#section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a> of

   CNSA Suite implementations MAY use either the uncompressed form or
   the compressed form of the elliptic curve point [<a href="./rfc5480" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography Subject Public Key Information"'>RFC5480</a>].  For
   interoperability purposes, all relying parties MUST be prepared to
   process the uncompressed form.

   The elliptic curve public key (an ECPoint that is an OCTET STRING) is
   mapped to a subjectPublicKey (a BIT STRING) as follows: the most
   significant bit of the OCTET STRING becomes the most significant bit
   of the BIT STRING, and the least significant bit of the OCTET STRING
   becomes the least significant bit of the BIT STRING [<a href="./rfc5480" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography Subject Public Key Information"'>RFC5480</a>].

   For RSA signature verification keys and key transport keys, the
   algorithm ID, rsaEncryption, MUST be used.

   The parameters field MUST have ASN.1 type NULL for this algorithm
