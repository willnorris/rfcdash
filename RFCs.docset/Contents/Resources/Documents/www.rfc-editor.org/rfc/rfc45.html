                         New Protocol is Coming

We are currently preparing a clean version of the Network protocol,
hopefully suitable for immediate implementation.  As advertised, we
will send these specs out on April 28.

Since the SJCC is one week later, we will host a discussion meeting in
Atlantic City, Thursday, May 7, win the afternoon.  The purpose of the
discussion meeting will be for us to explicate unclear details of our
April 29 document, and for everyone to exchange gripes, suggestions
and schedules.

(Note that the network session, chaired by Larry Roberts with papers
from BBN, et al is Thursday morning.)
