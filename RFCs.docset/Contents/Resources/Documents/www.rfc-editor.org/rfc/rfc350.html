User Accounts for UCSB On-line System                     UCSB
NIC 10549                                                 18-May-72

        For the past year UCSB has provided free use of the UCSB
        On-line System to Network sites.  Recharges for this
        service are being paid for by the Computer Research Lab
        with funds out of our current ARPA contract.  Connect
        time for the month of April totaled 152 hours.

        Presently, all users are running on the same account:
        User Number=196, ID Code=57372, User Name=ARPA.  As
        such, it is difficult to monitor the amount of use by
        each site.  Consequently, we are changing the login
        procedure for Network users, effective 1 June 72.

        Commencing June 1, the new login parameters will be:

           User Number=196
           ID=57372
           User Name=&lt;site destination&gt;
           Job Name=&lt;your name&gt; (NIC ID will suffice).

        The appropriate site designation is listed at the end of
        this RFC for each affilliation presently connected to
        the ARPA network.  Any site omitted from this list which
        plans on running at UCSB should contact me at (805)
        961-3793.

        Network users of the UCSB On-line System are reminded
        that these free accounts are provided for Network
        experimentation.  We also encourage use of this service
        on a casual basis inorder that users unfamiliar with the
        Culler-Fried System may acquaint themselves with some of
        the facilities available.  However, sites intending to
        use the system on a production basis are requested to
        open a private account to which computer charges can be
        billed.

        We will also continue to provide free remote batch
        support on a limited basis.  Again, this service is
        provided as a convenience to Network sites who are
        attempting to implement and debug Network software.
        Sites submitting production jobs will be expected to
        open a Computer Center account and pay for computer
        charges billed to that account.
