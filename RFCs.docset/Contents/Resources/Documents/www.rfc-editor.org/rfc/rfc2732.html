               <span class="h1">Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's</span>

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document defines the format for literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's
   for implementation in World Wide Web browsers.  This format has been
   implemented in the IPv6 versions of several widely deployed browsers
   including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Lynx.  It is also
   intended to be used in the IPv6 version of the service location
   protocol.

   This document incudes an update to the generic syntax for Uniform
   Resource Identifiers defined in <a href="./rfc2396">RFC 2396</a> [<a href="#ref-URL" title='"Uniform Resource Identifiers: Generic Syntax"'>URL</a>].  It defines a syntax
   for IPv6 addresses and allows the use of "[" and "]" within a URI
   explicitly for this reserved purpose.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   The textual representation defined for literal IPv6 addresses in
   [<a href="#ref-ARCH" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>ARCH</a>] is not directly compatible with URL's.  Both use ":" and "."
   characters as delimiters.  This document defines the format for
   literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's for implementation in World Wide Web
   browsers.  The goal is to have a format that allows easy "cut" and
   "paste" operations with a minimum of editing of the literal address.

   The format defined in this document has been implemented in the IPv6
   versions of several widely deployed browsers including Microsoft
   Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Lynx.  It is also intended to be used
   in the IPv6 version of the service location protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a> Requirements</span>

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, if and where they appear
   in this document, are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   World Wide Web browsers SHOULD implement the format of IPv6 literals
   in URL's defined in this document.  Other types of applications and
   protocols that use URL's MAY use this format.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Literal%20IPv6%20Address%20Format%20in%20URL%27s%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Literal IPv6 Address Format in URL's Syntax</span>

   To use a literal IPv6 address in a URL, the literal address should be
   enclosed in "[" and "]" characters.  For example the following
   literal IPv6 addresses:

      FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210
      1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:4171
      3ffe:2a00:100:7031::1
      1080::8:800:200C:417A
      ::192.9.5.5
      ::FFFF:129.144.52.38
      2010:836B:4179::836B:4179

   would be represented as in the following example URLs:

      http://[FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:80/index.html
      http://[1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A]/index.html
      http://[3ffe:2a00:100:7031::1]
      http://[1080::8:800:200C:417A]/foo
      http://[::192.9.5.5]/ipng
      http://[::FFFF:129.144.52.38]:80/index.html
      http://[2010:836B:4179::836B:4179]

   This document updates the generic syntax for Uniform Resource
   Identifiers defined in <a href="./rfc2396">RFC 2396</a> [<a href="#ref-URL" title='"Uniform Resource Identifiers: Generic Syntax"'>URL</a>].  It defines a syntax for IPv6
   addresses and allows the use of "[" and "]" within a URI explicitly
   for this reserved purpose.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2732">RFC 2732</a>            IPv6 Literal Addresses in URL's        December 1999</span>


   The following changes to the syntax in <a href="./rfc2396">RFC 2396</a> are made:
   (1) change the 'host' non-terminal to add an IPv6 option:

      host          = hostname | IPv4address | IPv6reference
      ipv6reference = "[" IPv6address "]"

   where IPv6address is defined as in <a href="./rfc2373">RFC2373</a> [<a href="#ref-ARCH" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>ARCH</a>].

   (2) Replace the definition of 'IPv4address' with that of <a href="./rfc2373">RFC 2373</a>, as
   it correctly defines an IPv4address as consisting of at most three
   decimal digits per segment.

   (3) Add "[" and "]" to the set of 'reserved' characters:

      reserved    = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&amp;" | "=" | "+" |
                    "$" | "," | "[" | "]"

   and remove them from the 'unwise' set:

      unwise      = "{" | "}" | "|" | "\" | "^" | "`"

   The use of this approach to represent literal IPv6 addresses in URL's
   does not introduce any known new security concerns.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. IANA Considerations</span>

   None.
