Abstract

   In conversational video applications, far-end camera control protocol
   is used by participants to control the remote camera.  The protocol
   that is commonly used is ITU H.281 over H.224.  The document
   registers the H224 media type.  It defines the syntax and the
   semantics of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) parameters needed
   to support far-end camera control protocol using H.224.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The document registers the H224 media type, which may be used by
   systems that use SDP [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>].

   This media type is used for supporting the simple far-end camera
   control protocol on SDP-based systems.  The media type helps
   signaling gateways between H.323 [<a href="#ref-ITU.H323" title='"Visual telephone systems and equipment for local area networks which provide a non-guaranteed quality of service"'>ITU.H323</a>] and SDP-based systems to
   use far-end camera control, end to end, without any protocol
   translation in the middle.

   The document defines the H224 media type since the RTP packets in
   H.323 annex Q [<a href="#ref-ITU.H323" title='"Visual telephone systems and equipment for local area networks which provide a non-guaranteed quality of service"'>ITU.H323</a>] carry H.224 frames [<a href="#ref-ITU.H224" title='"A real time control protocol for simplex applications using the H.221 LSD/HSD/HLP channels."'>ITU.H224</a>].  The far-end
   camera control protocol (FECC) is internal to the H.224 frame and is
   identified by the client ID field of the H.224 packet.

   The document will define the SDP [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] parameters needed to
   support the above far-end camera control protocol in systems that use
   SDP.

   This simple protocol is based on ITU-T H.281[ITU.281] frames carried
   in ITU-T H.224 packets in an RTP/UDP channel.  H.323 annex Q
   specifies how to build the RTP packets from the H.224 packets.

   Using far end camera control protocol in point-to-point calls and
   multipoint calls for packet-switch networks is described in H.323,
   annex Q.

   This section describes the media types and names associated with this

   Interoperability considerations:

      Terminals sending simple far-end camera control commands should

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:

      This media type depends on RTP framing and thus is only defined
      for transfer via RTP [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  Transport within other framing
      protocols is not defined at this time.

   The media type application/h224 string is mapped to fields in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) as follows:

      o The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be application.  The
      transport SHALL be any applicable RTP profile (for example <a href="./rfc3551">RFC</a>
      <a href="./rfc3551">3551</a> [<a href="./rfc3551" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>]), and the payload type is dynamic.

      o The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be h224
      (the MIME subtype).

      o The default clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 4800.

   The recommended maximum bandwidth for this protocol is 6.4 kbit/sec.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Usage%20with%20the%20SDP%20Offer%20Answer%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model</span>

   When offering FECC using SDP in an Offer/Answer model [<a href="./rfc3264" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>], the
   following considerations are necessary.

   Far-end camera control communication is uni-directional.  H.224 is
   bi-directional and can be used to learn the capabilities of the
   remote video end point, e.g., how many cameras it has.  The offer
   answer exchange is dependent on the functionality of both sides.

   The offerer offers a sendonly channel if its camera cannot be
   remotely controlled and if the offerer does not intend to use H.224
   to learn the capabilities of the remote video endpoints.

   In all other cases, when the offerer's camera can be remotely
   controlled and/or it intends to use H.224 capabilities negotiation,
   the offerer offers a sendrecv channel.

   The answerer behavior is as follows:

   If it receives an offer with sendonly, it answers with a recvonly if
   it supports far-end camera control; otherwise, it ignores/rejects the
   offer.

   If it receives an offer with sendrecv and its camera can be remotely
   controlled, or it intends to use H.224 capabilities negotiation, it
   answers with a sendrecv option.  If its camera cannot be remotely
   controlled, it can answer with a sendonly attribute.  The answerer
   may also reject the offer if he does not support FECC or does not
   intend to use FECC at the moment.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   H.224 payload format, defined in H.323, annex Q defines packet
   structure based on RTP using the RTP header structure from <a href="./rfc3550">RFC 3550</a>.
   Those packets are subject to the security considerations discussed in
   the RTP specification [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  This implies that confidentiality
   of the media streams is achieved by encryption.  Secure Realtime
   Transport Protocol (SRTP) [<a href="./rfc3711" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>] may be used to provide both
   encryption and integrity protection of RTP flow.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data that causes
   application behavior like camera movement.  The attacker can inject
   pathological datagrams into the stream that cause the receiver to
   change the camera position.  Therefore, the usage of data origin
   authentication and data integrity protection of at least the H.323
   annex Q packet is RECOMMENDED; for example, with SRTP.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to ensure confidentiality and
   integrity of H.323 annex Q packets and their payloads is very
   dependent on the application and on the transport and signaling
   protocols employed.  Thus, although SRTP is given as an example
   above, other possible choices exist.
