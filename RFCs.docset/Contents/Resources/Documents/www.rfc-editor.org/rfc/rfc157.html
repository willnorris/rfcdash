   One session of the Symposium on problems in the optimization of data
   communication networks is to be devoted to software for networks.  I
   believe that the work on protocols (1st, 2nd, and 3rd level) and file
   transmission procedures are highly relevant.  NWG participants should
   welcome the opportunity to inject their ideas into the published
   literature.  Many NWG/RFC's already are in good enough shape for
   publication so don't hesitate to submit your drafts.  Time is short,
   so prompt action is essential.

                              CALL FOR PAPERS
             SECOND SYMPOSIUM ON PROBLEMS IN THE OPTIMIZATION
                       OF DATA COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

   SIGCOMM of ACM and the Technical Committee on Commuter Communications
   of the IEEE Commuter Society are sponsoring the Second Symposium on
   Problems in the Optimization of Data Communication Systems to be held
   at Stanford University on October 20-22, 1971.  The symposium will
   include the presentation of papers, panel discussions, and workshop
   sessions.  The purpose is to bring together people engaged in
   computer communication system design, analysis, and research.  The
   setting will be one where each participant can engage in a dialogue
   on problems of interest to him with his colleagues in the computer/
   communications professional community.

Papers are being sought in the following areas:

   Advances in Data Communication Networks
   Computer Communication Technology
   New Applications and Applications Models
   Software Organization for Communications
   Systems Modeling, Evaluation, Optimization
   Interface Problems and Standards
