   Recognising that IP networks are growing beyond the LAN's in Europe,
   and are extending over national and international WAN's in Europe,
   the RIPE coordinating body has been created.  RIPE stands for the
   "Reseaux IP Europeens".

   The objective of RIPE is to ensure the necessary administrative and
   technical coordination to allow the operation and expansion of a
   pan-European IP network.

      o RIPE acts as a forum for the exchange of technical information
        and the creation of expertise on IP networking.

      o The area of relevance for RIPE is Europe.

      o All parties operating wide area IP networks are encouraged to
        participate.

      o RIPE promotes and coordinates interconnection of IP networks
        within Europe and to other continents.

      o RIPE establishes agreement on common network management
        practices and the operational management of the interconnected
        networks.

      o RIPE serves as a focal point for other common activities of the
        participants related to IP networking.

      o All documents produced by RIPE will be publicly available.

      o RIPE is not a network service provider.  IP networks
