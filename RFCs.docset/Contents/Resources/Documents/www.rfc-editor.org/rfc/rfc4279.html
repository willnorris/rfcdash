Abstract

   This document specifies three sets of new ciphersuites for the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support authentication
   based on pre-shared keys (PSKs).  These pre-shared keys are symmetric
   keys, shared in advance among the communicating parties.  The first
   set of ciphersuites uses only symmetric key operations for
   authentication.  The second set uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange
   authenticated with a pre-shared key, and the third set combines
   public key authentication of the server with pre-shared key
   authentication of the client.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Usually, TLS uses public key certificates [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] or Kerberos [<a href="#ref-KERB" title='"Addition of Kerberos Cipher Suites to Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>KERB</a>]
   for authentication.  This document describes how to use symmetric
   keys (later called pre-shared keys or PSKs), shared in advance among
   the communicating parties, to establish a TLS connection.

   There are basically two reasons why one might want to do this:

   o  First, using pre-shared keys can, depending on the ciphersuite,
      avoid the need for public key operations.  This is useful if TLS
      is used in performance-constrained environments with limited CPU
      power.

   o  Second, pre-shared keys may be more convenient from a key
      management point of view.  For instance, in closed environments
      where the connections are mostly configured manually in advance,
      it may be easier to configure a PSK than to use certificates.
      Another case is when the parties already have a mechanism for
      setting up a shared secret key, and that mechanism could be used
      to "bootstrap" a key for authenticating a TLS connection.

   This document specifies three sets of new ciphersuites for TLS.
   These ciphersuites use new key exchange algorithms, and reuse
   existing cipher and MAC algorithms from [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] and [<a href="#ref-AES" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>AES</a>].  A summary
   of these ciphersuites is shown below.

      TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA   RSA_PSK       AES_128_CBC   SHA
      TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA   RSA_PSK       AES_256_CBC   SHA

   The ciphersuites in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> (with PSK key exchange algorithm) use
   only symmetric key algorithms and are thus especially suitable for
   performance-constrained environments.

   The ciphersuites in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> (with DHE_PSK key exchange algorithm)
   use a PSK to authenticate a Diffie-Hellman exchange.  These
   ciphersuites protect against dictionary attacks by passive
   eavesdroppers (but not active attackers) and also provide Perfect
   Forward Secrecy (PFS).

   The ciphersuites in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> (with RSA_PSK key exchange algorithm)
   combine public-key-based authentication of the server (using RSA and
   certificates) with mutual authentication using a PSK.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Applicability%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Applicability Statement</span>

   The ciphersuites defined in this document are intended for a rather
   limited set of applications, usually involving only a very small
   number of clients and servers.  Even in such environments, other
   alternatives may be more appropriate.

   If the main goal is to avoid Public-Key Infrastructures (PKIs),
   another possibility worth considering is using self-signed
   certificates with public key fingerprints.  Instead of manually
   configuring a shared secret in, for instance, some configuration
   file, a fingerprint (hash) of the other party's public key (or
   certificate) could be placed there instead.

   It is also possible to use the SRP (Secure Remote Password)
   ciphersuites for shared secret authentication [<a href="#ref-SRP" title='"Using SRP for TLS Authentication"'>SRP</a>].  SRP was
   designed to be used with passwords, and it incorporates protection
   against dictionary attacks.  However, it is computationally more
   expensive than the PSK ciphersuites in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.

   This section defines the PSK key exchange algorithm and associated
   ciphersuites.  These ciphersuites use only symmetric key algorithms.

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the ordinary TLS
   handshake, shown below.  The elements in parenthesis are not included
   when the PSK key exchange algorithm is used, and "*" indicates a
   situation-dependent message that is not always sent.

   The client indicates its willingness to use pre-shared key
   authentication by including one or more PSK ciphersuites in the
   ClientHello message.  If the TLS server also wants to use pre-shared
   keys, it selects one of the PSK ciphersuites, places the selected
   ciphersuite in the ServerHello message, and includes an appropriate
   ServerKeyExchange message (see below).  The Certificate and
   CertificateRequest payloads are omitted from the response.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4279">RFC 4279</a>                PSK Ciphersuites for TLS           December 2005</span>


   Both clients and servers may have pre-shared keys with several
   different parties.  The client indicates which key to use by
   including a "PSK identity" in the ClientKeyExchange message (note
   that unlike in [<a href="#ref-SHAREDKEYS" title='"Use of Shared Keys in the TLS Protocol"'>SHAREDKEYS</a>], the session_id field in ClientHello
   message keeps its usual meaning).  To help the client in selecting
   which identity to use, the server can provide a "PSK identity hint"
   in the ServerKeyExchange message.  If no hint is provided, the
   ServerKeyExchange message is omitted.  See <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> for a more
   detailed description of these fields.

   The format of the ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange messages is
   shown below.

      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */
              case psk:  /* NEW */
                  opaque psk_identity_hint&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;
          };
      } ServerKeyExchange;

      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */
              case psk:   /* NEW */
                  opaque psk_identity&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;
          } exchange_keys;
      } ClientKeyExchange;

   The premaster secret is formed as follows: if the PSK is N octets
   long, concatenate a uint16 with the value N, N zero octets, a second
   uint16 with the value N, and the PSK itself.

      Note 1: All the ciphersuites in this document share the same
      general structure for the premaster secret, namely,

         struct {
             opaque other_secret&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;
             opaque psk&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;
         };

      Here "other_secret" either is zeroes (plain PSK case) or comes
      from the Diffie-Hellman or RSA exchange (DHE_PSK and RSA_PSK,
      respectively).  See Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a> and <a href="#section-4">4</a> for a more detailed
      description.

      Note 2: Using zeroes for "other_secret" effectively means that
      only the HMAC-SHA1 part (but not the HMAC-MD5 part) of the TLS PRF



<span class="grey">Eronen &amp; Tschofenig         Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4279">RFC 4279</a>                PSK Ciphersuites for TLS           December 2005</span>


      is used when constructing the master secret.  This was considered
      more elegant from an analytical viewpoint than, for instance,
      using the same key for both the HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA1 parts.  See
      [<a href="#ref-KRAWCZYK" title='"Re: TLS shared keys PRF"'>KRAWCZYK</a>] for a more detailed rationale.

   The TLS handshake is authenticated using the Finished messages as
   usual.

   If the server does not recognize the PSK identity, it MAY respond
   with an "unknown_psk_identity" alert message.  Alternatively, if the
   server wishes to hide the fact that the PSK identity was not known,
   it MAY continue the protocol as if the PSK identity existed but the
   key was incorrect: that is, respond with a "decrypt_error" alert.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20DHE_PSK%20Key%20Exchange%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  DHE_PSK Key Exchange Algorithm</span>

   This section defines additional ciphersuites that use a PSK to
   authenticate a Diffie-Hellman exchange.  These ciphersuites give some
   additional protection against dictionary attacks and also provide
   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).  See <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> for discussion of
   related security considerations.

   When these ciphersuites are used, the ServerKeyExchange and
   ClientKeyExchange messages also include the Diffie-Hellman
   parameters.  The PSK identity and identity hint fields have the same
   meaning as in the previous section (note that the ServerKeyExchange
   message is always sent, even if no PSK identity hint is provided).

   The format of the ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange messages is
   shown below.

      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */
              case diffie_hellman_psk:  /* NEW */
                  opaque psk_identity_hint&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;
                  ServerDHParams params;
          };
      } ServerKeyExchange;

      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */
              case diffie_hellman_psk:   /* NEW */
                  opaque psk_identity&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;
                  ClientDiffieHellmanPublic public;
          } exchange_keys;
      } ClientKeyExchange;

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4279">RFC 4279</a>                PSK Ciphersuites for TLS           December 2005</span>


   The premaster secret is formed as follows.  First, perform the
   Diffie-Hellman computation in the same way as for other
   Diffie-Hellman-based ciphersuites in [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>].  Let Z be the value
   produced by this computation (with leading zero bytes stripped as in
   other Diffie-Hellman-based ciphersuites).  Concatenate a uint16
   containing the length of Z (in octets), Z itself, a uint16 containing
   the length of the PSK (in octets), and the PSK itself.

   This corresponds to the general structure for the premaster secrets
   (see Note 1 in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) in this document, with "other_secret"
   containing Z.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20RSA_PSK%20Key%20Exchange%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  RSA_PSK Key Exchange Algorithm</span>

   The ciphersuites in this section use RSA and certificates to
   authenticate the server, in addition to using a PSK.

   As in normal RSA ciphersuites, the server must send a Certificate
   message.  The format of the ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange
   messages is shown below.  If no PSK identity hint is provided, the
   ServerKeyExchange message is omitted.

      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */
              case rsa_psk:  /* NEW */
                  opaque psk_identity_hint&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;
          };
      } ServerKeyExchange;

      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */
              case rsa_psk:   /* NEW */
                  opaque psk_identity&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;
                  EncryptedPreMasterSecret;
          } exchange_keys;
      } ClientKeyExchange;

   The EncryptedPreMasterSecret field sent from the client to the server
   contains a 2-byte version number and a 46-byte random value,
   encrypted using the server's RSA public key as described in <a href="#section-7.4.7.1">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-7.4.7.1">7.4.7.1</a> of [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>].  The actual premaster secret is formed by both
   parties as follows: concatenate a uint16 with the value 48, the
   2-byte version number and the 46-byte random value, a uint16
   containing the length of the PSK (in octets), and the PSK itself.
   (The premaster secret is thus 52 octets longer than the PSK.)

   This corresponds to the general structure for the premaster secrets
   (see Note 1 in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) in this document, with "other_secret"
   containing both the 2-byte version number and the 46-byte random
   value.

   Neither the normal RSA ciphersuites nor these RSA_PSK ciphersuites
   themselves specify what the certificates contain (in addition to the
   RSA public key), or how the certificates are to be validated.  In
   particular, it is possible to use the RSA_PSK ciphersuites with
   unvalidated self-signed certificates to provide somewhat similar

   It is expected that different types of identities are useful for
   different applications running over TLS.  This document does not
   therefore mandate the use of any particular type of identity (such as
   IPv4 address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)).

   However, the TLS client and server clearly have to agree on the
   identities and keys to be used.  To improve interoperability, this
   document places requirements on how the identity is encoded in the
   protocol, and what kinds of identities and keys implementations have
   to support.

   The requirements for implementations are divided into two categories,
   requirements for TLS implementations and management interfaces.  In
   this context, "TLS implementation" refers to a TLS library or module
   that is intended to be used for several different purposes, while
   "management interface" would typically be implemented by a particular
   application that uses TLS.

   This document does not specify how the server stores the keys and
   identities, or how exactly it finds the key corresponding to the
   identity it receives.  For instance, if the identity is a domain
   name, it might be appropriate to do a case-insensitive lookup.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that before looking up the key, the server processes the
   PSK identity with a stringprep profile [<a href="#ref-STRINGPREP" title='"Preparation of Internationalized Strings ("'>STRINGPREP</a>] appropriate for
   the identity in question (such as Nameprep [<a href="#ref-NAMEPREP" title='"Nameprep: A Stringprep Profile for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)"'>NAMEPREP</a>] for components
   of domain names or SASLprep for usernames [<a href="#ref-SASLPREP" title='"SASLprep: Stringprep Profile for User Names and Passwords"'>SASLPREP</a>]).

   The PSK identity MUST be first converted to a character string, and
   then encoded to octets using UTF-8 [<a href="#ref-UTF8" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>UTF8</a>].  For instance,

   o  IPv4 addresses are sent as dotted-decimal strings (e.g.,
      "192.0.2.1"), not as 32-bit integers in network byte order.

   o  Domain names are sent in their usual text form [<a href="#ref-DNS" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>DNS</a>] (e.g.,
      "www.example.com" or "embedded\.dot.example.net"), not in DNS
      protocol format.

   o  X.500 Distinguished Names are sent in their string representation
      [<a href="#ref-LDAPDN" title='"LDAP: String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>LDAPDN</a>], not as BER-encoded ASN.1.

   This encoding is clearly not optimal for many types of identities.
   It was chosen to avoid identity-type-specific parsing and encoding
   code in implementations where the identity is configured by a person
   using some kind of management interface.  Requiring such identity-
   type-specific code would also increase the chances for
   interoperability problems resulting from different implementations
   supporting different identity types.

   In the absence of an application profile specification specifying
   otherwise, servers SHOULD NOT provide an identity hint and clients
   MUST ignore the identity hint field.  Applications that do use this
   field MUST specify its contents, how the value is chosen by the TLS
   server, and what the TLS client is expected to do with the value.

   TLS implementations supporting these ciphersuites MUST support
   arbitrary PSK identities up to 128 octets in length, and arbitrary
   PSKs up to 64 octets in length.  Supporting longer identities and
   keys is RECOMMENDED.

   In the absence of an application profile specification specifying
   otherwise, a management interface for entering the PSK and/or PSK
   identity MUST support the following:

   o  Entering PSK identities consisting of up to 128 printable Unicode
      characters.  Supporting as wide a character repertoire and as long
      identities as feasible is RECOMMENDED.

   o  Entering PSKs up to 64 octets in length as ASCII strings and in
      hexadecimal encoding.

   IANA does not currently have a registry for TLS ciphersuite or alert
   numbers, so there are no IANA actions associated with this document.

   For easier reference in the future, the ciphersuite numbers defined
   in this document are summarized below.

      CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_RC4_128_SHA          = { 0x00, 0x8A };
      CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00, 0x8B };

      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x91 };
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_RC4_128_SHA      = { 0x00, 0x92 };
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA = { 0x00, 0x93 };

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x95 };

   This document also defines a new TLS alert message,
   unknown_psk_identity(115).

   As with all schemes involving shared keys, special care should be
   taken to protect the shared values and to limit their exposure over
   time.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.1.%20%20Perfect%20Forward%20Secrecy%20%28PFS%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" id="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)</span>

   The PSK and RSA_PSK ciphersuites defined in this document do not
   provide Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).  That is, if the shared secret
   key (in PSK ciphersuites), or both the shared secret key and the RSA
   private key (in RSA_PSK ciphersuites), is somehow compromised, an
   attacker can decrypt old conversations.

   The DHE_PSK ciphersuites provide Perfect Forward Secrecy if a fresh
   Diffie-Hellman private key is generated for each handshake.

   Use of a fixed shared secret of limited entropy (for example, a PSK
   that is relatively short, or was chosen by a human and thus may
   contain less entropy than its length would imply) may allow an
   attacker to perform a brute-force or dictionary attack to recover the
   secret.  This may be either an off-line attack (against a captured

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4279">RFC 4279</a>                PSK Ciphersuites for TLS           December 2005</span>


   TLS handshake messages) or an on-line attack where the attacker
   attempts to connect to the server and tries different keys.

   For the PSK ciphersuites, an attacker can get the information
   required for an off-line attack by eavesdropping on a TLS handshake,
   or by getting a valid client to attempt connection with the attacker
   (by tricking the client to connect to the wrong address, or by
   intercepting a connection attempt to the correct address, for
   instance).

   For the DHE_PSK ciphersuites, an attacker can obtain the information
   by getting a valid client to attempt connection with the attacker.
   Passive eavesdropping alone is not sufficient.

   For the RSA_PSK ciphersuites, only the server (authenticated using
   RSA and certificates) can obtain sufficient information for an
   off-line attack.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations that allow the administrator
   to manually configure the PSK also provide a functionality for
   generating a new random PSK, taking [<a href="#ref-RANDOMNESS" title='"Randomness Requirements for Security"'>RANDOMNESS</a>] into account.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.3.%20%20Identity%20Privacy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3" id="section-7.3">7.3</a>.  Identity Privacy</span>

   The PSK identity is sent in cleartext.  Although using a user name or
   other similar string as the PSK identity is the most straightforward
   option, it may lead to problems in some environments since an
   eavesdropper is able to identify the communicating parties.  Even
   when the identity does not reveal any information itself, reusing the
   same identity over time may eventually allow an attacker to perform
   traffic analysis to identify the parties.  It should be noted that
   this is no worse than client certificates, since they are also sent
   in cleartext.

   The implementation notes in [<a href="#ref-TLS11" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.1"'>TLS11</a>] about correct implementation and
   use of RSA (including <a href="#section-7.4.7.1">Section 7.4.7.1</a>) and Diffie-Hellman (including
   <a href="#appendix-F.1.1.3">Appendix F.1.1.3</a>) apply to the DHE_PSK and RSA_PSK ciphersuites as
   well.
