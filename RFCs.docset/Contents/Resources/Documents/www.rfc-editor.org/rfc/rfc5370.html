<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc5369">RFC 5369</a> [<a href="./rfc5369" title='"Framework for Transcoding with the Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC5369</a>] describes how two SIP [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] UAs (User Agents)
   can discover incompatibilities that prevent them from establishing a
   session (e.g., lack of support for a common codec or for a common
   media type).  When such incompatibilities are found, the UAs need to
   invoke transcoding services to successfully establish the session.
   The transcoding framework introduces two models to invoke transcoding
   services: the 3pcc (third-party call control) model [<a href="./rfc4117" title='"Transcoding Services Invocation in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Using Third Party Call Control (3pcc)"'>RFC4117</a>] and the
   conference bridge model.  This document specifies the conference
   bridge model.

   In the conference bridge model for transcoding invocation, a
   transcoding server that provides a particular transcoding service
   (e.g., speech-to-text) behaves as a B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent)
   between both UAs and is identified by a URI.  As shown in Figure 1,
   both UAs, A and B, exchange signalling and media with the transcoder
   T.  The UAs do not exchange any traffic (signalling or media)
   directly between them.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>], and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Caller%27s%20Invocation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Caller's Invocation</span>

   User agent A needs to perform two operations to invoke transcoding
   services from T for a session between user agent A and user agent B.
   User agent A needs to establish a session with T and provide T with
   user agent B's URI so that T can generate an INVITE towards user
   agent B.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Procedures%20at%20the%20User%20Agent"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Procedures at the User Agent</span>

   User agent A uses the procedures for <a href="./rfc5366">RFC 5366</a> [<a href="./rfc5366" title='"Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5366</a>] to provide T
   with B's URI using the same INVITE that establishes the session
   between A and T.  That is, user agent A adds to the INVITE a body
   part whose disposition type is recipient-list [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI- List Services"'>RFC5363</a>].  This body
   part consists of a URI-list that contains a single URI: user agent
   B's URI.

      Note that, as described in the transcoding framework [<a href="./rfc5369" title='"Framework for Transcoding with the Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC5369</a>],
      the transcoding model described in this document is modeled as a
      two-party conference server.  Consequently, this document focuses
      on two-party sessions that need transcoding.  Multi-party sessions
      can be established using INVITE requests with multiple URIs in
      their bodies, as specified in [<a href="./rfc5366" title='"Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5366</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Procedures%20at%20the%20Transcoder"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Procedures at the Transcoder</span>

   On receiving an INVITE with a URI-list body, the transcoder follows
   the procedures in [<a href="./rfc5366" title='"Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5366</a>] to generate an INVITE request towards the
   URI contained in the URI-list body.  Note that the transcoder acts as
   a B2BUA, not as a proxy.

   Additionally, the transcoder MUST generate the From header field of
   the outgoing INVITE request using the same value as the From header
   field included in the incoming INVITE request, subject to the privacy
   requirements (see [<a href="./rfc3323" title='"A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3323</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3325" title='"Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks"'>RFC3325</a>]) expressed in the incoming
   INVITE request.  Note that this does not apply to the "tag"
   parameter.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5370">RFC 5370</a>              Conference Transcoding Model          October 2008</span>


   The session description the transcoder includes in the outgoing
   INVITE request depends on the type of transcoding service that
   particular transcoder provides.  For example, a transcoder resolving
   audio codec incompatibilities would generate a session description
   listing the audio codecs the transcoder supports.

   When the transcoder receives a final response for the outgoing INVITE
   requests, it generates a new final response for the incoming INVITE
   request.  This new final response SHOULD have the same status code as
   the one received in the response for the outgoing INVITE request.

   If a transcoder receives an INVITE request with a URI-list with more
   than one URI, it SHOULD return a 488 (Max 1 URI allowed in URI-list)
   response.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Example</span>

   Figure 2 shows the message flow for the caller's invocation of a
   transcoder T.  The caller A sends an INVITE (1) to the transcoder (T)
   to establish the session A-T.  Following the procedures in [<a href="./rfc5366" title='"Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5366</a>],
   the caller A adds a body part whose disposition type is recipient-
   list [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI- List Services"'>RFC5363</a>].

   The following example shows an INVITE with two body parts: an SDP
   [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] session description and a URI-list.

   On receiving the INVITE, the transcoder generates a new INVITE
   towards the callee.  The transcoder acts as a B2BUA, not as a proxy.
   Therefore, this new INVITE (3) belongs to a different transaction
   than the INVITE (1) received by the transcoder.



<span class="grey">Camarillo                   Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5370">RFC 5370</a>              Conference Transcoding Model          October 2008</span>


   When the transcoder receives a final response (4) from the callee, it
   generates a new final response (6) for INVITE (1).  This new final
   response (6) has the same status code as the one received in the
   response from the callee (4).

   Figure 3 shows a similar message flow as the one in Figure 3.
   Nevertheless, this time the callee generates a non-2xx final response
   (4).  Consequently, the transcoder generates a non-2xx final response
   (6) towards the caller as well.

         Figure 3: Unsuccessful session establishment

   The ambiguity in this flow is that, if the provisional response (2)
   gets lost, the caller does not know whether the 603 (Decline)
   response means that the initial INVITE (1) was rejected by the
   transcoder or that the INVITE generated by the transcoder (4) was
   rejected by the callee.  The use of the "History-Info" header field
   [<a href="./rfc4244" title='"An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Request History Information"'>RFC4244</a>] between the transcoder and the caller resolves the previous
   ambiguity.

   Note that this ambiguity problem could also have been resolved by
   having transcoders act as a pure conference bridge.  The transcoder
   would respond with a 200 (OK) to the INVITE request from the caller,
   and it would generate an outgoing INVITE request towards the callee.
   The caller would get information about the result of the latter
   INVITE request by subscribing to the conference event package
   [<a href="./rfc4575" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State"'>RFC4575</a>] at the transcoder.  Although this flow would have resolved
   the ambiguity problem without requiring support for the "History-
   Info" header field, it is more complex, requires a higher number of
   messages, and introduces higher session setup delays.  That is why it
   was not chosen to implement transcoding services.

   If a UA receives an INVITE with a session description that is not
   acceptable, it can redirect it to the transcoder by using a 302
   (Moved Temporarily) response.  The Contact header field of the 302
   (Moved Temporarily) response contains the URI of the transcoder plus
   a "?body=" parameter.  This parameter contains a recipient-list body
   with B's URI.  Note that some escaping (e.g., for Carriage Returns
   and Line Feeds) is needed to encode a recipient-list body in such a
   parameter.  Figure 4 shows the message flow for this scenario.

       Figure 4: Callee's invocation of a transcoder

   Note that the syntax resulting from encoding a body into a URI as
   described earlier is quite complex.  It is actually simpler for
   callees to invoke transcoding services using the 3pcc transcoding
   model [<a href="./rfc4117" title='"Transcoding Services Invocation in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Using Third Party Call Control (3pcc)"'>RFC4117</a>] instead.

   Transcoders implementing this specification behave as a URI-list
   service as described in [<a href="./rfc5366" title='"Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5366</a>].  Therefore, the security
   considerations for URI-list services discussed in [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI- List Services"'>RFC5363</a>] apply
   here as well.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5370">RFC 5370</a>              Conference Transcoding Model          October 2008</span>


   In particular, the requirements related to list integrity and
   unsolicited requests are important for transcoding services.  User
   agents SHOULD integrity protect URI-lists using mechanisms such as
   S/MIME [<a href="./rfc3850" title='"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.1 Certificate Handling"'>RFC3850</a>] or TLS [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>], which can also provide URI-list
   confidentiality if needed.  Additionally, transcoders MUST
   authenticate and authorize users and MAY provide information about
   the identity of the original sender of the request in their outgoing
   requests by using the SIP identity mechanism [<a href="./rfc4474" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>].

   The requirement in [<a href="./rfc5363" title='"Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI- List Services"'>RFC5363</a>] to use opt-in lists (e.g., using <a href="./rfc5360">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc5360">5360</a> [<a href="./rfc5360" title='"A Framework for Consent-Based Communications in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5360</a>]) deserves special discussion.  The type of URI-list
   service implemented by transcoders following this specification does
   not produce amplification (only one INVITE request is generated by
   the transcoder on receiving an INVITE request from a user agent) and
   does not involve a translation to a URI that may be otherwise unknown
   to the caller (the caller places the callee's URI in the body of its
   initial INVITE request).  Additionally, the identity of the caller is
   present in the INVITE request generated by the transcoder.
   Therefore, there is no requirement for transcoders implementing this
   specification to use opt-in lists.
