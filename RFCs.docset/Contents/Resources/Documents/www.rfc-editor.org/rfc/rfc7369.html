Abstract

   The work related to GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) extended
   GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of Ethernet Label
   Switching Paths (LSPs).  IEEE Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management
   (CFM) specifies an adjunct Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance (OAM) flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks.
   CFM can also be used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and
   triggering recovery mechanisms.  The ITU-T Y.1731 specification
   builds on CFM and specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including
   Performance Monitoring, for Ethernet networks.  This document
   specifies extensions of the GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol to support the
   setup of the associated Ethernet OAM entities of Ethernet LSPs and
   defines the Ethernet technology-specific TLVs based on the GMPLS OAM
   Configuration Framework.  This document supports, but does not
   modify, the IEEE and ITU-T OAM mechanisms.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Background</span>

   Provider Backbone Bridging - Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE)
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE.802.1Q-2011">IEEE.802.1Q-2011</a>] decouples the Ethernet data and control planes and
   allows external control and management mechanisms to create
   explicitly routed Ethernet connections.  In addition, PBB-TE defines
   mechanisms for protection switching of bidirectional Ethernet
   connections.  Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) defines an
   adjunct connectivity-monitoring OAM flow to check the liveliness of
   Ethernet networks [<a href="#ref-IEEE.802.1Q-2011">IEEE.802.1Q-2011</a>], including the monitoring of
   specific explicitly routed Ethernet connections.  The ITU-T
   Recommendation Y.1731 [<a href="#ref-ITU-T.G.8013-2013">ITU-T.G.8013-2013</a>] extended CFM and specified
   additional OAM functionality.

   In the IETF, the work related to GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching
   (GELS) extended the GMPLS control plane to support the establishment
   of explicitly routed Ethernet connections [<a href="./rfc5828" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Ethernet Label Switching Architecture and Framework"'>RFC5828</a>] [<a href="./rfc6060" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Control of Ethernet Provider Backbone Traffic Engineering (PBB- TE)"'>RFC6060</a>].  We
   refer to GMPLS-established Ethernet connections as "Ethernet LSPs".
   GELS enables the application of MPLS-TE and GMPLS provisioning and
   recovery features in Ethernet networks.

   The use of GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment and
   configuration of OAM entities with LSP signaling is defined in a
   technology-agnostic way in [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>].  The purpose of this document
   is to specify the additional technology-specific OAM entities to
   support Ethernet connections.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Overview%20of%20Ethernet%20OAM%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Overview of Ethernet OAM Operation</span>

   For the purposes of this document, we only discuss Ethernet OAM
   aspects that are relevant for proactive connectivity monitoring of
   Ethernet LSPs and assume that on-demand OAM functions will be
   supported by management-plane operations.

   PBB-TE defines point-to-point Ethernet Switched Paths (ESPs) as a
   provisioned, traffic-engineered, unidirectional connectivity,
   identified by the 3-tuple [ESP-MAC DA, ESP-MAC SA, ESP-VID], where
   the ESP-MAC DA is the destination address of the ESP, the ESP-MAC SA
   is the source address of the ESP, and the ESP-VID is a VLAN
   identifier allocated for explicitly routed connections.  To form a
   bidirectional PBB-TE connection, two co-routed point-to-point ESPs
   are combined.  The combined ESPs must have the same ESP-MAC addresses



<span class="grey">Takacs, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7369">RFC 7369</a>         GMPLS-Based Ethernet OAM Configuration     October 2014</span>


   but may have different ESP-VIDs.  The formed co-routed bidirectional
   path is a path where the forward and backward directions follow the
   same route (links and nodes) across the network.

   Note that although it would be possible to use GMPLS to set up a
   single unidirectional ESP, the Ethernet OAM mechanisms are only fully
   functional when bidirectional connections are established with co-
   routed ESPs.  Therefore, the scope of this document only covers
   bidirectional point-to-point PBB-TE connections.

   At both ends of the bidirectional point-to-point PBB-TE connection,
   one Maintenance Entity Group End Point (MEP) is configured.  The MEPs
   monitoring a PBB-TE connection must be configured with the same
   Maintenance Domain Level (MD Level) and Maintenance Association
   Identifier (MAID).  Each MEP has a unique identifier, the MEP ID.
   Besides these identifiers, a MEP monitoring a PBB-TE connection must
   be provisioned with the 3-tuples [ESP-MAC DA, ESP-MAC SA, ESP-VID] of
   the two ESPs.

   In the case of point-to-point VLAN connections, the connection may be
   identified with a single VLAN or with two VLANs, one for each
   direction.  Therefore, instead of the 3-tuples of the PBB-TE ESPs,
   MEPs must be provisioned with the proper VLAN identifiers.

   MEPs exchange Connectivity Check Messages (CCMs) periodically with
   fixed intervals.  Eight distinct intervals are defined in
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE.802.1Q-2011">IEEE.802.1Q-2011</a>]:

   If three consecutive CCMs are lost, connectivity failure is declared.
   The MEP detecting the failure will signal the defect to the remote
   MEP in the subsequent CCMs it emits by setting the Remote Defect
   Indicator (RDI) bit in the CCM.  If a MEP receives a CCM with the RDI
   bit set, it immediately declares failure.  The detection of a failure
   may trigger protection switching mechanisms or may be signaled to a
   management system.

   At each transit node, Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points
   (MIPs) may be established to help failure localization, e.g., using
   link trace and loopback functions.  MIPs need to be provisioned with
   a subset of the MEP identification parameters described above.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20GMPLS%20RSVP-TE%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Operation%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Operation Overview</span>

   To simplify the configuration of connectivity monitoring, the
   associated MEPs should be automatically established when an Ethernet
   LSP is signaled.  To monitor an Ethernet LSP, a set of parameters
   must be provided to set up a Maintenance Association and related
   MEPs.  Optionally, MIPs may be created at the transit nodes of the
   Ethernet LSP.  The LSP Attribute Flags "OAM MEP entities desired" and
   "OAM MIP entities desired", as described in [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>], are used to
   signal that the respective OAM entities must be established.  An OAM
   Configuration TLV, as described in [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>], is added to the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects specifying that
   Ethernet OAM is to be set up for the LSP.  Information specific to
   Ethernet OAM, as described below, is carried in the new Ethernet OAM
   Configuration Sub-TLV (see <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>) within the OAM Configuration
   TLV.

   o  A unique MAID must be allocated for the PBB-TE connection, and
      both MEPs must be configured with the same information.  The MAID
      consists of an optional Maintenance Domain Name (MD Name) and a
      mandatory Short Maintenance Association Name (Short MA Name).
      Various formatting rules for these names have been defined in
      [<a href="#ref-IEEE.802.1Q-2011">IEEE.802.1Q-2011</a>].  Since this information is also carried in all
      CCMs, the combined length of the MD Name and Short MA Name is
      limited to 44 bytes (see [<a href="#ref-IEEE.802.1Q-2011">IEEE.802.1Q-2011</a>] for the details of the
      message format).  How these parameters are determined is out of
      the scope of this document.

   o  Each MEP must be provisioned with a MEP ID.  The MEP ID uniquely
      identifies a given MEP within a Maintenance Association.  That is,
      the combination of MAID and MEP ID must uniquely identify a MEP.
      How the value of the MEP ID is determined is out of the scope of
      this document.

   o  The Maintenance Domain Level (MD Level) allows hierarchical
      separation of monitoring entities.  [<a href="#ref-IEEE.802.1Q-2011">IEEE.802.1Q-2011</a>] allows
      differentiation of eight levels.  How the value of the MD Level is
      determined is out of the scope of this document.  Note that
      probably for all Ethernet LSPs, a single (default) MD Level will
      be used within a network domain.

   o  The desired CCM Interval must be specified by the management
      system based on service requirements or operator policy.  The same
      CCM Interval must be set in each of the MEPs monitoring a given
      Ethernet LSP.  How the value of the CCM Interval is determined is
      out of the scope of this document.

   o  The desired forwarding priority to be set by MEPs for the CCM
      frames may be specified.  The same CCM priority must be set in
      each of the MEPs monitoring a given Ethernet LSP.  How CCM
      priority is determined is out of the scope of this document.  Note
      that the highest priority should be used as the default CCM
      priority.

   o  MEPs must be aware of their own reachability parameters and those
      of the remote MEP.  In the case of bidirectional point-to-point
      PBB-TE connections, this requires that the 3-tuples [ESP-MAC A,
      ESP-MAC B, ESP-VID1] and [ESP-MAC B, ESP-MAC A, ESP-VID2] are
      configured in each MEP, where the ESP-MAC A is the same as the
      local MEP's Media Access Control (MAC) address and ESP-MAC B is
      the same as the remote MEP's MAC address.  The GMPLS Ethernet
      Label format, as defined in [<a href="./rfc6060" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Control of Ethernet Provider Backbone Traffic Engineering (PBB- TE)"'>RFC6060</a>], consists of the ESP-MAC DA
      and ESP-VID.  Hence, the necessary reachability parameters for the
      MEPs can be obtained from the Ethernet Labels (i.e., carried in
      the downstream and upstream labels).  In the case of point-to-
      point VLAN connections, MEPs need to be provisioned with the VLAN
      identifiers only, which can be derived similarly from the Ethernet
      Labels.

   Based on the procedures described in [<a href="./rfc6060" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Control of Ethernet Provider Backbone Traffic Engineering (PBB- TE)"'>RFC6060</a>] for bidirectional PBB-
   TE Ethernet LSP establishment, the Ethernet OAM configuration
   procedures are as follows.

   When the RSVP-TE signaling is initiated for the bidirectional
   Ethernet LSP, the local node generates a Path message and:

   o  Allocates an upstream label formed by combining its MAC address
      (ESP-MAC A) and locally selected VID (ESP-VID1), which will be
      used to receive traffic;

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7369">RFC 7369</a>         GMPLS-Based Ethernet OAM Configuration     October 2014</span>


   o  MUST include the OAM Configuration TLV with OAM Type set to
      Ethernet OAM in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
      objects;

   o  MUST include the OAM Function Flags Sub-TLV in the OAM
      Configuration TLV and set the OAM function flags as needed;

   o  MUST include an Ethernet OAM Configuration Sub-TLV in the OAM
      Configuration TLV that specifies the CCM Interval and MD Level;

   o  MAY add an MD Name Sub-TLV (optional) and MUST add a Short MA Name
      Sub-TLV (required) to the Ethernet OAM Configuration Sub-TLV,
      which will unambiguously identify a Maintenance Association for
      this specific PBB-TE connection.  Note that values for these
      parameters may be derived from the GMPLS LSP identification
      parameters; and

   o  MUST include a MEP ID Sub-TLV in the Ethernet OAM Configuration
      Sub-TLV and select two distinct integer values to identify the
      local and remote MEPs within the Maintenance Association created
      for monitoring of the point-to-point PBB-TE connection.

   Once the remote node receives the Path message, it can use the
   UPSTREAM_LABEL to extract the reachability information of the
   initiator.  Then, it allocates a Label by selecting a local MAC
   address (ESP-MAC B) and VID (ESP-VID2) that will be used to receive
   traffic.  These parameters determine the reachability information of
   the local MEP.  That is, the 3-tuples [ESP-MAC A, ESP-MAC B, ESP-
   VID1] and [ESP-MAC B, ESP-MAC A, ESP-VID2] are derived from the
   Ethernet Labels.  In addition, the information received in the
   Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV is used to configure the local MEP.

   Once the Resv message successfully arrives to the initiator, this end
   can extract the remote side's reachability information from the Label
   object and therefore has all the information needed to properly
   configure its local MEP.

     ------------      ------------------
         1               Ethernet OAM

   When the Ethernet OAM Type is requested, the receiving node should
   look for the corresponding technology-specific Ethernet OAM
   Configuration Sub-TLV.

   The Ethernet OAM Configuration Sub-TLV (depicted below) is defined
   for configuration parameters specific to Ethernet OAM.  The Ethernet
   OAM Configuration Sub-TLV, when used, MUST be carried in the OAM
   Configuration TLV.  This new sub-TLV accommodates Ethernet OAM
   information and carries sub-TLVs.

   Two flags are defined: Transmit (T) and Receive (R).  When T is set,
   the corresponding MEP MUST send OAM packets.  When R is set, the
   corresponding MEP MUST expect to receive OAM packets.  These flags
   are used to configure the role of MEPs.

   Length: Indicates the total length of the TLV, including padding and

   Prio: Indicates the priority to be set for CCM frames.  In Ethernet,
   3 bits carried in VLAN TAGs identify priority information.  Setting
   the priority is optional.  If the most significant bit is set to
   zero, the subsequent 3 priority bits will be ignored, and priority
   bits of the Ethernet CCM frame will be set based on default values

   CCM I (CCM Interval): MUST be set according to the 3-bit encoding
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE.802.1Q-2011">IEEE.802.1Q-2011</a>] shown in Table 1.  As a consequence, the most
   significant bit will be set to 0.  Four bits are allocated to support

   Ethernet OAM functions for Performance Monitoring (PM) allow
   measurements of different performance parameters including Frame Loss
   Ratio, Frame Delay, and Frame Delay Variation as defined in
   [<a href="#ref-ITU-T.G.8013-2013">ITU-T.G.8013-2013</a>].  Only a subset of PM functions are operated in a
   proactive fashion to monitor the performance of the connection
   continuously.  Proactive PM supports Fault Management functions by
   providing an indication of decreased service performance and
   therefore may provide triggers to initiate recovery procedures.

   While on-demand PM functions are, for the purposes of this document,
   always initiated by management commands, for proactive PM, it may be
   desirable to utilize the control plane for configuration and
   activation together with Fault Management functions such as the
   Continuity Check.

   [<a id="ref-ITU-T.G.8013-2013">ITU-T.G.8013-2013</a>] defines dual-ended Loss Measurement as proactive
   OAM for Performance Monitoring and as a PM function applicable to
   Fault Management.  For dual-ended Loss Measurement, each MEP
   piggybacks transmitted and received frame counters on CC messages to
   support and synchronize bidirectional Loss Measurements at the MEPs.
   Dual-ended Loss Measurement is supported by setting the Performance
   Monitoring/Loss OAM Function Flag and the Continuity Check Flag in
   the OAM Function Flags Sub-TLV [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>] and configuring the
   Continuity Check functionality by including the Ethernet OAM
   Configuration Sub-TLV.  No additional configuration is required for
   this type of Loss Measurement.

   IANA maintains an Error Code, "OAM Problem", in the "Error Codes and
   Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-Codes" sub-registry of the "Resource
   Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry.  [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>] defines
   a set of Error Value sub-codes for the "OAM Problem" Error Code.
   This document defines additional Error Value sub-codes for the "OAM
   Problem" Error Code as summarized below.

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues to
   those discussed in [<a href="./rfc7260" title='"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration"'>RFC7260</a>] and [<a href="./rfc6060" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Control of Ethernet Provider Backbone Traffic Engineering (PBB- TE)"'>RFC6060</a>].

   The signaling of OAM-related parameters and the automatic
   establishment of OAM entities based on RSVP-TE messages add a new
   aspect to the security considerations discussed in [<a href="./rfc3473" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions"'>RFC3473</a>].  In
   particular, a network element could be overloaded if a remote
   attacker targeted that element by sending frequent periodic messages
   requesting liveliness monitoring of a high number of LSPs.  Such an
   attack can efficiently be prevented when mechanisms for message
   integrity and node authentication are deployed.  Since the OAM
   configuration extensions rely on the hop-by-hop exchange of exiting
   RSVP-TE messages, procedures specified for RSVP message security in
   [<a href="./rfc2747" title='"RSVP Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC2747</a>] can be used to mitigate possible attacks.

   For a more comprehensive discussion of GMPLS security and attack
   mitigation techniques, please see "Security Framework for MPLS and
   GMPLS Networks" [<a href="./rfc5920" title='"Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS Networks"'>RFC5920</a>].
