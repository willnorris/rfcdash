     1.   If CCN refuses an ICP to a NETRJS socket, it means either that
          there is no free core within the NCP region, or that CCN's
          software is crashing.

     2.   Once ICP is completed, CCN might send the user one of the fol-
          lowing messages and close the Telnet connections:

          NRJ110I NETRJS PORTS BUSY.  TRY LATER

               This may be expected occasionally; frequent occurrance
               should be reported to CCN User Relations (825-7548), or
               to BELL@CCN.

          NRJ111I RJS NOT UP, TRY LATER

     3.   Normally, however, the user will receive a READY message:

               NRJ876R CCN NETRJS READY.  ENTER SIGNON

          If the user sends no operator input for 3 minutes, CCN will
          send:

               NRJ308R SIGNON TIMEOUT EXCEEDED

               NRJ205R NETRJS SESSION TERMINATED

          and close the Telnet connection.  If he sends an invalid SIG-
          NON command, he will receive the message:

               NRJ307R INVALID SIGNON, RE-ENTER

7          Finally, a valid signon will be acknowledged by RJS with the
          message:

               RJS750I TERMINAL -termid- HAS SIGNED ONTO RJS

     4.   If the user terminates the session by entering a SIGNOFF com-
          mand, NETRJS will wait until all data transfer has completed
          before sending the message:

               NRJ205R NETRJS SESSION TERMINATED

          and closing the Telnet connection.


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/B.%20%20REMOTE%20SITE%20OR%20NETWORK%20FAILURES"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B" id="appendix-B">B</a>.  <u>R</u><u>E</u><u>M</u><u>O</u><u>T</u><u>E</u> <u>S</u><u>I</u><u>T</u><u>E</u> <u>O</u><u>R</u> <u>N</u><u>E</u><u>T</u><u>W</u><u>O</u><u>R</u><u>K</u> <u>F</u><u>A</u><u>I</u><u>L</u><u>U</u><u>R</u><u>E</u><u>S</u></span>


     1.   During data transfer, the user must be reasonably responsive.
          If not, CCN will close the data transfer connection and send
          the remote operator message:

               NRJ504I DATA TRANSFER TIMEOUT FOR THE -device-, -termid-


                    a)   if -device- is PRINTER or PUNCH, user site
                         stopped accepting bits (sending "allocates")
                         for over 5 minutes.

                    b)   if -device- is READER, user site left reader
                         connection open without sending any bits for 5
                         minutes.

     2.   During data transfer on the CR connection, CCN may detect an
          incorrect header or record, presumably due to user site
          software or Network transmission error.  The following mes-
          sages beginning with the word "BAD" will follow an NRJ512I
          message containing the faulty header in hex:

               NRJ505I BAD HEADER SEQUENCE FOR NETRJS READER

                    Sequence number in transaction header does not match
                    internal counter of records passed.

               NRJ506I BAD HEADER LENGTH FOR NETRJS READER

                    Length given in header exceeds 880 bytes.

                                                                     P.3


7               NRJ507I BAD HEADER TYPE FOR NETRJS READER

                    Type code in header is not X'FF' (data) or X'FE'
                    (end-of-data)

               NRJ511I BAD FILL BIT COUNT FOR NETRJS READER

                    The filler bit count in header is not a multiple of
                    8.

     3.   If the header is correct but a data record is faulty, the fol-
          lowing message will be sent to a remote user:

               NRJ602I line STREAM ERROR - READER, -code-

                    A protocol error was detected in the READER stream.
                    CCN will close the stream and ready it to be reo-
                    pened so the remote user may retry the data transfer
                    operation.  The valid -code- values are:

     <u>C</u><u>O</u><u>D</u><u>E</u>            <u>E</u><u>R</u><u>R</u><u>O</u><u>R</u>

       1             Device id byte has high bit off.

       2             End of transaction in the middle of a data line.

       3             Truncated input line longer than 255 bytes.

       4             In compressed text, string control byte has high
                     bit off.

       5             In compressed text, duplicate blank string extends
                     line longer than 255 bytes.

       6             In compressed text, duplicate character string
                     extends line longer than 255 bytes.

       7             In compressed text, character string extends line
                     longer than 255 bytes.


     4.   Finally, if the user aborts his data transfer, he receives the
          message:

               NRJ502I NETRJS -device- DATA TRANSFER ABORTED BY USER
               -termid-.

7C.  <u>C</u><u>C</u><u>N</u> <u>F</u><u>A</u><u>I</u><u>L</u><u>U</u><u>R</u><u>E</u><u>S</u>


     1.   The CCN operator can cancel a NETRJS session, aborting any
          open data transfer streams and sending the message:

               NRJ204I NETRJS SESSION ABORTED BY CENTRAL OPERATOR, TERM=
               -termid-

     2.   Any of the following messages indicate a serious CCN Network
          software problem, and will cause the session to be aborted:

               NRJ106A NETRJS DEAD - EXCHANGE INOPERATIVE

               NRJ201A NETRJS DT SOCKET ERROR - BAD LISTEN

               NRJ208A NETRJS PROGRAM CHECK IN -device-, code=ccc

               NRJ209A NETRJS LOAD FAILED FOR -device-, code=xx

               NRJ304I RJS LINE HANDLER DEAD

               NRJ401I RJS LINE HANDLER DEAD

               NRJ402I RJS LINE HANDLER DEAD

          Any of these should be reported to CCN.

     3.   Besides global catastrophes like these above, the user might
          encounter a failure of a particular data transfer process.
          These do not terminate the session, only cause the data con-
          nection to be refused or terminated; the user can try again to
          open the data connection.  Repeated failure should be reported
          to CCN.

               NRJ501I NO CORE FOR DATA TRANSFER BUFFER -device-

               NRJ503I NO CORE FOR DATA TRANSFER WORKAREA -device-

               NRJ207I NO CORE FOR-device-DATA TRANSFER MODULE

                    Due to core memory limitations in CCN's NCP,
                    -device- cannot be started now.  The data transfer
                    connection indicated by -device- will be refused.
                    This may happen occasionally during active periods,
                    but repeated occurrences should be reported to CCN.

                    CCN data transfer failed, but recovery may be possi-
                    ble.  User may try again.
