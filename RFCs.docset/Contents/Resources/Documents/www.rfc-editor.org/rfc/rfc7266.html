<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20MOS%20Metrics%20Report%20Block"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  MOS Metrics Report Block</span>

   This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on media quality using one of
   several standard metrics (e.g., mean opinion score (MOS)).

   The metrics belong to the class of application-level metrics defined
   in [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  <a href="./rfc3611">RFC 3611</a>
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].

   The Performance Metrics Framework [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures document [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>] provides guidelines for
   reporting block format using RTCP XR.  The XR block type described in
   this document is in accordance with the guidelines in [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.4.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" id="section-1.4">1.4</a>.  Applicability</span>

   The MOS Metrics Report Block can be used in any application of RTP
   for which QoE (Quality-of-Experience) measurement algorithms are
   defined.

   The factors that affect real-time audio/video application quality can
   be split into two categories.  The first category consists of
   transport-specific factors such as packet loss, delay, and jitter
   (which also translates into losses in the playback buffer).  The
   factors in the second category consists of content- and codec-related
   factors such as codec type and loss recovery technique, coding bit
   rate, packetization scheme, and content characteristics

   Transport-specific factors may be insufficient to infer real-time
   media quality as codec related parameters and the interaction between
   transport problems and application-layer protocols can have a
   substantial effect on observed media quality.  Media quality may be
   measured using algorithms that directly compare input and output

   media streams, or it may be estimated using algorithms that model the
   interaction between media quality, protocol, and encoded content.
   Media quality is commonly expressed in terms of MOS; however, it is
   also represented by a range of indexes and other scores.

   The measurement of media quality has a number of applications:

   o  Detecting problems with media delivery or encoding that is
      impacting user-perceived quality.

   o  Tuning the content encoder algorithm to satisfy real-time data
      quality requirements.

   o  Determining which system techniques to use in a given situation
      and when to switch from one technique to another as system
      parameters change (for example, as discussed in [<a href="#ref-G.1082" title='"Measurement-based methods for improving the robustness of IPTV performance"'>G.1082</a>]).

   o  Prequalifying a network to assess its ability to deliver an
      acceptable end-user-perceived quality level.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   Notable terminology used is the following.

      Numeric formats X:Y

         where X the number of bits prior to the decimal place and Y the
         number of bits after the decimal place.

         Hence, 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0 to
         255.996 with a granularity of 0.0039. 0:16 represents a proper
         binary fraction with range 0.0 to 1 - 1/65536 = 0.9999847,
         though note that use of flag values at the top of the numeric
         range slightly reduces this upper limit.  For example, if the
         16-bit values 0XFFFE and 0XFFFF are used as flags for "over-
         range" and "unavailable" conditions, a 0:16 quantity has range
         0.0 to 1 - 3/65536 = 0.9999542.

      Calculation Algorithm

         Calculation Algorithm is used in this document to mean the MOS
         or QoE estimation algorithm.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7266">RFC 7266</a>                RTCP XR MOS Report Blocks              June 2014</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20MOS%20Metrics%20Block"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  MOS Metrics Block</span>

   A multimedia application MOS Metric is commonly expressed as a MOS.
   The MOS is usually on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5 represents
   excellent and 1 represents unacceptable; however, it can use other
   ranges (for example, 0 to 10 ).  The term "MOS" originates from
   subjective testing and is used to refer to the mean of a number of
   individual opinion scores.  Therefore, there is a well-understood
   relationship between MOS and user experience; hence, the industry
   commonly uses MOS as the scale for objective test results.
   Subjective tests can be used for measuring live network traffic;
   however, the use of objective or algorithmic measurement techniques
   allows much larger scale measurements to be made.  Within the scope
   of this document, mean opinion scores are obtained using objective or
   estimation algorithms.  ITU-T or ITU-R recommendations (e.g.,
   [<a href="#ref-BS.1387-1" title='"Method for objective measurements of perceived audio quality"'>BS.1387-1</a>], [<a href="#ref-G.107" title='"The E Model, a computational model for use in transmission planning"'>G.107</a>], [<a href="#ref-G.107.1" title='"Wideband E-model"'>G.107.1</a>], [<a href="#ref-P.862" title='"Perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ): An objective method for end-to-end speech quality assessment of narrow-band telephone networks and speech codecs"'>P.862</a>], [<a href="#ref-P.862.1" title='"Mapping function for transforming P.862 raw result scores to MOS-LQO"'>P.862.1</a>], [<a href="#ref-P.862.2" title='"Wideband extension to Recommendation P.862 for the assessment of wideband telephone networks and speech codecs"'>P.862.2</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-P.863" title='"Perceptual objective listening quality assessment"'>P.863</a>], [<a href="#ref-P.564" title='"Conformance testing for narrowband Voice over IP transmission quality assessment models"'>P.564</a>], [<a href="#ref-G.1082" title='"Measurement-based methods for improving the robustness of IPTV performance"'>G.1082</a>], [<a href="#ref-P.1201.1" title='"Parametric non-intrusive assessment of audiovisual media streaming quality - Lower resolution application area"'>P.1201.1</a>], [<a href="#ref-P.1201.2" title='"Parametric non-intrusive assessment of audiovisual media streaming quality - Higher resolution application area"'>P.1201.2</a>], [<a href="#ref-P.1202.1" title='"Parametric non-intrusive bitstream assessment of video media streaming quality - Lower resolution application area"'>P.1202.1</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-P.1202.2" title='"Parametric non-intrusive bitstream assessment of video media streaming quality - Higher resolution application area"'>P.1202.2</a>]) define methodologies for assessment of the performance of
   audio and video streams.  Other international and national standards
   organizations such as EBU, ETSI, IEC, and IEEE also define QoE
   algorithms and methodologies, and the intent of this document is not
   to restrict its use to ITU recommendations but to suggest that ITU
   recommendations be used where they are defined.

   This block reports the media quality in the form of a MOS range
   (e.g., 1-5, 0-10, or 0-100, as specified by the calculation
   algorithm); however, it does not report the MOS that includes
   parameters outside the scope of the RTP stream, for example,
   signaling performance, mean time to repair (MTTR), or other factors
   that may affect the overall user experience.

   The MOS Metric reported in this block gives a numerical indication of
   the perceived quality of the received media stream, which is
   typically measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances
   of this Metrics Block refer by synchronization source (SSRC) to the
   separate auxiliary Measurement Information block [<a href="./rfc6776" title='"Measurement Identity and Information Reporting Using a Source Description (SDES) Item and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block"'>RFC6776</a>] which
   describes measurement periods in use (see <a href="./rfc6776#section-4.2">RFC 6776, SectionÂ 4.2</a>).

   This Metrics Block relies on the measurement period in the
   Measurement Information block indicating the span of the report.
   Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   Measurement Information block.  Receivers MUST verify that the
   measurement period is received in the same compound RTCP packet as
   this Metrics Block.  If not, this Metrics Block MUST be discarded.

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The MOS Metrics Block is identified by the constant 29.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the MOS Metrics are
      Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>]:

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
               most recent measurement interval duration between
               successive metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
               accumulation period characteristic of cumulative
               measurements.

         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
               instantaneous value.

         I=00: Reserved

      In this document, MOS Metrics MAY be reported for intervals or for
      the duration of the media stream (cumulative).  The value I=01,
      indicating a sampled value, MUST NOT be sent and MUST be discarded
      when received.

   Reserved: 6 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      ignored by the receiver (see <a href="./rfc6709#section-4.2">RFC 6709, SectionÂ 4.2</a>).

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the MOS Metrics Block, the block length is variable length.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in <a href="./rfc3611#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of [RFC3611]</a>.

   Segment i: 32 bits

      There are two segment types defined in this document: single-
      channel audio/video per SSRC segment and multi-channel audio per
      SSRC segment.  Multi-channel audio per SSRC segment is used to
      deal with the case where multi-channel audio streams are carried
      in one RTP stream while a single-channel audio/video per SSRC
      segment is used to deal with the case where each media stream is
      identified by SSRC and sent in separate RTP streams.  The leftmost
      bit of the segment determines its type.  If the leftmost bit of
      the segment is zero, then it is a single-channel segment.  If the
      leftmost bit is one, then it is a multi-channel audio segment.
      Note that two segment types cannot be present in the same metric
      block.

   Segment Type (S): 1 bit

      This field is used to identify the segment type used in this
      report block.  A zero identifies this as a single-channel
      audio/video per SSRC segment.  Single channel means there is only
      one media stream carried in one RTP stream.  The single-channel
      audio/video per SSRC segment can be used to report the MOS value
      associated with the media stream identified by SSRC.  If there are
      multiple media streams and they want to use the single-channel
      audio/video per SSRC segment to report the MOS value, they should
      be carried in the separate RTP streams with each identified by
      different SSRC.  In this case, multiple MOS Metrics Blocks are

      required to report the MOS value corresponding to each media
      stream using single-channel audio/video per SSRC segment in the
      same RTCP XR packet.

   Calculation Algorithm ID (CAID) : 8 bits

      The 8-bit CAID is the session specific reference to the
      calculation algorithm and associated qualifiers indicated in SDP
      (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>) and used to compute the MOS score for this
      segment.

   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits

      MOS Metrics reporting depends on the payload format in use.  This
      field identifies the RTP payload type in use during the reporting
      interval.  The binding between RTP payload types and RTP payload
      formats is configured via a signaling protocol, for example, an
      SDP offer/answer exchange.  If the RTP payload type used is
      changed during an RTP session, separate reports SHOULD be sent for
      each RTP payload type, with corresponding measurement information
      blocks indicating the time period to which they relate.

      Note that the use of this Report Block with MPEG Transport streams
      carried over RTP is undefined as each MPEG Transport stream may
      use distinct audio or video codecs and the indication of the
      encoding of these is within the MPEG Transport stream and does not
      use RTP payloads.

   MOS Value: 16 bits

      The estimated mean opinion score (MOS) for multimedia application
      performance is estimated using an algorithm that includes the
      impact of delay, loss, jitter and other impairments that affect
      media quality.  This is an unsigned fixed-point 7:9 value
      representing the MOS, allowing the MOS score up to 127 in the
      integer part.  MOS ranges are defined as part of the specification
      of the MOS estimation algorithm (Calculation Algorithm in this
      document), and are normally ranges like 1-5, 0-10, or 0-100.  Two
      values are reserved: a value of 0xFFFE indicates that the
      measurement is out of range and a value of 0xFFFF indicates that
      the measurement is unavailable.  Values outside of the range
      defined by the Calculation Algorithm, other than the two reserved
      values, MUST NOT be sent and MUST be ignored by the receiving
      system.

   Segment Type (S): 1 bit

      This field is used to identify the segment type used in this
      report block.  A one identifies this as a multi-channel audio
      segment.

   Calculation Algorithm ID (CAID) : 8 bits

      The 8-bit CAID is the session specific reference to the
      calculation algorithm and associated qualifiers indicated in SDP
      (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>) and used to compute the MOS score for this
      segment.

   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits

      As defined in <a href="#section-3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a> of this document

   Channel Identifier (CHID): 3 bits

      If multiple channels of audio are carried in one RTP stream, each
      channel of audio will be viewed as an independent channel (e.g.,
      left channel audio, right channel audio).  This field is used to
      identify each channel carried in the same media stream.  The
      default channel mapping follows static ordering rule described in
      <a href="./rfc3551#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of [RFC3551]</a>.  However, there are some payload formats
      that use different channel mappings, e.g., AC-3 audio over RTP
      [<a href="./rfc4184" title='"RTP Payload Format for AC-3 Audio"'>RFC4184</a>] only follow AC-3 channel order scheme defined in [<a href="#ref-ATSC" title='"Digital Audio Compression Standard (AC-3, E-AC-3) Revision B"'>ATSC</a>].
      Enhanced AC-3 audio over RTP [<a href="./rfc4598" title='"Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload Format for Enhanced AC-3 (E-AC-3) Audio"'>RFC4598</a>] uses a dynamic channel
      transform mechanism.  In order for the appropriate channel mapping
      to be determined, MOS metrics reports need to be tied to an RTP
      payload format.  The reports should include the payload type of
      the reported media according to [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>], so that it can be used
      to determine the appropriate channel mapping.

   MOS Value: 13 bits

      The estimated MOS for multimedia application performance is
      defined as including the effects of delay, loss, discard, jitter
      and other effects that would affect media quality.  This is an
      unsigned fixed-point 7:6 value representing the MOS, allowing the
      MOS score up to 127 in the integer part.  MOS ranges are defined
      as part of the specification of the MOS estimation algorithm

   The mapping MUST be provided per media stream (in the media-level
   section(s) of SDP, i.e., after an "m=" line).

   The syntax element "mosref" is referred to the media resolution
   relative reference and has three values 'l','m','h'. (e.g.,
   narrowband (3.4 kHz) speech and Standard Definition (SD) or lower
   resolution video have 'l' resolution, super-wideband (&gt;14 kHz) speech
   or higher and High Definition (HD) or higher resolution video have
   'h' resolution, wideband speech (7 kHz) and video with resolution
   between SD and HD has 'm' resolution).  The MOS reported in the MOS
   metrics block might vary with the MOS reference; for example, MOS
   values for narrowband, wideband, super-wideband codecs occupy the
   same range but SHOULD be reported in different value.  For video
   application, MOS scores for SD resolution, HD resolution video also
   occupy the same ranges and SHOULD be reported in different value.

   When SDP is used in offer/answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>] applies.  In the offer/answer context, the
   signaling described above might be used in three ways:

   o  asymmetric behavior (segment extensions sent in only one
      direction),

   o  the offer of mutually exclusive alternatives, or

   o  the offer of more segments than can be sent in a single session.

   A direction attribute MAY be included in a "calgextmap"; without it,
   the direction implicitly inherits, of course, from the RTCP stream
   direction.

   Segment extensions, with their directions, MAY be signaled for an
   "inactive" stream.  An extension direction MUST be compatible with
   the stream direction.  If a segment extension in the SDP offer is
   marked as "sendonly" and the answerer desires to receive it, the
   extension MUST be marked as "recvonly" in the SDP answer.  An
   answerer that has no desire to receive the extension or does not
   understand the extension SHOULD NOT include it in the SDP answer.

   If a segment extension is marked as "recvonly" in the SDP offer and
   the answerer desires to send it, the extension MUST be marked as
   "sendonly" in the SDP answer.  An answerer that has no desire to, or
   is unable to, send the extension SHOULD NOT include it in the SDP
   answer.

   If a segment extension is offered as "sendrecv", explicitly or
   implicitly, and asymmetric behavior is desired, the SDP MAY be
   modified to modify or add direction qualifiers for that segment
   extension.

   A "mosref" attribute and "MOS Type" attribute MAY be included in a
   calgextmap; if not present, the "mosref" and "MOS Type" MUST be as
   defined in the QoE estimation algorithm referenced by the name
   attribute (e.g., P.1201.1 [<a href="#ref-P.1201.1" title='"Parametric non-intrusive assessment of audiovisual media streaming quality - Lower resolution application area"'>P.1201.1</a>] indicates lower resolution used
   while P.1201.2 [<a href="#ref-P.1201.2" title='"Parametric non-intrusive assessment of audiovisual media streaming quality - Higher resolution application area"'>P.1201.2</a>] indicates higher resolution used) or
   payload type carried in the segment extension (e.g., EVRC-WB
   [<a href="./rfc5188" title='"RTP Payload Format for the Enhanced Variable Rate Wideband Codec (EVRC-WB) and the Media Subtype Updates for EVRC-B Codec"'>RFC5188</a>] indicates using Wideband Codec).  However, not all payload
   types or MOS algorithm names indicate resolution to be used and MOS
   type to be used.  If an answerer receives an offer with a "mosref"
   attribute value it doesn't support (e.g.,the answerer only supports
   "l" and receives "h" from offerer), the answer SHOULD reject the
   mosref attribute value offered by the offerer.

   If the answerer wishes to reject a "mosref" attribute offered by the
   offerer, it sets identifiers associated with segment extensions in
   the answer to the value in the range 4096-4351.  The rejected answer
   MUST contain a "mosref" attribute whose value is the value of the SDP
   offer.

   Local identifiers in the valid range (inclusive) in an offer or
   answer must not be used more than once per media section.  A session
   update MAY change the direction qualifiers of segment extensions
   under use.  A session update MAY add or remove segment extension(s).
   Identifier values in the valid range MUST NOT be altered (remapped).

   If a party wishes to offer mutually exclusive alternatives, then
   multiple segment extensions with the same identifier in the
   (unusable) range 4096-4351 MAY be offered; the answerer SHOULD select
   at most one of the offered extensions with the same identifier, and
   remap it to a free identifier in the valid range for that extension
   to be usable.  Note that the two segment types defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>
   are also exclusive alternatives.

   If more segment extensions are offered in the valid range, the
   answerer SHOULD choose those that are desired and place the offered
   identifier value "as is" in the SDP answer.

   Similarly, if more segment extensions are offered than can be fit in
   the valid range, identifiers in the range 4096-4351 MAY be offered;
   the answerer SHOULD choose those that are desired and remap them to a
   free identifier in the valid range.

   Note that the range 4096-4351 for these negotiation identifiers is

   This document creates a new registry called "RTCP XR MOS Metric block
   - multimedia application Calculation Algorithm" as a subregistry of
   the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type
   Registry".  This registry applies to the multimedia session where
   each type of medium is sent in a separate RTP stream and also applies
   to the session where multi-channel audios are carried in one RTP
   stream.  Policies for this new registry are as follows:

   o  The information required to support this assignment is an
      unambiguous definition of the new metric, covering the base
      measurements and how they are processed to generate the reported
      metric.

   o  The review process for the registry is "Specification Required" as
      described in <a href="./rfc5226#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of [RFC5226]</a>.

   o  Entries in the registry are identified by entry name and mapped to
      the local identifier (CAID) in the segment extension defined in
      <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.

   o  Registration Template

      The following information must be provided with each registration:

      *  Name: A string uniquely and unambiguously identifying the
         calculation algorithm for use in protocols.
