                        <span class="h1">LINK NUMBER ASSIGNMENTS</span>

     Today Steve Crocker asked me to announce that from now on link
numbers 2-71 (decimal), inclusive, are to be valid for use in
connections.  Accordingly, the Host-Host Protocol Document, which I am
currently writing, will contain the following "declarative
specification".

     Links are assigned as follows:

     Link Number         Assignment

     0                   Control link
     2-71                Available for connections
     1, 72-190           Reserved-not for current use
     191                 To be used only for measurement
                         work under the direction of the
                         Network Measurement Center at UCLA
     192-255             Available for private experimental use
