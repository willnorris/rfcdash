   This document defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   Namespace Identifier (NID) for Ad-IDs.

   Ad-ID is the industry standard for identifying advertising assets
   across all media platforms (e.g., over the air, online, over the top,
   mobile, and place based).  Ad-IDs are unique codes for each creative
   advertising asset.  Those unique codes are applied to all media.

   Ad-IDs are an eleven-character ASCII string except for High
   Definition (HD) or Three-Dimensional (3D) codes, which have an H or D
   as the 12th character.

   Ad-ID also provides descriptive metadata about the advertisement.
   The metadata includes the advertiser, brand, product, commercial
   title, product categorization, and other essential data about the
   advertisement.  The metadata can be retrieved using the unique code.

   See <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> for additional background information.

   Using the template in [<a href="./rfc3406" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms"'>RFC3406</a>], the namespace definition is as
   follows:

   Namespace ID:

      adid

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization:
         Advertising Digital Identification, LLC

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The identifier structure is an Ad-ID that consists of a unique
      eleven-character string or a unique twelve-character string (video
      codes only).

      This string is divided into three parts:

      1. A four-character alphanumeric Company Prefix, not starting with
         "0"
      2. A seven-character alphanumeric code
      3. An optional one-character Video Format Identifier.
            H - High Definition
            D - Three-Dimensional

      The URN representation URN-ADID of an Ad-ID conforms to the
      following syntax (expressed using ABNF [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>]):

         URN-ADID = "urn:adid:" full-adid-identifier
         full-adid-identifier =
            full-adid-prefix full-adid-code [full-adid-suffix]
         full-adid-prefix = (ALPHA / %x31-39) 3*alphanum
         full-adid-code = 7*alphanum
         full-adid-suffix = "H" / "D"
         alphanum = ALPHA / DIGIT

      Examples:

         Standard Definition: urn:adid:ABCD0001000
         High Definition:     urn:adid:ABCD0001000H

      representations.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The Registrar (Advertising Digital Identification, LLC) is
      responsible for managing the assignment of the Ad-ID and shall
      ensure its uniqueness by checking the identifier against the list
      of existing identifiers.  In addition, each Ad-ID is associated
      with a its own unique URN-ADID.

      Ad-ID Registrar has assigned "adid" as a unique identifier.  It is
      associated with a single URN-ADID.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      The assignment process guarantees that 'adids' will not be
      reassigned or reused, and the binding between the identifier and
      its resource is permanent.

      These rules apply to this URN namespace.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Ad-IDs are generated by the Ad-ID's proprietary registration
      procedures.

   Process for identifier resolution:

      Ad-ID URNs are resolved via URN resolvers that are maintained by
      the Ad-ID.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      Lexical equivalence of URN-ADID is defined by case-insensitive
      string match.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      As specified above, the syntax of URN-ADID is a subset of the URN
      syntax specified in [<a href="./rfc2141" title='"URN Syntax"'>RFC2141</a>].

   Validation mechanism:

      The validity of a URN-ADID can be checked using Ad-ID's web
      services.  For more information on Ad-ID's web services, please
      refer to the following links:

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8107">RFC 8107</a>             Ad-ID URN Namespace Definition           March 2017</span>


   Scope:

      Ad-IDs are centrally registered, globally unique identifiers of
      advertising assets that are used worldwide.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Namespace%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Namespace Considerations</span>

   Ad-IDs are intended for use in Internet applications, where URNs are
   routinely used to identify audiovisual resources.  There is no direct
   mapping from Ad-IDs to existing URN namespaces.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Community%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Community Considerations</span>

   The primary registrants of Ad-IDs are advertisers and agencies.  Ad-
   IDs can be used by anyone to unambiguously identify advertising
   assets and retrieve underlying metadata.  The primary benefits of its
   use are providing greater transparency and accountability in the
   advertising marketplace, helping to eliminate costly errors
   associated with the inconsistent use of advertising-asset identifiers
   throughout the advertising supply chain, and enabling a more granular
   audience measurement across multiple platforms.

   This document specifies the syntax of the Ad-ID URN namespace and
   makes no security representations.  However, note that failure to
   conform to the syntactic and lexical equivalence rules specified in
   [<a href="./rfc3406" title='"Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms"'>RFC3406</a>] when using an Ad-ID as a criterion for accessing restricted
   resources can result in granting unauthorized access.

   registry.

   Ad-IDs are an eleven-character ASCII string except for High
   Definition (HD) or Three-Dimensional (3D) codes, which have an H or D
   as the 12th character.

   Ad-ID may have Complimentary Definition Codes (CDCs), which are
   matching SD, HD, and/or 3D codes where only the 12th character of the
   code varies.  This only applies to video codes.

   For example, a video with a standard format and high-definition
   format would have a single code for each format.

      Standard: ABCD1234000
      High Definition: ABCD1234000H
