<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   As of this writing, the BGP Path Attributes registry maintained by
   IANA contains entries for DPA, ADVERTISER, and RCID_PATH /
   CLUSTER_ID.  The first of these is associated with [<a href="#ref-BGPDPA" title='"Destination Preference Attribute for BGP"'>BGPDPA</a>], an
   Internet-Draft that was abandoned in 1996.  The latter are associated
   with [<a href="./rfc1863" title='"A BGP/IDRP Route Server alternative to a full mesh routing"'>RFC1863</a>], an RFC that was reclassified as Historic by [<a href="./rfc4223" title='"Reclassification of RFC 1863 to Historic"'>RFC4223</a>]
   in 2005.  Neither specification is currently in use, nor have they
   ever been.

   Note that the deprecated CLUSTER_ID is distinct from CLUSTER_LIST
   [<a href="./rfc4456" title='"BGP Route Reflection: An Alternative to Full Mesh Internal BGP (IBGP)"'>RFC4456</a>].  CLUSTER_LIST is not being deprecated.

   Per this document, IANA has marked the BGP Path Attributes registry
   entries for DPA (Value 11), ADVERTISER (Value 12), and RCID_PATH /
   CLUSTER_ID (Value 13) as "deprecated".

   There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
   registry update.
