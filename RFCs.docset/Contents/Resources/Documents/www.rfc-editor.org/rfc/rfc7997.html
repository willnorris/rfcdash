                <span class="h1">The Use of Non-ASCII Characters in RFCs</span>

Abstract

   In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more
   diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for
   the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the
   required language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will be
   in UTF-8, allowing for a broader range of characters than typically
   used in the English language.  This document describes the RFC Editor
   requirements and gives guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII
   characters in RFCs.

   This document updates <a href="./rfc7322">RFC 7322</a>.  Please view this document in PDF

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Please review the PDF version of this draft.

   For much of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding
   used for RFCs has been ASCII [<a href="./rfc20" title='"ASCII format for network interchange"'>RFC20</a>].  This was a sensible choice at
   the time: the language of the Series has always been English, a
   language that primarily uses ASCII-encoded characters (ignoring for a
   moment words borrowed from more richly decorated alphabets); and,
   ASCII is the "lowest common denominator" for character encoding,
   making cross-platform viewing trivial.

   There are limits to ASCII, however, that hinder its continued use as
   the exclusive character encoding for the Series.  The increasing need
   for easily readable, internationalized content suggests it is time to
   allow non-ASCII characters in RFCs where necessary.  To support this
   move away from ASCII, RFCs will switch to supporting UTF-8 as the
   default character encoding and will allow support for a broad range
   of Unicode characters [<a href="#ref-UnicodeCurrent">UnicodeCurrent</a>].  Note that the RFC Editor may
   reject any code point that does not render adequately across all
   formats or in enough rendering engines using the v3 tooling.

   Given the continuing goal of maximum readability across platforms,
   the use of non-ASCII characters should be limited to only where
   necessary within the text.  This document describes the rules under
   which non-ASCII characters may be used in an RFC.  These rules will
   be applied as the necessary changes are made to submission checking
   and editorial tools.

   This document updates the RFC Style Guide [<a href="./rfc7322" title='"RFC Style Guide"'>RFC7322</a>].

   The details included in this document are expected to change based on
   experience gained in implementing the new publication toolsets.
   Revised documents will be published capturing those changes as the
   toolsets are completed.  Other implementers must not expect those
   changes to remain backwards compatible with the details included in
   this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Basic%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Basic Requirements</span>

   Two fundamental requirements inform the guidance and examples
   provided in this document.  They are:

   o  Searches against RFC indexes and database tables need to return
      expected results and support appropriate Unicode string matching
      behaviors;





<span class="grey">Flanagan                      Informational                     [Page 3]</span></pre>

   o  RFCs must be able to be displayed correctly across a wide range of
      readers and browsers.  People whose systems do not have the fonts
      needed to display a particular RFC need to be able to read the
      various publication formats and the XML correctly in order to
      understand and implement the information described in the
      document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Rules%20for%20the%20Use%20of%20Non-ASCII%20Characters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Rules for the Use of Non-ASCII Characters</span>

   This section describes the guidelines for the use of non-ASCII
   characters in an RFC.  If the RFC Editor identifies areas where the
   use of non-ASCII characters negatively impacts the readability of the
   text, they will request alternate text.

   The RFC Editor may, in cases of entire words represented in non-ASCII
   characters, ask for a set of reviewers to verify the meaning,
   spelling, characters, and grammar of the text.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20General%20Usage%20throughout%20a%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  General Usage throughout a Document</span>

   Where the use of non-ASCII characters is purely part of an example
   and not otherwise required for correct protocol operation, escaping
   the non-ASCII character is not required.  Note, however, that as the
   language of the RFC Series is English, the use of non-ASCII
   characters is based on the spelling of words commonly used in the
   English language following the guidance in the Merriam-Webster
   dictionary [<a href="#ref-MerrWeb" title="&quot;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition&quot;">MerrWeb</a>].

   The RFC Editor will use the primary spelling listed in that
   dictionary by default.

   Example of non-ASCII characters that do not require escaping (example
   from <a href="./rfc4475#section-3.1.1.12">SectionÂ 3.1.1.12 of RFC 4475</a> [<a href="./rfc4475" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Torture Test Messages"'>RFC4475</a>], with a hex dump replaced
   by the actual character glyphs):

   This particular response contains unreserved and non-ASCII
   UTF-8 characters.
   This response is well formed.  A parser must accept this message.

   Person names may appear in several places within an RFC (e.g., the
   header, Acknowledgements, and References).  When a script outside the
   Unicode Latin blocks [<a href="#ref-UNICODE-CHART">UNICODE-CHART</a>] is used for an individual name,
   an author-provided, ASCII-only identifier will appear immediately
   after the non-Latin characters, surrounded by parentheses.  This will
   improve general readability of the text.

   When the mention of non-ASCII characters is required for correct
   protocol operation and understanding, the characters' Unicode code
   points must be used in the text.  The addition of each character name
   is encouraged.

   o  Non-ASCII characters will require identifying the Unicode code
      point.

   o  Use of the actual UTF-8 character (e.g., (See PDF for non-ASCII
      character string)) is encouraged so that a reader can more easily
      see what the character is, if their device can render the text.

   o  The use of the Unicode character names like "INCREMENT" in
      addition to the use of Unicode code points is also encouraged.
      When used, Unicode character names should be in all capital
      letters.

   Examples:

   OLD [<a href="./rfc7564" title='"PRECIS Framework: Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols"'>RFC7564</a>]:

   However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full
   range of Unicode code points into protocol strings.  For example,
   the characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2 from
   the Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters
   "STPETER" as they might appear when presented using a "creative"
   font family.

   Example of proper identification of Unicode characters in an RFC:

   Acceptable:

   o  Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
      indicated by the U+2206 character.

   Preferred:

   1.  Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
       indicated by the U+2206 character ("(See PDF for non-ASCII
       character string)").

   2.  Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
       indicated by the U+2206 character (INCREMENT).

   3.  Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
       indicated by the U+2206 character ("(See PDF for non-ASCII
       character string)", INCREMENT).

   4.  Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
       indicated by the U+2206 character (INCREMENT, "(See PDF for non-
       ASCII character string)").

   5.  Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
       indicated by the "Delta" character "(See PDF for non-ASCII
       character string)" (U+2206).

   6.  Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
       indicated by the character "(See PDF for non-ASCII character
       string)" (INCREMENT, U+2206).

   Which option of (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) is preferred may
   depend on context and the specific character(s) in question.  All are
   acceptable within an RFC.  "US-ASCII Escaping of Unicode Character"
   [<a href="#ref-BCP137" title='"ASCII Escaping of Unicode Characters"'>BCP137</a>] describes the pros and cons of different options for
   identifying Unicode characters and may help authors decide how to
   represent the non-ASCII characters in their documents.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7997">RFC 7997</a>                    Non-ASCII in RFCs              December 2016</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.6.%20%20Code%20Components"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6" id="section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Code Components</span>

   The RFC Editor encourages the use of the U+ notation except within a
   code component where one must follow the rules of the programming
   language in which the code is being written.

   Code components are generally expected to use fixed-width fonts.
   Where such fonts are not available for a particular script, the best
   script-appropriate font will be used for that part of the code
   component.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.7.%20%20Bibliographic%20Text"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7" id="section-3.7">3.7</a>.  Bibliographic Text</span>

   The reference entry must be in English; whatever subfields are
   present must be available in ASCII-encoded characters.  For
   references to RFCs and Internet-Drafts, the author's name will be
   formatted in the reference as per current RFC Style Guide
   recommendations.  As long as good sense is used, the reference entry
   may also include non-ASCII characters at the author's discretion and
   as provided by the author.  The RFC Editor may request that a third
   party, such as a language specialist or subject matter expert, review
   of any non-ASCII reference.  This applies to both normative and
   informative references.

   Example:

   [<a id="ref-GOST3410">GOST3410</a>] "Information technology. Cryptographic data security.
              Signature and verification processes of [electronic]
              digital signature.", GOST R 34.10-2001, Gosudarstvennyi
              Standard of Russian Federation, Government Committee of
              Russia for Standards, 2001. (In Russian)

   Allowable addition to the above citation:
              (See PDF for non-ASCII character strings)

   Alternatively:
   [<a href="#ref-GOST3410">GOST3410</a>] "Information technology. Cryptographic data security.
              Signature and verification processes of [electronic]
              digital signature.", GOST R 34.10-2001, Gosudarstvennyi
              Standard of Russian Federation, (See PDF for non-ASCII
              character strings) (Government Committee of
              Russia for Standards), 2001. (In Russian)

   Keywords (as tagged with the &lt;keyword&gt; element in XML) and citation
   tags (as defined in the anchor attributes of &lt;reference&gt; elements)
   must contain only ASCII characters.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7997">RFC 7997</a>                    Non-ASCII in RFCs              December 2016</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.9.%20%20Address%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.9" id="section-3.9">3.9</a>.  Address Information</span>

   The purpose of providing address information, either postal or email,
   is to assist readers of an RFC in contacting the author or authors.
   Authors may include the official postal address as recognized by
   their company or local postal service without additional non-ASCII
   character escapes.  If the email address includes non-ASCII
   characters and is a valid email address at the time of publication,
   non-ASCII character escapes are not required.

   Example:

     Qin Wu (editor)
     Huawei
     101 Software Avenue, Yuhua District
     Nanjing, Jiangsu  210012
     China

   Additional contact information:
     (See PDF for non-ASCII character strings)

   ------

     Roni Even
     Huawei
     14 David Hamelech
     Tel Aviv  64953
     Israel

   Additional contact information:
      (See PDF for non-ASCII character strings)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Normalization%20Forms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Normalization Forms</span>

   Authors should not expect normalization forms [<a href="#ref-UNICODE-NORM">UNICODE-NORM</a>]to be
   preserved.  If a particular normalization form is expected, note that
   in the text of the RFC.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20XML%20Markup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  XML Markup</span>

   As described above, use of non-ASCII characters in areas such as
   email, company name, address, and name is allowed.  In order to make
   it easier for code to identify the appropriate ASCII alternatives,
   authors must include an "ascii" attribute to their XML markup when an
   ASCII alternative is required.  See [<a href="./rfc7991" title='"The "'>RFC7991</a>] for more detail on how
   to tag ASCII alternatives.

   The ability to use non-ASCII characters in RFCs in a clear and
   consistent manner will improve the ability to describe
   internationalized protocols and will recognize the diversity of
   authors.  However, the goal of readability will override the use of
   non-ASCII characters within the text.

   Valid Unicode that matches the expected text must be verified in
   order to preserve expected behavior and protocol information.
