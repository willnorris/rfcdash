   "A Framework for Conferencing with the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP)" [<a href="./rfc4353" title='"A Framework for Conferencing with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4353</a>] presents an overall architecture for multi-party
   conferencing.  Among others, the framework borrows from RTP [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>]
   and extends the concept of a mixer entity "responsible for combining
   the media streams that make up a conference, and generating one or
   more output streams that are delivered to recipients".  Every
   participant would hence receive, in a flat single stream, media
   originating from all the others.

   Using such centralized mixer-based architectures simplifies support
   for conference calls on the client side, since they would hardly
   differ from one-to-one conversations.  However, the method also
   introduces a few limitations.  The flat nature of the streams that a
   mixer would output and send to participants makes it difficult for
   users to identify the original source of what they are hearing.

   Mechanisms that allow the mixer to send to participants cues on
   current speakers (e.g., the contributing source (CSRC) fields in RTP
   [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>]) only work for speaking/silent binary indications.  There
   are, however, a number of use cases where one would require more
   detailed information.  Possible examples include the presence of
   background chat/noise/music/typing, someone breathing noisily in
   their microphone, or other cases where identifying the source of the
   disturbance would make it easy to remove it (e.g., by sending a
   private IM to the concerned party asking them to mute their
   microphone).  A more advanced scenario could involve an intense
   discussion between multiple participants that the user does not
   personally know.  Audio level information would help better recognize
   the speakers by associating with them complex (but still human
   readable) characteristics like loudness and speed, for example.

   One way of presenting such information in a user-friendly manner
   would be for a conferencing client to attach audio level indicators
   to the corresponding participant-related components in the user
   interface.  One possible example is displayed in Figure 1, where
   levels can help users determine that Alice is currently the active
   speaker, Carol is mute, and Bob and Dave are sending some background
   noise.

     Figure 1: Displaying Detailed Speaker Information to the User by
                Including Audio Level for Every Participant

   Implementing a user interface like the above requires analysis of the
   media sent from other participants.  In a conventional audio
   conference, this is only possible for the mixer, since all other
   conference participants are generally receiving a single, flat audio
   stream and therefore have no immediate way of determining individual
   audio levels.

   This document specifies an RTP extension header that allows such
   mixers to deliver audio level information to conference participants
   by including it directly in the RTP packets transporting the
   corresponding audio data.

   The header extension in this document is different than, but
   complementary to, the one defined in [<a href="./rfc6464" title='"A Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Header Extension for Client-to- Mixer Audio Level Indication"'>RFC6464</a>], which defines a
   mechanism by which clients can indicate to audio mixers the levels of
   the audio in the packets they send.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Protocol%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Protocol Operation</span>

   According to <a href="./rfc3550">RFC 3550</a> [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], a mixer is expected to include in
   outgoing RTP packets a list of identifiers (CSRC IDs) indicating the
   sources that contributed to the resulting stream.  The presence of
   such CSRC IDs allows RTP clients to determine, in a binary way, the
   active speaker(s) in any given moment.  The RTP Control Protocol
   (RTCP) also provides a basic mechanism to map the CSRC IDs to user
   identities through the CNAME field.  More advanced mechanisms can
   exist, depending on the signaling protocol used to establish and
   control a conference.  In the case of the Session Initiation Protocol
   [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>], for example, "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event
   Package for Conference State" [<a href="./rfc4575" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State"'>RFC4575</a>] defines a &lt;src-id&gt; tag that
   binds CSRC IDs to media streams and SIP URIs.

   This document describes an RTP header extension that allows mixers to
   indicate the audio level of every contributing conference participant
   (CSRC) in addition to simply indicating their on/off status.  This
   new header extension uses the general mechanism for RTP header
   extensions as described in [<a href="./rfc5285" title='"A General Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions"'>RFC5285</a>].

   Each instance of this header contains a list of one-octet audio
   levels expressed in -dBov, with values from 0 to 127 representing 0
   to -127 dBov (see Figures 2 and 3).  <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> provides a reference
   implementation indicating one way of obtaining such values from raw
   audio samples.

   Every audio level value pertains to the CSRC identifier located at
   the corresponding position in the CSRC list.  In other words, the
   first value would indicate the audio level of the conference
   participant represented by the first CSRC identifier in that packet,
   and so forth.  The number and order of these values MUST therefore
   match the number and order of the CSRC IDs present in the same
   packet.

   When encoding audio level information, a mixer SHOULD include in a
   packet information that corresponds to the audio data being
   transported in that same packet.  It is important that these values
   follow the actual stream as closely as possible.  Therefore, a mixer
   SHOULD also calculate the values after the original contributing
   stream has undergone possible processing such as level normalization,
   and noise reduction, for example.

   It can sometimes happen that a conference involves more than a single
   mixer.  In such cases, each of the mixers MAY choose to relay the
   CSRC list and audio level information they receive from peer mixers
   (as long as the total CSRC count remains below 16).  Given that the
   maximum audio level is not precisely defined by this specification,
   it is likely that in such situations average audio levels would be
   perceptibly different for the participants located behind the
   different mixers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Audio%20Levels"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Audio Levels</span>

   The audio level header extension carries the level of the audio in
   the RTP payload of the packet with which it is associated.  This
   information is carried in an RTP header extension element as defined
   by "A General Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions" [<a href="./rfc5285" title='"A General Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions"'>RFC5285</a>].

   The payload of the audio level header extension element can be
   encoded using either the one-byte or two-byte header defined in
   [<a href="./rfc5285" title='"A General Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions"'>RFC5285</a>].  Figures 2 and 3 show sample audio level encodings with
   each of these header formats.

                          Two-Byte Header Format

   In the case of the one-byte header format, the 4-bit len field is the
   number minus one of data bytes (i.e., audio level values) transported
   in this header extension element following the one-byte header.
   Therefore, the value zero in this field indicates that one byte of
   data follows.  In the case of the two-byte header format, the 8-bit
   len field contains the exact number of audio levels carried in the

   extension.  <a href="./rfc3550">RFC 3550</a> [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] only allows RTP packets to carry a
   maximum of 15 CSRC IDs.  Given that audio levels directly refer to
   CSRC IDs, implementations MUST NOT include more than 15 audio level
   values.  The maximum value allowed in the len field is therefore 14
   for the one-byte header format and 15 for the two-byte header format.

      Note: Audio levels in this document are defined in the same manner
      as is audio noise level in the RTP Payload Comfort Noise
      specification [<a href="./rfc3389" title='"Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload for Comfort Noise (CN)"'>RFC3389</a>].  In [<a href="./rfc3389" title='"Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload for Comfort Noise (CN)"'>RFC3389</a>], the overall magnitude of
      the noise level in comfort noise is encoded into the first byte of
      the payload, with spectral information about the noise in
      subsequent bytes.  This specification's audio level parameter is
      defined so as to be identical to the comfort noise payload's
      noise-level byte.

   The magnitude of the audio level itself is packed into the seven
   least significant bits of the single byte of the header extension,
   shown in Figures 2 and 3.  The least significant bit of the audio
   level magnitude is packed into the least significant bit of the byte.
   The most significant bit of the byte is unused and always set to 0.

   The audio level is expressed in -dBov, with values from 0 to 127
   representing 0 to -127 dBov. dBov is the level, in decibels, relative
   to the overload point of the system, i.e., the highest-intensity
   signal encodable by the payload format.  (Note: Representation
   relative to the overload point of a system is particularly useful for
   digital implementations, since one does not need to know the relative
   calibration of the analog circuitry.)  For example, in the case of
   u-law (audio/pcmu) audio [<a href="#ref-ITU.G711" title='"Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) of Voice Frequencies"'>ITU.G711</a>], the 0 dBov reference would be a
   square wave with values +/- 8031.  (This translates to 6.18 dBm0,
   relative to u-law's dBm0 definition in Table 6 of [<a href="#ref-ITU.G711" title='"Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) of Voice Frequencies"'>ITU.G711</a>].)

   The audio level for digital silence -- for a muted audio source, for
   example -- MUST be represented as 127 (-127 dBov), regardless of the
   dynamic range of the encoded audio format.

   The audio level header extension only carries the level of the audio
   in the RTP payload of the packet with which it is associated, with no
   long-term averaging or smoothing applied.  That level is measured as
   a root mean square of all the samples in the measured range.

   To simplify implementation of the encoding procedures described here,
   this specification provides a sample Java implementation (see
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>) of an audio level calculator that helps obtain such
   values from raw linear Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) audio samples.

   The URI for declaring the audio level header extension in a Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) extmap attribute and mapping it to a local
   extension header identifier is
   "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:csrc-audio-level".  There is no
   additional setup information needed for this extension (i.e., no
   extension attributes).

   An example attribute line in the SDP for a conference might be:

      a=extmap:7 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:csrc-audio-level

   The above mapping will most often be provided per media stream (in
   the media-level section(s) of SDP, i.e., after an "m=" line) or
   globally if there is more than one stream containing audio level
   indicators in a session.

   Presence of the above attribute in the SDP description of a media
   stream indicates that RTP packets in that stream, which contain the
   level extension defined in this document, will be carrying such an
   extension with an ID of 7.

   Conferencing clients that support audio level indicators and have no
   mixing capabilities would not be able to provide content for this
   audio level extension and would hence have to always include the
   direction parameter in the "extmap" attribute with a value of
   "recvonly".  Conference focus entities with mixing capabilities can
   omit the direction or set it to "sendrecv" in SDP offers.  Such
   entities would need to set it to "sendonly" in SDP answers to offers
   with a "recvonly" parameter and to "sendrecv" when answering other
   "sendrecv" offers.

   This specification only defines the use of the audio level extensions
   in audio streams.  They MUST NOT be advertised with other media
   types, such as video or text, for example.

   Figures 4 and 5 show two example offer/answer exchanges between a
   conferencing client and a focus, and between two conference focus
   entities.

   1.  This document defines a means of attributing audio level to a
       particular participant in a conference.  An attacker may try to
       modify the content of RTP packets in a way that would make audio
       activity from one participant appear to be coming from another
       participant.

   2.  Furthermore, the fact that audio level values would not be
       protected even in a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
       session [<a href="./rfc3711" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>] might be of concern in some cases where the
       activity of a particular participant in a conference is
       confidential.  Also, as discussed in [<a href="#ref-SRTP-VBR-AUDIO">SRTP-VBR-AUDIO</a>], an
       attacker might be able to infer information about the
       conversation, possibly with phoneme-level resolution.

   3.  Both of the above are concerns that stem from the design of the
       RTP protocol itself, and they would probably also apply when
       using CSRC identifiers in the way specified in <a href="./rfc3550">RFC 3550</a>
       [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  It is therefore important that, according to the

       needs of a particular scenario, implementors and deployers
       consider the use of header extension encryption [<a href="#ref-SRTP-ENCR-HDR">SRTP-ENCR-HDR</a>]
       or a lower-level security and authentication mechanism such as
       IPsec [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>], for example.

   This appendix contains Java code for a reference implementation of
   the level calculation and rendering methods.  The code is not
   normative and is by no means the only possible implementation.  Its
   purpose is to help implementors add audio level support to mixers and
   clients.

   The Java code contains an AudioLevelCalculator class that calculates
   the sound pressure level of a signal with specific samples.  It can
   be used in mixers to generate values suitable for the level extension
   headers.

   The implementation is provided in Java but does not rely on any of
   the language specifics and can be easily ported to another language.
