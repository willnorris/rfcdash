Abstract

   This document defines a logical network element (LNE) YANG module
   that is compliant with the Network Management Datastore Architecture
   (NMDA).  This module can be used to manage the logical resource
   partitioning that may be present on a network device.  Examples of
   common industry terms for logical resource partitioning are logical
   systems or logical routers.  The YANG model in this document conforms
   with NMDA as defined in <a href="./rfc8342">RFC 8342</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document defines an NMDA-compliant YANG module [<a href="./rfc6020" title='"YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6020</a>] to
   support the creation of logical network elements (LNEs) on a network
   device.  An LNE is an independently managed virtual device made up of
   resources allocated to it from the host or parent network device.  An
   LNE running on a host network device conceptually parallels a virtual
   machine running on a host system.  Using host-virtualization
   terminology, one could refer to an LNE as a "Guest" and the
   containing network device as the "Host".  While LNEs may be
   implemented via host-virtualization technologies, this is not a
   requirement.  The YANG model in this document conforms with the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in [<a href="./rfc8342" title='"Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)"'>RFC8342</a>].

   This document also defines the necessary augmentations for allocating
   host resources to a given LNE.  As the interface management model
   [<a href="./rfc8343" title='"A YANG Data Model for Interface Management"'>RFC8343</a>] is the only module that currently defines host resources,
   this document currently defines only a single augmentation to cover
   the assignment of interfaces to an LNE.  Future modules that define
   support for the control of host device resources are expected to,
   where appropriate, provide parallel support for the assignment of
   controlled resources to LNEs.

   As each LNE is an independently managed device, each will have its
   own set of YANG-modeled data that is independent of the host device
   and other LNEs.  For example, multiple LNEs may all have their own
   "Tunnel0" interface defined, which will not conflict with each other
   and will not exist in the host's interface model.  An LNE will have
   its own management interfaces, possibly including independent
   instances of NETCONF/RESTCONF/etc servers to support the
   configuration of their YANG models.  As an example of this
   independence, an implementation may choose to completely rename
   assigned interfaces; so, on the host, the assigned interface might be
   called "Ethernet0/1" while within the LNE it might be called "eth1".

   In addition to standard management interfaces, a host device
   implementation may support accessing LNE configuration and
   operational YANG models directly from the host system.  When
   supported, such access is accomplished through a yang-schema-mount
   mount point [<a href="./rfc8528" title='"YANG Schema Mount"'>RFC8528</a>] under which the root-level LNE YANG models may
   be accessed.

   Examples of vendor terminology for an LNE include logical system or
   logical router and virtual switch, chassis, or fabric.

   In this document, we consider network devices that support protocols
   and functions defined within the IETF Routing Area, e.g., routers,
   firewalls, and hosts.  Such devices may be physical or virtual, e.g.,
   a classic router with custom hardware or one residing within a
   server-based virtual machine implementing a virtual network function
   (VNF).  Each device may subdivide their resources into LNEs, each of
   which provides a managed logical device.  Examples of vendor
   terminology for an LNE include logical system or logical router and
   virtual switch, chassis, or fabric.  Each LNE may also support VPN
   Routing and Forwarding (VRF) and Virtual Switching Instance (VSI)
   functions, which are referred to below as Network Instances (NIs).
   This breakdown is represented in Figure 1.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8530">RFC 8530</a>                        YANG LNEs                     March 2019</span>


   A model for LNEs is described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, and the model for NIs is
   covered in [<a href="./rfc8529" title='"YANG Data Model for Network Instances"'>RFC8529</a>].

   The interface management model [<a href="./rfc8343" title='"A YANG Data Model for Interface Management"'>RFC8343</a>] is an existing model that is
   impacted by the definition of LNEs and NIs.  This document and
   [<a href="./rfc8529" title='"YANG Data Model for Network Instances"'>RFC8529</a>] define augmentations to the interface model to support LNEs
   and NIs.  Similar elements, although perhaps only for LNEs, may also
   need to be included as part of the definition of the future hardware
   and QoS modules.

   Interfaces are a crucial part of any network device's configuration
   and operational state.  They generally include a combination of raw
   physical interfaces, link-layer interfaces, addressing configuration,
   and logical interfaces that may not be tied to any physical
   interface.  Several system services, and Layer 2 and Layer 3
   protocols, may also associate configuration or operational state data
   with different types of interfaces (these relationships are not shown
   for simplicity).  The interface management model is defined by
   [<a href="./rfc8343" title='"A YANG Data Model for Interface Management"'>RFC8343</a>].  The logical-network-element module augments existing
   interface management models by adding an identifier that is used on
   interfaces to identify an associated LNE.

   The interface-related augmentation is as follows:

       module: ietf-logical-network-element
         augment /if:interfaces/if:interface:
           +--rw bind-lne-name?   -&gt;
                /logical-network-elements/logical-network-element/name

   The interface model defined in [<a href="./rfc8343" title='"A YANG Data Model for Interface Management"'>RFC8343</a>] is structured to include all
   interfaces in a flat list, without regard to logical assignment of
   resources supported on the device.  The bind-lne-name and leaf
   provides the association between an interface and its associated LNE.
   Note that as currently defined, to assign an interface to both an LNE
   and NI, the interface would first be assigned to the LNE and then
   within that LNE's interface model, the LNE's representation of that
   interface would be assigned to an NI using the mechanisms defined in
   [<a href="./rfc8529" title='"YANG Data Model for Network Instances"'>RFC8529</a>].

   Logical network elements support the ability of some devices to
   partition resources into independent logical routers and/or switches.
   Device support for multiple logical network elements is
   implementation specific.  Systems without such capabilities need not
   include support for the logical-network-element module.  In physical
   devices, some hardware features are shared across partitions, but
   control-plane (e.g., routing) protocol instances, tables, and



<span class="grey">Berger, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>

   configuration are managed separately.  For example, in logical
   routers or VNFs, this may correspond to establishing multiple logical
   instances using a single software installation.  The model supports
   configuration of multiple instances on a single device by creating a
   list of logical network elements, each with their own configuration
   and operational state related to routing and switching protocols.

   The LNE model can be represented as:

   module: ietf-logical-network-element
     +--rw logical-network-elements
        +--rw logical-network-element* [name]
           +--rw name           string
           +--rw managed?       boolean
           +--rw description?   string
           +--mp root
     augment /if:interfaces/if:interface:
       +--rw bind-lne-name?
             -&gt; /logical-network-elements/logical-network-element/name

     notifications:
       +---n bind-lne-name-failed
          +--ro name             -&gt; /if:interfaces/interface/name
          +--ro bind-lne-name
          |       -&gt; /if:interfaces/interface/lne:bind-lne-name
          +--ro error-info?      string

   'name' identifies the logical network element.  'managed' indicates
   if the server providing the host network device will provide the
   client LNE information via the 'root' structure.  The root of an
   LNE's specific data is the schema mount point 'root'.  bind-lne-name
   is used to associate an interface with an LNE, and bind-lne-name-
   failed is used in certain failure cases.

   An LNE root MUST contain at least the YANG library [<a href="./rfc7895" title='"YANG Module Library"'>RFC7895</a>] and
   interface module [<a href="./rfc8343" title='"A YANG Data Model for Interface Management"'>RFC8343</a>].

   Logical network elements may be controlled by clients using existing
   list operations.  When list entries are created, a new LNE is
   instantiated.  The models mounted under an LNE root are expected to
   be dependent on the server implementation.  When a list entry is
   deleted, an existing LNE is destroyed.  For more information, see
   <a href="./rfc7950#section-7.8.6">[RFC7950], Section 7.8.6</a>.

   Once instantiated, host network device resources can be associated
   with the new LNE.  As previously mentioned, this document augments

   ietf-interfaces with the bind-lne-name leaf to support such
   associations for interfaces.  When a bind-lne-name is set to a valid
   LNE name, an implementation MUST take whatever steps are internally
   necessary to assign the interface to the LNE or provide an error
   message (defined below) with an indication of why the assignment
   failed.  It is possible for the assignment to fail while processing
   the set, or after asynchronous processing.  Error notification in the
   latter case is supported via a notification.

   On a successful interface assignment to an LNE, an implementation
   MUST also make the resource available to the LNE by providing a
   system-created interface to the LNE.  The name of the system-created
   interface is a local matter and may be identical or completely
   different and mapped from and to the name used in the context of the
   host device.  The system-created interface SHOULD be exposed via the
   LNE-specific instance of the interface model [<a href="./rfc8343" title='"A YANG Data Model for Interface Management"'>RFC8343</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20LNE%20Management%20--%20LNE%20View"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  LNE Management -- LNE View</span>

   Each LNE instance is expected to support management functions from
   within the context of the LNE root, via a server that provides
   information with the LNE's root exposed as the device root.
   Management functions operating within the context of an LNE are
   accessed through the LNE's standard management interfaces, e.g.,
   NETCONF and SNMP.  Initial configuration, much like the initial
   configuration of the host device, is a local implementation matter.

   When accessing an LNE via the LNE's management interface, a network
   device representation will be presented, but its scope will be
   limited to the specific LNE.  Normal YANG/NETCONF mechanisms,
   together with the required YANG library [<a href="./rfc7895" title='"YANG Module Library"'>RFC7895</a>] instance, can be
   used to identify the available modules.  Each supported module will
   be presented as a top-level module.  Only LNE-associated resources
   will be reflected in resource-related modules, e.g., interfaces,
   hardware, and perhaps QoS.  From the management perspective, there
   will be no difference between the available LNE view (information)
   and a physical network device.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20LNE%20Management%20--%20Host%20Network%20Device%20View"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  LNE Management -- Host Network Device View</span>

   There are multiple implementation approaches possible to enable a
   network device to support the logical-network-element module and
   multiple LNEs.  Some approaches will allow the management functions
   operating at the network device level to access LNE configuration and
   operational information, while others will not.  Similarly, even when
   LNE management from the network device is supported by the
   implementation, it may be prohibited by user policy.

   Independent of the method selected by an implementation, the
   'managed' boolean mentioned above is used to indicate when LNE
   management from the network device context is possible.  When the
   'managed' boolean is 'false', the LNE cannot be managed by the host
   system and can only be managed from within the context of the LNE as
   described in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.  Attempts to access information below a
   root node whose associated 'managed' boolean is set to 'false' MUST
   result in the error message indicated below.  In some
   implementations, it may not be possible to change this value.  For
   example, when an LNE is implemented using virtual machine and
   traditional hypervisor technologies, it is likely that this value
   will be restricted to a 'false' value.

   It is an implementation choice if the information can be accessed and
   modified from within the context of the LNE, or even the context of
   the host device.  When the 'managed' boolean is 'true', LNE
   information SHALL be accessible from the context of the host device.
   When the associated schema-mount definition has the 'config' leaf set
   to 'true', then LNE information SHALL also be modifiable from the
   context of the host device.  When LNE information is available from
   both the host device and from within the context of the LNE, the same
   information MUST be made available via the 'root' element, with paths
   modified as described in [<a href="./rfc8528" title='"YANG Schema Mount"'>RFC8528</a>].

   An implementation MAY represent an LNE's schema using either the
   'inline' or the 'shared-schema' approaches defined in [<a href="./rfc8528" title='"YANG Schema Mount"'>RFC8528</a>].  The
   choice of which to use is completely an implementation choice.  The
   inline approach is anticipated to be generally used in the cases
   where the 'managed' boolean will always be 'false'.  The 'shared-
   schema' approach is expected to be most useful in the case where all
   LNEs share the same schema.  When 'shared-schema' is used with an LNE
   mount point, the YANG library rooted in the LNE's mount point MUST
   match the associated schema defined according to the ietf-yang-
   schema-mount module.

   Beyond the two modules that will always be present for an LNE, as an
   LNE is a network device itself, all modules that may be present at
   the top-level network device MAY also be present for the LNE.  The
   list of available modules is expected to be implementation dependent,
   as is the method used by an implementation to support LNEs.
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> provides example uses of LNEs.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8530">RFC 8530</a>                        YANG LNEs                     March 2019</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>] or RESTCONF [<a href="./rfc8040" title='"RESTCONF Protocol"'>RFC8040</a>].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [<a href="./rfc6242" title='"Using the NETCONF Protocol over Secure Shell (SSH)"'>RFC6242</a>].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [<a href="./rfc8446" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3"'>RFC8446</a>].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [<a href="./rfc8341" title='"Network Configuration Access Control Model"'>RFC8341</a>]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   LNE information represents device and network configuration
   information.  As such, the security of this information is important,
   but it is fundamentally no different than any other interface or
   device configuration information that has already been covered in
   other documents such as [<a href="./rfc8343" title='"A YANG Data Model for Interface Management"'>RFC8343</a>], [<a href="./rfc7317" title='"A YANG Data Model for System Management"'>RFC7317</a>], and [<a href="./rfc8349" title='"A YANG Data Model for Routing Management (NMDA Version)"'>RFC8349</a>].

   The vulnerable "config true" parameters and subtrees are the
   following:

   /logical-network-elements/logical-network-element:  This list
      specifies the logical network element and the related logical
      device configuration.

   /logical-network-elements/logical-network-element/managed:  While
      this leaf is contained in the previous list, it is worth
      particular attention as it controls whether information under the
      LNE mount point is accessible by both the host device and within
      the LNE context.  There may be extra sensitivity to this leaf in
      environments where an LNE is managed by a different party than the
      host device, and that party does not wish to share LNE information
      with the operator of the host device.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/bind-lne-name:  This leaf indicates the
      LNE instance to which an interface is assigned.  Implementations
      should pay particular attention to when changes to this leaf are
      permitted as removal of an interface from an LNE can have a major
      impact on the LNE's operation as it is similar to physically
      removing an interface from the device.  Implementations can reject
      a reassignment using the previously described error message
      generation.

   Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect the
   security of both the local device and the network.  This may lead to
   network malfunctions, delivery of packets to inappropriate
   destinations, and other problems.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Examples</span>

   The following subsections provide example uses of LNEs.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.1.%20%20Example%3A%20Host-Device-Managed%20LNE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" id="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Example: Host-Device-Managed LNE</span>

   This section describes an example of the LNE model using schema mount
   to achieve the parent management.  An example device supports
   multiple instances of LNEs (logical routers), each of which supports
   features of Layer 2 and Layer 3 interfaces [<a href="./rfc8343" title='"A YANG Data Model for Interface Management"'>RFC8343</a>], a routing
   information base [<a href="./rfc8349" title='"A YANG Data Model for Routing Management (NMDA Version)"'>RFC8349</a>], and the OSPF protocol [<a href="#ref-OSPF-YANG">OSPF-YANG</a>].  Each
   of these features is specified by a YANG model, and they are combined
   using the YANG schema mount as shown below.  Not all possible mounted
   modules are shown.  For example, implementations could also mount the
   model defined in [<a href="./rfc8348" title='"A YANG Data Model for Hardware Management"'>RFC8348</a>].

         "module": "ietf-logical-network-element",

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8530">RFC 8530</a>                        YANG LNEs                     March 2019</span>


   By using the implementation of the YANG schema mount, an operator can
   create instances of logical routers.  An interface can be assigned to
   a logical router, so that the logical router has the permission to
   access this interface.  The OSPF protocol can then be enabled on this
   assigned interface.

   For this implementation, a parent management session has access to
   the schemas of both the parent hosting system and the child logical
   routers.  In addition, each child logical router can grant its own
   management sessions, which have the following schema:

   This section describes an example of the LNE model using schema mount
   to achieve child-independent management.  An example device supports
   multiple instances of LNEs (logical routers), each of which has the
   features of Layer 2 and Layer 3 interfaces [<a href="./rfc8343" title='"A YANG Data Model for Interface Management"'>RFC8343</a>], a routing
   information base [<a href="./rfc8349" title='"A YANG Data Model for Routing Management (NMDA Version)"'>RFC8349</a>], and the OSPF protocol.  Each of these
   features is specified by a YANG model, and they are put together by
   the YANG schema mount as follows:

   To realize the above schema, the device implements the following
   schema mount instance:

   "ietf-yang-schema-mount:schema-mounts": {
     "mount-point": [
       {
         "module": "ietf-logical-network-element",
         "label": "root",
         "inline": {}
       }
     ]
   }

   By using the implementation of the YANG schema mount, an operator can
   create instances of logical routers, each with their logical router-
   specific inline modules.  An interface can be assigned to a logical
   router, so that the logical router has the permission to access this
   interface.  The OSPF protocol can then be enabled on this assigned
   interface.  Each logical router independently manages its own set of
   modules, which may or may not be the same as other logical routers.
   The following is an example of schema set implemented on one
   particular logical router:
