                  <span class="h1">The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option</span>

Abstract

   DNS messages between clients and servers may be received over either
   UDP or TCP.  UDP transport involves keeping less state on a busy
   server, but can cause truncation and retries over TCP.  Additionally,
   UDP can be exploited for reflection attacks.  Using TCP would reduce
   retransmits and amplification.  However, clients commonly use TCP
   only for retries and servers typically use idle timeouts on the order
   of seconds.

   This document defines an EDNS0 option ("edns-tcp-keepalive") that
   allows DNS servers to signal a variable idle timeout.  This
   signalling encourages the use of long-lived TCP connections by
   allowing the state associated with TCP transport to be managed
   effectively with minimal impact on the DNS transaction time.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   DNS messages between clients and servers may be received over either
   UDP or TCP [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>].  Historically, DNS clients used APIs that only
   facilitated sending and receiving a single query over either UDP or
   TCP.  New APIs and deployment of DNSSEC validating resolvers on hosts
   that in the past were using stub resolving only is increasing the DNS
   client base that prefer using long-lived TCP connections.  Long-lived
   TCP connections can result in lower request latency than the case
   where UDP transport is used and truncated responses are received.
   This is because clients that retry over TCP following a truncated UDP
   response typically only use the TCP session for a single (request,
   response) pair, continuing with UDP transport for subsequent queries.

   The use of TCP transport requires state to be retained on DNS
   servers.  If a server is to perform adequately with a significant
   query load received over TCP, it must manage its available resources
   to ensure that all established TCP sessions are well-used, and idle
   connections are closed after an appropriate amount of time.

   UDP transport is stateless, and hence presents a much lower resource
   burden on a busy DNS server than TCP.  An exchange of DNS messages
   over UDP can also be completed in a single round trip between
   communicating hosts, resulting in optimally short transaction times.
   UDP transport is not without its risks, however.

   A single-datagram exchange over UDP between two hosts can be
   exploited to enable a reflection attack on a third party.  Response
   Rate Limiting [<a href="#ref-RRL" title='"DNS Response Rate Limiting (DNS RRL)"'>RRL</a>] is designed to help mitigate such attacks against
   authoritative-only servers.  One feature of RRL is to let some amount
   of responses "slip" through the rate limiter.  These are returned
   with the TC (truncation) bit set, which causes legitimate clients to
   resend the same query using TCP transport.

   [<a id="ref-RFC1035">RFC1035</a>] specified a maximum DNS message size over UDP transport of
   512 bytes.  Deployment of DNSSEC [<a href="./rfc4033" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>] and other protocols
   subsequently increased the observed frequency at which responses
   exceed this limit.  EDNS0 [<a href="./rfc6891" title='"Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))"'>RFC6891</a>] allows DNS messages larger than
   512 bytes to be exchanged over UDP, with a corresponding increased
   incidence of fragmentation.  Fragmentation is known to be problematic
   in general, and has also been implicated in increasing the risk of
   cache poisoning attacks [<a href="#ref-fragmentation-considered-poisonous">fragmentation-considered-poisonous</a>].

   TCP transport is less susceptible to the risks of fragmentation and
   reflection attacks.  However, TCP transport for DNS as currently
   deployed has expensive setup overhead, compared to using UDP (when no
   retry is required).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7828">RFC 7828</a>           The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option        April 2016</span>


   The overhead of the three-way TCP handshake for a single DNS
   transaction is substantial, increasing the transaction time for a
   single (request, response) pair of DNS messages from 1x RTT to 2x
   RTT.  There is no such overhead for a session that is already
   established; therefore, the overhead of the initial TCP handshake is
   minimised when the resulting session is used to exchange multiple DNS
   message pairs over a single session.  The extra RTT time for session
   setup can be represented as the equation (1 + N)/N, where N
   represents the number of DNS message pairs that utilize the session
   and the result approaches unity as N increases.

   With increased deployment of DNSSEC and new RR types containing
   application-specific cryptographic material, there is an increase in
   the prevalence of truncated responses received over UDP with retries
   over TCP.  The overhead for a DNS transaction over UDP truncated due
   to RRL is 3x RTT higher than the overhead imposed on the same
   transaction initiated over TCP.

   This document proposes a signalling mechanism between DNS clients and
   servers that encourages the use of long-lived TCP connections by
   allowing the state associated with TCP transport to be managed
   effectively with minimal impact on the DNS transaction time.

   This mechanism will be of benefit for both stub-resolver and
   resolver-authoritative TCP connections.  In the latter case, the
   persistent nature of the TCP connection can provide improved defence
   against attacks including DDoS.

   The reduced overhead of this extension adds up significantly when
   combined with other EDNS0 extensions, such as [<a href="#ref-CHAIN-QUERY">CHAIN-QUERY</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-DNS-over-TLS">DNS-over-TLS</a>].  For example, the combination of these EDNS0
   extensions make it possible for hosts on high-latency mobile networks
   to natively and efficiently perform DNSSEC validation and encrypt
   queries.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20The%20edns-tcp-keepalive%20Option"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  The edns-tcp-keepalive Option</span>

   This document specifies a new EDNS0 [<a href="./rfc6891" title='"Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))"'>RFC6891</a>] option, edns-tcp-
   keepalive, which can be used by DNS clients and servers to signal a
   willingness to keep an idle TCP session open to conduct future DNS
   transactions, with the idle timeout being specified by the server.
   This specification does not distinguish between different types of
   DNS client and server in the use of this option.

   [<a id="ref-RFC7766">RFC7766</a>] defines an 'idle DNS-over-TCP session' from both the client
   and server perspective.  The idle timeout described here begins when
   the idle condition is met per that definition and should be reset
   when that condition is lifted, i.e., when a client sends a message or
   when a server receives a message on an idle connection.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Option%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Option Format</span>

   The edns-tcp-keepalive option is encoded as follows:

                        1                   2                   3

   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   !         OPTION-CODE           !         OPTION-LENGTH         !
   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   |           TIMEOUT             !
   +-------------------------------+

   where:

   OPTION-CODE:   the EDNS0 option code assigned to edns-tcp-keepalive,
      11

   OPTION-LENGTH:   the value 0 if the TIMEOUT is omitted, the value 2
      if it is present;

   TIMEOUT:   an idle timeout value for the TCP connection, specified in
      units of 100 milliseconds, encoded in network byte order.

   DNS clients MUST NOT include the edns-tcp-keepalive option in queries
   sent using UDP transport.

   DNS clients MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option in the first
   query sent to a server using TCP transport to signal their desire to
   keep the connection open when idle.

   DNS clients MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option in subsequent
   queries sent to a server using TCP transport to signal their
   continued desire to keep the connection open when idle.

   Clients MUST specify an OPTION-LENGTH of 0 and omit the TIMEOUT
   value.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.2.%20%20Receiving%20Responses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.2" id="section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  Receiving Responses</span>

   A DNS client that receives a response using UDP transport that
   includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option MUST ignore the option.

   A DNS client that receives a response using TCP transport that
   includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option MAY keep the existing TCP
   session open when it is idle.  It SHOULD honour the timeout received
   in that response (overriding any previous timeout) and initiate close
   of the connection before the timeout expires.

   A DNS client that receives a response that includes the edns-tcp-
   keepalive option with a TIMEOUT value of 0 SHOULD send no more
   queries on that connection and initiate closing the connection as
   soon as it has received all outstanding responses.

   A DNS client that sent a query containing the edns-keepalive-option
   but receives a response that does not contain the edns-keepalive-
   option SHOULD assume the server does not support keepalive and behave
   following the guidance in [<a href="./rfc7766" title='"DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements"'>RFC7766</a>].  This holds true even if a
   previous edns-keepalive-option exchange occurred on the existing TCP
   connection.

   A DNS server that receives a query using UDP transport that includes
   the edns-tcp-keepalive option MUST ignore the option.

   A DNS server that receives a query using TCP transport that includes
   the edns-tcp-keepalive option MAY modify the local idle timeout
   associated with that TCP session if resources permit.

   A DNS server that receives a query sent using TCP transport that
   includes an OPT RR (with or without the edns-tcp-keepalive option)
   MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option in the response to signal
   the expected idle timeout on a connection.  Servers MUST specify the
   TIMEOUT value that is currently associated with the TCP session.  It

   is reasonable for this value to change according to local resource
   constraints.  The DNS server SHOULD send an edns-tcp-keepalive option
   with a timeout of 0 if it deems its local resources are too low to
   service more TCP keepalive sessions or if it wants clients to close
   currently open connections.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20TCP%20Session%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  TCP Session Management</span>

   Both DNS clients and servers are subject to resource constraints that
   will limit the extent to which TCP sessions can persist.  Effective
   limits for the number of active sessions that can be maintained on
   individual clients and servers should be established, either as
   configuration options or by interrogation of process limits imposed
   by the operating system.  Servers that implement edns-tcp-keepalive
   should also engage in TCP connection management by recycling existing
   connections when appropriate, closing connections gracefully, and
   managing request queues to enable fair use.

   In the event that there is greater demand for TCP sessions than can
   be accommodated, servers may reduce the TIMEOUT value signalled in
   successive DNS messages to minimise idle time on existing sessions.
   This also allows, for example, clients with other candidate servers
   to query to establish new TCP sessions with different servers in
   expectation that an existing session is likely to be closed or to
   fall back to UDP.

   Based on TCP session resources, servers may signal a TIMEOUT value of
   0 to request clients to close connections as soon as possible.  This
   is useful when server resources become very low or a denial-of-
   service attack is detected and further maximises the shifting of
   TIME_WAIT state to well-behaved clients.

   However, it should be noted that <a href="./rfc6891">RFC 6891</a> states:

      Lack of presence of an OPT record in a request MUST be taken as an
      indication that the requestor does not implement any part of this
      specification and that the responder MUST NOT include an OPT
      record in its response.

   Since servers must be faithful to this specification even on a
   persistent TCP connection, it means that (following the initial
   exchange of timeouts) a server may not be presented with the
   opportunity to signal a change in the idle timeout associated with a
   connection if the client does not send any further requests
   containing EDNS0 OPT RRs.  This limitation makes persistent
   connection handling via an initial idle timeout signal more

   attractive than a mechanism that establishes default persistence and
   then uses a connection close signal (in a similar manner to HTTP 1.1
   [<a href="./rfc7230" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>]).

   If a client includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option in the first
   query, it SHOULD include an EDNS0 OPT RR periodically in any further
   messages it sends during the TCP session.  This will increase the
   chance of the client being notified should the server modify the
   timeout associated with a session.  The algorithm for choosing when
   to do this is out of scope of this document and is left up to the
   implementor and/or operator.

   DNS clients and servers MAY close a TCP session at any time in order
   to manage local resource constraints.  The algorithm by which clients
   and servers rank active TCP sessions in order to determine which to
   close is not specified in this document.

   Many paths between DNS clients and servers suffer from poor hygiene,
   limiting the free flow of DNS messages that include particular EDNS0
   options or messages that exceed a particular size.  A fallback
   strategy similar to that described in <a href="./rfc6891#section-6.2.2">[RFC6891], SectionÂ 6.2.2</a> SHOULD
   be employed to avoid persistent interference due to non-clean paths.

   Changes in network topology between clients and anycast servers may
   cause disruption to TCP sessions making use of edns-tcp-keepalive
   more often than with TCP sessions that omit it, since the TCP
   sessions are expected to be longer lived.  It might be possible for
   anycast servers to avoid disruption due to topology changes by making
   use of TCP multipath [<a href="./rfc6824" title='"TCP Extensions for Multipath Operation with Multiple Addresses"'>RFC6824</a>] to anchor the server side of the TCP
   connection to an unambiguously unicast address.

   It is RECOMMENDED that DNS intermediaries that terminate TCP
   connections implement edns-tcp-keepalive.  An intermediary that does
   not implement edns-tcp-keepalive but sits between a client and server
   that both support edns-tcp-keepalive might close idle connections
   unnecessarily.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The edns-tcp-keepalive option can potentially be abused to request
   large numbers of long-lived sessions in a quick burst.  When a DNS
   server detects abusive behaviour, it SHOULD immediately close the TCP
   connection and free the resources used.

   Servers could choose to monitor client behaviour with respect to the
   edns-tcp-keepalive option to build up profiles of clients that do not
   honour the specified timeout.

   Readers are advised to familiarise themselves with the security
   considerations outlined in [<a href="./rfc7766" title='"DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements"'>RFC7766</a>]

   IANA has assigned an EDNS0 option code for the edns-tcp-keepalive
   option from the "DNS EDNS0 Option Codes (OPT)" registry as follows:
