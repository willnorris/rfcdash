   [<a href="./rfc6513" title='"Multicast in MPLS/ BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6513</a>], [<a href="./rfc6514" title='"BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6514</a>], and [<a href="./rfc6625" title='"Wildcards in Multicast VPN Auto-Discovery Routes"'>RFC6625</a>] specify procedures for supporting
   multicast in Multiprotocol Label Switching/Border Gateway Protocol
   (MPLS/BGP) Layer 3 (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  Throughout
   this document, we will use the term "MVPN" (for "multicast VPN")
   [<a href="./rfc6513" title='"Multicast in MPLS/ BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6513</a>] to refer to a BGP/MPLS IP VPN that supports multicast.

   Provider Edge (PE) routers that attach to a particular MVPN exchange
   customer multicast (C-multicast) routing information with neighboring
   PEs.  In [<a href="./rfc6513" title='"Multicast in MPLS/ BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6513</a>], two basic methods for exchanging C-multicast
   routing information are defined: (1) Protocol Independent Multicast
   (PIM) [<a href="./rfc7761" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC7761</a>] and (2) BGP.

   In the rest of this document, we will use the term "PIM-MVPN" to
   refer to the case where PIM is used for exchanging C-multicast
   routing information and "BGP-MVPN" to refer to the case where BGP is
   used for exchanging C-multicast routing information.

   This document describes managed objects to configure and/or monitor
   MVPNs.  Most of the managed objects are common to both PIM-MVPN and
   BGP-MVPN, and some managed objects are BGP-MVPN specific.

   This document adopts the definitions, abbreviations, and mechanisms
   described in [<a href="./rfc4364" title='"BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4364</a>], [<a href="./rfc6513" title='"Multicast in MPLS/ BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6513</a>], and [<a href="./rfc6514" title='"BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6514</a>].  Familiarity with
   multicast, MPLS, Layer 3 (L3) VPN, and MVPN concepts and/or
   mechanisms is assumed.  Some terms specifically related to this
   document are explained below.

   An MVPN can be realized by using various kinds of transport
   mechanisms for forwarding a packet to all or a subset of PEs across
   service provider networks.  Such transport mechanisms are referred to
   as provider tunnels (P-tunnels).

   A Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) [<a href="./rfc6513" title='"Multicast in MPLS/ BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6513</a>] is a
   conceptual interface instantiated by a P-tunnel.  A PE uses a PMSI to
   send customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.

   There are two kinds of PMSIs: Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI) and Selective
   PMSI (S-PMSI) [<a href="./rfc6513" title='"Multicast in MPLS/ BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6513</a>].  An I-PMSI enables a PE attached to a
   particular MVPN to transmit a message to all PEs in the same MVPN.
   An S-PMSI enables a PE to transmit a message to a selected set of PEs
   in the same MVPN.

   As described in [<a href="./rfc4382" title='"MPLS/BGP Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) Management Information Base"'>RFC4382</a>], each PE maintains one default forwarding
   table and zero or more Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) tables.
   Throughout this document, we will use the term "MVRF" (for "multicast
   VRF") to refer to a VRF that contains multicast routing information.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>

   This document defines BGP-MPLS-LAYER3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB, a MIB module
   for monitoring and/or configuring MVPNs on PEs.  This MIB module will
   be used in conjunction with MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB [<a href="./rfc4382" title='"MPLS/BGP Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) Management Information Base"'>RFC4382</a>] and IPMCAST-
   MIB [<a href="./rfc5132" title='"IP Multicast MIB"'>RFC5132</a>].

   BGP-MPLS-LAYER3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB provides the following
   functionalities.

   o  Monitoring attributes of MVPNs on a PE

   o  Configuring timers and thresholds related to an MVPN on a PE

   o  Notifying creation, deletion, and modification of MVRFs on a PE

   o  Monitoring PMSI attributes

   o  Monitoring statistics of advertisements exchanged by a PE

   o  Monitoring routing information for multicast destinations

   o  Monitoring next hops for each multicast destination

   To provide these functionalities, BGP-MPLS-LAYER3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB
   defines the following tables.

   o  mvpnGenericTable

      This table contains generic information about MVPNs on a PE.  Each
      entry in this table represents an instance of an MVPN on a PE and
      contains generic information related to the MVPN.  For each entry
      in this table, there MUST be a corresponding VRF in MPLS-L3VPN-
      STD-MIB [<a href="./rfc4382" title='"MPLS/BGP Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) Management Information Base"'>RFC4382</a>].

   o  mvpnBgpTable

      This table contains information specific to BGP-MVPNs.  Each BGP-
      MVPN on a PE will have an entry in this table.

   o  mvpnPmsiTable

      This table contains managed objects representing attribute
      information that is common to I-PMSIs and S-PMSIs on a PE.

   o  mvpnSpmsiTable

      This table contains managed objects representing attribute
      information specific to S-PMSIs.  An S-PMSI represented in this
      table will have a corresponding entry in mvpnPmsiTable.

     DESCRIPTION
         "The minimum number of hops between this router and any
          member of this IP multicast group reached via this next hop
          on the corresponding outgoing interface.  Any IP multicast
          datagram for the group that has a TTL (IPv4) or a Hop Count
          (IPv6) less than mvpnMrouteNextHopClosestMemberHops will
          not be forwarded through this interface.

          A value of zero means all multicast datagrams are forwarded
          out of the interface.  A value of 256 means that no multicast
          datagrams are forwarded out of the interface.

          This is an optimization applied by multicast routing
          protocols that explicitly track hop counts to downstream
          listeners.  Multicast protocols that are not aware of hop
          counts to downstream listeners set this object to zero.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This MIB module contains some read-only objects that may be deemed
   sensitive.  It also contains some read-write objects whose settings
   will change the device's MVPN-related behavior.  Appropriate security
   procedures that are related to SNMP in general but are not specific
   to this MIB module need to be implemented by concerned operators.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection opens devices to attack.  These are the tables and objects
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  mvpnSPTunnelLimit

      The value of this object is used to control the maximum number of
      selective provider tunnels that a PE allows for a particular MVPN.
      Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of
      the PE or prevent the PE from having new selective provider
      tunnels.

   o  mvpnBgpCmcastRouteWithdrawalTimer

      The value of this object is used to control the delay for the
      advertisement of withdrawals of C-multicast routes.  Access to
      this object may be abused to impact the performance of a PE.

   o  mvpnBgpSrcSharedTreeJoinTimer

      The value of this object is used to control the delay for the
      advertisement of Source/Shared Tree Join C-multicast routes.
      Access to this object may be abused to impact the propagation of
      C-multicast routing information.

   o  mvpnBgpMsgRateLimit

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the rate of BGP C-multicast routing information message exchange
      among PEs.  Access to this object may be abused to impact the
      performance of the PE or disrupt the C-multicast routing
      information message exchange using BGP.

   o  mvpnBgpMaxSpmsiAdRoutes

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the number of S-PMSI A-D routes.  Access to this object may be
      abused to impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE from
      receiving S-PMSI A-D routes.

   o  mvpnBgpMaxSpmsiAdRouteFreq

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the frequency of S-PMSI A-D route generation.  Access to this
      object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or
      prevent the PE from generating new S-PMSI A-D routes.

   o  mvpnBgpMaxSrcActiveAdRoutes

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the number of Source Active A-D routes.  Access to this object may
      be abused to impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE
      from receiving Source Active A-D routes.

   o  mvpnBgpMaxSrcActiveAdRouteFreq

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the frequency of Source Active A-D route generation.  Access to
      this object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or
      prevent the PE from generating new Source Active A-D routes.

   Some of the objects in this MIB module may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  This includes INDEX objects
   with a MAX-ACCESS of not-accessible, and any indices from other
   modules exposed via AUGMENTS.  It is thus important to control even
   GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the
   network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The address-related objects in this MIB module may have impact on
      privacy and security.  These objects may reveal the locations of
      senders and recipients.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [<a href="./rfc3410" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [<a href="./rfc3414" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC3414</a>] with the AES cipher algorithm [<a href="./rfc3826" title='"The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Cipher Algorithm in the SNMP User-based Security Model"'>RFC3826</a>].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [<a href="./rfc5591" title='"Transport Security Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5591</a>] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [<a href="./rfc5592" title='"Secure Shell Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5592</a>] or TLS/DTLS [<a href="./rfc6353" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC6353</a>].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   (Jeffrey) Zhang, Saud Asif, Andy Green, Sameer Gulrajani, and Pradeep
   G. Jain.  That document, in turn, was based on an earlier document
   written by Susheela Vaidya, Thomas D. Nadeau, and Harmen Van der
   Linde.

   This document also borrows heavily from the design and descriptions
   of ipMcastRouteTable and ipMcastRouteNextHopTable from IPMCAST-MIB
   [<a href="./rfc5132" title='"IP Multicast MIB"'>RFC5132</a>].

   Glenn Mansfield Keeni did the MIB Doctor review and provided valuable
   comments.
