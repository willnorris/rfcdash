   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects which provide an inverted
   mapping of the interface stack table used for managing network
   interfaces.

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o An overall architecture, described in <a href="./rfc2571">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>1</a>].

    o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>2</a>], STD 16, <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>3</a>] and <a href="./rfc1215">RFC 1215</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>4</a>].  The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, which
      consists of <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>5</a>], <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>6</a>] and <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>7</a>].

    o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>8</a>].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="./rfc1901">RFC 1901</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>9</a>] and <a href="./rfc1906">RFC</a>
      <a href="./rfc1906">1906</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>10</a>].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>10</a>], <a href="./rfc2572">RFC 2572</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>11</a>] and <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a>
      [<a href="#ref-12" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>12</a>].

    o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>8</a>].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in <a href="./rfc1905">RFC 1905</a>
      [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>13</a>].

    o A set of fundamental applications described in <a href="./rfc2573">RFC 2573</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"SNMP Applications"'>14</a>] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in <a href="./rfc2575">RFC 2575</a>
      [<a href="#ref-15" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>15</a>].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in <a href="./rfc2570">RFC 2570</a> [<a href="#ref-18" title='"Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>18</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Interface%20Sub-Layers%20and%20the%20ifStackTable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Interface Sub-Layers and the ifStackTable</span>

   MIB-II [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets - MIB-II"'>16</a>] defines objects for managing network interfaces by
   providing a generic interface definition together with the ability to
   define media-specific extensions.  The generic objects are known as
   the 'interfaces' group.

   Experience in defining media-specific extensions showed the need to
   distinguish between the multiple sub-layers beneath the
   internetwork-layer.  Consider, for example, an interface with PPP
   running over an HDLC link which uses a RS232-like connector.  Each of
   these sub-layers has its own media-specific MIB module.

   The latest definition of the 'interfaces' group in the IF-MIB [<a href="#ref-17" title='"The Interface Group MIB"'>17</a>]
   satisfies this need by having each sub-layer be represented by its
   own conceptual row in the ifTable.  It also defines an additional MIB
   table, the ifStackTable, to identify the "superior" and "subordinate"
   sub-layers through ifIndex "pointers" to the appropriate conceptual
   rows in the ifTable.

   Each conceptual row in the ifStackTable represents a relationship
   between two interfaces, where this relationship is that the "higher-
   layer" interface runs "on top" of the "lower-layer" interface.  For
   example, if a PPP module operated directly over a serial interface,
   the PPP module would be a "higher layer" to the serial interface, and
   the serial interface would be a "lower layer" to the PPP module.
   This concept of "higher-layer" and "lower-layer" is the same as
   embodied in the definitions of the ifTable's packet counters.

   The ifStackTable is INDEX-ed by the ifIndex values of the two
   interfaces involved in the relationship.  By necessity, one of these
   ifIndex values must come first, and the IF-MIB chose to have the
   higher-layer interface first, and the lower-layer interface second.
   Due to this, it is straight-forward for a Network Management
   application to read a subset of the ifStackTable and thereby
   determine the interfaces which run underneath a particular interface.
   However, to determine which interfaces run on top of a particular
   interface, a Network Management application has no alternative but to
   read the whole table.  This is very inefficient when querying a
   device which has many interfaces, and many conceptual rows in its
   ifStackTable.

   This MIB provides an inverted Interfaces Stack Table, the
   ifInvStackTable.  While it contains no additional information beyond
   that already contained in the ifStackTable, the ifInvStackTable has
   the ifIndex values in its INDEX clause in the reverse order, i.e.,
   the lower-layer interface first, and the higher-layer interface
   second.  As a result, the ifInvStackTable is an inverted version of

   the same information contained in the ifStackTable.  Thus, the
   ifInvStackTable provides an efficient means for a Network Management
   application to read a subset of the ifStackTable and thereby
   determine which interfaces run on top of a particular interface.

          the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces.  In
          particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run
          'underneath' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer
          corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.  For
          example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs
          underneath the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this
          table contains:

            ifInvStackStatus.x.y=active

          For each ifIndex value, z, which identifies an active
          interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows
          in this table associated with z.  For one of these rows, z
          is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, z is the
          value of ifStackLowerLayer.  (If z is not involved in
          multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated
          with z.)

          For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has
          no others stacked on top or below it:

            ifInvStackStatus.z.0=active
            ifInvStackStatus.0.z=active

          This table contains exactly the same number of rows as the
          ifStackTable, but the rows appear in a different order."

          An instance of this object exists for each instance of the

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>12</a>] and the View- based
   Access Control Model <a href="./rfc2575">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="#ref-15" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>15</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
