Abstract

   RPS Security [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Routing Policy System Security"'>2</a>] requires certain RPSL [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL)"'>1</a>] objects in the IRR to be
   hierarchically delegated.  The set of objects that are at the root of
   this hierarchy needs to be created and digitally signed by IANA. This
   paper presents these seed objects and lists operations required from
   IANA.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1%20Initial%20Seed"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a> Initial Seed</span>

   A public key of IANA needs to be distributed with the software
   implementations of Distributed Routing Policy System [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Distributed Routing Policy System"'>3</a>].  An initial
   set of seed objects are needed to be signed with this key.  The
   following transaction (the transaction format is defined in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Distributed Routing Policy System"'>3</a>])
   contains these objects and is signed by this key:

   The above text has no extra white space characters at the end of each
   line, and contains no tab characters.  All blank line sequences
   contain only a single blank line.  The page break in the text is also
   a single blank line.

   In this case, we assumed that IANA runs its own repository.  However
   this is not a requirement.  Instead, it may publish this transaction
   with an existing routing registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2%20IANA%20Assignments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a> IANA Assignments</span>

   Each time IANA makes an assignment, it needs to create inetnum and
   as-block objects as appropriate and digitally sign them using the key
   in its key-cert object.  For example:

   To enable a new routing repository, a repository object, a maintainer
   object and a key-cert object need to be created and digitally signed
   by IANA. For example:

   This very first transaction of a new repository is placed in the new
   repository, not in the IANA repository.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a> Security Considerations</span>

   Routing policy system security document [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Routing Policy System Security"'>2</a>] defines an hierarchical
   authorization model for objects stored in the routing registries.
   This document specifies the seed objects and the actions need to be
   taken by IANA to maintain the root of that authorization hierarchy.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a> IANA Considerations</span>

   This whole document is for detailed consideration by IANA.
