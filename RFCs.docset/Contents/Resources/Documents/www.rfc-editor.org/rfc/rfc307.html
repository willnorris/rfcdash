                     USING NETWORK REMOTE JOB ENTRY

OVERVIEW

   As has been mentioned in previous RFCs and at previous Network
   meetings various groups at Rand have been doing RJE to remote Network
   sites (UCBS and UCLA) for over a year.  Until recently all this work
   has been done from our IBM 360/65 which is only a Network using host
   (not a server).  Recently our PDP-10 has come onto the Network as
   both a user and server host.  We now have, as well, a program on the
   PDP-10 allowing access to the Remote Job Service (RJS) at UCLA.  Our
   normal mode of operation is diagramed below.

                    User

   To use RJS the user creates a job source "deck" in the Rand File
   system.  He then instructs the RJS Access Program (RJSAP) to send
   that file (job) to RJS.  (Sample session below.)  He can then monitor
   the status of his job via RJSAP (and hence RJS) and ask that RJSAP
   retrieve his print output to a local file, (or directly to his
   console, the line printer or whatever).

   Recently, several people at other Network sites have expressed an
   interest in using RJS.  However, they are located at a minimal Host
   or at a host not providing RJS access.  Since the Rand PDP-10 is a
   Network server, these people can solve their access problem by
   logging onto the Rand PDP-10, using Telnet, and running the RJSAP
   themselves.  The remainder of this RFC describe the steps necessary

   to run that program.

The Rand PDP-10

   The Rand PDP-10 operates under the Tenex operating system.  Thus,
   some understanding of the Tenex Executive is required.  The necessary
   documents can be obtained from the developers of Tenex:

                    Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc.
                    50 Moulton Street
                    Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138
                    (617) 491-1850

   Secondly, it is necessary to establish an account on the Rand PDP-10.
   This can be done through:

                    Rod Fredrickson
                    The Rand Corporation
                    1700 Main Street
                    Santa Monica, California 90406
                    (213) 393-0411

UCLA Remote Job Service

   To use the UCLA IBM 360/91 via RJS it is necessary to:

      1) have an account at UCLA
      2) have an assigned RJS terminal ID.

   These can both be obtained from

                    Bob Braden
                    UCLA
                    Math Sciences Building
                    3531 Boelter Hall
                    Los Angeles, Calif.  90024
                    (213) 825-7518

The RJS Access Program (RJSAP)

   A sample session using RJSAP is attached below.  The RJSAP is started
   by typing "RJS&lt;return&gt;" to the Tenex executive.  The program will
   then initialize and check (via your login information) to see if you
   are a user recorded in its tables.  This is done to assure you have a
   valid RJS terminal ID.  If your ID is not found, the program will
   terminate with appropriate message.





<span class="grey">Harslem                                                         [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-3"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc307">RFC 307</a>              Using Network Remote Job Entry        February 1972</span>


   If your ID is found, RJSAP will attempt to connect to RJS.  If UCLA
   is down, a message to that effect will appear and the program will
   terminate.  If UCLA is up, RJSAP will connect you to RJS and sign-on
   your terminal ID (see <a href="./rfc189">RFC 189</a>).  RJSAP will respond "YOU ARE
   CONNECTED TO RJS."

   At this point RJS will acknowledge your signon and print out messages
   regarding system status.

   The programs (RJSAP and RJS) are now ready to perform RJE functions.
   All commands are initially interpreted by RJSAP.  They are listed and
   explained below.

      1. Help

         If the user types "?" RJSAP will echo the "?" and list the
         valid set of commands (see below).

      2. Message to RJS

         If the first character of a command is a "/" all subsequent
         characters up to a "return" are transmitted to RJS on the
         operator input connection.  See <a href="./rfc189">RFC 189</a> for the syntax and
         semantics of these commands.

         An operator input message can be cancelled with the RUB OUT key
         or backspaced using BACKSPACE.

      3. Send a Job

         When the user types "S" RJSAP echoes "SEND SOURCE DECK FROM
         FILE".  The user then enters the file name containing his job
         followed by a "return."  Obviously the file must already exist.
         If the file is ok and is transmitted successfully, both RJSAP
         and RJS will print an acknowledgement on the user's terminal
         (see example below).

      4. Retrieve Job Output-Printer

         The user can retrieve printed output by entering "PR".  RJSAP
         will echo "PRINT OUTPUT TO FILE".  The user then enters the
         files name where he wants the output.  This can be a new file
         or even a device such as the printer or teletype.  When the
         print output is completely received, the RJSAP will print an
         acknowledgment (see example).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc307">RFC 307</a>              Using Network Remote Job Entry        February 1972</span>


      5. Retrieve Job Output-Punch

         This function is currently not implemented, pending a decision
         on the use of this channel between a PDP-10 and a 360.

      6. Transmission Status

         For long transmissions of job input or output it may be
         desirable to check on the progress of the transmission.  Typing
         "R" will cause RJSAP to echo "REPORT ON TRANSMISSIONS--",
         followed by a record count for the job input and printer output
         channels.

      7. Termination

         If the user types a "Q" at the start of a command, RJSAP will
         echo "QUIT IN PROGRESS" and terminate.  This is the preferred
         way of terminating the program.  (Rather than just ^C).

   NOTE: Since RJSAP has not been extensively used, we expect it to be
   improved and modified in the future.  Thus, the last section of this
   RFC -- the explanation of the use of RJSAP -- will be kept in file
   &lt;HARSLEM&gt;RJSACCESSPROGRAM.EXPLANATION on the Rand PDP-10 and be
   updated appropriately.
