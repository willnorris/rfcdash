Abstract

   The multipart/report Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
   media type is a general "family" or "container" type for electronic
   mail reports of any kind.  Although this memo defines only the use of
   the multipart/report media type with respect to delivery status
   reports, mail processing programs will benefit if a single media type
   is used for all kinds of reports.

   This memo obsoletes "The Multipart/Report Content Type for the
   Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages", <a href="./rfc3462">RFC 3462</a>, and
   marks <a href="./rfc3462">RFC 3462</a> and its predecessor as "Historic".

   [<a id="ref-OLD-REPORT">OLD-REPORT</a>] and its antecedent declared the multipart/report media
   type for use within the [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME</a>] construct to create a container for
   mail system administrative reports of various kinds.

   Practical experience has shown that the general requirement of having
   that media type constrained to be used only as the outermost MIME
   type of a message is overly restrictive and limits such things as the
   transmission of multiple administrative reports within a single
   overall message container.  In particular, it prevents one from
   forwarding a report as part of another multipart MIME message.

   This memo removes that constraint.  No other changes apart from some
   editorial ones are made.  Other memos might update other documents to
   establish or clarify the constraints on use of multipart/report in
   contexts where such are needed.

   This memo obsoletes <a href="./rfc3462">RFC 3462</a>.  <a href="./rfc3462">RFC 3462</a> and its predecessor, <a href="./rfc1892">RFC</a>

   The multipart/report MIME media type is a general "family" or
   "container" type for electronic mail reports of any kind.  Although
   this memo defines only the use of the multipart/report media type
   with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs
   will benefit if a single media type is used for all kinds of reports.

   Per [<a href="#ref-MIME-REG" title='"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"'>MIME-REG</a>], the multipart/report media type is defined as
   follows:

   Type name:  multipart

   Subtype name:  report

   Required parameters:  boundary, report-type

   Optional parameters:  none

   The syntax of multipart/report is identical to the multipart/mixed
   content type defined in [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME</a>].  The report-type parameter identifies
   the type of report.  The parameter is the MIME subtype of the second
   body part of the multipart/report.  (See <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.)

   The multipart/report media type contains either two or three sub-
   parts, in the following order:

   1.  (REQUIRED) The first body part contains a human-readable message.
       The purpose of this message is to provide an easily understood
       description of the condition(s) that caused the report to be
       generated, for a human reader who might not have a user agent
       capable of interpreting the second section of the multipart/
       report.  The text in the first section can use any IANA-
       registered MIME media type, charset, or language.  Where a
       description of the error is desired in several languages or

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6522">RFC 6522</a>               Multipart/Report Media Type          January 2012</span>


       several media, a multipart/alternative construct MAY be used.
       This body part MAY also be used to send detailed information that
       cannot be easily formatted into the second body part.

   2.  (REQUIRED) A machine-parsable body part containing an account of
       the reported message handling event.  The purpose of this body
       part is to provide a machine-readable description of the
       condition(s) that caused the report to be generated, along with
       details not present in the first body part that might be useful
       to human experts.  An initial body part, message/delivery-status,
       is defined in [<a href="#ref-DSN-FORMAT" title='"An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications"'>DSN-FORMAT</a>].

   3.  (OPTIONAL) A body part containing the returned message or a
       portion thereof.  This information could be useful to aid human
       experts in diagnosing problems.  (Although it might also be
       useful to allow the sender to identify the message about which
       the report was issued, it is hoped that the envelope-id and
       original-recipient-address returned in the message/report body
       part will replace the traditional use of the returned content for
       this purpose.)

   Return of content can be wasteful of network bandwidth and a variety
   of implementation strategies can be used.  Generally, the sender
   needs to choose the appropriate strategy and inform the recipient of
   the required level of returned content required.  In the absence of
   an explicit request for level of return of content such as that
   provided in [<a href="#ref-DSN-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"'>DSN-SMTP</a>], the agent that generated the delivery service
   report SHOULD return the full message content.

   When 8-bit or binary data not encoded in a 7-bit form is to be
   returned, and the return path is not guaranteed to be 8-bit or binary
   capable, two options are available.  The original message MAY be
   re-encoded into a legal 7-bit MIME message or the text/rfc822-headers
   media type MAY be used to return only the original message headers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20text%2Frfc822-headers%20Media%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The text/rfc822-headers Media Type</span>

   The text/rfc822-headers media type provides a mechanism to label and
   return only the [<a href="#ref-MAIL" title='"Internet Message Format"'>MAIL</a>] header of a failed message.  The header is not
   the complete message and SHOULD NOT be returned using the message/
   <a href="./rfc822">rfc822</a> media type defined in [<a href="#ref-MIME-TYPES" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>MIME-TYPES</a>].  The returned header is
   useful for identifying the failed message and for diagnostics based
   on the Received header fields.

   The text/rfc822-headers media type is defined as follows:

   Type name:  text

   Subtype name:  <a href="./rfc822">rfc822</a>-headers

   Required parameters:  None

   Optional parameters:  None

   Encoding considerations:  7-bit is sufficient for normal mail
      headers, however, if the headers are broken or extended and
      require encoding to make them legal 7-bit content, they MAY be
      encoded with quoted-printable as defined in [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME</a>].

   The text/rfc822-headers body part SHOULD contain all the mail header
   fields from the message that caused the report.  The header includes
   all header fields prior to the first blank line in the message.  They
   include the MIME-Version and MIME content description fields.

   Registration of new media types for the purpose of creating a new
   report format SHOULD note in the Intended Usage section of the media
   type registration that the type being registered is suitable for use
   as a report-type (i.e., the second body part) in the context of this
   specification.

   IANA has updated the Media Type Registry to indicate that this memo
   contains the current definition of the multipart/report and text/
   <a href="./rfc822">rfc822</a>-headers media types, obsoleting [<a href="#ref-OLD-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>OLD-REPORT</a>].

   Automated use of report types without authentication presents several
   security issues.  Forging negative reports presents the opportunity
   for denial-of-service attacks when the reports are used for automated
   maintenance of directories or mailing lists.  Forging positive
   reports can cause the sender to incorrectly believe a message was
   delivered when it was not.

   A signature covering the entire multipart/report structure could be
   used to prevent such forgeries; such a signature scheme is, however,
   beyond the scope of this document.
