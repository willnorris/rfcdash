FYI: 1                                                       J. Reynolds
                                                                     ISI
                                                              March 1990

                    Introduction to the F.Y.I. Notes

Status of this Memo

   This RFC is the first in a new sub-series of RFCs called FYIs (For
   Your Information).  This memo provides information for the Internet
   community.  It does not specify any standard.  Distribution of this
   memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The FYI series of notes is designed to provide Internet users with a
   central repository of information about any topics which relate to
   the Internet.  FYIs topics may range from historical memos on "Why it
   was was done this way" to answers to commonly asked operational
   questions.

   The FYIs are intended for a wide audience.  Some FYIs will cater to
   beginners, while others will discuss more advanced topics.  An FYI
   may be submitted by anyone who has something to contribute and has
   the time to do so.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Why%20RFCs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Why RFCs</span>

   There are several reasons why the FYIs are part of the larger RFC
   series of notes.  The formost reason is that the distribution
   mechanisms for RFCs are tried and true.  Anyone who can get an RFC,
   can automatically get an FYI.  More importantly, anyone who knows of
   the RFC series, can easily find out about the FYIs.

   Another reason for making FYIs part of the RFC series is that the
   maintainance mechanisms for RFCs are already in place and funded.  It
   makes sense to maintain similar documents is a similar way.  After
   all, there have been informational RFCs before.

   Finally, the name RFC has come to carry a meaning with it.  There is
   credibility associated memos carrying the RFC label.  FYIs should
   share that respect.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1150">RFC 1150</a>                    F.Y.I. on F.Y.I.                  March 1990</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Format%20Rules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Format Rules</span>

   Since the FYIs are a part of the RFC series, they must conform to
   <a href="./rfc1111">RFC-1111</a> (Request for Comments on Request for Comments: Instructions
   to RFC Authors) with respect to format.  Ideally, they should be
   submitted in ASCII format, as described by <a href="#section-2">section 2</a>a, of <a href="./rfc1111">RFC-1111</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Status%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Status Statement</span>

   Each RFC must include on its first page the "Status of this Memo"
   section which contains a paragraph describing the intention of the
   RFC.  This section is meant to convey the status granted by the RFC
   Editor and the Internet Activities Board (IAB).  There are several
   reasons for publishing a memo as an RFC, for example, to make
   available some information for interested people, or to begin or
   continue a discussion of an interesting idea, or to make available
   the specification of a protocol.

   For example:

   This RFC is the first in a new sub-series of RFCs called FYIs (For
   Your Information).  This memo provides information for the Internet
   community.  It does not specify any standard.  Distribution of this
   memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Distribution%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Distribution Statement</span>

   Each FYI is to also include a "distribution statement".  As the
   purpose of the FYI series is to disseminate information, there is no
   reason for the distribution to be anything other than "unlimited".

   Typically, the distribution statement will simply be the sentence
   "Distribution of this memo is unlimited." appended to the "Status of
   this Memo" section.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   All FYIs must contain a section that discusses the security
   considerations of the procedures that are the main topic of the RFC.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Author%27s%20Address"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Author's Address</span>

   Each FYI must have at the very end a section giving the author's
   address, including the name and postal address, the telephone number,
   and the Internet email address.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1150">RFC 1150</a>                    F.Y.I. on F.Y.I.                  March 1990</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Relation%20to%20other%20FYIs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Relation to other FYIs</span>

   Sometimes an FYI adds information on a topic discussed in a previous
   FYI or completely replaces an earlier FYI.  There are two terms used
   for these cases respectively, UPDATES and OBSOLETES.  A document that
   obsoletes an earlier document can stand on its own.  A document that
   merely updates an earlier document cannot stand on its own; it is
   something that must be added to or inserted into the existing
   document, and has limited usefulness independently.

   UPDATES

      To be used as a reference from a new item that cannot be used
      alone (i.e., one that supplements a previous document), to refer
      to the previous document.  The newer publication is a part that
      will supplement or be added on to the existing document; e.g., an
      addendum, or separate, extra information that is to be added to
      the original document.

   OBSOLETES

      To be used to refer to an earlier document that is replaced by
      this document.  This document contains either revised information,
      or else all of the same information plus some new information,
      however extensive or brief that new information is; i.e., this
      document can be used alone, without reference to the older
      document.

   OBSOLETED-BY

      To be used to refer to the newer document that replaces the older
      document.

   UPDATED-BY

      To be used to refer to the newer document that adds information to
      the existing, still useful, document.

   All FYIs are submitted to the IETF User Services Working Group for
   review prior to their submission to the RFC Editor.

   New FYIs are announced to the RFC distribution list maintained by the
   SRI Network Information Center (NIC).  Contact the SRI-NIC to be
   added or deleted from this mailing list by sending an email message
   to RFC-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/11.%20%20Obtaining%20FYIs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11" id="section-11">11</a>.  Obtaining FYIs</span>

   FYIs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname
   FYI:mm.TXT, or RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT (where "mm" refers to the number of
   the FYI and "nnnn" refers to the number of the RFC).  Login with FTP,
   username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.  The NIC also provides an
   automatic mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address
   the request to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and in the subject field of the
   message indicate the FYI or RFC number, as in "Subject: FYI mm" or
   "Subject: RFC nnnn".
