             <span class="h1">TCP Sender Clarification for Persist Condition</span>

Abstract

   This document clarifies the Zero Window Probes (ZWPs) described in
   <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> ("Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers").
   In particular, it clarifies the actions that can be taken on
   connections that are experiencing the ZWP condition.  Rather than
   making a change to the standard, this document clarifies what has
   been until now a misinterpretation of the standard as specified in
   <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a>.

   <a href="#section-4.2.2.17">Section 4.2.2.17</a> of "Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication
   Layers" [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>] says:

      "A TCP MAY keep its offered receive window closed indefinitely.
      As long as the receiving TCP continues to send acknowledgments in
      response to the probe segments, the sending TCP MUST allow the
      connection to stay open.

      DISCUSSION:

         It is extremely important to remember that ACK (acknowledgment)
         segments that contain no data are not reliably transmitted by
         TCP".








<span class="grey">Bashyam, et al.               Informational                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6429">RFC 6429</a>                  TCP Persist Condition            December 2011</span>


   Therefore, zero window probing needs to be supported to prevent a
   connection from hanging forever if ACK segments that re-open the
   window are lost.  The condition where the sender goes into the Zero
   Window Probe (ZWP) mode is typically known as the 'persist
   condition'.

   This guidance is not intended to preclude resource management by the
   operating system or application, which may request that connections
   be aborted regardless of whether or not they are in the persist
   condition.  The TCP implementation needs to, of course, comply by
   aborting such connections.  If such resource management is not
   performed external to the protocol implementation, TCP
   implementations that misinterpret <a href="./rfc1122#section-4.2.2.17">Section 4.2.2.17 of [RFC1122]</a> have
   the potential to make systems vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS)
   [<a href="./rfc4732" title='"Internet Denial-of-Service Considerations"'>RFC4732</a>] scenarios where attackers tie up resources by keeping
   connections in the persist condition.

   Rather than making a change to the standard, this document clarifies
   what has been until now a misinterpretation of the standard as
   specified in <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>].

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document describes why implementations might not
   close connections merely because they are in the persist condition,
   yet need to still allow such connections to be closed on command.
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> outlines a simple attack on systems that do not
   sufficiently manage connections in this state.  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> concludes
   with a requirements-language clarification to the <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a>
   requirement.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Requirements%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Requirements Language</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Discussion%20of%20RFC%201122%20Requirement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Discussion of <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> Requirement</span>

   Per [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>], as long as the ACKs are being received for window
   probes, a connection can continue to stay in the persist condition.
   This is an important feature, because applications typically would
   want the TCP connection to stay open unless an application explicitly
   closes the connection.

   For example, take the case of a user running a network print job
   during which the printer runs out of paper and is waiting for the
   user to reload the paper tray (user intervention).  The printer may
   not be reading data from the printing application during this time.



<span class="grey">Bashyam, et al.               Informational                     [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6429">RFC 6429</a>                  TCP Persist Condition            December 2011</span>


   Although this may result in a prolonged ZWP state, it would be
   premature for TCP to take action on its own and close the printer
   connection merely due to its lack of progress.  Once the printer's
   paper tray is reloaded (which may be minutes, hours, or days later),
   the print job needs to be able to continue uninterrupted over the
   same TCP connection.

   However, systems that misinterpret <a href="./rfc1122#section-4.2.2.17">Section 4.2.2.17 of [RFC1122]</a> may
   fall victim to DoS attacks by not supporting sufficient mechanisms to
   allow release of system resources tied up by connections in the
   persist condition during times of resource exhaustion.  For example,
   take the case of a busy server where multiple (attacker) clients can
   advertise a zero window forever (by reliably acknowledging the ZWPs).
   This could eventually lead to resource exhaustion in the server
   system.  In such cases, the application or operating system would
   need to take appropriate action on the TCP connection to reclaim
   their resources and continue to maintain legitimate connections.

   The problem is applicable to TCP and TCP-derived flow-controlled
   transport protocols such as the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
   (SCTP).

   Clearly, a system needs to be robust to such attacks and allow
   connections in the persist condition to be aborted in the same way as
   any other connection.  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of this document provides the
   requisite clarification to permit such resource management.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Description%20of%20One%20Simple%20Attack"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Description of One Simple Attack</span>

   To illustrate a potential DoS scenario, consider the case where many
   client applications open TCP connections with an HTTP [<a href="./rfc2616" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>]
   server, and each sends a GET request for a large page and stops
   reading the response partway through.  This causes the client's TCP
   implementation to advertise a zero window to the server.  For every
   large HTTP response, the server is left holding on to the response
   data in its sending queue.  The amount of response data held will
   depend on the size of the send buffer and the advertised window.  If
   the clients never read the data in their receive queues and therefore
   do not clear the persist condition, the server will continue to hold
   that data indefinitely.  Since there may be a limit to the operating
   system kernel memory available for TCP buffers, this may result in
   DoS to legitimate connections by locking up the necessary resources.
   If the above scenario persists for an extended period of time, it
   will lead to starvation of TCP buffers and connection blocks, causing
   legitimate existing connections and new connection attempts to fail.

   A clever application needs to detect such attacks with connections
   that are not making progress, and could close these connections.

   However, some applications might have transferred all the data to the
   TCP socket and subsequently closed the socket, leaving the
   connections with no controlling process; such connections are
   referred to as orphaned connections.  These orphaned connections
   might be left holding the data indefinitely in their sending queue.

   The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) has released an
   advisory in this regard [<a href="#ref-VU723308" title='"TCP may keep its offered receive window closed indefinitely (RFC 1122)"'>VU723308</a>] and is making vendors aware of
   this DoS scenario.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Clarification%20Regarding%20RFC%201122%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Clarification Regarding <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> Requirements</span>

   As stated in [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>], a TCP implementation MUST NOT close a
   connection merely because it seems to be stuck in the ZWP or persist
   condition.  Though unstated in <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a>, but implicit for system
   robustness, a TCP implementation needs to allow connections in the
   ZWP or persist condition to be closed or aborted by their
   applications or other resource management routines in the operating
   system.

   An interface that allows an application to inform TCP on what to do
   when the connection stays in the persist condition, or that allows an
   application or other resource manager to query the health of the TCP
   connection, is considered outside the scope of this document.  All
   such techniques, however, are in complete compliance with TCP
   [<a href="./rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>] and [<a href="./rfc1122" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document discusses one system security consideration that is
   listed in "Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security
   Considerations" [<a href="./rfc3552" title='"Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations"'>RFC3552</a>].  In particular, it describes an
   inappropriate use of a system that is acting as a server for many
   users.  That use and a possible DoS attack are discussed in
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   This document limits itself to clarifying <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a>.  It does not
   discuss what can happen with orphaned connections and other possible
   mitigation techniques, as these are considered outside the scope of
   this document.

   This document was inspired by the recent discussions that took place
   regarding the TCP persist condition issue in the TCP Maintenance and
   Minor Extensions (TCPM) Working Group mailing list [<a href="#ref-TCPM" title='"TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (tcpm) - Charter"'>TCPM</a>].  The
   outcome of those discussions was to come up with a document that
   would clarify the intentions of the ZWP as discussed in <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a>.  We
