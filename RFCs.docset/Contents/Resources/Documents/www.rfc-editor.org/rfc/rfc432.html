                          <span class="h1">Network Logical Map</span>

   Attached is the logical map of the network as of December 30, 1972.
   The ovals indicate the host computers that we think are connected to
   each IMP, with the double oval implying an interface.  If there are
   any errors in the map or if your status vis-a-vis connected hosts, is
   going to change within the next few months, please contact:
