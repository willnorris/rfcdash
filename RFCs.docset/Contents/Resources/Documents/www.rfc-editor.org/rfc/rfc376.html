RFC # 376                                           8 August 1972
Categories:  F, G.3
Updates:  RFC #370
Obsoletes:  None

                          <span class="h1">NETWORK HOST STATUS</span>

     This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from
July 31 to August 4.

     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing
as they are presently intended to be users only.  Included here
are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,
MITRE, RADC, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, ARPA, and BBN*).
This category also includes the Network Control Center computer
(Network address 5) which is used solely for gathering statistics
from the Network.  Finally, included among these Hosts are the
following:

     Network
     Address                  Site                 Computer
     -------                  ----                 --------
         7                    Rand                 IBM-360/65
        73                    Harvard              PDP-1
       138                    Lincoln              TSP
        12                    Illinois             PDP-11
        19                    NBS                  PDP-11
        23                    USC                  IBM-360/44

     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status
for this period.

NOTE: Ellen Westheimer left BBN to return to school on August 4.
We therefore will discontinue the publication of these summaries.
It is my understanding that UCLA-NMC is considering the publica-
tion of similar, although more detailed, survey data in the near
future; I hope that data will serve in lieu of these reports.  In
addition, of course, MIT-DMCG has had survey information available
on line for some time (see RFC #308, NIC 9259.)

*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and
as such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being
used to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

    network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal
    IMP.)

F = Full (Destination Host opened a connection, informed user that
    all Network ports were in use, and immediately closed the connection.)

H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)

*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a Network
 Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to
 test NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection to the NETRJS
 logger indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.

#These sites advertise that they may not have their system available
 at these times.
