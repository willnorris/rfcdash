<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC5639">RFC5639</a>] specified a new set of elliptic curve groups over finite
   prime fields for use in cryptographic applications.  These groups,
   denoted as ECC Brainpool curves, were generated in a verifiably
   pseudo-random way and comply with the security requirements of
   relevant standards from ISO [<a href="#ref-ISO1" title="">ISO1</a>] [<a href="#ref-ISO2" title='"Information Technology -- Security Techniques -- Cryptographic Techniques Based on Elliptic Curves - Part 2: Digital signatures"'>ISO2</a>], ANSI [<a href="#ref-ANSI1" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>ANSI1</a>], NIST [<a href="#ref-FIPS" title='"Digital Signature Standard (DSS)"'>FIPS</a>],
   and the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group [<a href="#ref-SEC2" title='"Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters"'>SEC2</a>].

   While the ASN.1 object identifiers defined in <a href="./rfc5639">RFC 5639</a> allow usage of
   the ECC Brainpool curves in certificates and certificate revocation
   lists, their utilization for key exchange in IKEv2 [<a href="./rfc5996" title='"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC5996</a>] requires
   the definition and assignment of additional Diffie-Hellman Group
   Transform IDs in the respective IANA registry.  This document
   specifies transform IDs for four curves from <a href="./rfc5639">RFC 5639</a>, as well as the
   encoding of the key exchange payload and derivation of the shared
   secret when using one of these curves.

   In order to use the ECC Brainpool curves for key exchange within
   IKEv2, the Diffie-Hellman Group Transform IDs (Transform Type 4)
   listed in the following table have been registered with IANA
   [<a href="#ref-IANA-IKE2" title='"Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) Parameters"'>IANA-IKE2</a>].  The parameters associated with these curves are defined
   in <a href="./rfc5639">RFC 5639</a> [<a href="./rfc5639" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Brainpool Standard Curves and Curve Generation"'>RFC5639</a>].

                      |      Curve      | Transform ID |

                                  Table 1

   Test vectors for the groups defined by the ECC Brainpool curves are
   provided in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   In [<a href="./rfc5639" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Brainpool Standard Curves and Curve Generation"'>RFC5639</a>], for each random curve, a "twisted curve" (defined by a
   quadratic twist; see [<a href="#ref-HMV" title='"Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>HMV</a>]) is defined that offers the same level of
   security but potentially allows more efficient arithmetic due to the
   curve parameter A = -3.  The transform IDs listed in Table 1 also
   allow using the twisted curve corresponding to the specified random
   curve: points (x,y) of any of the listed curves can be efficiently
   transformed to the corresponding point (x',y') on the twisted curve
   of the same bit length -- and vice versa -- by setting (x',y') =
   (x*Z^2, y*Z^3) with the coefficient Z specified for that curve
   [<a href="./rfc5639" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Brainpool Standard Curves and Curve Generation"'>RFC5639</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Key%20Exchange%20Payload%20and%20Shared%20Secret"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Key Exchange Payload and Shared Secret</span>

   For the encoding of the key exchange payload and the derivation of
   the shared secret, the methods specified in [<a href="./rfc5903" title='"Elliptic Curve Groups modulo a Prime (ECP Groups) for IKE and IKEv2"'>RFC5903</a>] are adopted.

   In an Elliptic Curve Group over GF[P] (ECP) key exchange in IKEv2,
   the Diffie-Hellman public value passed in a key establishment (KE)
   payload consists of two components, x and y, corresponding to the
   coordinates of an elliptic curve point.  Each component MUST be
   computed from the corresponding coordinate using the FieldElement-to-
   OctetString conversion method specified in [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>] and MUST have a bit

   length as indicated in Table 2.  This length is enforced by the
   FieldElement-to-OctetString conversion method, if necessary, by
   prepending the value with zeros.

   Note: The FieldElement-to-OctetString conversion method specified in
   [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>] is equivalent to applying the conversion between integers and
   octet strings (as described in <a href="./rfc6090#section-6">Section 6 of [RFC6090]</a>) after
   representing the field element as an integer in the interval
   [0, p-1].

                                  Table 2

   From these components, the key exchange payload MUST be computed as
   the concatenation of the x- and y-coordinates.  Hence, the key
   exchange payload has the bit length indicated in Table 2.

   The Diffie-Hellman shared secret value consists only of the x value.
   In particular, the shared secret value MUST be computed from the
   x-coordinate of the Diffie-Hellman common value using the
   FieldElement-to-OctetString conversion method specified in [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>] and
   MUST have bit length as indicated in Table 2.

   The security considerations of [<a href="./rfc5996" title='"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC5996</a>] apply accordingly.

   In order to thwart certain active attacks, the validity of the other
   peer's public Diffie-Hellman value (x,y) recovered from the received
   key exchange payload needs to be verified.  In particular, it MUST be
   verified that the x- and y-coordinates of the public value satisfy
   the curve equation.  For additional information, we refer the reader
   to [<a href="./rfc6989" title='"Additional Diffie-Hellman Tests for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC6989</a>].

   The confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of a secure
   communication based on IKEv2 are limited by the weakest cryptographic
   primitive applied.  In order to achieve a maximum security level when

   using one of the elliptic curves from Table 1 for key exchange, the
   following should be chosen according to the recommendations of
   [<a href="#ref-NIST800-57" title='"Recommendation for Key Management -- Part 1: General (Revised)"'>NIST800-57</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5639" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Brainpool Standard Curves and Curve Generation"'>RFC5639</a>]:

   o  key derivation function

   o  algorithms and key lengths of symmetric encryption and message
      authentication

   o  algorithm, bit length, and hash function used for signature
      generation

   Furthermore, the private Diffie-Hellman keys should be selected with
   the same bit length as the order of the group generated by the base
   point G and with approximately maximum entropy.

   Implementations of elliptic curve cryptography for IKEv2 could be
   susceptible to side-channel attacks.  Particular care should be taken
   for implementations that internally use the corresponding twisted
   curve to take advantage of an efficient arithmetic for the special
   parameters (A = -3): although the twisted curve itself offers the
   same level of security as the corresponding random curve (through
   mathematical equivalence), an arithmetic based on small curve
   parameters could be harder to protect against side-channel attacks.
   General guidance on resistance of elliptic curve cryptography
   implementations against side-channel attacks is given in [<a href="#ref-BSI1" title='"Minimum Requirements for Evaluating Side-Channel Attack Resistance of Elliptic Curve Implementations"'>BSI1</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-HMV" title='"Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>HMV</a>].

   This section provides some test vectors, for example, Diffie-Hellman
   key exchanges using each of the curves defined in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.  The
   following notation is used in the subsequent subsections:

      d_A: the secret key of party A

      x_qA: the x-coordinate of the public key of party A

      y_qA: the y-coordinate of the public key of party A

      d_B: the secret key of party B

      x_qB: the x-coordinate of the public key of party B

      y_qB: the y-coordinate of the public key of party B

      x_Z: the x-coordinate of the shared secret that results from
      completion of the Diffie-Hellman computation

      y_Z: the y-coordinate of the shared secret that results from
      completion of the Diffie-Hellman computation

   The field elements x_qA, y_qA, x_qB, y_qB, x_Z, and y_Z are
   represented as hexadecimal values using the FieldElement-to-
   OctetString conversion method specified in [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].
