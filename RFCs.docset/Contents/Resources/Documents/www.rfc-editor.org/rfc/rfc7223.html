   This document defines a YANG [<a href="./rfc6020" title='"YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6020</a>] data model for the management
   of network interfaces.  It is expected that interface-type-specific
   data models augment the generic interfaces data model defined in this
   document.

   Network interfaces are central to the management of many Internet
   protocols.  Thus, it is important to establish a common data model
   for how interfaces are identified, configured, and monitored.

   The data model includes configuration data and state data (status
   information and counters for the collection of statistics).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The following terms are used within this document:

   o  system-controlled interface: An interface is said to be system-
      controlled if the system creates and deletes the interface
      independently of what has been explicitly configured.  Examples
      are interfaces representing physical hardware that appear and
      disappear when hardware (e.g., a line card or hot-pluggable
      wireless interface) is added or removed.  System-controlled
      interfaces may also appear if a certain functionality is enabled
      (e.g., a loopback interface might appear if the IP protocol stack
      is enabled).

   o  user-controlled interface: An interface is said to be user-
      controlled if the creation of the interface is controlled by
      adding explicit interface configuration to the running
      configuration datastore and the removal of the interface is
      controlled by removing explicit interface configuration from the
      running configuration datastore.  Examples are VLAN interfaces
      configured on a system-controlled Ethernet interface.

   The following terms are defined in [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [<a href="./rfc6020" title='"YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6020</a>] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   o  presence container

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Objectives"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Objectives</span>

   This section describes some of the design objectives for the model
   presented in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   o  It is recognized that existing implementations will have to map
      the interface data model defined in this memo to their proprietary
      native data model.  To facilitate such mappings, the data model
      should be simple.

   o  The data model should be suitable for new implementations to use
      as is, without requiring a mapping to a different native model.

   o  References to interfaces should be as simple as possible,
      preferably by using a single leafref.

   o  The mapping to ifIndex [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>] used by the Simple Network
      Management Protocol (SNMP) to identify interfaces must be clear.

   o  The model must support interface layering: both (1) simple
      layering, where one interface is layered on top of exactly one
      other interface, and (2) more complex scenarios, where one
      interface results from the aggregation of N other interfaces or
      when N interfaces are multiplexed over one other interface.

   o  The data model should support the pre-provisioning of interface
      configuration, i.e., it should be possible to configure an
      interface whose physical interface hardware is not present on the
      device.  It is recommended that devices that support dynamic
      addition and removal of physical interfaces also support
      pre-provisioning.

   o  The data model should support physical interfaces as well as
      logical interfaces.

   o  The data model should include read-only counters in order to
      gather statistics for sent and received octets and packets,
      received packets with errors, and packets that could not be sent
      due to errors.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20The%20Interface%20Lists"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  The Interface Lists</span>

   The data model for interfaces presented in this document uses a flat
   list of interfaces.  Each interface in the list is identified by its
   name.  Furthermore, each interface has a mandatory "type" leaf.

   The "iana-if-type" module [<a href="./rfc7224" title='"IANA Interface Type YANG Module"'>RFC7224</a>] defines YANG identities for the
   interface types in the IANA-maintained "ifType definitions" registry.

   There is one list of configured interfaces ("/interfaces/interface"),
   and a separate list for the operational state of all interfaces
   ("/interfaces-state/interface").

   It is expected that interface-type-specific data models augment the
   interface lists and possibly use the "type" leaf to make the
   augmentation conditional.

   As an example of such an interface-type-specific augmentation,
   consider this YANG snippet.  For a more complete example, see
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

     import interfaces {
         prefix "if";
     }
     import iana-if-type {
       prefix ianaift;
     }

     augment "/if:interfaces/if:interface" {
         when "if:type = 'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd'";

         container ethernet {
             leaf duplex {
                 ...
             }
         }
     }

   For system-controlled interfaces, the "name" is the device-specific
   name of the interface.  The 'config false' list
   "/interfaces-state/interface" contains all existing interfaces on the
   device.

   If the device supports arbitrarily named user-controlled interfaces,
   the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) server advertises the
   "arbitrary-names" feature.  If the device does not advertise this
   feature, the names of user-controlled interfaces MUST match the
   device's naming scheme.  How a client can learn the naming scheme of
   such devices is outside the scope of this document.  See Appendices
   E.1 and E.2 for examples.

   When a system-controlled interface is created by the system, the
   system tries to apply the interface configuration in "/interfaces/
   interface" with the same name as the new interface.  If no such
   interface configuration is found, or if the configured type does not
   match the real interface type, the system creates the interface
   without applying explicit configuration.

   When a user-controlled interface is created, the configuration
   determines the name of the interface.

   Depending on the operating system and the physical attachment point
   to which a network interface may be attached or removed, it may be
   impossible for an implementation to provide predictable and
   consistent names for system-controlled interfaces across insertion/
   removal cycles as well as in anticipation of initial insertion.  The
   ability to provide configurations for such interfaces is therefore
   dependent on the implementation and cannot be assumed in all cases.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Interface%20References"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Interface References</span>

   An interface is identified by its name, which is unique within the
   server.  This property is captured in the "interface-ref" and
   "interface-state-ref" typedefs, which other YANG modules SHOULD use
   when they need to reference a configured interface or operationally
   used interface, respectively.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Interface%20Layering"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Interface Layering</span>

   There is no generic mechanism for how an interface is configured to
   be layered on top of some other interface.  It is expected that
   interface-type-specific models define their own data nodes for
   interface layering by using "interface-ref" types to reference
   lower layers.

   Below is an example of a model with such nodes.  For a more complete
   example, see <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

     import interfaces {
         prefix "if";
     }
     import iana-if-type {
       prefix ianaift;
     }

     augment "/if:interfaces/if:interface" {
         when "if:type = 'ianaift:ieee8023adLag'";

         leaf-list slave-if {
             type if:interface-ref;
             must "/if:interfaces/if:interface[if:name = current()]"
                + "/if:type = 'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd'" {
                 description
                     "The type of a slave interface must be
                      'ethernetCsmacd'.";
             }
         }
         // other bonding config params, failover times, etc.
     }

   While the interface layering is configured in interface-type-specific
   models, two generic state data leaf-lists, "higher-layer-if" and
   "lower-layer-if", represent a read-only view of the interface
   layering hierarchy.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20IF-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Relationship to the IF-MIB</span>

   If the device implements the IF-MIB [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>], each entry in the "/
   interfaces-state/interface" list is typically mapped to one ifEntry.
   The "if-index" leaf MUST contain the value of the corresponding
   ifEntry's ifIndex.

   In most cases, the "name" of an "/interfaces-state/interface" entry
   is mapped to ifName.  The IF-MIB allows two different ifEntries to
   have the same ifName.  Devices that support this feature and also
   support the data model defined in this document cannot have a 1-1
   mapping between the "name" leaf and ifName.

   The configured "description" of an "interface" has traditionally been
   mapped to ifAlias in some implementations.  This document allows this
   mapping, but implementers should be aware of the differences in the
   value space and persistence for these objects.  See the YANG module
   definition of the leaf "description" in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> for details.

   The IF-MIB also defines the writable object ifPromiscuousMode.  Since
   this object typically is not implemented as a configuration object by
   SNMP agents, it is not mapped to the "ietf-interfaces" module.

   The ifMtu object from the IF-MIB is not mapped to the
   "ietf-interfaces" module.  It is expected that interface-type-
   specific YANG modules provide interface-type-specific MTU leafs by
   augmenting the "ietf-interfaces" model.

   There are a number of counters in the IF-MIB that exist in two
   versions: one with 32 bits and one with 64 bits.  The 64-bit versions
   were added to support high-speed interfaces with a data rate greater
   than 20,000,000 bits/second.  Today's implementations generally
   support such high-speed interfaces, and hence only 64-bit counters
   are provided in this data model.  Note that NETCONF and SNMP may
   differ in the time granularity in which they provide access to the
   counters.  For example, it is common that SNMP implementations cache
   counter values for some time.

   The objects ifDescr and ifConnectorPresent from the IF-MIB are not
   mapped to the "ietf-interfaces" module.

              For system-controlled interfaces, this leaf is the
              device-specific name of the interface.  The 'config false'
              list /interfaces-state/interface contains the currently
              existing interfaces on the device.

              If a client tries to create configuration for a
              system-controlled interface that is not present in the
              /interfaces-state/interface list, the server MAY reject
              the request if the implementation does not support
              pre-provisioning of interfaces or if the name refers to
              an interface that can never exist in the system.  A
              NETCONF server MUST reply with an rpc-error with the
              error-tag 'invalid-value' in this case.

              If the device supports pre-provisioning of interface
              configuration, the 'pre-provisioning' feature is
              advertised.

              If the device allows arbitrarily named user-controlled
              interfaces, the 'arbitrary-names' feature is advertised.

              When a configured user-controlled interface is created by
              the system, it is instantiated with the same name in the
              /interface-state/interface list.";

           type string;

             "A textual description of the interface.

              A server implementation MAY map this leaf to the ifAlias
              MIB object.  Such an implementation needs to use some
              mechanism to handle the differences in size and characters
              allowed between this leaf and ifAlias.  The definition of
              such a mechanism is outside the scope of this document.

              Since ifAlias is defined to be stored in non-volatile
              storage, the MIB implementation MUST map ifAlias to the
              value of 'description' in the persistently stored
              datastore.

              Specifically, if the device supports ':startup', when
              ifAlias is read the device MUST return the value of
              'description' in the 'startup' datastore, and when it is
              written, it MUST be written to the 'running' and 'startup'
              datastores.  Note that it is up to the implementation to

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [<a href="./rfc6242" title='"Using the NETCONF Protocol over Secure Shell (SSH)"'>RFC6242</a>].  The NETCONF access control model
   [<a href="./rfc6536" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Access Control Model"'>RFC6536</a>] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., &lt;edit-config&gt;)

   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /interfaces/interface:  This list specifies the configured interfaces
      on a device.  Unauthorized access to this list could cause the
      device to ignore packets it should receive and process.

   /interfaces/interface/enabled:  This leaf controls whether an
      interface is enabled or not.  Unauthorized access to this leaf
      could cause the device to ignore packets it should receive and
      process.

   This section gives a simple example of how an Ethernet interface
   module could be defined.  It demonstrates how media-specific
   configuration parameters can be conditionally augmented to the
   generic interface list.  It also shows how operational state
   parameters can be conditionally augmented to the operational
   interface list.  The example is not intended as a complete module for
   Ethernet configuration.

   This section gives examples of some implementation strategies.

   The examples make use of the example data model "ex-vlan" (see
   <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>) to show how user-controlled interfaces can be configured.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/E.1.%20%20Router%20with%20Restricted%20Interface%20Names"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-E.1" id="appendix-E.1">E.1</a>.  Router with Restricted Interface Names</span>

   In this example, a router has support for 4 line cards, each with 8
   ports.  The slots for the cards are physically numbered from 0 to 3,
   and the ports on each card from 0 to 7.  Each card has Fast Ethernet
   or Gigabit Ethernet ports.

   The device-specific names for these physical interfaces are
   "fastethernet-N/M" or "gigabitethernet-N/M".

   The name of a VLAN interface is restricted to the form
   "&lt;physical-interface-name&gt;.&lt;subinterface-number&gt;".

   It is assumed that the operator is aware of this naming scheme.  The
   implementation auto-initializes the value for "type" based on the
   interface name.

   The NETCONF server does not advertise the "arbitrary-names" feature
   in the &lt;hello&gt; message.

   An operator can configure a physical interface by sending an
   &lt;edit-config&gt; containing:

     &lt;interface nc:operation="create"&gt;
       &lt;name&gt;fastethernet-1/0&lt;/name&gt;
     &lt;/interface&gt;

   When the server processes this request, it will set the leaf "type"
   to "ianaift:ethernetCsmacd".  Thus, if the client performs a
   &lt;get-config&gt; right after the &lt;edit-config&gt; above, it will get:

     &lt;interface&gt;
       &lt;name&gt;fastethernet-1/0&lt;/name&gt;
       &lt;type&gt;ianaift:ethernetCsmacd&lt;/type&gt;
     &lt;/interface&gt;

   The client can configure a VLAN interface by sending an &lt;edit-config&gt;
   containing:

     &lt;interface nc:operation="create"&gt;
       &lt;name&gt;fastethernet-1/0.10005&lt;/name&gt;
       &lt;type&gt;ianaift:l2vlan&lt;/type&gt;
       &lt;vlan:base-interface&gt;fastethernet-1/0&lt;/vlan:base-interface&gt;
       &lt;vlan:vlan-id&gt;5&lt;/vlan:vlan-id&gt;
     &lt;/interface&gt;

   If the client tries to change the type of the physical interface with
   an &lt;edit-config&gt; containing:

     &lt;interface nc:operation="merge"&gt;
       &lt;name&gt;fastethernet-1/0&lt;/name&gt;
       &lt;type&gt;ianaift:tunnel&lt;/type&gt;
     &lt;/interface&gt;

   then the server will reply with an "invalid-value" error, since the
   new type does not match the name.

   In this example, a router has support for 4 line cards, each with 8
   ports.  The slots for the cards are physically numbered from 0 to 3,
   and the ports on each card from 0 to 7.  Each card has Fast Ethernet
   or Gigabit Ethernet ports.

   The device-specific names for these physical interfaces are
   "fastethernet-N/M" or "gigabitethernet-N/M".

   The implementation does not restrict the user-controlled interface
   names.  This allows an operator to more easily apply the interface
   configuration to a different interface.  However, the additional
   level of indirection also makes it a bit more complex to map
   interface names found in other protocols to configuration entries.

   The NETCONF server advertises the "arbitrary-names" feature in the
   &lt;hello&gt; message.

   Physical interfaces are configured as in <a href="#appendix-E.1">Appendix E.1</a>.

   An operator can configure a VLAN interface by sending an
   &lt;edit-config&gt; containing:

     &lt;interface nc:operation="create"&gt;
       &lt;name&gt;acme-interface&lt;/name&gt;
       &lt;type&gt;ianaift:l2vlan&lt;/type&gt;
       &lt;vlan:base-interface&gt;fastethernet-1/0&lt;/vlan:base-interface&gt;
       &lt;vlan:vlan-id&gt;5&lt;/vlan:vlan-id&gt;
     &lt;/interface&gt;

   If necessary, the operator can move the configuration named
   "acme-interface" over to a different physical interface with an
   &lt;edit-config&gt; containing:

     &lt;interface nc:operation="merge"&gt;
       &lt;name&gt;acme-interface&lt;/name&gt;
       &lt;vlan:base-interface&gt;fastethernet-1/1&lt;/vlan:base-interface&gt;
     &lt;/interface&gt;

   In this example, an Ethernet switch has a number of ports, each
   identified by a simple port number.

   The device-specific names for the physical interfaces are numbers
   that match the physical port number.

   An operator can configure a physical interface by sending an
   &lt;edit-config&gt; containing:

     &lt;interface nc:operation="create"&gt;
       &lt;name&gt;6&lt;/name&gt;
     &lt;/interface&gt;

   When the server processes this request, it will set the leaf "type"
   to "ianaift:ethernetCsmacd".  Thus, if the client performs a
   &lt;get-config&gt; right after the &lt;edit-config&gt; above, it will get:

     &lt;interface&gt;
