Security Implications of IPv6 Fragmentation with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

Abstract

   This document analyzes the security implications of employing IPv6
   fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery (ND) messages.  It updates <a href="./rfc4861">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc4861">4861</a> such that use of the IPv6 Fragmentation Header is forbidden in
   all Neighbor Discovery messages, thus allowing for simple and
   effective countermeasures for Neighbor Discovery attacks.  Finally,
   it discusses the security implications of using IPv6 fragmentation
   with SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) and formally updates <a href="./rfc3971">RFC 3971</a>
   to provide advice regarding how the aforementioned security
   implications can be mitigated.

   The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is specified in <a href="./rfc4861">RFC 4861</a>
   [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  It is used by both hosts and routers.  Its functions
   include Neighbor Discovery (ND), Router Discovery (RD), address
   autoconfiguration, address resolution, Neighbor Unreachability
   Detection (NUD), Duplicate Address Detection (DAD), and redirection.

   Many of the possible attacks against the Neighbor Discovery Protocol
   are discussed in detail in [<a href="./rfc3756" title='"IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats"'>RFC3756</a>].  In order to mitigate the
   aforementioned possible attacks, SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) was
   standardized.  SEND employs a number of mechanisms to certify the
   origin of Neighbor Discovery packets and the authority of routers,
   and to protect Neighbor Discovery packets from being the subject of
   modification or replay attacks.

   However, a number of factors, such as the high administrative
   overhead of deploying trust anchors and the unavailability of SEND
   implementations for many widely deployed operating systems, make SEND
   hard to deploy [<a href="#ref-Gont-DPSC" title='"Results of a Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)"'>Gont-DPSC</a>].  Thus, in many general scenarios, it may
   be necessary and/or convenient to use other mitigation techniques for
   NDP-based attacks.  The following mitigations are currently available
   for NDP attacks:

   o  Static Access Control Lists (ACLs) in switches

   o  Layer-2 filtering of Neighbor Discovery packets (such as RA-Guard
      [<a href="./rfc6105" title='"IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard"'>RFC6105</a>])

   o  Neighbor Discovery monitoring tools (e.g., NDPMon [<a href="#ref-NDPMon" title='"NDPMon - IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol Monitor"'>NDPMon</a>] and
      ramond [<a href="#ref-ramond" title='"ramond"'>ramond</a>])

   o  Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

   IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) is a mitigation technique
   for attack vectors based on ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
   messages.  It is meant to block attack packets at a layer-2 device
   before the attack packets actually reach the target nodes.  [<a href="./rfc6104" title='"Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement Problem Statement"'>RFC6104</a>]
   describes the problem statement of "Rogue IPv6 Router
   Advertisements", and [<a href="./rfc6105" title='"IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard"'>RFC6105</a>] specifies the "IPv6 Router
   Advertisement Guard" functionality.

   Tools such as NDPMon [<a href="#ref-NDPMon" title='"NDPMon - IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol Monitor"'>NDPMon</a>] and ramond [<a href="#ref-ramond" title='"ramond"'>ramond</a>] aim to monitor
   Neighbor Discovery traffic in the hopes of detecting possible attacks
   when there are discrepancies between the information advertised in
   Neighbor Discovery packets and the information stored on a local
   database.

   Some Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can mitigate Neighbor
   Discovery attacks.  We recommend that Intrusion Prevention Systems
   implement mitigations for NDP attacks.

   IPv6 fragmentation introduces a key challenge for these mitigation or
   monitoring techniques, since it is trivial for an attacker to conceal
   his attack by fragmenting his packets into multiple fragments.  This
   may limit or even eliminate the effectiveness of the aforementioned
   mitigation or monitoring techniques.  Recent work [<a href="#ref-CPNI-IPv6" title='"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)"'>CPNI-IPv6</a>]
   indicates that current implementations of the aforementioned
   mitigations for NDP attacks can be trivially evaded.  For example, as
   noted in [<a href="#ref-RA-GUARD" title='"Implementation Advice for IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard)"'>RA-GUARD</a>], current RA-Guard implementations can be
   trivially evaded by fragmenting the attack packets into multiple
   fragments, such that the layer-2 device cannot find all the necessary
   information to perform packet filtering in the same packet.  While
   Neighbor Discovery monitoring tools could (in theory) implement IPv6

   fragment reassembly, this is usually an arms-race with the attacker
   (an attacker can generate lots of forged fragments to "confuse" the
   monitoring tools), and therefore the aforementioned tools are
   unreliable for the detection of such attacks.

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> analyzes the use of IPv6 fragmentation in traditional
   Neighbor Discovery.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> analyzes the use of IPv6 fragmentation
   in SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND).  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> provides the
   rationale for forbidding the use of IPv6 fragmentation with Neighbor
   Discovery.  <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> formally updates <a href="./rfc4861">RFC 4861</a> such that the use of
   the IPv6 Fragment Header with traditional Neighbor Discovery is
   forbidden, and also formally updates <a href="./rfc3971">RFC 3971</a> by providing advice on
   the use of IPv6 fragmentation with SEND.  <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> provides
   operational advice about interoperability problems arising from the
   use of IPv6 fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Traditional%20Neighbor%20Discovery%20and%20IPv6%20Fragmentation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Traditional Neighbor Discovery and IPv6 Fragmentation</span>

   The only potential use case for IPv6 fragmentation with traditional
   (i.e., non-SEND) IPv6 Neighbor Discovery would be that in which a
   Router Advertisement must include a large number of options (Prefix
   Information Options, Route Information Options, etc.).  However, this
   could still be achieved without employing fragmentation, by splitting
   the aforementioned information into multiple Router Advertisement
   messages.

      Some Neighbor Discovery implementations are known to silently
      ignore Router Advertisement messages that employ fragmentation.
      Therefore, splitting the necessary information into multiple RA
      messages (rather than sending a large RA message that is
      fragmented into multiple IPv6 fragments) is probably desirable
      even from an interoperability point of view.

   Thus, avoiding the use of IPv6 fragmentation in traditional Neighbor
   Discovery would greatly simplify and improve the effectiveness of
   monitoring and filtering Neighbor Discovery traffic and would also
   prevent interoperability problems with those implementations that do
   not support fragmentation in Neighbor Discovery messages.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20SEcure%20Neighbor%20Discovery%20%28SEND%29%20and%20IPv6%20Fragmentation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) and IPv6 Fragmentation</span>

   SEND packets typically carry more information than traditional
   Neighbor Discovery packets: for example, they include additional
   options such as the Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) option
   and the RSA signature option.

   When SEND nodes employ any of the Neighbor Discovery messages
   specified in [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>], the situation is roughly the same: if more
   information than would fit in a non-fragmented Neighbor Discovery
   packet needs to be sent, it should be split into multiple Neighbor
   Discovery messages (such that IPv6 fragmentation is avoided).

   However, Certification Path Advertisement (CPA) messages (specified
   in [<a href="./rfc3971" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC3971</a>]) pose a different situation, since the Certificate
   Option they include typically contains much more information than any
   other Neighbor Discovery option.  For example, <a href="./rfc3971#appendix-C">AppendixÂ C of
   [RFC3971]</a> reports Certification Path Advertisement messages from 1050
   to 1066 bytes on an Ethernet link layer.  Since the size of CPA
   messages could potentially exceed the MTU of the local link,
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> recommends that fragmented CPA messages be processed
   normally, but discourages the use of keys that would result in
   fragmented CPA messages.

   It should be noted that relying on fragmentation opens the door to a
   variety of IPv6 fragmentation-based attacks against SEND.  In
   particular, if an attacker is located on the same broadcast domain as
   the victim host and Certification Path Advertisement messages employ
   IPv6 fragmentation, it would be trivial for the attacker to forge
   IPv6 fragments such that they result in "Fragment ID collisions",
   causing both the attack fragments and the legitimate fragments to be
   discarded by the victim node.  This would eventually cause
   Authorization Delegation Discovery (<a href="./rfc3971#section-6">SectionÂ 6 of [RFC3971]</a>) to fail,
   thus leading the host to (depending on local configuration) either
   fall back to unsecured mode or reject the corresponding Router
   Advertisement messages (possibly resulting in a denial of service).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Rationale%20for%20Forbidding%20IPv6%20Fragmentation%20in%20Neighbor%20Discovery"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Rationale for Forbidding IPv6 Fragmentation in Neighbor Discovery</span>

   A number of considerations should be made regarding the use of IPv6
   fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery:

   o  A significant number of existing implementations already silently
      drop fragmented ND messages, so the use of IPv6 fragmentation may
      hamper interoperability among IPv6 implementations.

   o  Although it is possible to build an ND message that needs to be
      fragmented, such packets are unlikely to exist in the real world
      because of the large number of options that would be required for
      the resulting packet to exceed the minimum IPv6 MTU of
      1280 octets.

   o  If an ND message was so large as to need fragmentation, there is
      an option to distribute the same information amongst more than one
      message, each of which is small enough to not need fragmentation.

   Thus, forbidding the use of IPv6 fragmentation with Neighbor
   Discovery normalizes existing behavior and sets the expectations of
   all implementations to the existing lowest common denominator.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Specification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Specification</span>

   o  Neighbor Solicitation

   o  Neighbor Advertisement

   o  Router Solicitation

   o  Router Advertisement

   o  Redirect

   o  Certification Path Solicitation

   Nodes SHOULD NOT employ IPv6 fragmentation for sending the following

   o  Certification Path Advertisement

   Nodes MUST silently ignore the following Neighbor Discovery and
   SEcure Neighbor Discovery messages if the packets carrying them
   include an IPv6 Fragmentation Header:

   o  Neighbor Solicitation

   o  Neighbor Advertisement

   o  Router Solicitation

   o  Certification Path Solicitation

   Nodes SHOULD normally process the following messages when the packets
   carrying them include an IPv6 Fragmentation Header:

   o  Certification Path Advertisement

   SEND nodes SHOULD NOT employ keys that would result in fragmented CPA
   messages.

   An operator detecting that Neighbor Discovery traffic is being
   silently dropped should find whether the corresponding Neighbor
   Discovery messages are employing IPv6 fragmentation.  If they are, it
   is likely that the devices receiving such packets are silently
   dropping them merely because they employ IPv6 fragmentation.  In such
   a case, an operator should check whether the sending device has an
   option to prevent fragmentation of ND messages, and/or see whether it
   is possible to reduce the options carried on such messages.  We note
   that solving this (unlikely) problem might require a software upgrade
   to a version that does not employ IPv6 fragmentation with Neighbor
   Discovery.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The IPv6 Fragmentation Header can be leveraged to circumvent network
   monitoring tools and current implementations of mechanisms such as
   RA-Guard [<a href="#ref-RA-GUARD" title='"Implementation Advice for IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard)"'>RA-GUARD</a>].  By updating the relevant specifications such
   that the IPv6 Fragment Header is not allowed in any Neighbor
   Discovery messages except Certification Path Advertisement messages,
   protection of local nodes against Neighbor Discovery attacks, as well
   as the monitoring of Neighbor Discovery traffic, are greatly
   simplified.

   As noted in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, the use of SEND could potentially result in
   fragmented Certification Path Advertisement messages, thus allowing
   an attacker to employ IPv6 fragmentation-based attacks against such
   messages.  Therefore, to the extent that is possible, such use of
   fragmentation should be avoided.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Message%20Size%20When%20Carrying%20Certificates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Message Size When Carrying Certificates</span>

   This section aims at estimating the size of normal Certification Path
   Advertisement messages.

   Considering a Certification Path Advertisement (CPA) such as that of
   <a href="./rfc3971#appendix-C">AppendixÂ C of [RFC3971]</a> (certification path length of 4, between 1
   and 4 address prefix extensions, and a key length of 1024 bits), the
   certificate lengths range between 864 and 888 bytes (and the
   corresponding Ethernet packets from 1050 to 1066 bytes) [<a href="./rfc3971" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC3971</a>].

   Updating the aforementioned packet size to account for the larger
   (2048 bits) keys required by [<a href="./rfc6494" title='"Certificate Profile and Certificate Management for SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC6494</a>] results in packet sizes
   ranging from 1127 to 1238 bytes, which are smaller than the minimum
   IPv6 MTU (1280 bytes) and much smaller than the ubiquitous Ethernet
   MTU (1500 bytes).

   However, we note that packet sizes may vary depending on a number of
   factors, including:

   o  the number of prefixes included in the certificate

   o  the length of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) in Trust Anchor
      (TA) options [<a href="./rfc3971" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC3971</a>] (if present)

   If larger key sizes (e.g., 4096 bits) are required in the future, a
   larger MTU size might be required to convey such information in
   Neighbor Discovery packets without the need to employ fragmentation.
