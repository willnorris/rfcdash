Abstract

   This document defines a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP-for-IPv4) option that contains a list of domain names or IPv4
   addresses that can be mapped to one or more Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) outbound proxy servers.  This is one of the many
   methods that a SIP client can use to obtain the addresses of such a
   local SIP server.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Terminology</span>

        DHCP client: A DHCP [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>1</a>] client is an Internet host that uses
             DHCP to obtain configuration parameters such as a network
             address.

        DHCP server: A DHCP server is an Internet host that returns
             configuration parameters to DHCP clients.

        SIP server: As defined in <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>2</a>].  This server MUST be an
            outbound proxy server, as defined in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP Servers"'>3</a>].  In the context of
            this document, a SIP server refers to the host the SIP
            server is running on.

        SIP client: As defined in <a href="./rfc3261">RFC 3261</a>.  The client can be a user
            agent client or the client portion of a proxy server.  In
            the context of this document, a SIP client refers to the
            host the SIP client is running on.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3361">RFC 3361</a>             DHCPv4 Option for SIP Servers           August 2002</span>


   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to indicate requirement levels"'>4</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [<a href="#ref-2" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>2</a>] is an application-layer
   control protocol that can establish, modify and terminate multimedia
   sessions or calls.  A SIP system has a number of logical components:
   user agents, proxy servers, redirect servers and registrars.  User
   agents MAY contain SIP clients, proxy servers always do.

   This document specifies a DHCP option [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>1</a>,<a href="#ref-5" title='"DHCP options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions"'>5</a>] that allows SIP clients
   to locate a local SIP server that is to be used for all outbound SIP
   requests, a so-called outbound proxy server.  (SIP clients MAY
   contact the address identified in the SIP URL directly, without
   involving a local SIP server.  However in some circumstances, for
   example, when firewalls are present, SIP clients need to use a local
   server for outbound requests.)  This is one of many possible
   solutions for locating the outbound SIP server; manual configuration
   is an example of another.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20SIP%20Server%20DHCP%20Option"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  SIP Server DHCP Option</span>

   The SIP server DHCP option carries either a 32-bit (binary) IPv4
   address or, preferably, a DNS (<a href="./rfc1035">RFC 1035</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>6</a>]) fully-qualified domain
   name to be used by the SIP client to locate a SIP server.

   The option has two encodings, specified by the encoding byte ('enc')
   that follows the code byte.  If the encoding byte has the value 0, it
   is followed by a list of domain names, as described below (<a href="#section-3.1">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>).  If the encoding byte has the value 1, it is followed by one or
   more IPv4 addresses (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).  All implementations MUST support
   both encodings.  The 'Len' field indicates the total number of octets
   in the option following the 'Len' field, including the encoding byte.

   A DHCP server MUST NOT mix the two encodings in the same DHCP
   message, even if it sends two different instances of the same option.
   Attempts to do so would result in incorrect client behavior as DHCP
   processing rules call for the concatenation of multiple instances of
   an option into a single option prior to processing the option [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Encoding Long DHCP Options"'>7</a>].

   The code for this option is 120.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1%20Domain%20Name%20List"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a> Domain Name List</span>

   If the 'enc' byte has a value of 0, the encoding byte is followed by
   a sequence of labels, encoded according to <a href="./rfc1035#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of RFC 1035</a>
   [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>6</a>], quoted below:

         Domain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence
         of labels.  Each label is represented as a one octet length
         field followed by that number of octets.  Since every domain
         name ends with the null label of the root, a domain name is
         terminated by a length byte of zero.  The high order two bits
         of every length octet must be zero, and the remaining six bits
         of the length field limit the label to 63 octets or less.  To
         simplify implementations, the total length of a domain name
         (i.e., label octets and label length octets) is restricted to
         255 octets or less.

   <a href="./rfc1035">RFC 1035</a> encoding was chosen to accommodate future internationalized
   domain name mechanisms.

   The minimum length for this encoding is 3.

   The option MAY contain multiple domain names, but these SHOULD refer
   to different NAPTR records, rather than different A records.  The
   client MUST try the records in the order listed, applying the
   mechanism described in <a href="./rfc3263#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of RFC 3263</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP Servers"'>3</a>] for each.  The
   client only resolves the subsequent domain names if attempts to
   contact the first one failed or yielded no common transport protocols
   between client and server or denote a domain administratively
   prohibited by client policy.

         Use of multiple domain names is not meant to replace NAPTR and
         SRV records, but rather to allow a single DHCP server to
         indicate outbound proxy servers operated by multiple providers.

   Clients MUST support compression according to the encoding in <a href="#section-4.1.4">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-4.1.4">4.1.4</a> of "Domain Names - Implementation And Specification" [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>6</a>].

         Since the domain names are supposed to be different domains,
         compression will likely have little effect, however.

   If the length of the domain list exceeds the maximum permissible
   within a single option (254 octets), then the domain list MUST be
   represented in the DHCP message as specified in [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Encoding Long DHCP Options"'>7</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3361">RFC 3361</a>             DHCPv4 Option for SIP Servers           August 2002</span>


   The DHCP option for this encoding has the following format:

        Code  Len   enc   DNS name of SIP server
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
      | 120 |  n  |  0  |  s1 |  s2 |  s3 |  s4 | s5  |  ...
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

   As an example, consider the case where the server wants to offer two
   outbound proxy servers, "example.com" and "example.net".  These would
   be encoded as follows:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |120|27 | 0 | 7 |'e'|'x'|'a'|'m'|'p'|'l'|'e'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'| 0 |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | 7
      |'e'|'x'|'a'|'m'|'p'|'l'|'e'| 3 |'n'|'e'|'t'| 0 | +---+---+---
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   If the 'enc' byte has a value of 1, the encoding byte is followed by
   a list of IPv4 addresses indicating SIP outbound proxy servers
   available to the client.  Servers MUST be listed in order of
   preference.

   Its minimum length is 5, and the length MUST be a multiple of 4 plus
   one.  The DHCP option for this encoding has the following format:

       Code   Len   enc   Address 1               Address 2
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
      | 120 |  n  |  1  | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  | a1  |  ...
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations in <a href="./rfc2131">RFC 2131</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>1</a>], <a href="./rfc2543">RFC 2543</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>2</a>] and <a href="./rfc3263">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3263">3263</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP Servers"'>3</a>] apply.  If an adversary manages to modify the response from
   a DHCP server or insert its own response, a SIP user agent could be
   led to contact a rogue SIP server, possibly one that then intercepts
   call requests or denies service.  A modified DHCP answer could also
   omit host names that translated to TLS-based SIP servers, thus
   facilitating intercept.
