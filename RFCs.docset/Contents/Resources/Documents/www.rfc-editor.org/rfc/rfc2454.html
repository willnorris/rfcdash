Abstract

   This document is one in the series of documents that define various
   MIB objects for IPv6.  Specifically, this document is the MIB module
   which defines managed objects for implementations of the User
   Datagram Protocol (UDP) over IP Version 6 (IPv6).

   This document also recommends a specific policy with respect to the
   applicability of <a href="./rfc2013">RFC 2013</a> for implementations of IPv6.  Namely, that
   most of managed objects defined in <a href="./rfc2013">RFC 2013</a> are independent of which
   IP versions underlie UDP, and only the UDP listener information is IP
   version-specific.

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   IPv6-based internets.

   A management system contains: several (potentially many) nodes, each
   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to
   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a
   management protocol, used to convey management information between
   the agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are
   carried out under an administrative framework which defines
   authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy policies.

   Management stations execute management applications which monitor and
   control managed elements.  Managed elements are devices such as
   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and
   controlled via access to their management information.

   Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
   residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined
   in MIB modules.  These modules are written using a subset of OSI's
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-1" title=" (December">1</a>], termed the Structure of
   Management Information (SMI) [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure of Management Information for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

   This document is one in the series of documents that define various
   MIB objects, and statements of conformance, for IPv6.  This document
   defines the required instrumentation for implementations of UDP over
   IPv6.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Transparency%20of%20IP%20versions%20to%20UDP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Transparency of IP versions to UDP</span>

   The fact that UDP is carried over IPv6 as opposed to IPv4, is largely
   invisible to a UDP implementation.  A "UDPng" did not need to be
   defined, implementations simply need to support IPv6 addresses.

   As such, the managed objects already defined in [UDP MIB] are
   sufficient for managing UDP in the presence of IPv6.  These objects
   are equally applicable whether the managed node supports IPv4 only,
   IPv6 only, or both IPv4 and IPv6.

   For example, udpInDatagrams counts "The total number of UDP datagrams
   delivered to UDP users", regardless of which version of IP is used to
   deliver any of those datagrams.

   Stated differently, UDP implementations don't need separate counters
   for IPv4 and for IPv6.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Representing%20UDP%20Listeners"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Representing UDP Listeners</span>

   The exception to the statements in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> is the udpTable.  Since
   IPv6 addresses cannot be represented with the IpAddress syntax, not
   all UDP endpoints can be represented in the udpTable defined in [UDP
   MIB].

   This memo defines a new, separate table to represent only those UDP
   endpoints that utilize an IPv6 address.  UDP endpoints on IPv4
   addresses continue to be represented in udpTable [UDP MIB].

   A different approach would have been to define a new table to
   represent all UDP endpoints regardless of IP version.  This would
   require changes to [UDP MIB] and hence to existing (IPv4-only) UDP
   implementations.  The approach suggested in this memo has the
   advantage of leaving IPv4-only implementations intact.

   It is assumed that the objects defined in this memo will eventually
   be defined in an update to [UDP MIB].  For this reason, the module
   identity is assigned under the experimental portion of the MIB.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be
   considered to contain sensitive information in some environments.
   For example, the MIB identifies UDP ports on which processes are
   listening.  Although this information might be considered sensitive
   in some environments (i.e., to identify ports on which to launch
   denial-of-service or other attacks), there are already other ways of
   obtaining similar information.  For example, sending a random UDP
   packet to an unused port prompts the generation of an ICMP port
   unreachable message.

   Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all
   versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.
   SNMPv1 by itself does not provide encryption or strong
   authentication.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [<a href="./rfc2274" title='"The User-Based Security Model for Version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2274</a>] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [<a href="./rfc2275" title='"View-based Access Control Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2275</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
