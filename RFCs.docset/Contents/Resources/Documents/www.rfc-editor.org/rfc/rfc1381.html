Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing the Link Layer of
   X.25, LAPB.  The objects defined here, along with the objects in the
   "SNMP MIB Extension for the Packet Layer of X.25" [<a href="#ref-9" title='"SNMP MIB extension for the Packet Layer of X.25"'>9</a>] and the
   "Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232-like Hardware Devices"
   [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232- like Hardware Devices"'>8</a>], combine to allow management of an X.25 protocol stack.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20The%20Network%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  The Network Management Framework</span>

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  These components give the rules for defining objects,
   the definitions of objects, and the protocol for manipulating
   objects.

   The network management framework structures objects in an abstract
   information tree. The branches of the tree name objects and the
   leaves of the tree contain the values manipulated to effect
   management. This tree is called the Management Information Base or
   MIB. The concepts of this tree are given in STD 16/RFC 1155 "The
   Structure of Management Information" or SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>]. The SMI defines the
   trunk of the tree and the types of objects used when defining the
   leaves. STD 16/RFC 1212, "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>4</a>],
   defines a more concise description mechanism that preserves all the
   principals of the SMI.

   The core MIB definitions for the Internet suite of protocols can be
   found in <a href="./rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>2</a>] "Management Information Base for Network
   Management of TCP/IP-based internets". STD 17/RFC 1213 [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>] defines
   MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I with changes to incorporate
   implementation experience and new operational requirements.

   STD 15/RFC 1157 [<a href="#ref-3" title="and J. Davin">3</a>] defines the SNMP protocol itself. The protocol
   defines how to manipulate the objects in a remote MIB.

   The tree structure of the MIB allows new objects to be defined for
   the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Objects</span>

   The definition of an object in the MIB requires an object name and
   type.  Object names and types are defined using the subset of the
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-6" title=" International Organization for Standardization">6</a>] defined in the SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>].
   Objects are named using ASN.1 object identifiers, administratively
   assigned names, to specify object types. The object name, together
   with an optional object instance, uniquely identifies a specific
   instance of an object. For human convenience, we often use a textual
   string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to objects.

   Objects also have a syntax that defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language [<a href="#ref-6" title=" International Organization for Standardization">6</a>] provides

   the primitives used for this purpose.  The SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>] purposely
   restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used for simplicity and
   ease of implementation.  The encoding of an object type simply
   describes how to represent an object using ASN.1 encoding rules [<a href="#ref-7" title=" International Standard 8825">7</a>],
   for purposes of dealing with the SNMP protocol.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> contains the specification of all object types defined in
   this MIB module. The object definitions use the conventions given in
   the SMI [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>] as amended by the concise MIB definitions [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>4</a>].

   This section describes how the objects defined below relate with
   other MIBs.  This section is only informational to help understand
   how the pieces fit together.

   The objects defined below are to be used in conjunction with MIB-II
   and other MIBs such as the X.25 packet level MIB [<a href="#ref-9" title='"SNMP MIB extension for the Packet Layer of X.25"'>9</a>].  A system with
   a complete X.25 stack running over a synchronous line will have at
   least two interfaces in the ifTable defined in MIB-II.  There will be
   an interface for LAPB and another interface for the packet layer of
   X.25. There will also be objects defined in the RS-232-like MIB for
   the physical sync line.

   Each software interface identifies the layer below it used to send
   and receive packets. The X.25 MIB object, x25InfoDataLinkId,
   specifies an instance of lapbAdmnIndex for the LAPB interface under
   that X.25. The LAPB object, lapbOperPortId, defined below, identifies
   an instance of the rs232PortIndex for the the Sync line used by LAPB.

   For X.25 running over LAPB over Ethernet, the lapbAdmnPortId would
   identify the instance of ifIndex for the Ethernet interface.

   Each X.25 subnetwork will have separate entries in the ifTable.  Thus
   a system with two X.25 lines would have two ifTable entries for the
   two X.25 packet layers and two other entries for the two LAPB
   interfaces. Each X.25 Packet Layer MIB would identify the instance of
   the LAPB MIB below it. Each LAPB MIB would identify the Sync line
   below it. The system would also have two entries for rs232PortTable
   and rs232SyncPortTable for the two physical lines.

   Since the ifTable as defined in MIB-II is device independent, it
   doesn't have anything specific for any type of interface.  The
   objects below define the LAPB specific information for an interface



<span class="grey">Throop &amp; Baker                                                  [Page 3]</span></pre>

   of type LAPB. Different LAPB interfaces can also be differentiated by
   matching the values of ifIndex with lapbAdmnIndex.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Textual%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Textual Conventions</span>

   Two new data types are introduced as a textual conventions in this
   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the readability of
   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications
   if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of these
   textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
   are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit
   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

   This MIB introduces the data types of:

                    PositiveInteger
                    ifIndexType

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.3.%20%20Formal%20overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Formal overview</span>

   Instances of the objects defined below represent attributes of a LAPB
   interface.  LAPB interfaces are identified by an ifType object in the
   Internet-standard MIB [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>] of

                lapb(16).

   For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the
   MIB-II [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

                lapb    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { transmission 16 }

   The relationship between a LAPB interface and an interface in the
   context of the Internet-standard MIB [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>] is one-to-one.  As such, the
   value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to identify
   corresponding instances of the objects defined below.

   The objects defined below are defined in the context of ISO 7776 [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Information processing systems - Data communication - High-level data link control procedure - Description of the X.25 LAPB- compatible DTE data link procedures"'>10</a>]
   and ISO 8885 [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - High-level data link control (HDLC) procedures - General purpose XID frame information field contents and format"'>11</a>]. Access to those documents maybe useful (but isn't
   essential) to understand the names and semantics of some objects.
   Where possible the object descriptions use the terminology of ISO
   7776; for example, one commonly used term refers to the peer LAPB as
   the DCE/remote DTE.  This terminology does not restrict the
   instrumented LAPB to function only as a DTE.  This MIB maybe applied



<span class="grey">Throop &amp; Baker                                                  [Page 4]</span></pre>

   to a LAPB configured as either a DCE or a DTE.

   To the extent that some attributes defined in the Internet standard
   MIB [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>5</a>] are applicable to LAPB, those objects have not been
   duplicated here.  In some instances some clarification of how to
   apply those objects to LAPB has been given.

   Some objects defined below include a DEFVAL clause. This clause
   provides reasonable (but not mandatory) default values to use when
   creating these objects.  This does not imply this MIB defines any
   mechanism for creating or deleting LAPB interfaces.  The creation and
   deletion of the objects of this MIB depend on the implementation
   method for creating and deleting LAPB interfaces.  The DEFVAL clause
   provides reasonable defaults to allow further extension of the MIB to
   define methods for creating and deleting LAPB interfaces without
   having to deprecate these objects for the lack of a DEFVAL clause.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Tables"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Tables</span>

   This extension adds four tables to the MIB.  These tables are:

                       lapbAdmnTable,
                       lapbOperTable,
                       lapbFlowTable, and
                       lapbXidTable.

   The lapbAdmnTable provides objects for common parameters used by LAPB
   such as the T1 retransmission timer or the N2 retransmission counter.
   Changes to objects in this table need not affect a running interface
   but provides access to the values used to initialize an interface.
   These values are read-write.

   The lapbOperTable provides objects to determine the parameters
   actually in use by an interface.  These objects are read only.  The
   values currently in use maybe different from the lapbAdmnTable values
   if the lapbAdmnTable was changed after interface initialization or if
   XID negotiation selected different values.

   The lapbFlowTable provides objects that report how the LAPB interface
   performs.  These are read-only objects used to monitor operation.

   The lapbXidTable is not required for systems that do not transmit XID
   frames. For systems that do transmit XID frames, this table provides
   the values for the fields of the XID frame that are not already
   present in the lapbAdmnTable.  The objects in this table are read-
   write.

   Since all LAPB interfaces have entries in the ifTable, significant
   changes in the state of the interface should send a linkUp or
   linkDown trap. Thus an interface that receives or sends a Frame
   Reject frame should send a linkDown trap.  If the interface later
   comes back up, it should then send a linkUP trap.

July 30, 1992

The July revision of this document (Editor's Internal Reference 2.10)
incorporated the comments of the SNMP directorate.

      The ifIndexType textual convention was added and used as the type
      for all index objects.

      The enumeration xidDetection of the lapbAdmnStationType was
      changed to dxe to be consistent with other similar enumerations.

      Conformance statements were added at before every table as ASN.1
      comments.

June 12, 1992

   The June 12, 1992 revision of this document (Editor's Internal
   Reference 2.9) incorporated some clarifications and updated the
   status.

      The range on PositiveInteger was changed to start at 0 rather than
      1.

      The syntax of lapbXidIndex was changed to PositiveInteger.

      A value of dxe was added to lapbOperStationType.

      The range of lapbAdmnN2RxmitCount was change to (0..65535).

      The definition of ifInOctets, ifInUcastPkts, ifInErrors,
      ifInUnknownProtos, ifOutOctets, and ifoutUcastPkts was clarified.

May 18, 1992

   The May 18, 1992 revision of this document (Editor's Internal
   Reference  2.8) incorporated the following changes:

      The states of lapbFlowCurrentMode were redefined.

      The default value for lapbAdmnControlField was changed from
      module8 to modulo8.

April 8, 1992

   The April 8, 1992 revision of this document (Editor's Internal
   Reference 2.4) incorporated the following changes:

      All reference comments in the MIB were moved to the REFERENCE
      field of the OBJECT-TYPE macro.

      A type of PositiveInteger was introduced and used for common
      integer values including all timers.  This effectively made the
      maximum value for timers 2147483646 milliseconds.  The type of the
      frame size was changed to positiveInteger.

      The reference to ISO 7776 has been broadened to say the MIB
      descriptions use the terminology of ISO 7776.

      A comment was added to the overview section discussing creation
      and deletion of tables.

      The objects in the lapbParmTable and lapbDefTable were
      redistributed to create a lapbOperTable, a lapbAdmnTable, and a
      lapbXidTable.  The lapbParmTable and lapbDefTable were deleted.
      Objects were included in the Admn table for t3 and t4.

      An object identifier was added to identify the protocol version.

      A DEFVAL clause was added for all writable objects.

      Some more overview text was included.

February 1992

   The February 1992 revision of this document (Editor's Internal
   Reference 1.17) incorporated the following changes:

      The name was changed from HDLC to LAPB. This change was made
      because other flavors of HDLC such as LAPD, SDLC, and raw HDLC
      framing, are different enough that this MIB will not adequately



<span class="grey">Throop &amp; Baker                                                 [Page 28]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-29"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc1381">RFC 1381</a>                     X.25 LAPB MIB                 November 1992</span>


      manage them.

      The Historical Perspective section at the beginning of the
      document has been replaced with a more concise Network Management
      Framework section.

      The name lapbParmKWindowSize was changed to
      lapbParmTransmitKWindowSize and the object
      lapbParmReceiveKWindowSize was added. This change was made because
      <a href="#section-5.7.4">section 5.7.4</a> of ISO 7776 and Table 3 of ISO 8885 have provisions
      for different values for the transmit and receive window size.

      The name lapbParmN1FrameSize was changed to
      lapbParmTransmitN1FrameSize and the object
      lapbParmReceiveN1FrameSize was added. This change was made because
      <a href="#section-5.7.3">section 5.7.3</a> of ISO 7776 and Table 3 of ISO 8886 have provisions
      for different values for the transmit and receive maximum frame
      size.

      The object lapbParmPortIndex was deleted and the description of
      lapbParmPortId was changed.  The object lapbParmPortId now
      identifies an instance of the index object for the MIB of the
      physical device or interface below LAPB.

      The units for the timers were changed to Milliseconds to be
      consistent with ISO 8885; see table 3.

      The objects lapbParamT2AckDelayTimer and
      lapbParamT3DisconnectTimer both allow values of 0 to indicate the
      timer is not being used.

      The object lapbParamT4IdleTimer has a value to indicate timer not
      in use.

      The object lapbFlowXidReceived was added to the flow table.

      The lapbDefTable was added.

      Ranges and sizes were added for all INTEGERs and OCTET STRINGs
      that didn't have them.

October 1991

   The October 1991 revision of this document basically changed the name
   from LAPB to HDLC to make the objects more appropriate for a broader
   range of uses.  A number of minor changes were made to bring the
   objects in line with established conventions.  These changes are as
   follows.



<span class="grey">Throop &amp; Baker                                                 [Page 29]</span></pre>

      The enumerated values of hdlcParmStationType were renumbered from
      0 and 1 to 1 and 2.

      The object hdlcFlowBusyDefer was renamed hdlcFlowBusyDefers.

      The object hdlcFlowRejSent was rename hdlcFlowRejOutPkts.

      The object hdlcFlowRejReceived was renamed hdlcFlowRejInPkts.

June 1991

   The June revision of this document incorporated much of the E-mail
   discussion of the first draft. In particular it replaced the
   lapbStatTable (and all contents) with the lapbFlowTable.

April 1991

   The April 24 version of this document was the first release.  At that
   time this document was basically a bunch of objects synthesized from
   various vendor MIBs and a quick reading of ISO 7776 [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Information processing systems - Data communication - High-level data link control procedure - Description of the X.25 LAPB- compatible DTE data link procedures"'>10</a>].  On first
   reading it appeared to instrument too many LAPB normal functions and
   too few exceptional conditions.  The lapbStatTable was too long and
   needed to be redone.
