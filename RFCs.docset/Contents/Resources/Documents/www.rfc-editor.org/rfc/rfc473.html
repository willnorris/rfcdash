                             <span class="h1">MIX and MIXAL?</span>

   Is there an interpreter for Knuth's hypothetical computer, MIX,
   together with an assemble for the MIX assembly language, MIXAL,
   available on any ARPA Network Host? If not, will not some Network
   Host make them available (cheaply)?--it would be considerable service
   to all of us who are students of the "Art of Computer Programming."
