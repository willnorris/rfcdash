                       Well Known Socket Numbers

     The Network Measurement Group would like to establish a network
standard socket number for a Process Discard service (not all HOSTs need
cooperate.) To do this, it is necessary to know which sockets at each
HOST have already been allocated to standard network functions.

     At all HOSTs which permit login for services, socket 1 is the
Network Logger on which ICP may be performed.

     We would like to catalog other sockets which are supposed to be
well-known, so we would appreciate having a note or phone call from each
HOST Technical Liaison describing the function and socket numbers of
network service programs at each HOST.  The catalog will be published and
we would recommend that it be maintained at NIC.
