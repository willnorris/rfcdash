Abstract

   This document captures the issues that may arise in the deployment of
   IPv6 networks when they support Mobile IPv6 and firewalls.  The
   issues are not only applicable to firewalls protecting enterprise
   networks, but are also applicable in 3G mobile networks such as
   General Packet Radio Service / Universal Mobile Telecommunications
   System (GPRS/UMTS) and CDMA2000 networks.

   The goal of this document is to highlight the issues with firewalls
   and Mobile IPv6 and act as an enabler for further discussion.  Issues
   identified here can be solved by developing appropriate solutions.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Network elements such as firewalls are an integral aspect of a
   majority of IP networks today, given the state of security in the
   Internet, threats, and vulnerabilities to data networks.  Current IP
   networks are predominantly based on IPv4 technology, and hence
   firewalls have been designed for these networks.  Deployment of IPv6
   networks is currently progressing, albeit at a slower pace.
   Firewalls for IPv6 networks are still maturing and in development.

   Mobility support for IPv6 has been standardized as specified in <a href="./rfc3775">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3775">3775</a>.  Given the fact that Mobile IPv6 is a recent standard, most
   firewalls available for IPv6 networks do not support Mobile IPv6.

   Unless firewalls are aware of Mobile IPv6 protocol details, these
   security devices will interfere with the smooth operation of the
   protocol and can be a detriment to deployment.

   Mobile IPv6 enables IP mobility for IPv6 nodes.  It allows a mobile
   IPv6 node to be reachable via its home IPv6 address irrespective of
   any link that the mobile attaches to.  This is possible as a result
   of the extensions to IPv6 defined in the Mobile IPv6 specification
   [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>1</a>].

   Mobile IPv6 protocol design also incorporates a feature termed Route
   Optimization.  This set of extensions is a fundamental part of the
   protocol that enables optimized routing of packets between a mobile
   node and its correspondent node and therefore optimized performance
   of the communication.

   In most cases, current firewall technologies, however, do not support
   Mobile IPv6 or are not even aware of Mobile IPv6 headers and
   extensions.  Since most networks in the current business environment
   deploy firewalls, this may prevent future large-scale deployment of
   the Mobile IPv6 protocol.

   This document presents in detail some of the issues that firewalls
   present for Mobile IPv6 deployment, as well as the impact of each
   issue.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   Return Routability Test (RRT): The Return Routability Test is a
      procedure defined in <a href="./rfc3775">RFC 3775</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>1</a>].  It is performed prior to the
      Route Optimization (RO), where a mobile node (MN) instructs a
      correspondent node (CN) to direct the mobile node's data traffic
      to its claimed care-of address (CoA).  The Return Routability
      procedure provides some security assurance and prevents the misuse
      of Mobile IPv6 signaling to maliciously redirect the traffic or to
      launch other attacks.

   The following section provides a brief overview of firewalls.  It is
   intended as background information so that issues with the Mobile
   IPv6 protocol can then be presented in detail in the following
   sections.

   There are different types of firewalls, and state can be created in
   these firewalls through different methods.  Independent of the
   adopted method, firewalls typically look at five parameters of the
   traffic arriving at the firewalls:





<span class="grey">Le, et al.                   Informational                      [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4487">RFC 4487</a>                  MIPv6 and Firewalls                   May 2006</span>


   o  Source IP address

   o  Destination IP address

   o  Protocol type

   o  Source port number

   o  Destination port number

   Based on these parameters, firewalls usually decide whether to allow
   the traffic or to drop the packets.  Some firewalls may filter only
   incoming traffic, while others may also filter outgoing traffic.

   According to <a href="./rfc2647#section-3.29">SectionÂ 3.29 of RFC 2647</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Performance"'>2</a>], stateful packet filtering
   refers to the process of forwarding or rejecting traffic based on the
   contents of a state table maintained by a firewall.  These types of
   firewalls are commonly deployed to protect networks from different
   threats, such as blocking unsolicited incoming traffic from the
   external networks.  The following briefly describes how these
   firewalls work since they can create additional problems with the
   Mobile IPv6 protocol as described in the subsequent sections.

   In TCP, an MN sends a TCP SYN message to connect to another host in
   the Internet.

   Upon receiving that SYN packet, the firewall records the source IP
   address, the destination IP address, the Protocol type, the source
   port number, and the destination port number indicated in that packet
   before transmitting it to the destination.

   When an incoming message from the external networks reaches the
   firewall, it searches the packet's source IP address, destination IP
   address, Protocol type, source port number, and destination port
   number in its entries to see if the packet matches the
   characteristics of a request sent previously.  If so, the firewall
   allows the packet to enter the network.  If the packet was not
   solicited from an internal node, the packet is blocked.

   When the TCP close session packets are exchanged or after some
   configurable period of inactivity, the associated entry in the
   firewall is deleted.  This mechanism prevents entries from remaining
   when TCP are abruptly terminated.

   A similar entry is created when using UDP.  The difference with this
   transport protocol is that UDP is connectionless and does not have
   packets signaling the initiation or termination of a session.
   Consequently, the duration of the entries relies solely on timers.

   The following section describes various scenarios involving MIP6
   nodes and firewalls and also presents the issues related to each
   scenario.

   The Mobile IPv6 specifications define three main entities: the mobile
   node (MN), the correspondent node (CN), and the home agent (HA).
   Each of these entities may be in a network protected by one or many
   firewalls:

   o  <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> analyzes the issues when the MN is in a network
      protected by firewall(s)

   o  <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a> analyzes the issues when the CN is in a network
      protected by firewall(s)

   o  <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a> analyzes the issues when the HA is in a network
      protected by firewall(s)

   The MN may also be moving from an external network, to a network
   protected by firewall(s).  The issues of this case are described in
   <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>.

   Some of the described issues (e.g., Sections <a href="#section-5.1">5.1</a> and <a href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>) may require
   modifications to the protocols or to the firewalls, and others (e.g.,
   <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>) may require only that appropriate rules and
   configuration be in place.

     +----------------+
     Network protected

   Figure 1: Issues between MIP6 and firewalls when MN is in a network
             protected by firewalls

   A number of issues need to be considered:

   Issue 1: When MN A connects to the network, it should acquire a local
      IP address (CoA) and send a Binding Update (BU) to its Home Agent
      to update the HA with its current point of attachment.  The
      Binding Updates and Acknowledgements should be protected by IPsec
      ESP according to the MIPv6 specifications [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>1</a>].  However, as a
      default rule, many firewalls drop IPsec ESP packets because they
      cannot determine whether inbound ESP packets are legitimate.  It
      is difficult or impossible to create useful state by observing the
      outbound ESP packets.  This may cause the Binding Updates and
      Acknowledgements between the mobile nodes and their home agent to
      be dropped.

   Issue 2: Let's now consider a node in the external network, B, trying
      to establish a communication with MN A.

      *  B sends a packet to the mobile node's home address.

      *  The packet is intercepted by the MN's home agent, which tunnels
         it to the MN's CoA [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>1</a>].

      *  When arriving at the firewall(s) protecting MN A, the packet
         may be dropped since the incoming packet may not match any
         existing state.  As described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>, stateful inspection
         packet filters (for example) typically drop unsolicited
         incoming traffic.



<span class="grey">Le, et al.                   Informational                      [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-8"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4487">RFC 4487</a>                  MIPv6 and Firewalls                   May 2006</span>


      *  B will thus not be able to contact MN A and establish a
         communication.

      Even though the HA is updated with the location of an MN,
      firewalls may prevent correspondent nodes from establishing
      communications when the MN is in a network protected by
      firewall(s).

   Issue 3: Let's assume a communication between MN A and an external
      node B.  MN A may want to use Route Optimization (RO) so that
      packets can be directly exchanged between the MN and the CN
      without passing through the HA.  However, the firewalls protecting
      the MN might present issues with the Return Routability procedure
      that needs to be performed prior to using RO.

      According to the MIPv6 specifications, the Home Test message of
      the RRT must be protected by IPsec in tunnel mode.  However,
      firewalls might drop any packet protected by ESP, since the
      firewalls cannot analyze the packets encrypted by ESP (e.g., port
      numbers).  The firewalls may thus drop the Home Test messages and
      prevent the completion of the RRT procedure.

   Issue 4: Let's assume that MN A successfully sends a Binding Update
      to its home agent (resp. correspondent nodes) -- which solves
      issue 1 (resp. issue 3) -- and that the subsequent traffic is sent
      from the HA (resp. CN) to the MN's CoA.  However there may not be
      any corresponding state in the firewalls.  The firewalls
      protecting A may thus drop the incoming packets.

      The appropriate states for the traffic to the MN's CoA need to be
      created in the firewall(s).

   Issue 5: When MN A moves, it may move to a link that is served by a
      different firewall.  MN A might be sending a BU to its CN;
      however, incoming packets may be dropped at the firewall, since
      the firewall on the new link that the MN attaches to does not have
      any state that is associated with the MN.

   The issues described above result from the fact that the MN is behind
   the firewall.  Consequently, the MN's communication capability with
   other nodes is affected by the firewall rules.

   Let's consider an MN in a network, communicating with a Correspondent
   Node C in a network protected by firewall(s).  There are no issues
   with the presence of a firewall in the scenario where the MN is
   sending packets to the CN via a reverse tunnel that is set up between
   the MN and HA.  However, firewalls may present different issues to
   Route Optimization.

   Figure 2: Issues between MIP6 and firewalls when a CN is in a network
             protected by firewalls

   The following issues need to be considered:

   Issue 1: The MN (MN B) should use its Home Address (HoA B) when
      establishing the communication with the CN (CN C), if MN B wants
      to take advantage of the mobility support provided by the Mobile
      IPv6 protocol for its communication with CN C.  The state created
      by the firewall protecting CN C is therefore created based on the
      IP address of C (IP C) and the home address of Node B (IP HoA B).
      The states may be created via different means, and the protocol
      type as well as the port numbers depend on the connection setup.

         Uplink packet filters (1)

            Source IP address: IP C

            Destination IP address: HoA B

      Nodes C and B might be topologically close to each other, while
      B's home agent may be far away, resulting in a trombone effect
      that can create delay and degrade the performance.  MN B may
      decide to initiate the route optimization procedure with Node C.
      Route optimization requires MN B to send a Binding Update to Node
      C in order to create an entry in its binding cache that maps the
      MN's home address to its current care-of-address.  However, prior
      to sending the binding update, the mobile node must first execute
      a Return Routability Test:

      *  Mobile Node B has to send a Home Test Init (HoTI) message via
         its home agent and

      *  a Care of Test Init (COTI) message directly to its
         Correspondent Node C.

      The Care of Test Init message is sent using the CoA of B as the
      source address.  Such a packet does not match any entry in the
      protecting firewall (2).  The CoTi message will thus be dropped by
      the firewall.

      The HoTI is a Mobility Header packet, and as the protocol type
      differs from the established state in the firewall (see (2)), the
      HoTI packet will also be dropped.

      As a consequence, the RRT cannot be completed, and route
      optimization cannot be applied.  Every packet has to go through
      Node B's home agent and tunneled between B's home agent and B.

      Figure 3: Issues with Return Routability Test

   Issue 2: Let's assume that the Binding Update to the CN is
      successful; the firewall(s) might still drop packets that are:

      1.  coming from the CoA, since these incoming packets are sent
          from the CoA and do not match the Downlink Packet filter (2).

      2.  sent from the CN to the CoA if uplink packet filters are
          implemented.  The uplink packets are sent to the MN's CoA and
          do not match the uplink packet filter (1).

      The packet filters for the traffic sent to (resp. from) the CoA
      need to be created in the firewall(s).

      Requiring the firewalls to update the connection state upon
      detecting Binding Update messages from a node outside the network
      protected by the firewall does not appear feasible or desirable,
      since currently the firewall does not have any means to verify the
      validity of Binding Update messages and therefore to modify the
      state information securely.  Changing the firewall states without
      verifying the validity of the Binding Update messages could lead
      to denial of service attacks.  Malicious nodes may send fake
      binding updates, forcing the firewall to change its state
      information, and therefore leading the firewall to drop packets
      from the connections that use the legitimate addresses.  An
      adversary might also use an address update to enable its own
      traffic to pass through the firewall and enter the network.

   Issue 3: Let's assume that the Binding Update to the CN is
      successful.  The CN may be protected by different firewalls, and
      as a result of the MN's change of IP address, incoming and
      outgoing traffic may pass through a different firewall.  The new

      firewall may not have any state associated with the CN, and
      incoming packets (and potentially outgoing traffic as well) may be
      dropped at the firewall.

      Firewall technology allows clusters of firewalls to share state
      [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Check Point NG VPN-1/ Firewall-1 Advanced Configuration and Troubleshooting"'>3</a>].  This, for example, allows the support of routing asymmetry.
      However, if the previous and the new firewalls, through which the
      packets are routed after the Binding Update has been sent, do not
      share state, this may result in packets being dropped at the new
      firewall.  As the new firewall does not have any state associated
      with the CN, incoming packets (and potentially outgoing traffic as
      well) may be dropped at the new firewall.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.%20%20Scenario%20Where%20the%20HA%20Is%20in%20a%20Network%20Protected%20by%20Firewall%28s%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Scenario Where the HA Is in a Network Protected by Firewall(s)</span>

   In the scenarios where the home agent is in a network protected by
   firewall(s), the following issues may exist:

   Issue 1: If the firewall(s) protecting the home agent block ESP
      traffic, much of the MIPv6 signaling (e.g., Binding Update, HoT)
      may be dropped at the firewall(s), preventing MN(s) from updating
      their binding cache and performing Route Optimization, since
      Binding Update, HoT, and other MIPv6 signaling must be protected
      by IPsec ESP.

   Issue 2: If the firewall(s) protecting the home agent block
      unsolicited incoming traffic (e.g., as stateful inspection packet
      filters do), the firewall(s) may drop connection setup requests
      from CNs, and packets from MNs.

   Issue 3: If the home agent is in a network protected by several
      firewalls, an MN/CN's change of IP address may result in the
      passage of traffic to and from the home agent through a different
      firewall that may not have the states corresponding to the flows.
      As a consequence, packets may be dropped at the firewall.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.4.%20%20Scenario%20Where%20the%20MN%20Moves%20to%20a%20Network%20Protected%20by%20Firewall%28s%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" id="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Scenario Where the MN Moves to a Network Protected by Firewall(s)</span>

   Let's consider an HA in a network protected by firewall(s).  The
   following issues need to be investigated:

   Issue 1: Similarly to issue 1 described in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>, the MN will
      send a Binding Update to its home agent after acquiring a local IP
      address (CoA).  The Binding Updates and Acknowledgements should be
      protected by IPsec ESP according to the MIPv6 specifications [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>1</a>].
      However, as a default rule, many firewalls drop ESP packets.  This
      may cause the Binding Updates and Acknowledgements between the
      mobile nodes and their home agent to be dropped.

   Issue 2: The MN may be in a communication with a CN, or a CN may be
      attempting to establish a connection with the MN.  In both cases,
      packets sent from the CN will be forwarded by the MN's HA to the
      MN's CoA.  However, when the packets arrive at the firewall(s),
      the incoming traffic may not match any existing state, and the
      firewall(s) may therefore drop it.

   Issue 3: If the MN is in a communication with a CN, the MN may
      attempt to execute an RRT for packets to be route optimized.
      Similarly to issue 3, <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>, the Home Test message that
      should be protected by ESP may be dropped by firewall(s)
      protecting the MN.  Firewall(s) may as a default rule drop any ESP
      traffic.  As a consequence, the RRT cannot be completed.

   Issue 4: If the MN is in a communication with a CN, and assuming that
      the MN successfully sent a Binding Update to its CN to use Route
      Optimization, packets will then be sent from the CN to the MN's
      CoA and from the MN's CoA to the CN.

      Packets sent from the CN to the MN's CoA may, however, not match
      any existing entry in the firewall(s) protecting the MN, and
      therefore be dropped by the firewall(s).

      If packet filtering is applied to uplink traffic (i.e., traffic
      sent by the MN), packets sent from the MN's CoA to the CN may not
      match any entry in the firewall(s) either and may be dropped as
      well.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Conclusions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Conclusions</span>

   Current firewalls may not only prevent route optimization but may
   also prevent regular TCP and UDP sessions from being established in
   some cases.  This document describes some of the issues between the
   Mobile IPv6 protocol and current firewall technologies.

   This document captures the various issues involved in the deployment
   of Mobile IPv6 in networks that would invariably include firewalls.
   A number of different scenarios are described, which include
   configurations where the mobile node, correspondent node, and home
   agent exist across various boundaries delimited by the firewalls.
   This enables a better understanding of the issues when deploying
   Mobile IPv6 as well as the issues for firewall design and policies to
   be installed therein.

   This document describes several issues that exist between the Mobile
   IPv6 protocol and firewalls.

   Firewalls may prevent Mobile IP6 signaling in addition to dropping
   incoming/outgoing traffic.

   If the firewall configuration is modified in order to support the
   Mobile IPv6 protocol but not properly configured, many attacks may be
   possible as outlined above: malicious nodes may be able to launch
   different types of denial of service attacks.

   In 3G networks, different packet filtering functionalities may be
   implemented to prevent malicious nodes from flooding or launching
   other attacks against the 3G subscribers.  The packet filtering
   functionality of 3G networks is further described in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Problem Statement for MIPv6 Interactions with GPRS/UMTS Packet Filtering"'>4</a>].  Packet
   filters are set up and applied to both uplink and downlink traffic:
   outgoing and incoming data not matching the packet filters is
   dropped.  The issues described in this document also apply to 3G
   networks.
