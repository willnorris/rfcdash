   This document adds the following elliptic curve cryptography
   algorithms to the Secure Shell arsenal: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDH) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), as
   well as utilizing the SHA2 family of secure hash algorithms.
   Additionally, support is provided for Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-
   Vanstone (ECMQV).

   Due to its small key sizes and its inclusion in the National Security
   Agency's Suite B, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is becoming a
   widely utilized and attractive public-key cryptosystem.

   Compared to cryptosystems such as RSA, the Digital Signature
   Algorithm (DSA), and Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange, ECC variations
   on these schemes offer equivalent security with smaller key sizes.
   This is illustrated in the following table, based on <a href="#section-5.6.1">Section 5.6.1</a> of
   NIST 800-57 [<a href="#ref-NIST-800-57" title='"Recommendation for Key Management - Part 1: General (Revised)"'>NIST-800-57</a>], which gives approximate comparable key
   sizes for symmetric- and asymmetric-key cryptosystems based on the
   best known algorithms for attacking them.  L is the field size and N
   is the sub-field size.

      +-----------+------------------------------+-------+---------+
      | Symmetric | Discrete Log (e.g., DSA, DH) |  RSA  |   ECC   |
      +-----------+------------------------------+-------+---------+
      |     80    |       L = 1024, N = 160      |  1024 | 160-223 |
      |           |                              |       |         |
      |    112    |       L = 2048, N = 256      |  2048 | 224-255 |
      |           |                              |       |         |
      |    128    |       L = 3072, N = 256      |  3072 | 256-383 |
      |           |                              |       |         |
      |    192    |       L = 7680, N = 384      |  7680 | 384-511 |
      |           |                              |       |         |
      |    256    |      L = 15360, N = 512      | 15360 |   512+  |
      +-----------+------------------------------+-------+---------+

   Implementation of this specification requires familiarity with both
   SSH [<a href="./rfc4251" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>] [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] [<a href="./rfc4250" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Assigned Numbers"'>RFC4250</a>] and ECC [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>] (additional

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Notation</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The data types boolean, byte, uint32, uint64, string, and mpint are
   to be interpreted in this document as described in [<a href="./rfc4251" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>].

   The size of a set of elliptic curve domain parameters on a prime
   curve is defined as the number of bits in the binary representation
   of the field order, commonly denoted by p.  Size on a
   characteristic-2 curve is defined as the number of bits in the binary
   representation of the field, commonly denoted by m.  A set of
   elliptic curve domain parameters defines a group of order n generated
   by a base point P.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20SSH%20ECC%20Public%20Key%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  SSH ECC Public Key Algorithm</span>

   The SSH ECC public key algorithm is defined by its key format,
   corresponding signature algorithm ECDSA, signature encoding, and
   algorithm identifiers.

   This section defines the family of "ecdsa-sha2-*" public key formats
   and corresponding signature formats.  Every compliant SSH ECC
   implementation MUST implement this public key format.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Key%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Key Format</span>

   The "ecdsa-sha2-*" key formats all have the following encoding:

      string   "ecdsa-sha2-[identifier]"
      byte[n]  ecc_key_blob

   The ecc_key_blob value has the following specific encoding:

      string   [identifier]
      string   Q

   The string [identifier] is the identifier of the elliptic curve
   domain parameters.  The format of this string is specified in
   <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.  Information on the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED sets of
   elliptic curve domain parameters for use with this algorithm can be
   found in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   Q is the public key encoded from an elliptic curve point into an
   octet string as defined in Section 2.3.3 of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>]; point compression
   MAY be used.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5656">RFC 5656</a>             SSH ECC Algorithm Integration         December 2009</span>


   The algorithm for ECC key generation can be found in Section 3.2 of
   [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].  Given some elliptic curve domain parameters, an ECC key pair
   can be generated containing a private key (an integer d), and a
   public key (an elliptic curve point Q).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.1.%20%20Signature%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" id="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Signature Algorithm</span>

   Signing and verifying is done using the Elliptic Curve Digital
   Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  ECDSA is specified in [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].  The
   message hashing algorithm MUST be from the SHA2 family of hash
   functions [<a href="#ref-FIPS-180-3" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>FIPS-180-3</a>] and is chosen according to the curve size as
   specified in <a href="#section-6.2.1">Section 6.2.1</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.2.%20%20Signature%20Encoding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2" id="section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Signature Encoding</span>

   Signatures are encoded as follows:

      string   "ecdsa-sha2-[identifier]"
      string   ecdsa_signature_blob

   The string [identifier] is the identifier of the elliptic curve
   domain parameters.  The format of this string is specified in
   <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.  Information on the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED sets of
   elliptic curve domain parameters for use with this algorithm can be
   found in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   The ecdsa_signature_blob value has the following specific encoding:

      mpint    r
      mpint    s

   The integers r and s are the output of the ECDSA algorithm.

   The width of the integer fields is determined by the curve being
   used.  Note that the integers r and s are integers modulo the order
   of the cryptographic subgroup, which may be larger than the size of
   the finite field.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20ECDH%20Key%20Exchange"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  ECDH Key Exchange</span>

   The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange method
   generates a shared secret from an ephemeral local elliptic curve
   private key and ephemeral remote elliptic curve public key.  This key
   exchange method provides explicit server authentication as defined in
   [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>] using a signature on the exchange hash.  Every compliant
   SSH ECC implementation MUST implement ECDH key exchange.

   The primitive used for shared key generation is ECDH with cofactor
   multiplication, the full specification of which can be found in
   Section 3.3.2 of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].  The algorithm for key pair generation can
   be found in Section 3.2.1 of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].

   The family of key exchange method names defined for use with this key
   exchange can be found in <a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>.  Algorithm negotiation chooses
   the public key algorithm to be used for signing and the method name
   of the key exchange.  The method name of the key exchange chosen
   determines the elliptic curve domain parameters and hash function to
   be used in the remainder of this section.

   Information on the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED elliptic curve domain
   parameters for use with this method can be found in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   All elliptic curve public keys MUST be validated after they are
   received.  An example of a validation algorithm can be found in
   Section 3.2.2 of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].  If a key fails validation, the key exchange
   MUST fail.

   The elliptic curve public keys (points) that must be transmitted are
   encoded into octet strings before they are transmitted.  The
   transformation between elliptic curve points and octet strings is
   specified in Sections <a href="#section-2.3.3">2.3.3</a> and <a href="#section-2.3.4">2.3.4</a> of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>]; point compression
   MAY be used.  The output of shared key generation is a field element
   xp.  The SSH framework requires that the shared key be an integer.
   The conversion between a field element and an integer is specified in
   Section 2.3.9 of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].

   Specification of the message numbers SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT and
   SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY is found in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   The following is an overview of the key exchange process:

      Client                                                Server
      ------                                                ------
      Generate ephemeral key pair.
      SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT  --------------&gt;

                                      Verify received key is valid.
                                       Generate ephemeral key pair.
                                             Compute shared secret.
                                   Generate and sign exchange hash.
                             &lt;------------- SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY

      Verify received key is valid.
      *Verify host key belongs to server.
      Compute shared secret.
      Generate exchange hash.
      Verify server's signature.

      *  It is RECOMMENDED that the client verify that the host key sent
         is the server's host key (for example, using a local database).
         The client MAY accept the host key without verification, but
         doing so will render the protocol insecure against active
         attacks; see the discussion in <a href="./rfc4251#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of [RFC4251]</a>.

   This is implemented using the following messages.

   The client sends:

      byte     SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT
      string   Q_C, client's ephemeral public key octet string

   The server responds with:

      byte     SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY
      string   K_S, server's public host key
      string   Q_S, server's ephemeral public key octet string
      string   the signature on the exchange hash

   The exchange hash H is computed as the hash of the concatenation of
   the following.

      string   V_C, client's identification string (CR and LF excluded)
      string   V_S, server's identification string (CR and LF excluded)
      string   I_C, payload of the client's SSH_MSG_KEXINIT

      string   K_S, server's public host key
      string   Q_C, client's ephemeral public key octet string
      string   Q_S, server's ephemeral public key octet string
      mpint    K,   shared secret

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20ECMQV%20Key%20Exchange"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  ECMQV Key Exchange</span>

   The Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) key exchange algorithm
   generates a shared secret from two local elliptic curve key pairs and
   two remote public keys.  This key exchange method provides implicit
   server authentication as defined in [<a href="./rfc4253" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol"'>RFC4253</a>].  The ECMQV key
   exchange method is OPTIONAL.

   The key exchange method name defined for use with this key exchange
   is "ecmqv-sha2".  This method name gives a hashing algorithm that is
   to be used for the Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) below.
   Future RFCs may define new method names specifying new hash
   algorithms for use with ECMQV.  More information about the method
   name and HMAC can be found in <a href="#section-6.4">Section 6.4</a>.

   In general, the ECMQV key exchange is performed using the ephemeral
   and long-term key pair of both the client and server, which is a
   total of 4 keys.  Within the framework of SSH, the client does not
   have a long-term key pair that needs to be authenticated.  Therefore,
   we generate an ephemeral key and use that as both the clients keys.
   This is more efficient than using two different ephemeral keys, and
   it does not adversely affect security (it is analogous to the one-
   pass protocol in Section 6.1 of [<a href="#ref-LMQSV98" title='"An Efficient Protocol for Authenticated Key Agreement"'>LMQSV98</a>]).

   A full description of the ECMQV primitive can be found in Section 3.4
   of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].  The algorithm for key pair generation can be found in
   Section 3.2.1 of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].

   During algorithm negotiation with the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT messages, the
   ECMQV key exchange method can only be chosen if a public key
   algorithm supporting ECC host keys can also be chosen.  This is due
   to the use of implicit server authentication in this key exchange
   method.  This case is handled the same way that key exchange methods
   requiring encryption/signature capable public key algorithms are

   handled in <a href="./rfc4253#section-7.1">Section 7.1 of [RFC4253]</a>.  If ECMQV key exchange is
   chosen, then the public key algorithm supporting ECC host keys MUST
   also be chosen.

   ECMQV requires that all the keys used to generate a shared secret are
   generated over the same elliptic curve domain parameters.  Since the
   host key is used in the generation of the shared secret, allowing for
   implicit server authentication, the domain parameters associated with
   the host key are used throughout this section.

   All elliptic curve public keys MUST be validated after they are
   received.  An example of a validation algorithm can be found in
   Section 3.2.2 of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].  If a key fails validation, the key exchange
   MUST fail.

   The elliptic curve ephemeral public keys (points) that must be
   transmitted are encoded into octet strings before they are
   transmitted.  The transformation between elliptic curve points and
   octet strings is specified in Sections <a href="#section-2.3.3">2.3.3</a> and <a href="#section-2.3.4">2.3.4</a> of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>];
   point compression MAY be used.  The output of shared key generation
   is a field element xp.  The SSH framework requires that the shared
   key be an integer.  The conversion between a field element and an
   integer is specified in Section 2.3.9 of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].

   The following is an overview of the key exchange process:

      Client                                                Server

                              HMAC over it using the shared secret.

      Verify received keys are valid.
      *Verify host key belongs to server.
      Compute shared secret.
      Verify HMAC.

      *  It is RECOMMENDED that the client verify that the host key sent
         is the server's host key (for example, using a local database).
         The client MAY accept the host key without verification, but
         doing so will render the protocol insecure against active
         attacks.

   The specification of the message numbers SSH_MSG_ECMQV_INIT and
   SSH_MSG_ECMQV_REPLY can be found in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   This key exchange algorithm is implemented with the following
   messages.

   The client sends:

      byte     SSH_MSG_ECMQV_INIT
      string   Q_C, client's ephemeral public key octet string

   The server sends:

   This document defines a new family of key exchange method names, a
   new key exchange method name, and a new family of public key
   algorithm names in the SSH name registry.

   This section specifies identifiers encoding named elliptic curve
   domain parameters.  These identifiers are used in this document to
   identify the curve used in the SSH ECC public key format, the ECDSA
   signature blob, and the ECDH method name.

   For the REQUIRED elliptic curves nistp256, nistp384, and nistp521,
   the elliptic curve domain parameter identifiers are the strings
   "nistp256", "nistp384", and "nistp521".

   For all other elliptic curves, including all other NIST curves and
   all other RECOMMENDED curves, the elliptic curve domain parameter
   identifier is the ASCII period-separated decimal representation of
   the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-ASN1" title='"Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Specification of basic notation"'>ASN1</a>] Object Identifier
   (OID) of the named curve domain parameters that are associated with
   the server's ECC host keys.  This identifier is defined provided that
   the concatenation of the public key format identifier and the
   elliptic curve domain parameter identifier (or the method name and
   the elliptic curve domain parameter identifier) does not exceed the
   maximum specified by the SSH protocol architecture [<a href="./rfc4251" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>], namely
   64 characters; otherwise, the identifier for that curve is undefined,
   and the curve is not supported by this specification.

   A list of the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED curves and their OIDs can be
   found in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   Note that implementations MUST use the string identifiers for the
   three REQUIRED NIST curves, even when an OID exists for that curve.

   identifier as defined in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.  A list of the required and

   The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange is defined by a
   family of method names.  Each method name is the concatenation of the
   string "ecdh-sha2-" with the elliptic curve domain parameter
   identifier as defined in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.  A list of the required and
   recommended curves and their OIDs can be found in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   For example, the method name for ECDH key exchange with ephemeral
   keys generated on the sect409k1 curve is "ecdh-sha2-1.3.132.0.36".

   The hashing algorithm defined by this family of method names is the
   SHA2 family of hashing algorithms [<a href="#ref-FIPS-180-3" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>FIPS-180-3</a>].  The hashing
   algorithm is defined in the method name to allow room for other
   algorithms to be defined in future documents.  The algorithm from the
   SHA2 family that will be used is chosen based on the size of the
   named curve specified in the method name according to the table in
   <a href="#section-6.2.1">Section 6.2.1</a>.

   The concatenation of any so encoded ASN.1 OID specifying a set of
   elliptic curve domain parameters with "ecdh-sha2-" is implicitly
   registered under this specification.

   The Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) key exchange is
   defined by the method name "ecmqv-sha2".  Unlike the ECDH key
   exchange method, ECMQV relies on a public key algorithm that uses ECC
   keys: it does not need a family of method names because the curve
   information can be gained from the public key algorithm.

   The hashing and message authentication code algorithms are defined by
   the method name to allow room for other algorithms to be defined for
   use with ECMQV in future documents.

   As this document provides new functionality within the Secure Shell
   protocol architecture, the only impact on network operations is the
   impact on existing Secure Shell implementations.  The Secure Shell
   protocol provides negotiation mechanisms for public key algorithms
   and key exchange methods: any implementations that do not recognize
   the algorithms and methods defined in this document will ignore them
   in the negotiation and use the next mutually supported algorithm or
   method, causing no negative impact on backward compatibility.

   The use of elliptic curve cryptography should not place a significant
   computational burden on an implementing server.  In fact, due to its
   smaller key sizes, elliptic curve cryptography can be implemented
   more efficiently for the same security level than RSA, finite field
   Diffie-Hellman, or DSA.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document provides new public key algorithms and new key
   agreement methods for the Secure Shell protocol.  For the most part,
   the security considerations involved in using the Secure Shell
   protocol apply.  Additionally, implementers should be aware of
   security considerations specific to elliptic curve cryptography.

   For all three classes of functionality added by this document (the
   public key algorithms involving ECDSA, key exchange involving ECDH,
   and authenticated key exchange involving ECMQV), the current best
   known technique for breaking the cryptosystems is by solving the
   elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP).

   The difficulty of breaking the ECDLP depends on the size and quality
   of the elliptic curve parameters.  Certain types of curves can be
   more susceptible to known attacks than others.  For example, curves
   over finite fields GF(2^m), where m is composite, may be susceptible
   to an attack based on the Weil descent.  All of the RECOMMENDED
   curves in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> do not have this problem.  System administrators
   should be cautious when enabling curves other than the ones specified
   in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> and should make a more detailed investigation into the
   security of the curve in question.

   It is believed (see, for example, Section B.2.1 of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>]) that when
   curve parameters are generated at random, the curves will be
   resistant to special attacks, and must rely on the most general
   attacks.  The REQUIRED curves in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> were all generated
   verifiably pseudorandomly.  The runtime of general attacks depends on
   the algorithm used.  At present, the best known algorithm is the
   Pollard-rho method.  (Shor's algorithm for quantum computers can

   solve the ECDLP in polynomial time, but at present large-scale
   quantum computers have not been constructed and significant
   experimental physics and engineering work needs to be done before
   large-scale quantum computers can be constructed.  There is no solid
   estimate as to when this may occur, but it is widely believed to be
   at least 20 years from the present.)

   Based on projections of computation power, it is possible to estimate
   the running time of the best known attacks based on the size of the
   finite field.  The table in <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> gives an estimate of the
   equivalence between elliptic curve field size and symmetric key size.
   Roughly speaking, an N-bit elliptic curve offers the same security as
   an N/2-bit symmetric cipher, so a 256-bit elliptic curve (such as the
   REQUIRED nistp256 curve) is suitable for use with 128-bit AES, for
   example.

   Many estimates consider that 2^80-2^90 operations are beyond
   feasible, so that would suggest using elliptic curves of at least
   160-180 bits.  The REQUIRED curves in this document are 256-, 384-,
   and 521-bit curves; implementations SHOULD NOT use curves smaller
   than 160 bits.

   A detailed discussion on the security considerations of elliptic
   curve domain parameters and the ECDH, ECDSA, and ECMQV algorithms can
   be found in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> of [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>SEC1</a>].

   Additionally, the key exchange methods defined in this document rely
   on the SHA2 family of hash functions, defined in [<a href="#ref-FIPS-180-3" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>FIPS-180-3</a>].  The
   appropriate security considerations of that document apply.  Although
   some weaknesses have been discovered in the predecessor, SHA-1, no
   weaknesses in the SHA2 family are known at present.  The SHA2 family
   consists of four variants -- SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-521
   -- named after their digest lengths.  In the absence of special
   purpose attacks exploiting the specific structure of the hash
   function, the difficulty of finding collisions, preimages, and second
   preimages for the hash function is related to the digest length.
   This document specifies in <a href="#section-6.2.1">Section 6.2.1</a> which SHA2 variant should be
   used with which elliptic curve size based on this guidance.

   Since ECDH and ECMQV allow for elliptic curves of arbitrary sizes and
   thus arbitrary security strength, it is important that the size of
   elliptic curve be chosen to match the security strength of other
   elements of the SSH handshake.  In particular, host key sizes,
   hashing algorithms and bulk encryption algorithms must be chosen
   appropriately.  Information regarding estimated equivalence of key
   sizes is available in [<a href="#ref-NIST-800-57" title='"Recommendation for Key Management - Part 1: General (Revised)"'>NIST-800-57</a>]; the discussion in [<a href="./rfc3766" title='"Determining Strengths For Public Keys Used For Exchanging Symmetric Keys"'>RFC3766</a>] is
   also relevant.  We note in particular that when ECDSA is used as the

   signature algorithm and ECDH is used as the key exchange method, if
   curves of different sizes are used, then it is possible that
   different hash functions from the SHA2 family could be used.

   The REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED curves in this document are at present
   believed to offer security at the levels indicated in this section
   and as specified with the table in <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a>.

   System administrators and implementers should take careful
   consideration of the security issues when enabling curves other than
   the REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED curves in this document.  Not all
   elliptic curves are secure, even if they are over a large field.

   Implementers SHOULD ensure that any ephemeral private keys or random
   values -- including the value k used in ECDSA signature generation
   and the ephemeral private key values in ECDH and ECMQV -- are
   generated from a random number generator or a properly seeded
   pseudorandom number generator, are protected from leakage, are not
   reused outside of the context of the protocol in this document, and
   are erased from memory when no longer needed.

   Implementations MAY support any ASN.1 object identifier (OID) in the

   Every SSH ECC implementation MUST support the named curves below.
   These curves are defined in [<a href="#ref-SEC2" title='"Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters"'>SEC2</a>]; the NIST curves were originally
   defined in [<a href="#ref-NIST-CURVES" title='"Recommended Elliptic Curves for Federal Government Use"'>NIST-CURVES</a>].  These curves SHOULD always be enabled
   unless specifically disabled by local security policy.
