RFC Editor Note:

   This memo corrects discrepancies between the values assigned for
   CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER and NVSE-TYPE-NUMBER in <a href="./rfc3025">RFC 3025</a> and in the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority's (IANA) repository.  The difference in
   the assigned values are as follows:

   CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER = 37 in <a href="./rfc3025">RFC 3025</a>
   CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER = 38 in IANA (Under Mobile IP numbers)

   NVSE-TYPE-NUMBER =  133 in <a href="./rfc3025">RFC 3025</a>
   NVSE-TYPE-NUMBER =  134 in IANA (Under Mobile IP numbers)

   This memo obsoletes <a href="./rfc3025">RFC 3025</a>, since the current implementations
   follow the IANA assignments.

Abstract

   This document defines two new extensions to Mobile IP.  These
   extensions will facilitate equipment vendors and organizations to
   make specific use of these extensions as they see fit for research or
   deployment purposes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   Current specification of Mobile IP [<a href="#ref-1" title='"IP Mobility Support"'>1</a>] does not allow for
   organizations and vendors to include organization/vendor-specific
   information in the Mobile IP messages.  With the imminent wide scale
   deployment of Mobile IP it is useful to have vendor or organization-
   Specific Extensions to support this capability.  This document
   defines two extensions that can be used for making organization
   specific extensions by vendors/organizations for their own specific
   purposes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20Specification%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>. Specification Language</span>

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>3</a>].

   In addition, the following words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.

   silently discard
            The implementation discards the datagram without further
            processing, and without indicating an error to the sender.
            The implementation SHOULD provide the capability of logging
            the error, including the contents of the discarded datagram,
            and SHOULD record the event in a statistics counter.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Vendor%2FOrganization%20Specific%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Vendor/Organization Specific Extensions</span>

   Two Vendor/Organization Specific Extensions are described, Critical
   (CVSE) and Normal (NVSE) Vendor/Organization Specific Extensions.
   The basic differences between the Critical and Normal Extensions are
   that when the Critical extension is encountered but not recognized,
   the message containing the extension MUST be silently discarded,
   whereas when a Normal Vendor/Organization Specific Extension is
   encountered but not recognized, the extension SHOULD be ignored, but
   the rest of the Extensions and message data MUST still be processed.
   Another difference between the two is that Critical
   Vendor/Organization Extension has a length field of two octets and
   the NVSE has a length field of only one octet.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3%20Vendor%2FOrganization%20Specific%20Extensions%20Processing%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a> Vendor/Organization Specific Extensions Processing Considerations</span>

   When a Mobile IP entity receives a registration request message (or
   any other request/update message) with an extension of type CVSE-
   TYPE-NUMBER and recognizes it, but the extension contains an
   unknown/unsupported vendor ID or Vendor-CVSE-Type, a registration
   reject (or the appropriate deny message) MUST be sent with the error
   code to indicate that the registration was rejected due to the
   presence of an unknown CVSE.

   When a Mobile IP entity receives a registration reply (or any other
   mobile IP reply/acknowledgement message) with an extension of type
   CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER and recognizes it, but the extensions contains an
   unknown/unsupported vendor ID or Vendor-CVSE-Type, the processing is
   performed as described below.

   1. If the Mobile IP entity is a transit node for the reply (i.e.,
   this entity processes and sends the registration reply to another
   entity) a registration reject (or the appropriate deny message) MUST
   be sent with the error code to indicate that the registration was
   rejected due to the presence of an unknown CVSE.  For example, FA
   when it receives an unknown CVSE in a registration reply from the HA,
   should send a registration reject to the MN.

   2. If the Mobile IP entity is not a transit node for the reply, the
   reply is treated as a reject (or the appropriate deny message) due to
   the presence of an unknown CVSE.

   While designing enhancements wherein a CVSE is included in a reply
   message, it should noted that the reply message could be discarded by
   the mobile IP entity processing this message.  Enhancements that
   include a CVSE should take this into consideration during design.

   When a Mobile IP entity receives a mobile IP related message
   (registration request/reply, advertisement/solicitation, etc.) with
   an extension of type NVSE-TYPE-NUMBER and recognizes it, but the
   extension contains an unknown/unsupported vendor ID or Vendor-NVSE-
   Type, the entire extension is skipped.

   NOTE that according to <a href="./rfc2002">RFC 2002</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"IP Mobility Support"'>1</a>], when an extension numbered
   within the range 0 through 127 is encountered in a registration
   message but not recognized, the message containing that extension
   MUST be silently discarded.  This document is compliant with the
   above specification and specifies the action if the extension of type
   CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER is encountered and recognized, but does not support
   the vendor ID or the vendor type extension within.

   The following error codes are defined.

   Registration denied by the Foreign agent:

        ERROR-FA-1 100: Unsupported Vendor-ID or
        unable to interpret Vendor-CVSE-Type in the CVSE sent by the
        Mobile Node to the Foreign Agent.

        ERROR-FA-2 101: Unsupported Vendor-ID or
        unable to interpret Vendor-CVSE-Type in the CVSE sent by the
        Home Agent to the Foreign Agent.

   Registration denied by the Home agent:

        ERROR-HA-1 140: Unsupported Vendor-ID or
        unable to interpret Vendor-CVSE-Type in the CVSE sent by the
        Mobile Node to the Home Agent.

        ERROR-HA-2 141: Unsupported Vendor-ID or
        unable to interpret Vendor-CVSE-Type in the CVSE sent by the
        Foreign Agent to the Home Agent.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Restrictions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Restrictions</span>

   Multiple TLV's with the types CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER and NVSE-TYPE-NUMBER
   can be included in a message.  TLVs with types CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER and
   NVSE-TYPE-NUMBER can be placed anywhere after the fixed portion of
   the Mobile IP message.  These TLVs are expected to be protected by
   the corresponding authenticator as necessary.  Ordering of these
   TLV's should not be modified by intermediate nodes.

   The Critical Vendor/Organization Specific Extension (CVSE) as defined
   in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> and Normal Vendor/Organization Specific Extension
   (NVSE) as defined in <a href="#section-2.2">section 2.2</a> are proposed new extensions to the

   [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Sun's SKIP Firewall Traversal for Mobile IP&quot;">5</a>].

   IANA has assigned a Type value of CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER for the Critical
   Vendor/Organization Specific Extension (CVSE), and a Type value of
   NVSE-TYPE-NUMBER for the Normal Vendor/Organization Specific
   Extension (NVSE).  The numbers CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER and NVSE-TYPE-NUMBER
   for the CVSE and the NVSE are taken from the numbering space defined
   for Mobile IP registration extensions [<a href="#ref-1" title='"IP Mobility Support"'>1</a>].

   This document assumes that the Mobile IP messages are authenticated
   using a method defined by the Mobile IP protocol.  This document does
   not impose any additional requirements on Mobile IP messages from a
   security point of view.  So this is not expected to be a security
   issue.
