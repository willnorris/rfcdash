Abstract

   Protocols such as ARP and Neighbor Discovery have data fields that
   contain link-layer addresses. In order to interoperate properly, a
   sender setting such a field must insure that the receiver extracts
   those bits and interprets them correctly.  In most cases, such fields
   must be in "canonical form".  Unfortunately, not all LAN adaptors are
   consistent in their use of canonical form, and implementations may
   need to explicitly bit swap individual bytes in order to obtain the
   correct format.  This document provides information to implementors
   to help them avoid the pitfall of using non-canonical forms when
   canonical forms are required.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Protocols such as ARP [<a href="#ref-ARP" title='"An Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol"'>ARP</a>] and ND [<a href="#ref-DISCOVERY" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>DISCOVERY</a>] have data fields that
   contain link-layer addresses.  In order to interoperate properly, a
   sender setting such a field must insure that the receiver extracts
   those bits and interprets them correctly.  In most cases, such fields
   must be in "canonical form".  Unfortunately, not all LAN adaptors are
   consistent in their use of canonical form, and implementations may
   need to explicitly bit swap individual bytes in order to obtain the
   correct format.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Canonical%20Form"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Canonical Form</span>

   Canonical form (also known as "LSB format" and "Ethernet format") is
   the name given to the format of a LAN adapter address as it should be
   presented to the user according to the 802 LAN standard.  It is best
   defined as how the bit order of an adapter address on the LAN media
   maps to the bit order of an adapter address in memory: The first bit
   of each byte that appears on the LAN maps to the least significant
   (i.e., right-most) bit of each byte in memory (the figure below
   illustrates this).  This puts the group address indicator (i.e., the
   bit that defines whether an address is unicast or multicast) in the
   least significant bit of the first byte.  Ethernet and 802.3 hardware
   behave consistently with this definition.

   Unfortunately, Token Ring (and some FDDI) hardware does not behave
   consistently with this definition; it maps the first bit of each byte
   of the adapter address to the most significant (i.e., left-most) bit
   of each byte in memory, which puts the group address indicator in the
   most significant bit of the first byte.  This mapping is variously
   called "MSB format", "IBM format", "Token-Ring format", and "non-
   canonical form".  The figure below illustrates the difference between
   canonical and non-canonical form using the canonical form address
   12-34-56-78-9A-BC as an example:

   In memory,      12       34       56       78       9A       BC
   canonical:   00010010 00110100 01010110 01111000 10011010 10111100

                1st bit appearing on LAN (group address indicator)

   In memory,
   MSB format:  01001000 00101100 01101010 00011110 01011001 00111101

   The implication of this inconsistency is that addresses extracted
   from adaptors, assigned to adaptors, or extracted from link-layer
   packet headers obtained from adaptors may need to be bit-swapped to
   put them into canonical form. Likewise, addresses in canonical form
   that are handed to adaptors (e.g., to set an address, to specify a
   destination address in a link-layer header, etc.) may need to be
   bit-swapped in order for the adaptor to process the request as
   expected.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Neighbor%20Discovery%20in%20IPv6"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Neighbor Discovery in IPv6</span>

   All of the IPv6 over specific link layers documents specify that
   link-layer addresses must be transmitted in canonical order [IPv6-
   ETHER, IPv6-FDDI, IPv6-TOKEN].  As far as the authors can tell, all
   Ethernet LAN adaptors use canonical order and no special processing
   by implementations is needed. In contrast, some FDDI and all Token
   Ring adaptors appear to use non-canonical format.  Implementors must
   insure that any addresses that appear in link-layer address options
   of Neighbor Discovery [<a href="#ref-DISCOVERY" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)"'>DISCOVERY</a>] messages are sent in canonical
   order and that any link-layer addresses extracted from ND packets are
   interpreted correctly on the local machine and its adaptors.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20IPv4%20and%20ARP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  IPv4 and ARP</span>

   Ethernet addresses that appear in ARP packets are in canonical order.
   In contrast, when running ARP over Token Ring, the de facto practice
   is to transmit addresses in non-canonical order. Because all Token
   Ring adaptors assume non-canonical ordering, no interoperability
   problems result between communicating nodes attached to the same
   Token Ring.

   In some environments, however, Token Rings and Ethernets are
   connected via a bridge. When a node on the Token Ring attempts to
   communicate with a node on the Ethernet, communication would normally
   fail, since the Ethernet will misinterpret the Token Ring address
   (and vice versa). To get around this problem, bridges that forward
   packets between dissimilar network types perform bit swaps of the
   addresses in the address fields of ARP packets that are forwarded
   from a network of one type to one of the other.
