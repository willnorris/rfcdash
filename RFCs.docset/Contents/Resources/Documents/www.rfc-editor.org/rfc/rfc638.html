                <span class="h1">IMP/TIP Preventive Maintenance Schedule</span>

      This RFC corrects numerous inaccuracies in RFC #633.  Rather than
      trying to list all the changes, I urge all Liaisons and other
      interested parties to look carefully at the times now listed for
      the sites they are interested in.

   This note presents the current IMP/TIP Preventive Maintenance
   schedule.  Preventive Maintenance is scheduled on a monthly basis and
   a given machine is normally scheduled at the same time each month;
   wherever possible the time is chosen to coincide with the PM time for
   the Host(s) at the site.

   It is sometimes necessary to reschedule PM's because of network
   connectivity considerations or for other reasons.  Whenever this is
   necessary we will follow the usual procedure for scheduling down time
   with our "primary contact" at the site.  Permanent changes to the
   schedule will he announced via the RFC mechanism.

   PM's normally do not require the IMP/TIP to be taken down.  However,
   machines must be taken down in some cases, so no one should rely on
   the machine remaining available through the PM period.

   PLEASE REMEMBER THAT TUESDAY MORNINGS FROM 7am TO 9am ARE RESERVED
   FOR NETWORK SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE.
