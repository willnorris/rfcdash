<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7885">RFC 7885</a>                  Seamless BFD for VCCV                July 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Background</span>

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Virtual Circuit
   Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [<a href="./rfc5885" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for the Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)"'>RFC5885</a>] defines the CV Types for
   BFD using VCCV, protocol operation, and the required packet
   encapsulation formats.  This document extends those procedures and
   CV Type values to enable Seamless BFD (S-BFD) [<a href="./rfc7880" title='"Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD)"'>RFC7880</a>] operation
   for VCCV.

   The new S-BFD CV Types are Pseudowire (PW) demultiplexer agnostic and
   hence are applicable for both MPLS and Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
   version 3 (L2TPv3) PW demultiplexers.  This document concerns itself
   with the S-BFD VCCV operation over Single-Segment PWs (SS-PWs).  The
   scope of this document is as follows:

   o  This specification describes procedures for S-BFD asynchronous
      mode only.

   o  S-BFD Echo mode is outside the scope of this specification.

   o  S-BFD operation for fault detection and status signaling is
      outside the scope of this specification.

   This document specifies the use of a single S-BFD Discriminator per
   PW.  There are cases where multiple S-BFD Discriminators per PW can
   be useful.  One such case involves using different S-BFD
   Discriminators per Flow within a Flow-Aware Transport (FAT) PW
   [<a href="./rfc6391" title='"Flow-Aware Transport of Pseudowires over an MPLS Packet Switched Network"'>RFC6391</a>]; however, the mapping between Flows and discriminators is a
   prerequisite.  FAT PWs can be supported as described in <a href="./rfc6391#section-7">Section 7 of
   [RFC6391]</a>, which details Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM) considerations for FAT PWs.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20S-BFD%20Connectivity%20Verification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  S-BFD Connectivity Verification</span>

   The S-BFD protocol provides continuity check services by monitoring
   the S-BFD Control packets sent and received over the VCCV channel of
   the PW.  The term "Connectivity Verification" (CV) is used throughout
   this document to be consistent with [<a href="./rfc5885" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for the Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)"'>RFC5885</a>].

   This section defines the CV Types to be used for S-BFD.  It also
   defines the procedures for the S-BFD reflector and S-BFD initiator
   operation.

   Two CV Types are defined for S-BFD.  Table 1 summarizes the S-BFD
   CV Types, grouping them by encapsulation (i.e., with IP/UDP headers,
   without IP/UDP headers) for fault detection only.  S-BFD for fault
   detection and status signaling is outside the scope of this
   specification.

                Table 1: Bitmask Values for S-BFD CV Types

   IANA has assigned two new bits to indicate S-BFD operation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Co-existence%20of%20S-BFD%20and%20BFD%20Capabilities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Co-existence of S-BFD and BFD Capabilities</span>

   Since the CV Types for S-BFD and BFD are unique, BFD and S-BFD
   capabilities can be advertised concurrently.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20S-BFD%20CV%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  S-BFD CV Operation</span>

   The S-BFD initiator SHOULD bootstrap S-BFD sessions after it learns
   the discriminator of the remote target identifier.  This can be
   achieved, for example, through one or more of the following methods.
   (This list is not exhaustive.)

   1.  Advertisements of S-BFD Discriminators made through a
       PW signaling protocol -- for example, AVPs/TLVs defined in
       L2TP/LDP.

   2.  Provisioning of S-BFD Discriminators by manual configuration of
       the Provider Edge (PE) or L2TP Control Connection Endpoints
       (LCCEs).

   3.  Assignment of S-BFD Discriminators by a controller.

   4.  Probing remote S-BFD Discriminators through a mechanism such as
       S-BFD Alert Discriminators [<a href="#ref-SBFD-ALERT-DISCRIM">SBFD-ALERT-DISCRIM</a>].

   The S-BFD initiator operation MUST be done as specified in
   <a href="./rfc7880#section-7.3">Section 7.3 of [RFC7880]</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.2.%20%20S-BFD%20Reflector%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2" id="section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  S-BFD Reflector Operation</span>

   When a PW signaling protocol such as LDP or L2TPv3 is in use, the
   S-BFD reflector can advertise its target discriminators using that
   signaling protocol.  When static PWs are in use, the target
   discriminator of S-BFD needs to be provisioned on the S-BFD
   initiator nodes.

   All point-to-point PWs are bidirectional; the S-BFD reflector
   therefore reflects the S-BFD packet back to the initiator using the
   VCCV channel of the reverse direction of the PW on which it was
   received.

   The reflector has enough information to reflect the S-BFD Async
   packet received by it back to the S-BFD initiator using the PW
   context (e.g., fields of the L2TPv3 headers).

   The S-BFD reflector operation for BFD protocol fields MUST be
   performed as specified in [<a href="./rfc7880" title='"Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD)"'>RFC7880</a>].

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.2.1.%20%20Demultiplexing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2.1" id="section-2.2.2.1">2.2.2.1</a>.  Demultiplexing</span>

   Demultiplexing of S-BFD is achieved using the PW context, following
   the procedures in <a href="./rfc7880#section-7.1">Section 7.1 of [RFC7880]</a>.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.2.2.%20%20Transmission%20of%20Control%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2.2" id="section-2.2.2.2">2.2.2.2</a>.  Transmission of Control Packets</span>

   S-BFD reflector procedures as described in [<a href="./rfc7880" title='"Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD)"'>RFC7880</a>] apply for S-BFD
   using VCCV.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.2.3.%20%20Advertisement%20of%20Target%20Discriminators%20Using%20LDP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2.3" id="section-2.2.2.3">2.2.2.3</a>.  Advertisement of Target Discriminators Using LDP</span>

   The advertisement of the target discriminator using LDP is left for
   further study.  It should be noted that S-BFD can still be used with
   signaled PWs over an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN) by
   provisioning the S-BFD Discriminators or by learning the S-BFD
   Discriminators via some other means.

   The S-BFD reflector MUST use the AVP defined in [<a href="./rfc7886" title='"Advertising Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) Discriminators in the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3)"'>RFC7886</a>] for
   advertising its target discriminators using L2TP.

   S-BFD target discriminators MAY be provisioned when static PWs
   are used.

   Unless specified differently below, the encapsulation of S-BFD
   packets is identical to the method specified in <a href="./rfc5885#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of
   [RFC5885]</a> and in [<a href="./rfc5880" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>] for the encapsulation of BFD packets.

   o  IP/UDP BFD encapsulation (BFD with IP/UDP headers):

      *  The destination UDP port for the IP-encapsulated S-BFD packet
         MUST be 7784 [<a href="./rfc7881" title='"Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) for IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS"'>RFC7881</a>].

      *  The contents of the S-BFD Control packets MUST be set according
         to <a href="./rfc7880#section-7.3.2">Section 7.3.2 of [RFC7880]</a>.

      *  The Time to Live (TTL) (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) is set
         to 255.

   o  PW-ACH/L2SS BFD encapsulation (BFD without IP/UDP headers):

      *  The encapsulation of S-BFD packets using this format MUST be
         performed according to <a href="./rfc5885#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of [RFC5885]</a>, with the
         exception of the value for the PW-ACH/L2SS type.

      *  When VCCV carries PW-ACH/L2SS-encapsulated S-BFD (i.e., "raw"
         S-BFD), the Channel Type of PW-ACH (the PW Control Word (CW))
         or L2SS MUST be set to 0x0008 to indicate "S-BFD Control,
         PW-ACH/L2SS-encapsulated" (i.e., S-BFD without IP/UDP headers;
         see <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>).  This is done to allow the identification of
         the encapsulated S-BFD payload when demultiplexing the VCCV
         control channel.

   When multiple S-BFD CV Types are advertised, and after applying the
   rules in [<a href="./rfc5885" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for the Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)"'>RFC5885</a>], the set that both ends of the PW have in common
   is determined.  If the two ends have more than one S-BFD CV Type in
   common, the following list of S-BFD CV Types is considered in order,
   from the lowest list number CV Type to the highest list number
   CV Type, and the CV Type with the lowest list number is used:

   1.  0x40 - S-BFD IP/UDP-encapsulated, for PW Fault Detection only.

   2.  0x80 - S-BFD PW-ACH/L2SS-encapsulated (without IP/UDP headers),
       for PW Fault Detection only.

   The order of capability selection between S-BFD and BFD is defined as
   follows:

   +---------------------------+---------+-----------+-----------------+
   |  Advertised capabilities  |   BFD   |   S-BFD   |  Both S-BFD and |
   |         of PE1/PE2        |   Only  |    Only   |       BFD       |

   [RFC5085]</a>.  The introduction of the S-BFD CV Types does not present
   any new security risks for VCCV.  Implementations of the additional
   CV Types defined herein are subject to the same security
   considerations as those defined in [<a href="./rfc5085" title='"Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV): A Control Channel for Pseudowires"'>RFC5085</a>] as well as [<a href="./rfc7880" title='"Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD)"'>RFC7880</a>].

   The IP/UDP encapsulation of S-BFD makes use of the TTL / Hop Limit
   procedures described in the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)
   specification [<a href="./rfc5082" title='"The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)"'>RFC5082</a>] as a security mechanism.

   This specification does not raise any additional security issues
   beyond these.

   This section lists the new S-BFD CV Types.

   IANA has augmented the "MPLS VCCV Connectivity Verification (CV)
   Types" registry in the "Pseudowire Name Spaces (PWE3)" registry
   [<a href="#ref-IANA-PWE3">IANA-PWE3</a>].  These are bitfield values.  CV Type values are
   specified in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document.
