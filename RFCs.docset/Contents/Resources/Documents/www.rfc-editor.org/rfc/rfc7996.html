<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Over the last few years, the RFC Editor has worked with the Internet
   community to develop specifications for changes in the format of
   RFCs.  An outline of the resulting specifications was published as
   [<a href="./rfc6949" title='"RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development"'>RFC6949</a>] in May 2013.  Since then, a Design Team has been working
   with the RFC Editor to flesh out those specifications.  One aspect of
   the changes is to allow line drawings in RFCs; [<a href="./rfc6949" title='"RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development"'>RFC6949</a>] says

      Graphics may include ASCII art and a more complex form to be
      defined, such as SVG line art [SVG].  Color and grayscale will not
      be accepted.  RFCs must correctly display in monochromatic black-
      and-white to allow for monochrome displays, black-and-white
      printing, and support for visual disabilities.

   SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) has been developed by W3C, the World
   Wide Web Consortium; its current standard is SVG 1.1 Full
   [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-SVG11-20110816">W3C.REC-SVG11-20110816</a>].  This document defines SVG 1.2 RFC, an SVG
   profile (i.e., a subset of SVG) that is suitable for RFC line
   drawings.

   Note that in RFCs, the text provides normative descriptions of
   protocols, systems, etc.  Diagrams may be used to help explain
   concepts more clearly, but they provide supporting details and should
   not be considered to be complete specifications in themselves.

   The details (particularly any vocabularies) described in this
   document are expected to change based on experience gained in
   implementing the new publication toolsets.  Revised documents will be
   published capturing those changes as the toolsets are completed.
   Other implementers must not expect those changes to remain backwards-
   compatible with the details described in this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20SVG%201.2%20RFC%3A%20An%20SVG%20Profile%20for%20RFCs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  SVG 1.2 RFC: An SVG Profile for RFCs</span>

   As a starting point for SVG 1.2 RFC, the Design Team decided to use
   SVG Tiny 1.2 (also referred to as "SVG 1.2 Tiny")
   [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222">W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222</a>].  SVG 1.2 Tiny is an SVG subset intended
   to be implemented on small, mobile devices such as cell phones and
   smartphones.  That should allow RFCs to be rendered well on such
   devices, especially those that have small screens.  However, RFCs are
   self-contained documents that do not change once they are published.
   The use of SVG drawings in RFCs is intended to allow authors to
   create drawings that are simple to produce and are easier to
   understand than our traditional "ASCII art" ones.  In short, we are
   also trying to improve access to the content in RFCs, so SVG drawings
   need to be kept as simple as possible.

   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> (below) provides a complete RELAX NG Compact (RNC) schema
   [<a href="#ref-RNG-HOME" title='"RELAX NG home page"'>RNG-HOME</a>] for SVG 1.2 RFC.  It is derived from the SVG 1.2 schema,
   and is the formal definition of SVG 1.2 RFC.  The remainder of this
   section gives a simplified -- i.e., easier to read and understand --
   overview of SVG 1.2 RFC.

   SVG can provide a complete User Interface, but within RFCs, all we
   need are simple diagrams that do not change once the RFC is
   published.  Therefore, SVG 1.2 RFC does not allow anything from the
   following sections in SVG Tiny 1.2 [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222">W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222</a>]:

   12  Multimedia
   13  Interactivity
   15  Scripting
   16  Animation
   18  Metadata
   19  Extensibility

   Note that SVG Tiny 1.2 elements may have many properties or
   attributes that are needed to support aspects of the above sections.
   Those are not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7996">RFC 7996</a>           SVG Drawings for RFCs: SVG 1.2 RFC      December 2016</span>


   We now consider these other sections in SVG Tiny 1.2
   [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222">W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222</a>]:

    9 Basic Shapes

   10 Text
        Everything in this section is allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.

   11 Painting: Filling, Stroking, Colors and Paint Servers
        Anything relating to 'color' is not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC;
        everything else is allowed.  This is a requirement documented in
        [<a href="./rfc6949" title='"RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development"'>RFC6949</a>].

   14 Linking
        SVG Tiny 1.2 allows Internationalized Resource Identifiers
        (IRIs) in references.  In SVG 1.2 RFC, such links must be ASCII
        only.  That should not cause problems, since one can just use
        the URI form of any IRI.  Authors should try to use links only
        to URIs that are long-term stable.

   17 Fonts
        SVG 1.2 RFC only allows 'serif', 'sans-serif', and 'monospace'
        generic font families from the WebFonts facility, described in
        <a href="#section-15">Section 15</a> ("Fonts") of the W3C Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 2.1
        document [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607">W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607</a>].  In particular, the SVG 'font'
        element is not allowed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Elements%2C%20Properties%2C%20and%20Attributes%20Allowed%20in%20SVG%201.2%20RFC"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Elements, Properties, and Attributes Allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC</span>

   This section discusses elements, properties, and attributes selected
   for SVG 1.2 RFC from [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222">W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222</a>].

   In the list below, elements and properties are listed on the
   left, and their allowed values are given in parentheses on the
   right.

   &lt;color&gt; is the list of allowed colors, a black-and-white
           subset of the SVG color names.

   &lt;style&gt; is a set of CSS attributes that are commonly used (by SVG
           drawing applications).  They are not part of SVG Tiny 1.2
           but are included here for compatibility.  Note that

           - There is no guarantee that any renderer will implement
             all the CSS attributes a drawing application may use.

           - Authors will need to consider the compatibility of their
             drawings with rendering devices.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20How%20to%20Create%20SVG%20Drawings"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  How to Create SVG Drawings</span>

   Many drawing packages can be used to create SVG drawings -- for
   example, Open Source packages Inkscape and Dia.  Be aware that such
   packages may use SVG elements or attributes that are not allowed in
   SVG 1.2 RFC.

   o  For example, the 'marker' attribute is often used to place symbols
      such as arrowheads on lines, but 'marker' is not allowed in
      SVG 1.2 Tiny or SVG 1.2 RFC.  In such cases, one has to draw the
      arrowhead in another, simpler way.

   o  SVG clip paths are used to define a shape; objects outside that
      shape become invisible.  The 'clipPath' element is not allowed in
      SVG 1.2 Tiny or SVG 1.2 RFC.

   Diagrams produced with these packages may contain elements, their
   attributes or properties, or values of attributes or properties that
   are not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.  We will need to provide a tool to
   either (1) strip out anything that is not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC or
   (2) replace disallowed values (e.g., replace 'Sans' with 'sans-serif'
   as an allowed value for 'font-family').  Experience with a simple
   test version of a tool for this has shown that such deletion and
   replacement can be effective for making SVG files from drawing
   packages conform to SVG 1.2 RFC, without visibly changing the
   diagrams they produce.

   The tool described above can also be used by authors simply to check
   that their diagrams conform to SVG 1.2 RFC.  To help with this, if
   visible changes do occur, the tool should produce a list of
   non-allowed keywords and the context in which they were found.

   To include a diagram in an RFC, the xml2rfc (v3) tool will need to
   provide a way to include SVG drawings in Internet-Drafts, as
   described in <a href="./rfc7991#section-2.5">Section 2.5 of [RFC7991]</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Accessibility%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Accessibility Considerations</span>

   One of the long-term goals for RFCs is to make them more accessible,
   e.g., to sight-impaired readers.  For diagrams, it would be useful
   for authors to provide alternative forms of the diagram, so that
   voice-reading software could be used to "talk through" the diagram.
   Simply reading the SVG code for a complex diagram seems unlikely
   to work.

   SVG 1.2 RFC allows SVG's 'title' and 'desc' elements.  'title'
   provides a brief text caption for an SVG object (much like a figure
   caption), and 'desc' provides a longer text description of what the
   object actually represents.  As well, the SVG 'role' attribute can be
   used to indicate to a browser how an SVG object is to be interpreted.
   Good suggestions on how to use these elements are given in
   [<a href="#ref-SVG-ACCESS-TIPS">SVG-ACCESS-TIPS</a>].

   ARIA is a W3C Recommendation for using SVG to create (as the name
   "ARIA" indicates) "Accessible Rich Internet Applications".  A helpful
   introduction to ARIA is provided by [<a href="#ref-SVG-ARIA-PRIMER">SVG-ARIA-PRIMER</a>], while
   [<a href="#ref-SVG-USING-ARIA">SVG-USING-ARIA</a>] gives examples of how to use ARIA to enhance SVG
   accessibility.

   Another way to create SVG drawings is to write programs to draw them.
   For example, using Python and its svgwrite module is a pleasant
   environment (for those who like writing code); this section presents
   a few examples of diagrams created in this way.  Note that they are
   merely examples of typical diagrams from RFCs.

   The following RNC schema can be used to check whether an SVG file
   conforms to SVG 1.2 RFC.  For example, if this schema were contained
   in a file called SVG-1.2-RFC.rnc, the following command will test
   whether SVG file diagram.svg is a conformant SVG 1.2 RFC drawing.

   jing -c SVG-1.2-RFC.rnc diagram.svg

   The RNC schema included below is available on the RFC Editor website
   &lt;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/format/SVG-1.2-RFC.rnc">https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/format/SVG-1.2-RFC.rnc</a>&gt;.  The
   website is considered definitive should there be any discrepancies.
