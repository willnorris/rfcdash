<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the current global hierarchical
   replicated distributed database system for Internet addressing, mail
   proxy, and similar information. The DNS has been extended to include
   digital signatures and cryptographic keys as described in [<a href="./rfc2535">RFC 2535</a>].
   Thus the DNS can now be used for secure key distribution.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1%20About%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a> About This Document</span>

   This document describes how to store Diffie-Hellman keys in the DNS.
   Familiarity with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is assumed
   [<a href="#ref-Schneier" title='"Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C"'>Schneier</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2%20About%20Diffie-Hellman"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a> About Diffie-Hellman</span>

   Diffie-Hellman requires two parties to interact to derive keying
   information which can then be used for authentication.  Since DNS SIG
   RRs are primarily used as stored authenticators of zone information
   for many different resolvers, no Diffie-Hellman algorithm SIG RR is
   defined. For example, assume that two parties have local secrets "i"
   and "j".  Assume they each respectively calculate X and Y as follows:

                X = g**i ( mod p ) Y = g**j ( mod p )

   They exchange these quantities and then each calculates a Z as
   follows:

                Zi = Y**i ( mod p ) Zj = X**j ( mod p )

   shared secret between the two parties that an adversary who does not
   know i or j will not be able to learn from the exchanged messages
   (unless the adversary can derive i or j by performing a discrete
   logarithm mod p which is hard for strong p and g).

   The private key for each party is their secret i (or j).  The public
   key is the pair p and g, which must be the same for the parties, and
   their individual X (or Y).

   Diffie-Hellman keys are stored in the DNS as KEY RRs using algorithm
   number 2.  The structure of the RDATA portion of this RR is as shown
   below.  The first 4 octets, including the flags, protocol, and
   algorithm fields are common to all KEY RRs as described in [RFC
   2535].  The remainder, from prime length through public value is the
   "public key" part of the KEY RR. The period of key validity is not in
   the KEY RR but is indicated by the SIG RR(s) which signs and
   authenticates the KEY RR(s) at that domain name.

   Prime length is length of the Diffie-Hellman prime (p) in bytes if it
   is 16 or greater.  Prime contains the binary representation of the
   Diffie-Hellman prime with most significant byte first (i.e., in
   network order). If "prime length" field is 1 or 2, then the "prime"
   field is actually an unsigned index into a table of 65,536
   prime/generator pairs and the generator length SHOULD be zero.  See
   Appedix A for defined table entries and <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for information on
   allocating additional table entries.  The meaning of a zero or 3
   through 15 value for "prime length" is reserved.

   Generator length is the length of the generator (g) in bytes.
   Generator is the binary representation of generator with most
   significant byte first.  PublicValueLen is the Length of the Public
   Value (g**i (mod p)) in bytes.  PublicValue is the binary
   representation of the DH public value with most significant byte
   first.

   The corresponding algorithm=2 SIG resource record is not used so no
   format for it is defined.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20Performance%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. Performance Considerations</span>

   Current DNS implementations are optimized for small transfers,
   typically less than 512 bytes including overhead.  While larger
   transfers will perform correctly and work is underway to make larger
   transfers more efficient, it is still advisable to make reasonable
   efforts to minimize the size of KEY RR sets stored within the DNS
   consistent with adequate security.  Keep in mind that in a secure
   zone, an authenticating SIG RR will also be returned.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. IANA Considerations</span>

   Assignment of meaning to Prime Lengths of 0 and 3 through 15 requires
   an IETF consensus.

   Well known prime/generator pairs number 0x0000 through 0x07FF can
   only be assigned by an IETF standards action and this Proposed
   Standard assigns 0x0001 through 0x0002. Pairs number 0s0800 through
   0xBFFF can be assigned based on RFC documentation.  Pairs number
   0xC000 through 0xFFFF are available for private use and are not
   centrally coordinated. Use of such private pairs outside of a closed
   environment may result in conflicts.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   Many of the general security consideration in [<a href="./rfc2535">RFC 2535</a>] apply.  Keys
   retrieved from the DNS should not be trusted unless (1) they have
   been securely obtained from a secure resolver or independently
   verified by the user and (2) this secure resolver and secure
   obtainment or independent verification conform to security policies
   acceptable to the user.  As with all cryptographic algorithms,
   evaluating the necessary strength of the key is important and
   dependent on local policy.

   In addition, the usual Diffie-Hellman key strength considerations
   apply. (p-1)/2 should also be prime, g should be primitive mod p, p
   should be "large", etc.  [<a href="#ref-Schneier" title='"Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C"'>Schneier</a>]
