Abstract

   Ever since Gutenberg discovered and patented ASCII and the
   corresponding "Courier New" font with its now-famous "ten" point
   size, artisans and artificers have striven to represent their views
   of the world in print.

   Similarly, starting from Darwin's discovery of the hippogriff and his
   subsequent registration of the creature as an International Trade
   Mark, men (and some women) have struggled to catalog the fabulous
   variety that is called "nature".

   This document supplies a number of representations of all manner of
   things (both elemental and hypothetical) supplied by some of our best
   collectors of curios and delivered in a manner that may well be
   reused by the cunning document author.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, where princes were
   available to those who knew how to kiss, and frogs could be picked up
   by the handful and were sold in brown paper bags at the shop on the
   corner of your street, there was an impish discovery made by the
   appropriately named Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg.
   His name, it turned out, was coincidentally fortuitous for when he
   uncovered the Gutenberg Press he was able to claim it as his own.

   Amongst Gutenberg's better known discoveries were the ten point font,
   the Courier New Font (which he is supposed to have found growing in a
   hedgerow close to his cottage), and the ASCII character set.  All of
   these have been embraced as comforting and warm blankets by the
   engineers of the IETF as they embark on expeditions to plot the
   desolated wastes of the Internet.

   Although the RFC Editor has recently dragged the IETF kicking and
   screaming into the twentieth century [<a href="./rfc7990" title='"RFC Format Framework"'>RFC7990</a>] [<a href="./rfc7996" title='"SVG Drawings for RFCs: SVG 1.2 RFC"'>RFC7996</a>], there is a
   yearning among all right-thinking Internet architects to "keep it
   simple" and to return to the olden days when pigs could be given
   thrust without anyone taking undue offence [<a href="./rfc1925" title='"The Twelve Networking Truths"'>RFC1925</a>].  This document
   attempts to address that yearning by demonstrating the full wonder of
   the natural world in vivid two-dimensional representation and a
   colour palette that would put even the august L. S. Lowry to shame.

   Readers of this document are encouraged to be familiar.

   "Many and wonderful are the beasts of the land" wrote the poet.  And
   he was right in some ways.

   Of these many beasts, the most fabulous are the Troll and the
   Unicorn.  Here are reproduced representations of sightings in the
   field.

   The troll is an evil beast that frequently appears around the IETF.
   It feeds alternately on passing goats and cookies, but it prefers
   above all things the taste of distress, especially that expressed in
   email.

   Trolls should be shunned and never fed.  Stories about them being
   sensitive to water or light are unsubstantiated, but it may be true
   that they can be pacified with alcohol.

   The chief weapons of a Troll are its sharp tongue, its blunt
   phrasing, and its total disregard for doing useful work.

   Many things in the IETF rely on majick.  Without pixie dust or other
   artful contributions from the world of faerie, it is unlikely that
   the Internet would work at all.

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a concept whereby complex and
   devious networks may be subjugated to the will of a sorcerer (or an
   opensourcerer as they are sometimes know).  Fundamental to the body
   of an SDN is the Path Computation Element (PCE) [<a href="./rfc7399" title='"Unanswered Questions in the Path Computation Element Architecture"'>RFC7399</a>].  Essential
   to the proper function of the PCE is the Unicorn that roams the dark
   wood of the Traffic Engineering Database, rearing up and spearing
   unwitting paths on the horn of its intellect.

   Unicorns, it is claimed, can only be captured by the pure of heart
   who have never operated a real network.

   "Not all that crawls upon the land can rival the creatures of the
   deep," said the great ethnographer and philanderer.  And how often it
   has been observed that he was both wise and drunk.

   The things that slide below the surface of the water remain hidden to
   most of us, a mystery no less than the ways of the elliptic curve.
   Most elusive of all is the Loch Ness Monster; most peculiar is the
   Marlynne.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20The%20Loch%20Ness%20Monster"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  The Loch Ness Monster</span>

   So rare are the sightings of this beast that we must count ourselves
   lucky to have presented here a very real etching collected at great
   expense from a native Scott.

   The Loch Ness Monster appears most often on dark nights or in heavy
   storms when the only thing that parts the fog is the rain that lashes
   your face.  Thus, the creature is most often visible when it can be
   least well seen.  In this respect, it is most like clear text in an
   RFC, which is most easy to read and comprehend when it is least
   written.

   Getting to the point is not always something that is practised in the
   IETF.  But there is one beast that Roams the Deeps and Never Sleeps:
   The Marlynne, when hauled from its roost by an unsuspecting fisherman
   for delivery to his equally unsuspecting fishwife has often been
   mistaken for a very angry mermaid [<a href="#ref-MTFTW" title='"More Tales From The Wood"'>MTFTW</a>].  Do not mistake its sharp
   wit for a valid argument.

   As can be seen from the rendition here presented, the Marlynne is
   happy in its work.

   Cloud is the latest buzz for the trendy hipster, active in
   networking.  But be careful not to let your feet get off the crowd
   lest your head become implanted somewhere it shouldn't be.

   Most afeared of all of the creatures is surely the vampire, for it
   will drain the blood of any good idea until it withers or is
   completely changed into a problem statement I-D.  More scary than the
   dreaded Old Timer that will suck the air from a room with its hated
   Process Discussion.  More frightening than the <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> Usage Debate
   of Doom.

   The vampire bat is sometimes mistaken for its third cousin on its
   mother's side, the fruitbat.  That beast is equally evil and will
   remove whole plates of fruit from refreshment tables, leaving only
   celery sticks for latecomers.

   Data that is once nibbled by a vampire may find that some of its most
   precious bits become corrupted and drop off.  Sure protection may
   only be achieved by placing garlic in the metadata or overhead of a
   packet.

   More famous than the Thrusted Pig [<a href="./rfc1925" title='"The Twelve Networking Truths"'>RFC1925</a>] and more celebrated than
   the Infinite Monkey [<a href="./rfc2795" title='"The Infinite Monkey Protocol Suite (IMPS)"'>RFC2795</a>] is the Avian Carrier [<a href="./rfc1149" title='"Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams on avian carriers"'>RFC1149</a>].

   This scavenger of the sky comes in a variety of bright colors,
   perhaps an evolutionary trait enabling a hunter to distinguish the
   carriers and drop those it considers weakest, or maybe acting as a
   warning to predatory Buphyres so that they do not attack the carriers
   deemed most important by the flock.

   "Man has become God and shapes the world at will" said the slightly
   disgruntled theologian.  And who would dare argue this point that
   wanted to escape the conversation in time to get home for dinner?

   When Laura Ingalls Wilder was just starting out on her cover designs,
   she agonized about what shade her little house should be.  She
   narrowly avoided madness thanks to the timely intervention of
   Professor Kandinsky, a prominent Moscow lawyer.

   It has often been asserted that new art forms are needed to allow the
   inclusion of colors in IETF publications.  Figure 8 clearly
   demonstrates this to be a fallacy.

   Many stories have been told of how young Hans and his sister, the
   equally young Gretha, came to be abandoned in the woods [<a href="#ref-TFTW" title='"Tales From The Wood"'>TFTW</a>].
   However, it may have been Herr Grimm and his eponymous brother, Herr
   Grimm, who first recorded the existence of a house made of
   gingerbread (with all the trimmings).

   Note that attempts to perform packet tracing using breadcrumbs will
   usually fail owing to avian carriers who like to keep the forest
   floor tidy (<a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.

   IANA might consider introducing a registry for Figure 8 to track the
   assignment of colours to shapes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Stone walls do not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage: but they do
   help.  And with this in mind, our elders encourage us always to be
   mindful of the security and privacy of our eternal souls.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.1.%20%20A%20Private%20Key"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" id="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  A Private Key</span>

   Keys that are shared are keys that other people have.  If someone
   else has a key, they will use it.  If you have a key, you will
   probably leave it in the lock or drop it in the street.  Hence we
   conclude that keys are a security vulnerability.

   Locks, on the other hand, are good.  They can become rusted solid,
   meaning that no one can open them.  What could be more secure?

   And remember, a smile is the key that fits the lock to everybody's
   heart.  So don't trust people who smile.

   If you have a door, you are admitting (sic) a weakness.  A closed
   door invites opening, and an open door invites ingress.  Security
   lies in bricks and mortar.

   Some of the wild beasts depicted in this tome are best confined to a
   managerie.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.%20%20Morality%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" id="section-9">9</a>.  Morality Considerations</span>

   In accordance with advice offered in [<a href="./rfc4041" title='"Requirements for Morality Sections in Routing Area Drafts"'>RFC4041</a>], this section
   considers the impact of this document on the public morals.

   It is still the view of popular opinion and can be verified by
   reliable metrics that moral values are declining and that degeneracy
   is on the rise.  One has only to look at the apostasy surrounding the
   True Use of Language as set forth in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] to know that
   the populace has become truly debauched.

   Care must be taken lest ASCII fall into the hands of disreputable
   characters.

   We should warn our children against engraving self-portraits in
   ASCII-art and sharing them with their friends as woodcuts or in other
   modern media.  Recall that a picture, once made, lasts forever.

   The very idea that someone might patent unicorn DNA is, of course,
   unthinkable.  Large companies only have our best interests at heart.

   Adequate oversight of all things is performed by the RFC Editor.  Who
   has a higher moral compass or a better sense of directional values?

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/9.5.%20%20Other%20Ways%20of%20Doing%20Things"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.5" id="section-9.5">9.5</a>.  Other Ways of Doing Things</span>

   Radical and subversive cliques, such as that established by the
   heretics, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, may also be represented in
   ASCII art.  However, doing so will, in almost every case, exceed the
   72 character width limit used by all right-thinking people and must,
   therefore, be avoided by all who do not wish to be doomed to spend
   eternity in a dark corner with only dial-up access.
