   The purpose of this RFC is to report on the recent status of most
   Network Hosts.  During September 27 through September 29 the BBN
   prototype Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) was inaccessible due to
   hardware debugging.  The Network was, therefore, not examined on
   these days.

   Three Hosts which were not officially able to act as Server's at the
   time of RFC #240 are now able to do so.  These Hosts are:

         NETWORK          SITE              COMPUTER
         ADDRESS
         2                SRI (NIC)         PDF-10
         6                MIT (Multics)     H-645
         9                HARVARD           PDP-10

   The Harvard PDP-10, however, has limited core space.  They will,
   therefore, run the Telnet program only occasionally.

   The following two tables summarize the information on the Host status
   for September 30 - October 8.

   where

      D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to
      network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal
      IMP.)

      R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

      T = Timed out (Destination Host did not respond in any way to the
      initial RFC, although not dead.)

      H = 1/2  Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then
      either immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

      0 = Opened (Destination Host opened a connection and was
      accessible to user.)

      * The UCLA IMB-360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS),
        but has not implemented a full server Telnet System.  The BBN
        Terminal IMP is not equipped to test NETRJS however, we are
        assuming that receipt of the UCLA explanatory message indicates
        that NETRJS is also functioning.
