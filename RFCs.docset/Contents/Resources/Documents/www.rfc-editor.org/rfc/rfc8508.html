Abstract

   This document defines an IMAP extension that can be used to replace
   an existing message in a message store with a new message.  Message
   replacement is a common operation for clients that automatically save
   drafts or notes as a user composes them.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Overview</span>

   This document defines an IMAP ([<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>]) extension to facilitate the
   replacement of an existing message with a new one.  This is
   accomplished by defining a new REPLACE command and extending the
   Unique Identifier (UID) command to allow UID REPLACE.

   Since there is no replace function in the base IMAP specification,
   clients have instead had to use a combination of three separate
   commands issued in serial fashion; APPEND, STORE, and EXPUNGE.
   Pipelining of these three commands is not recommended since failure
   of any individual command should prevent subsequent commands from
   being executed lest the original message version be lost.

   Because of the non-atomic nature of the existing sequence,
   interruptions can leave messages in intermediate states that can be
   seen and acted upon by other clients.  Such interruptions can also
   strand older revisions of messages, thereby forcing the user to
   manually clean up multiple revisions of the same message in order to
   avoid wasteful quota consumption.  Additionally, the existing
   sequence can fail on APPEND due to an over-quota condition even

   though the subsequent STORE/EXPUNGE would free up enough space for
   the newly revised message.  And finally, server efficiencies may be
   possible with a single logical message replacement operation as
   compared to the existing APPEND/STORE/EXPUNGE sequence.

   In its simplest form, the REPLACE command is a single-command
   encapsulation of APPEND, STORE +flags \DELETED, and UID EXPUNGE for a
   message, except that it avoids any of the quota implications or
   intermediate states associated with the three-command sequence.
   Server developers are encouraged to implement REPLACE as an atomic
   operation to simplify error handling, minimize operational concerns,
   and reduce potential security problems.  For systems where this is
   not possible, communication with the requesting client must ensure no
   confusion of message store state.  A server MUST NOT generate a
   response code for the STORE +flags \DELETED portion of the sequence.
   Additionally, servers supporting the REPLACE command MUST NOT infer
   any inheritance of content, flags, or annotations from the message
   being replaced.

   This extends the first form of the UID command (see <a href="./rfc3501#section-6.4.8">Section 6.4.8 of
   [RFC3501]</a>) to add the REPLACE command defined above as a valid
   argument.  This form of REPLACE uses a UID rather than a sequence
   number as its first parameter.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8508">RFC 8508</a>                 IMAP REPLACE Extension             January 2019</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20%20Semantics%20of%20REPLACE%20and%20UID%20REPLACE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Semantics of REPLACE and UID REPLACE</span>

   The REPLACE and UID REPLACE commands take five arguments: a message
   identifier, a named mailbox, an optional parenthesized flag list, an
   optional message date/time string, and a message literal.  The
   message literal will be appended to the named mailbox, and the
   message specified by the message identifier will be removed from the
   selected mailbox.  These operations will appear to the client as a
   single action.  This has the same effect as the following sequence:

      1. APPEND
      2. [UID] STORE +FLAGS.SILENT \DELETED
      3. UID EXPUNGE

   In the cited sequence, the quota implications of APPEND are evaluated
   within the context of the pending EXPUNGE so that only the net quota
   consumption is considered.  Additionally, the EXPUNGE portion of the
   sequence only applies to the specified message, not all messages
   flagged as "\Deleted".

   Although the effect of REPLACE is identical to the steps above, the
   semantics are not identical; similar to MOVE [<a href="./rfc6851" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - MOVE Extension"'>RFC6851</a>], the
   intermediate states do not occur and the response codes are
   different.  In particular, the response codes for APPEND and EXPUNGE
   will be returned while those for the STORE operation MUST NOT be
   generated.

   When an error occurs while processing REPLACE or UID REPLACE, the
   server MUST NOT leave the selected mailbox in an inconsistent state;
   any untagged EXPUNGE response MUST NOT be sent until all actions are
   successfully completed.

   While it may be common for the named mailbox argument to match the
   selected mailbox for the common use case of replacing a draft, the
   REPLACE extension intentionally does not require the two to be the
   same.  As an example, it's possible to use the REPLACE command to
   replace a message in the \Drafts special-use mailbox (see <a href="./rfc6154#section-2">Section 2
   of [RFC6154]</a>) with a message in the \Sent special-use mailbox
   following message submission.

   Because of the similarity of REPLACE to APPEND, extensions that
   affect APPEND affect REPLACE in the same way.  Response codes such as
   TRYCREATE (see <a href="./rfc3501#section-6.3.11">Section 6.3.11 of [RFC3501]</a>), along with those defined
   by extensions, are sent as appropriate.  See <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for more
   information about how REPLACE interacts with other IMAP extensions.

   Unlike the APPEND command, which is valid in the authenticated state,
   the REPLACE and UID REPLACE commands MUST only be valid in the
   selected state.  This difference from APPEND is necessary since
   REPLACE operates on message sequence numbers.  Additionally, the
   REPLACE extension intentionally follows the convention for UID
   commands found in <a href="./rfc3501#section-6.4.8">Section 6.4.8 of [RFC3501]</a> in that the UID variant
   of the command does not support use from the authenticated state.

   This section describes how REPLACE interacts with some other IMAP
   extensions.

   The Access Control List (ACL) rights [<a href="./rfc4314" title='"IMAP4 Access Control List (ACL) Extension"'>RFC4314</a>] required for UID
   REPLACE are the union of the ACL rights required for UID STORE and
   UID EXPUNGE in the current mailbox, and APPEND in the target mailbox.

   Servers supporting both REPLACE and CATENATE [<a href="./rfc4469" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) CATENATE Extension"'>RFC4469</a>] MUST support
   the additional append-data and resp-text-code elements defined in
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> ("Formal Syntax") of [<a href="./rfc4469" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) CATENATE Extension"'>RFC4469</a>] in conjunction with the
   REPLACE command.  When combined with CATENATE, REPLACE can become
   quite an efficient way of message manipulation.

   Servers supporting both REPLACE and UIDPLUS [<a href="./rfc4315" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - UIDPLUS extension"'>RFC4315</a>] SHOULD send
   APPENDUID in response to a UID REPLACE command.  For additional
   information, see <a href="./rfc4315#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC4315]</a>.  Servers implementing
   REPLACE and UIDPLUS are also advised to send the APPENDUID response
   code in an untagged OK before sending the EXPUNGE or replaced
   responses.  (Sending APPENDUID in the tagged OK as described in the
   UIDPLUS specification means that the client first receives EXPUNGE
   for a message and afterwards APPENDUID for the new message.  It can
   be unnecessarily difficult to process that sequence usefully.)

   REPLACE applies to IMAP events in Sieve [<a href="./rfc6785" title='"Support for Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Events in Sieve"'>RFC6785</a>] in the same way
   that APPEND does.  Therefore, REPLACE can cause a Sieve script to be
   invoked with the imap.cause set to "APPEND".  Because the
   intermediate state of STORE +FLAGS.SILENT \DELETED is not exposed by
   REPLACE, no action will be taken that results in an imap.cause of
   FLAG.

   Servers implementing both REPLACE and CONDSTORE/QRESYNC [<a href="./rfc7162" title='"IMAP Extensions: Quick Flag Changes Resynchronization (CONDSTORE) and Quick Mailbox Resynchronization (QRESYNC)"'>RFC7162</a>]
   MUST treat the message being replaced as if it were being removed
   with a UID EXPUNGE command.  Sections <a href="#section-3.2.9">3.2.9</a> and <a href="#section-3.2.10">3.2.10</a> of [<a href="./rfc7162" title='"IMAP Extensions: Quick Flag Changes Resynchronization (CONDSTORE) and Quick Mailbox Resynchronization (QRESYNC)"'>RFC7162</a>]

   Servers implementing both REPLACE and OBJECTID [<a href="./rfc8474" title='"IMAP Extension for Object Identifiers"'>RFC8474</a>] MUST return
   different EMAILIDs for both the replaced and replacing messages.  The
   only exception to this is the case outlined in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> ("EMAILID
   Identifier for Identical Messages") of [<a href="./rfc8474" title='"IMAP Extension for Object Identifiers"'>RFC8474</a>] when the server
   detects that both messages' immutable content is identical.

   The REPLACE extension has no interaction with MULTIAPPEND [<a href="./rfc3502" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - MULTIAPPEND Extension"'>RFC3502</a>].
   This document explicitly does not outline a method for replacing
   multiple messages concurrently.

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].  [<a href="./rfc3501" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>] defines
   the non-terminals "capability","command-select", "mailbox",
   "seq-number", and "uid".  [<a href="./rfc4466" title='"Collected Extensions to IMAP4 ABNF"'>RFC4466</a>] defines the non-terminal
   "append-message".

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case
   insensitive.  The use of uppercase or lowercase characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

   capability     =/ "REPLACE"

   command-select =/ replace
   replace        = "REPLACE" SP seq-number SP mailbox append-message
   uid            =/ "UID" SP replace

   This document is believed to add no security problems beyond those
   that may already exist with the base IMAP specification.  The REPLACE
   command may actually prevent some potential security problems because
   it avoids intermediate message states that could possibly be
   exploited by an attacker.
