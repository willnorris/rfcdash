                   <span class="h1">IPv6 Address Allocation Management</span>

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   The IPv6 address space will be managed by the IANA for the good of
   the Internet community, with advice from the IAB and the IESG, by
   delegation to the regional registries.

Statement

   The IPv6 address space must be managed for the good of the Internet
   community.  Good management requires at least a small element of
   central authority over the delegation and allocation of the address
   space.

   The Internet community recognizes the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) as the appropriate entity to have the responsibility
   for the management of the IPv6 address space.

   The IANA will rely on the advice of the Internet Architecture Board
   (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) in the
   management of the IPv6 address space.

   The IANA will delegate to regional (and other) registries the task of
   making specific address allocations to network service providers and
   other subregional registries.  Individuals and organizations may
   obtain address allocations directly from the appropriate regional (or
   other) registry, or from their service provider.

   Delegation of address space by the IANA is not irrevocable. If, in
   the judgement of the IANA, a registry has seriously mishandled the
   address space delegated to it, the IANA may revoke the delegation,
   with due notice and with due consideration of the operational
   implications.  IANA will make every effort in such a case not to
   revoke addresses that are in active use, unless there are
   overwhelming technical reasons for doing so.

   Any revenues (such as transaction fees) received with respect to the
   IPv6 address space should be used only for expenses related to
   registry activities, and not to subsidize any other activities.
   There will be no charges for the address space itself, only fees to
   recover the registry costs.

   Any situation in the management of the IPv6 address space that leads
   to monopoly control or predatory practices must be avoided.

   The IANA will develop a plan for the initial IPv6 address allocation,
   including a provision for the automatic allocation of IPv6 addresses
   to holders of IPv4 addresses. IANA will also develop mediation and
   appeals procedures concerning delegation and revocation.
