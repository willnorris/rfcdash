Abstract

   The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be carried out
   by various persons or entities.  The RFC Editor model presented in
   this document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into
   four functions: The RFC Series Editor, the Independent Submission
   Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.  It also
   introduces the RFC Series Advisory Group and an (optional)
   Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board.  The model outlined
   here is intended to increase flexibility and operational support
   options, provide for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and
   ensure the continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC
   quality and timely processing, ensuring document accessibility,
   reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5620">RFC 5620</a>              RFC Editor Model (Version 1)           August 2009</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is concerned
   with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC Editor
   succession, maintaining RFC quality, and RFC document accessibility.
   The IAB is also sensitive to the concerns of the IETF Administrative
   Oversight Committee (IAOC) about providing the necessary services in
   a cost-effective and efficient manner.

   The definition of the RFC series is described in <a href="./rfc4844">RFC 4844</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The RFC Series and RFC Editor"'>1</a>].
   <a href="./rfc4844#section-3.1">SectionÂ 3.1 of RFC 4844</a> defines "RFC Editor":

 | 3.1. RFC Editor
 |
 |  Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
 |  Series (the RFC Editor).  The task has grown, and the work now
 |  requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC
 |  Editors, or an RFC Editor organization.  In time, there may be
 |  multiple organizations working together to undertake the work
 |  required by the RFC Series.  For simplicity's sake, and without
 |  attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,
 |  this document refers to this collection of experts and organizations
 |  as the "RFC Editor".
 |
 |  The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,
 |  acting to support the mission of the RFC Series.  As such, the RFC
 |  Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the
 |  RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes.  In addition,
 |  the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in
 |  discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
 |  RFCs.

   <a href="./rfc4844">RFC 4844</a> makes no attempt to explore the internal organization of the
   RFC Editor.  However, <a href="./rfc4844">RFC 4844</a> envisions changes in the RFC Editor
   organizational structure.  In discussion with the Internet community,
   the IAB considered changes that increase flexibility and operational
   support options, provide for the orderly succession of the RFC
   Editor, and ensure the continuity of the RFC series, while
   maintaining RFC quality and timely processing, ensuring document
   accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency.  The
   model set forth below is the result of those discussions, and
   examines the internal organization of the RFC Editor, while remaining
   consistent with <a href="./rfc4844">RFC 4844</a>.








<span class="grey">Kolkman &amp; IAB                Informational                      [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5620">RFC 5620</a>              RFC Editor Model (Version 1)           August 2009</span>


   Note that <a href="./rfc4844">RFC 4844</a> uses the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC
   Editor" as the collective set of responsibilities for which this memo
   provides a model for internal organization.  This memo introduces the
   term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series Editor" for one of the
   organizational components.

   While the IAB approved the initial version of this RFC Editor model
   on October 1, 2008, the model has received clarifications since.  It
   should be noted that the publication of the document as an RFC does
   not cast the model in stone, as the primary purpose of this document,
   throughout the publication process, is to encourage normal community
   review in order to ascertain consensus to work to this model as a
   first step.  The document, and the resulting structures, will be
   modified as needed through normal procedures.  The IAB will continue
   to monitor discussions within the community about potential
   adjustments to the RFC Editor model and recognizes that the process
   described in this document may need to be adjusted to align with any
   changes that result from such discussions, hence the version number
   in the title.

   In particular, the document will be reviewed after the various
   transition periods and mechanisms specified in this version are
   completed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20IAOC%20Implementation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  IAOC Implementation</span>

   The model is constructed in such a way that it allows for all these
   functions to be implemented jointly or under separate contractual
   arrangements.  In fact, a bidder could put together a proposal that
   includes one or more subcontractors.  The reporting structure will
   depend on the manner that the contracts are awarded, and they are
   subject to change over time.  As a result, the model describes only
   responsibilities, procedures, and process.  The exact implementation
   is a responsibility of the IAOC.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Expenses%20for%20the%20RFC%20Editor"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Expenses for the RFC Editor</span>

   The expenses discussed in this document are not new expenses.  They
   are part of the IASA budget.  Today, these expenses are part of the
   RFC Editor contract with the University of Southern California's
   Information Sciences Institute.

   The RFC Editor model divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series
   into the following components:

   o  RFC Series Editor ("RSE").

   o  Independent Submission Editor ("ISE").

   o  RFC Production Center.

   o  RFC Publisher.

   The RFC Series production and process under this structure is
   schematically represented by the figure below.  (The figure does not
   depict oversight and escalation relations.)

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5620">RFC 5620</a>              RFC Editor Model (Version 1)           August 2009</span>


   In this model, documents are produced and approved through multiple
   document streams.  The four that now exist are described in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The RFC Series and RFC Editor"'>1</a>].
   Documents from these streams are edited and processed by the
   Production Center and published by the Publisher.  The RFC Series
   Editor will exercise executive-level management over many of the
   activities of the RFC Publisher and the RFC Production Center (which
   can be seen as back-office functions) and will be the entity that:

   o  Faces the community.

   o  Works with the IAOC for contractual responsibilities.

   o  In collaboration with the RFC Series Advisory Group (RSAG),
      identifies and leads community discussion of important issues and
      opportunities facing the RFC Series.

   while the IAB and IAOC maintain their chartered responsibility.  More
   details about the collaboration with the RSAG and the IAB
   responsibilities can be found in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   The RSE does not have the authority to hire or fire RFC Editor
   contractors or personnel (see <a href="#section-4.1.3">Section 4.1.3</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20RFC%20Series%20Editor"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  RFC Series Editor</span>

   The RFC Series Editor is an individual who may have assistants and
   who will regularly be provided support from an advisory group (see
   <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).  The RSE is responsible for:

   1.  Identifying appropriate steps for RFC Series continuity;

   2.  Exercising executive-level management over the implementation of
       policies, processes, and procedures established to ensure the
       quality and consistency for the RFC Series.  The RFC Series
       Editor will work with the RSAG, and, where appropriate, the IAB
       and IAOC to develop new policy and see that contractual
       agreements are met;

   3.  Taking proposed changes to the community, and working with the
       IAB so that the IAB can ensure that there is sufficient community
       review before significant policies or policy changes are adopted;

   4.  Coordinating with the IAB and/or IAOC and, together with the IAB
       and/or IAOC, participating in reviews of the RFC Publisher, RFC
       Production Center, and Independent Submission Editor functions to
       ensure the above-mentioned continuity;





<span class="grey">Kolkman &amp; IAB                Informational                      [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5620">RFC 5620</a>              RFC Editor Model (Version 1)           August 2009</span>


   5.  Developing, maintaining, and publishing the RFC Style Manual for
       use by authors, editors, the stream managers, the RFC Production
       Center, and the RFC Publisher;

   6.  Managing the RFC errata process;

   7.  Liaising with the IAB;

   8.  Overseeing consistency of RFCs with the RFC Series and RFC Style
       Manual.

   There are many potential issues with respect to RFC Series
   continuity.  To name a few: look and feel of the series, indexing
   methodologies, accessibility of the publications, IPR and copyright
   issues, and formatting issues.  After identifying the appropriate
   steps to address such issues, the implementation of those steps
   resides mostly with the RFC production and publishing functions.
   Since the IAOC maintains oversight of the implementation, the RFC
   Series Editor is expected to be invited and to participate in reviews
   of that implementation.

   The RFC Series Editor is a senior technology professional with the
   following qualifications:

   1.  Strong understanding of the IETF and RFC process.

   2.  Executive management experience suitable to managing the
       requirements outlined elsewhere in this document and the many
       aspects of this role, and to coordinating the overall RFC Editor
       process.

   3.  Good understanding of the English language and technical
       terminology related to the Internet.

   4.  Good communication skills.

   5.  Experience with editorial processes.

   6.  Independent worker.

   7.  Experience as an RFC author desired.

   There are alternative selection methods for selecting the individual
   to serve as the RFC Series Editor:

   The first alternative involves a Request for Proposal (RFP) process
   run by the IAOC.  The IAOC would seek a person with the listed
   qualifications in a broadly distributed RFP.  The winner would be



<span class="grey">Kolkman &amp; IAB                Informational                      [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-8"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5620">RFC 5620</a>              RFC Editor Model (Version 1)           August 2009</span>


   selected by the IAOC in consultation with the IAB, and then, the IAOC
   would contract for the services.  Contract terms, including length of
   contract, extensions, and renewals, shall be as provided in the RFP.
   The opportunity to bid shall be broadly available.  Fees and expenses
   to support the administrative operation of the RFC Series Editor
   would be part of the awarded contract and be part of the IASA budget.

   The second alternative involves a nomination and confirmation
   process.  Candidates are nominated, and then an individual with the
   listed qualifications is selected by the Internet community and
   confirmed by the IAB.  An approach similar to the one used by the IAB
   to select an IAOC member every other year (as described in
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>) will be used.  Once the selection is made, a contract
   will be negotiated between the person selected and the IAOC,
   following the general model above.  Financial compensation and
   expenses to support the administrative operation of the RFC Series
   Editor selected in this manner would be part of the IASA budget.

   Based on an Request for Information (RFI) issued by the IAOC in
   December 2008, the IAOC recommended that the second alternative is
   chosen for the selection cycle to be completed in 2009.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Independent%20Submission%20Editor"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Independent Submission Editor</span>

   The Independent Submission Editor is an individual who may have
   assistants and who is responsible for:

   1.  Maintaining technical quality of the Independent Submission
       stream.

   2.  Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent Submissions.

   3.  Forwarding to the Production Center the Internet-Drafts that have
       been accepted for publication as RFCs in the Independent
       Submission Stream.

   4.  Reviewing and approving RFC errata in Independent Submissions.

   5.  Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series policies
       as specified by the IAB and RSE.

   6.  Providing statistics and documentation as requested by the RSE
       and/or IAOC.

   The Independent Submission Editor is a senior position for which the
   following qualifications are desired:

   1.  Technical competence, i.e., broad technical experience and
       perspective across the whole range of Internet technologies and
       applications, and specifically, the ability to work effectively
       with portions of that spectrum in which no personal expertise
       exists.

   2.  Thorough familiarity with the RFC series.

   3.  An ability to define and constitute advisory and document review
       arrangements.  If those arrangements include an Editorial Board
       similar to the current one or some equivalent arrangement, assess
       the technical competence of potential Editorial Board members.

   4.  Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond the IETF.

   5.  Demonstrated editorial skills, good command of the English
       language, and demonstrated history of being able to work
       effectively with technical documents and materials created by
       others.

   6.  The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor environment with
       divided authority and responsibility similar to that described in
       this document.

   The Independent Submission Editor may seek support from an advisory
   board (see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>) and may form a team to perform the activities
   needed to fulfill their responsibilities.

   The individual with the listed qualifications will be selected by the
   IAB after input is collected from the community.  An approach similar
   to the one used by the IAB to select an IAOC member every other year
   (as described in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>) should be used.  While the ISE itself is
   considered a volunteer function, the IAB considers maintaining the
   Independent Submission stream within the RFC Series part of the IAB's
   supported activities, and will include the expenses made for the
   support of the ISE in its IASA-supported budget.

   RFC Production is performed by a paid contractor, and the contractor
   responsibilities include:

   1.   Editing inputs from all RFC streams to comply with the RFC Style
        Manual;

   2.   Creating records of edits performed on documents;

   3.   Identifying where editorial changes might have technical impact
        and seeking necessary clarification;

   4.   Engaging in dialogue with authors, document shepherds, IANA,
        and/or stream-dependent contacts when clarification is needed;

   5.   Creating records of dialogue with document authors;

   6.   Requesting advice from the RFC Series Editor as needed;

   7.   Providing suggestions to the RFC Series Editor as needed;

   8.   Coordinating with IANA to perform protocol parameter registry
        actions;

   9.   Assigning RFC numbers;

   10.  Establishing publication readiness of each document through
        communication with the authors, document shepherds, IANA and/or
        stream-dependent contacts, and, if needed, with the RFC Series
        Editor;

   11.  Forwarding ready-to-publish documents to the RFC Publisher;

   12.  Forwarding records of edits and author dialogue to the RFC
        Publisher so these can be preserved;

   13.  Liaising with IESG and IAB.

   The RFC Production Center contractor is to be selected by the IAOC
   through an RFP process.  The IAOC will seek a bidder who, among other
   things, is able to provide a professional, quality, timely, and cost-
   effective service against the established style and production
   guidelines.  Contract terms, including length of contract, extensions
   and renewals, shall be as defined in an RFP.  The opportunity to bid
   shall be broadly available.

   As described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>, this model allows the IAOC to recommend
   the RSE position to be selected through an RFP process.  In that
   case, the model also allows combining the RFC Production Center bid
   with the RSE bid.  For 2009, the recommendation was made that the RSE
   is selected through an IAB-led selection process.

   The RFC Publisher responsibilities include:

   1.  Announcing and providing on-line access to RFCs.

   2.  Providing on-line system to submit RFC Errata.

   3.  Providing on-line access to approved RFC Errata.

   4.  Providing backups.

   5.  Providing storage and preservation of records.

   6.  Authenticating RFCs for legal proceedings.

   All these activities will be done under general supervision of the
   RSE and need some level of coordination with various submission
   streams and the RSE.

   Implementation of the RFC Publisher function can be pursued in two
   different ways.  The choice between these alternatives will be based
   on an RFI issued by the IAOC in January 2009.

   The first alternative is to modify the IETF Secretariat contract to
   include these services.  Expenses to support these services would be
   part of the revised contract.

   The second alternative is a separate vendor selected by the IAOC
   through an RFP process, possibly as part of the same contract as the
   RFC Series Editor.  Expenses to support these services would be part
   of the awarded contract.

   The purpose of the RSAG is to provide expert, informed guidance
   (chiefly, to the RSE) in matters affecting the RFC Series operation
   and development.  Such matters include, but are not limited to,
   issues in operation of the RFC model components, and consideration of
   additional RFC streams, to give a sense of the range of topics
   covered.

   The RSAG is chartered by the IAB.  As such, it operates independently
   of the IAB to fulfill that charter, and provides periodic reports to
   the IAB via the RSE.

   The group provides guidance to the RSE, who in turn addresses
   immediate operational issues or opportunities with the ISE,
   Production Center, or Publisher.  In cases where these issues have
   contractual side-effects, the RSE provides guidance to the IETF
   Administrative Director (IAD).  The RSAG also serves to provide
   advice to the RSE on longer-term, larger-scale developments for the
   RFC Series.  This informs the proposals the RSE takes to the
   community for discussion, and the IAD/IAOC as proposals for
   implementation.

   The RSAG will assist the RSE in identifying and leading community
   discussion of important issues and opportunities facing the RFC
   Series.  The IAB retains its oversight role and is responsible for
   ensuring that adequate community discussion has been held on any such
   significant topics.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.2.%20%20Membership"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.2" id="section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  Membership</span>

   The RSAG full members are all at-large members, selected for their
   experience and interest in the RFC Series, to provide consistency and
   constancy of the RFC Series interpretation over time; the members do
   not represent a particular RFC stream or any organizations.  In
   particular, there is no requirement or expectation that RSAG members
   will be IAB members.  The RSAG members are proposed by the Series
   Editor in consultation with the sitting RSAG members, and then
   confirmed and formally appointed by the IAB.  In addition to these
   full members, each RFC stream approver will appoint a liaison to the
   RSAG to provide context specific to their stream.  The liaisons do
   not have to be members of the stream approval bodies.  Initially,
   there will be no IAOC or IAB liaison for their oversight role;
   however, as experience is gained, the IAOC, IAB, or RSAG may request
   such liaisons.

   The RSAG does not select or appoint the RSE, or any other component
   of the RFC Editor model, although it acts as an important resource
   for informing any selection process.

   It is envisioned that the RSAG will be composed of appointed full
   members serving staggered 3 year terms, plus the RSE.  The full
   members will serve at the pleasure of the IAB -- appointed by the
   IAB, and if necessary, removed by the IAB.

   In order to provide continuity and to assist with a smooth transition
   of the RFC Editor function, the members of the existing RFC Editor
   Editorial Board who are willing to do so are asked to serve as an
   interim RSAG, effective as of the time of approval of this document.
   Within one year from the time the RFC Editor function transitions to
   the new model and after consideration of the operation of the new
   model in practice, the interim RSAG and RSE will formulate
   recommendations to the IAB about this model, regarding the regular
   composition, size, and selection process for the permanent RSAG in
   particular.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.3.%20%20Disagreements%20among%20RFC%20Editor%20Entities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.3" id="section-4.1.3">4.1.3</a>.  Disagreements among RFC Editor Entities</span>

   If during the execution of their activities, a disagreement arises
   over an implementation decision made by one of the entities in the
   model, any relevant party should first request a review and
   reconsideration of the decision.  If that party still disagrees after
   the reconsideration, that party may ask the RSE to decide or,
   especially if the RSE is involved, that party may ask the IAB Chair
   (for a technical or procedural matter) or IAD (for an administrative
   or contractual one) to mediate or appoint a mediator to aid in the
   discussions, although neither is obligated to do so.  All parties
   should work informally and in good faith to reach a mutually
   agreeable conclusion.

   If such a conclusion is not possible through those informal
   processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC Series
   Advisory Group.  The RSAG may choose to offer advice to the RSE or
   more general advice to the parties involved and may ask the RSE to
   defer a decision until it formulates its advice.  However, if a
   timely decision cannot be reached through discussion, mediation, and
   mutual agreement, the Series Editor is expected to make whatever
   decisions are needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the RFC
   Editor function; those decisions are final.

   RSE decisions of this type are limited to the functioning of the
   process and evaluation of whether current policies are appropriately
   implemented in the decision or need adjustment.  In particular, it
   should be noted that final decisions about the technical content of
   individual documents are the exclusive responsibility of the stream
   approvers for those documents, as shown in the illustration in
   Figure 1.

   If a disagreement or decision has immediate or future contractual
   consequences, the Series Editor must identify the issue to the IAOC
   and, if the RSAG has provided advice, forward that advice as well.

   After the IAOC has notified the IAB, the IAD as guided by the IAOC,
   with advice provided by the Series Editor, has the responsibility to
   resolve these contractual issues.

   If informal agreements cannot be reached and formal RSAG review
   and/or RSE or stream approver decisions are required, the RSE must
   identify the issues involved to the community and report them to the
   IAB in its oversight capacity.  The RSE and IAB shall mutually
   develop a satisfactory mechanism for this type of reporting when and
   if it is necessary.

   IAB and community discussion of any patterns of disputes are expected
   to inform future changes to Series policies including possible
   updates to this document.

   Today the RFC Editor is supported by an Editorial Board for the
   review of Independent Submission stream documents.  This board is
   expected to evolve in what we will call the Independent Submission
   Stream Editorial Board.  This volunteer Editorial Board will exist at
   the pleasure of the ISE, and the members serve at the pleasure of the
   ISE.  The existence of this board is simply noted within this model,
   and additional discussion of such is considered out of scope of this
   document.

   This document defines several functions within the overall RFC Editor
   structure, and it places the responsibility for coordination of
   registry value assignments with the RFC Production Center.  The IAOC
   will facilitate the establishment of the relationship between the RFC
   Production Center and IANA.

   This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
   values in existing registries, and no IANA action is required.

   The same security considerations as those in <a href="./rfc4844">RFC 4844</a> apply.  The
   processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
   introduction of unapproved changes.  Since the RFC Editor maintains
   the index of publications, sufficient security must be in place to
   prevent these published documents from being changed by external
   parties.  The archive of RFC documents, any source documents needed
   to recreate the RFC documents, and any associated original documents

   (such as lists of errata, tools, and, for some early items, non-
   machine-readable originals) need to be secured against failure of the
   storage medium and other similar disasters.

   The IAOC should take these security considerations into account
   during the implementation of this RFC Editor model.

   The RFC Editor model was conceived and discussed in hallways and on
   mail lists.  The first iteration of the text on which this document
   is based was drafted by Leslie Daigle, Russ Housley, and Ray
   Pelletier.  In addition to the members of the IAOC and IAB in
   conjunction with those roles, major and minor contributions were made
   by (in alphabetical order): Bob Braden, Brian Carpenter, Sandy
   Ginoza, Alice Hagens, Joel M. Halpern, Alfred Hoenes, Paul Hoffman,
   John Klensin, Subramanian Moonesamy, and Jim Schaad.

   The IAOC members at the time the RFC Editor model was approved were
   (in alphabetical order): Fred Baker, Bob Hinden, Russ Housley, Ole
   Jacobsen, Ed Juskevicius, Olaf Kolkman, Ray Pelletier (non-voting),
   Lynn St. Amour, and Jonne Soininen.  In addition, Marshall Eubanks
   was serving as the IAOC Scribe.

   The IAB members at the time the initial RFC Editor model was approved
   were (in alphabetical order): Loa Andersson, Gonzalo Camarillo,
   Stuart Cheshire, Russ Housley, Olaf Kolkman, Gregory Lebovitz, Barry
   Leiba, Kurtis Lindqvist, Andrew Malis, Danny McPherson, David Oran,
   Dave Thaler, and Lixia Zhang.  In addition, the IAB included two ex-
   officio members: Dow Street, who was serving as the IAB Executive
   Director, and Aaron Falk, who was serving as the IRTF Chair.

   The IAB members at the time the this RFC was approved were (in
   alphabetical order): Marcelo Bagnulo, Gonzalo Camarillo, Stuart
   Cheshire, Vijay Gill, Russ Housley, John Klensin, Olaf Kolkman,
   Gregory Lebovitz, Andrew Malis, Danny McPherson, David Oran, Jon

   In 2009, the IAB is responsible for the selection of the RFC Series
   Editor and for the selection of the Independent Submission Editor.
   The IAOC selects the RFC Production Center and the RFC Publisher from
   vendors that choose to submit a proposal.  The IAOC procurement
   process is not described in this document.

   The selection process for the ISE and RSE is taken from [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) Member Selection Guidelines and Process"'>2</a>] but
   modified to allow for subject-matter experts to advise the IAB, to
   take into account that the community with interest in the RFC series
   extends beyond the IETF community.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.1.%20%20Ad%20Hoc%20Advisory%20Committee%28s%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" id="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Ad Hoc Advisory Committee(s)</span>

   It is expected that the IAB and IAOC will, during the various stages
   of the bidding process, establish one or more ad hoc advisory
   committees to assist them in the selection of the various functions.
   The names of the members of the committees, who do not need to be IAB
   members or IETF participants, will be made public through the IAB and
   IAOC minutes and possibly other mechanisms as well.

   Members of these committees are expected to have an understanding of
   the RFC series and related processes, and of procedures and interests
   of the various streams.

   Members of the subcommittees will be privy to confidential material
   and are expected to honor confidentiality.  Because they are subject
   to confidential material, they are recused from bidding on any of the
   functions for which financial compensation is offered.

   The IAB and IAOC bear the responsibility for the selections of the
   candidates for defined functions.  The committees provide advice and
   recommendations but are not expected to act as nomination or
   selection committees.

   The IAB will be making a broad public call for nominations.  The
   public call will specify the manner by which nominations will be
   accepted and the means by which the list of nominees will be
   published.  Self-nominations are permitted.  Along with the name and
   contact information for each candidate, details about the candidate's
   background and qualifications for the position should be attached to
   the nomination.

   People that served on the ad-hoc advisory committee(s) mentioned
   above are not eligible.  There are no further limitations.
   Specifically, nominees do not have to be actively contributing to the
   IETF and active participation as a working group chair, an IETF
   Nominating Committee member, or an IAB or IESG member is not a
   limitation.

   IAB members who accept a nomination for an IAB-selected position will
   recuse themselves from IAB selection discussions.

   During the 2009 selection process, a committee assisted the IAOC/IAB
   in creating the job descriptions and statements of work.  This
   committee may also assist in assessing the bids made to the IAOC for
   the Production Center and the RFC Publisher.  Another committee, the
   Ad Hoc Committee for Selection of Editorial Functions, assists the
   IAB in the assessment of the RFC Series Editor and the Independent
   Submission Editor candidates.

   The IAB will publish the list of nominated persons prior to making a
   decision, allowing time for the community to pass any relevant
   comments to the IAB.  When established, the advisory committee will
   be asked to provide a motivated shortlist.  The IAB will review the
   nomination material, any submitted comments, the shortlist from the
   advisory committee, and make its selection.

   It is noted that the community mentioned above is the community with
   an interest in RFCs and the RFC Editor's functioning; the IETF
   community is only a part of that community.

   The main intent is to select the superior candidate, taking the
   continuity of the series into account.

   The following procedures will be used by the IAB in managing
   candidates' personal information:

   o  The candidate's name will be published, with all other candidate
      names, at the close of the nominations period.

   o  Except as noted above, all information provided to the IAB during

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/A.2.5.%20%20Term%20of%20Office%20and%20Selection%20Time%20Frame"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2.5" id="appendix-A.2.5">A.2.5</a>.  Term of Office and Selection Time Frame</span>

   Subject to further negotiations and in the interest of providing
   stability, terms of office are expected to be five years with no
   restrictions on renewals and with provision for shorter actual
   contracts and intermediate reviews.  In addition, an effort should be
   made so that terms of office for the RSE, ISE, and RFC Production
   Center do not terminate concurrently.

   The selection timeframe for 2009 is roughly:

      June - IAB calls for nominations for ISE and RSE positions;

      July - A Committee conducts interviews;

      Mid-August - Committee recommends individuals to IAB for ISE and
      RSE positions;

      Second half of September - IAB appoints ISE and RSE, subject to
      successful negotiations of agreement with IAOC;

      Mid-October - Memorandums of understanding (MOUs) executed with
      IAD, ISE for expenses, RSE for stipend and expenses;

      Mid-October - Transition begins;

      January 2010 - Contract begins.

   The timeline for future selections is subject to recommendation from
   the RSAG and review by the IAB.
