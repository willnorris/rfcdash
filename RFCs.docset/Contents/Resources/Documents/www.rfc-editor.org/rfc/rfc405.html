Correction to <a href="./rfc404">RFC 404</a>

This is to correct a typographic error in RFC# 404.  The
address of the ISI IMP is 22 (decimal), not 86 as was
erroneously stated.  All other numbers in RFC# 404 were
correct;  the complete (corrected) text follows:

This week the RAND IMP was temporarily removed from the
Network and a new IMP was installed at ISI.  Some of the
people and computers from RAND have moved to ISI, in
particular the RAND TENEX is now the ISI TENEX.  The address
of the ISI IMP is 22 (decimal) and the TENEX at ISI is Host
number one; thus the "Network Address" of the ISI TENEX is 86.
Sometime early next week the RAND IMP will be re-installed.
It will still be IMP number 7, and the IBM 360/65 at RAND will
still be "Network Address" 7.
