     <span class="h1">At the last Network Graphics meeting held in July at</span>

M.I.T., we tentatively scheduled the next Network Graphics

meeting which is being hosted by Stanford AI, for October

17, 18, and 19.  Because the Network Working Group meeting

is being held on October 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 it has been

decided to postpone the Network Graphics meeting.  As soon

as a new date for the meeting is established it will be

announced via an RFC.  It is expected that the meeting will

be held in the San Francisco area sometime in November or

early December.
