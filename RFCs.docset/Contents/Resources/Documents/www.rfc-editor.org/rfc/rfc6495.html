<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [<a href="./rfc3971" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC3971</a>] utilizes X.509v3
   certificates that include the [<a href="./rfc3779" title='"X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers"'>RFC3779</a>] extension for IPv6 addresses
   to certify a router's authority over an IPv6 prefix for the NDP
   (Neighbor Discovery Protocol).  The Trust Anchor (TA) option in
   <a href="./rfc3971#section-6.4.3">Section 6.4.3 of [RFC3971]</a> allows the identification of the Trust
   Anchor selected by the host.  In that same section, two name types
   were defined: the DER Encoded X.501 Name and a Fully Qualified Domain
   Name (FQDN).

   In any Public Key Infrastructure, the subject name of a certificate
   is only unique within each Certification Authority (CA).
   Consequently, a new option to identify TAs across CAs is needed.

   In [<a href="./rfc6494" title='"Certificate Profile and Certificate Management for SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC6494</a>], the certificate profile described in [<a href="./rfc6487" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>] is
   adopted for SEND.  In these documents, the Subject field in the
   certificates is declared to be meaningless and the subjectAltName
   field is not allowed.  On the other hand, the Subject Key Identifier
   (SKI) extension for the X.509 certificates is defined as mandatory
   and non-critical.

   This document specifies new Name Type fields in the SEND TA option
   that allows the use of the SKI X.509 extension to identify TA X.509
   certificates.  This document also defines experimental and reserved
   Name Types values.

   Finally, this document updates [<a href="./rfc3971" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC3971</a>] by changing the "Trust
   Anchor option (Type 15) Name Type field" registration procedures from
   Standards Action to Standards Action or IESG Approval [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Name%20Type%20Fields%20in%20the%20ICMPv6%20TA%20Option%20Defined%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Name Type Fields in the ICMPv6 TA Option Defined in This Document</span>

   The following Name Type fields in the ICMPv6 TA option are defined:

           Name Type      Description
            0              Reserved
            3              SHA-1 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
            4              SHA-224 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
            5              SHA-256 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
            6              SHA-384 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
            7              SHA-512 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
            253-254        Experimental
            255            Reserved

   Name Type field values 0 and 255 are marked as reserved.  This means
   that they are not available for allocation.

   When the Name Type field is set to 3, the Name Type field contains a
   160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value of the DER-encoded ASN.1 bit string
   of the subject public key, as described in <a href="./rfc6487#section-4.8.2">Section 4.8.2 of
   [RFC6487]</a>.  Implementations MAY support SHA-1 SKI name type.

   When the Name Type field is set to 4, 5, 6, or 7, the hash function
   will respectively be: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.
   Implementations MAY support SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512
   SKI name types.

   Name Type fields 253 and 254 are marked as experimental, per guidance
   in [<a href="./rfc3692" title='"Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful"'>RFC3692</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Processing%20Rules%20for%20Routers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Processing Rules for Routers</span>

   As specified in [<a href="./rfc3971" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC3971</a>], a TA is identified by the SEND TA option.
   If the TA option is represented as a SKI, then the SKI MUST be equal
   to the X.509 SKI extension in the trust anchor's certificate.  The
   router SHOULD include the TA option(s) in the advertisement for which
   the certification path was found.  Also, following the specification
   defined in [<a href="./rfc3971" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>RFC3971</a>], if the router is unable to find a path to the
   requested anchor, it SHOULD send an advertisement without any
   certificate.  In this case, the router SHOULD include the TA options
   that were solicited.

   IANA has updated the "Trust Anchor option (Type 15) Name Type field"
   registry to include the following values:

      +---------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | Value   | Description                                      |

      | 3       | SHA-1 Subject Key Identifier (SKI) (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>)   |
      | 4       | SHA-224 Subject Key Identifier (SKI) (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) |
      | 5       | SHA-256 Subject Key Identifier (SKI) (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) |
      | 6       | SHA-384 Subject Key Identifier (SKI) (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) |
      | 7       | SHA-512 Subject Key Identifier (SKI) (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) |
      | 253-254 | Experimental Use (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>)                     |
      | 255     | Reserved (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>)                             |
      +---------+--------------------------------------------------+

        Table 1: New Name Type Field Values in the ICMPv6 TA Option

   IANA has also modified the registration procedures for the "Trust
   Anchor option (Type 15) Name Type field" registry to Standards Action
   or IESG Approval [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The hash functions referenced in this document to calculate the SKI
   have reasonable random properties in order to provide reasonably
   unique identifiers.  Two identical identifiers in the same validation
   path will cause the router to stop fetching certificates once the
   first certificate has been fetched.  In the case that the upward
   certificate was configured as a TA by a host, the router will send to
   this host an incomplete list of certificates, causing the SEND
   validation to fail.

   For experimental values of the Name Type field, the guidance given in
   [<a href="./rfc3692" title='"Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful"'>RFC3692</a>] about the use of experimental values needs to be followed.
