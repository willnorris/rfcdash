        Two new commands have been added to UCSB's Simple Minded
File System (SMFS).  They are described below.


        Login (LGI)
        The login command is the means whereby the user
identifies himself and specifies the account number to which his
use of SMFS is to be billed.  The user should issue a LGI command
directly after completing the ICP and before any command
referencing a file.  The user name and account number specified
remain in effect until another LGI command is issued, a LGO
command is issued, or the connection is closed.

        At present, the use of SMFS is not billed, and therefore
use of the accounting commands is optional.  It is requested,
however, that users and user processes begin to use this command
as soon as possible, since we would like to collect statistics on
SMFS utilization before implementing billing.  Therefore, at
present the user name can be any name that identfies the user,
and the account number is completely arbitrary.

        The format of the LGI command is given below.  Note that
the lengths of the fixed-length fields are given in bits.  The op
code for LGI is decimal 13.

            8
        &lt;op code&gt;&lt;user name&gt;&lt;account number&gt;

The &lt;user name&gt; and &lt;account number&gt; fields are further divided
as follows:

            8     8*length
        &lt;length&gt;&lt;user name&gt;

where &lt;length&gt; gives the length in 8-bit characters of the &lt;user
name&gt; or &lt;account number&gt; subfield.  The maximum length of &lt;user
name&gt; is eight characters and of &lt;account number&gt; is four

characters.  The &lt;user name&gt; and &lt;account number&gt; fields must
consist of characters chosen from the same character set as
filenames.


        Logout (LGO)
        The logout command terminates the association between the
user and the accounting information specified in the last LGI
command issued, if any; it does not cause SMFS to close the
connection.  The user should then issue another LGI command
before attempting any operation referencing a file.  It is not
necessary to issue a LGO command before issuing another LGI
command, or before closing the connection.

        Again, at the present time the LGO command is optional,
and does not affect the user's ability to reference files.

        The format of the LGO command is as follows:

            8
        &lt;op code&gt;

The op code for LGO is decimal 14.
