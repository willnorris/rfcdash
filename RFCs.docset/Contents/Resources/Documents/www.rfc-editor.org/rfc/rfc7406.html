Abstract

   This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology,
   and describes an extension for the base IETF emergency services
   architecture to address cases where an emergency caller is not
   authenticated, has no identifiable service provider, or has no
   remaining credit with which to pay for access to the network.

   Summoning police, the fire department, or an ambulance in emergencies
   is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone.
   As telephony functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
   Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
   functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for
   the older technology.  New devices and services are being made
   available that could be used to make a request for help; those
   devices are not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly
   expecting them to be able to place emergency calls.

   Roughly speaking, the IETF emergency services architecture (see
   [<a href="./rfc6881" title='"Best Current Practice for Communications Services in Support of Emergency Calling"'>RFC6881</a>] and [<a href="./rfc6443" title='"Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia"'>RFC6443</a>]) divides responsibility for handling
   emergency calls among the access network (Internet Access Provider
   (IAP) or ISP); the application service provider (ASP), which may be a
   VoIP service provider (VSP); and the provider of emergency signaling
   services, the emergency service network (ESN).  The access network
   may provide location information to end systems but does not have to
   provide any ASP signaling functionality.  The emergency caller can
   reach the ESN either directly or through the ASP's outbound proxy.
   Any of the three parties can provide the mapping from location to the
   Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) URI by offering Location-to-
   Service Translation (LoST) [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>] services.

   In general, a set of automated configuration mechanisms allows a
   device to function in a variety of architectures, without the user
   being aware of the details on who provides location, mapping
   services, or call-routing services.  However, if emergency calling is
   to be supported when the calling device lacks access network
   authorization or does not have an ASP, one or more of the providers
   may need to provide additional services and functions.

   In all cases, the end device has to be able to perform a LoST lookup
   and otherwise conduct the emergency call in the same manner as when
   the three exceptional conditions discussed below do not apply.

   We distinguish among three conditions:

   No Access Authentication (NAA):  In the NAA case, the emergency
      caller does not posses valid credentials for the access network.
      This includes the case where the access network allows
      pay-per-use, as is common for wireless hotspots, but there is
      insufficient time to enter credit card details and other
      registration information required for access.  It also covers all
      cases where either no credentials are available at all or the
      available credentials do not work for the given IAP/ISP.  As a
      result, the NAA case basically combines the No ASP (NASP) and
      zero-balance ASP (ZBP) cases below, but at the IAP/ISP level.
      Support for emergency call handling in the NAA case is subject to
      the local policy of the ISP.  Such policy may vary substantially
      between ISPs and typically depends on external factors that are
      not under the ISP control.

   No ASP (NASP):  The caller does not have an ASP at the time of the
      call.  This can occur in case the caller either does not possess
      any valid subscription for a reachable ASP or does possess a valid
      subscription but none of the ASPs are reachable through the ISP.

      Note: The interoperability need is increased with this scenario
      since the client software used by the emergency caller must be
      compatible with the protocols and extensions deployed by the ESN.

   Zero-balance ASP (ZBP):  In the case of a zero-balance ASP, the ASP
      can authenticate the caller, but the caller is not authorized to
      use ASP services, e.g., because the contract has expired or the
      prepaid account for the customer has been depleted.

   These three cases are not mutually exclusive.  A caller in need of
   help may, for example, be both in an NAA and NASP situation, as
   explained in more detail in Figure 1.  Depending on local policy and
   regulations, it may not be possible to place emergency calls in the
   NAA case.  Unless local regulations require user identification, it
   should always be possible to place calls in the NASP case, with
   minimal impact on the ISP.  Unless the ESN requires that all calls
   traverse a known set of Voice Service Providers (VSPs), it is
   technically possible to let a caller place an emergency call in the
   ZBP case.  We discuss each case in more detail in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   Some of the functionality provided in this document is already
   available in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
   Consequently, there is real-world experience available and not all of
   it is positive.  For example, the functionality of calls without
   Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) in today's cellular system has
   lead to a fair amount of hoax or test calls in certain countries.

   This causes overload situations at PSAPs, which is considered harmful
   to the overall availability and reliability of emergency services.

      As an example, the Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM,
      Switzerland) provided statistics about emergency (112) calls in
      Switzerland from Jan. 1997 to Nov. 2001.  Switzerland did not
      offer SIM-less emergency calls except for almost a month in July
      2000 where a significant increase in hoax and test calls was
      reported.  As a consequence, the functionality was disabled again.
      More details can be found in the panel presentations of the 3rd
      Standards Development Organization (SDO) Emergency Services
      Workshop [<a href="#ref-esw07" title='"3rd Standards Development Organziations (SDO) Emergency Services Workshop"'>esw07</a>].

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   This document reuses terminology from [<a href="./rfc5687" title='"GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol: Problem Statement and Requirements"'>RFC5687</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5012" title='"Requirements for Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technologies"'>RFC5012</a>], namely
   Internet Access Provider (IAP), Internet Service Provider (ISP),
   Application Service Provider (ASP), Voice Service Provider (VSP),
   Emergency Service Routing Proxy (ESRP), Public Safety Answering Point
   (PSAP), Location Configuration Server (LCS), (emergency) service dial
   string, and (emergency) service identifier.

   An end host needs to perform the following steps if it is not
   attached to the network and the user is starting to place an
   emergency call:

   Link-Layer Attachment:  Some networks have added support for
      unauthenticated emergency access while others have advertised
      these capabilities using layer beacons (multicast or broadcast
      announcements).  The end host learns about these unauthenticated
      emergency services capabilities from either the link layer type or
      advertisement.

      The end host uses the link-layer-specific network attachment
      procedures defined for unauthenticated network access in order to
      get access to the network.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7406">RFC 7406</a>            Unauthenticated Emergency Service      December 2014</span>


   Pre-emergency Service Configuration:  When the link-layer network
      attachment procedure is completed, the end host learns basic
      configuration information using DHCP from the ISP.  The end host
      uses a Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) to retrieve location
      information.  Subsequently, the LoST protocol [<a href="./rfc5222" title='"LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"'>RFC5222</a>] is used to
      learn the relevant emergency numbers and to obtain the PSAP URI
      applicable for that location.

   Emergency Call:  In case of the need for help, a user dials an
      emergency number and the SIP User Agent (UA) initiates the
      emergency call procedures by communicating with the PSAP.

   Figure 1 compiles the basic logic taking place during network entry
   for requesting an emergency service and shows the interrelation
   between the three conditions described earlier.

   The NAA procedures are described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.  The ZBP procedures
   are described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  The NASP procedures are described in
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  The Phone BCP procedures are described in [<a href="./rfc6881" title='"Best Current Practice for Communications Services in Support of Emergency Calling"'>RFC6881</a>].  The
   LLA procedures are not described in this document since they are
   specific to the link-layer technology in use.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20ZBP%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  ZBP Considerations</span>

   ZBP includes all cases where a subscriber is known to an ASP but
   lacks the necessary authorization to access regular ASP services.
   Example ZBP cases include empty prepaid accounts, barred accounts,
   roaming and mobility restrictions, or any other conditions set by ASP
   policy.

   Local regulation might demand that emergency calls cannot proceed
   without successful service authorization.  In some regulatory
   regimes, however, it may be possible to allow emergency calls to
   continue despite authorization failures.  To distinguish an emergency
   call from a regular call, an ASP can identify emergency sessions by
   inspecting the service URN [<a href="./rfc5031" title='"A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Emergency and Other Well-Known Services"'>RFC5031</a>] used in call setup.  The ZBP
   case, therefore, only affects the ASP.

   Permitting a call despite authorization failures could present an
   opportunity for abuse.  The ASP may choose to verify the destination
   of the emergency calls and to only permit calls to certain,
   preconfigured entities (e.g., to local PSAPs).  <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> discusses
   this topic in more detail.

   An ASP without a regulatory requirement to authorize emergency calls
   can deny emergency call setup.  Where an ASP does not authorize an
   emergency call, the caller may be able to fall back to NASP
   procedures.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20NASP%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  NASP Considerations</span>

   To start the description, we consider the sequence of steps that are
   executed in an emergency call based on Figure 5.

   o  As an initial step, the devices attach to the network as shown in
      step (1).  This step is outside the scope of this section.

   o  When the link-layer network attachment procedure is completed, the
      end host learns basic IP configuration information using DHCP from
      the ISP, as shown in step (2).







<span class="grey">Schulzrinne, et al.           Informational                    [Page 12]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-13"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7406">RFC 7406</a>            Unauthenticated Emergency Service      December 2014</span>


   o  When the end host has configured the IP address, it starts an
      interaction with the discovered LCS at the ISP, as shown in step
      (3).  In certain deployments, the ISP may need to interact with
      the IAP.  This protocol exchange is shown in step (4).

   o  Once location information is obtained, the end host triggers the
      LoST protocol to obtain the address of the ESRP/PSAP.  This is
      shown in step (5).

   o  In step (6), the SIP UA initiates a SIP INVITE request towards the
      indicated ESRP.  The INVITE message contains all the necessary
      parameters required by <a href="#section-5.1.5">Section 5.1.5</a>.

   o  The ESRP receives the INVITE and processes it according to the
      description in <a href="#section-5.3.3">Section 5.3.3</a>.

   o  The ESRP routes the call to the PSAP, as shown in step (8),
      potentially interacting with a LoST server first to determine the
      route.

   o  The PSAP evaluates the initial INVITE and aims to complete the
      call setup.

   o  Finally, when the call setup is completed, media traffic can be
      exchanged between the PSAP and the SIP UA.

   For brevity, the end-to-end SIP and media exchange between the PSAP
   and SIP UA are not shown in Figure 5.

   Some networks have added support for unauthenticated emergency access
   while others have advertised these capabilities using layer beacons.
   The end host learns about these unauthenticated emergency services
   capabilities either from the link-layer type or from advertisement.

   It is important to highlight that the NAA case is inherently a Layer
   2 problem, and the general form of the solution is to provide an
   "emergency only" access type, with appropriate limits or monitoring
   to prevent abuse.  The described mechanisms are informative in nature
   since the relationship to the IETF emergency services architecture is
   only indirect, namely via some protocols developed within the IETF
   (e.g., EAP and EAP methods) that require extensions to support this
   functionality.

   This section discusses different methods to indicate an emergency
   service request as part of network attachment.  It provides some
   general considerations and recommendations that are not specific to
   the access technology.

   To perform network attachment and get access to the resources
   provided by an IAP/ISP, the end host uses access technology-specific
   network attachment procedures, including, for example, network
   detection and selection, authentication, and authorization.  For
   initial network attachment of an emergency service requester, the
   method of how the emergency indication is given to the IAP/ISP is
   specific to the access technology.  However, a number of general
   approaches can be identified:

   Link-layer emergency indication:  The end host provides an
      indication, e.g., an emergency parameter or flag, as part of the
      link-layer signaling for initial network attachment.  Examples
      include an emergency bit signaled in the IEEE 802.16-2009 wireless
      link.  In IEEE 802.11 WLAN [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.11">IEEE802.11</a>], an emergency support
      indicator allows the station (i.e., end host in this context) to
      download before association to a Network Access Identifier (NAI),
      which it can use to request server-side authentication only for an
      IEEE 802.1X network.

   Higher-layer emergency indication:  Typically, emergency indication
      is provided in the network access authentication procedure.  The
      emergency caller's end host provides an indication as part of the
      access authentication exchanges.  Authentication via the EAP
      [<a href="./rfc3748" title='"Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)"'>RFC3748</a>] is of particular relevance here.  Examples are the EAP
      NAI decoration used in Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
      Access (WiMAX) networks and modification of the authentication
      exchange in IEEE 802.11 [<a href="#ref-nwgstg3" title='"WiMAX Forum Network Architecture - Detailed Protocols and Procedures Base Specification"'>nwgstg3</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20Link-Layer%20Emergency%20Indication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Link-Layer Emergency Indication</span>

   In general, link-layer emergency indications provide good integration
   into the actual network access procedure regarding the enabling of
   means to recognize and prioritize an emergency service request from
   an end host at a very early stage of the network attachment
   procedure.  However, support in end hosts for such methods cannot be
   considered to be commonly available.

   No general recommendations are given in the scope of this memo due to
   the following reasons:

   o  Dependency on the specific access technology.

   o  Dependency on the specific access network architecture.  Access
      authorization and policy decisions typically happen at different
      layers of the protocol stack and in different entities than those
      terminating the link-layer signaling.  As a result, link-layer
      indications need to be distributed and translated between the
      different protocol layers and entities involved.  Appropriate
      methods are specific to the actual architecture of the IAP/ISP
      network.

   o  An advantage of combining emergency indications with the actual
      network attachment procedure performing authentication and
      authorization is the fact that the emergency indication can
      directly be taken into account in the authentication and
      authorization server that owns the policy for granting access to
      the network resources.  As a result, there is no direct dependency
      on the access network architecture that otherwise would need to
      take care of merging link-layer indications into the
      authentication, authorization, and policy decision process.

   o  EAP signaling happens at a relatively early stage of network
      attachment, so it is likely to match most requirements for
      prioritization of emergency signaling.  However, it does not cover






<span class="grey">Schulzrinne, et al.           Informational                    [Page 18]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-19"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7406">RFC 7406</a>            Unauthenticated Emergency Service      December 2014</span>


      early stages of link-layer activity in the network attachment
      process.  Possible conflicts may arise, e.g., in case of filtering
      based on Media Access Control (MAC) in entities terminating link-
      layer signaling in the network (like a base station).  In normal
      operation, EAP-related information will only be recognized in the
      Network Access Server (NAS).  Any entity residing between the end
      host and NAS should not be expected to understand/parse EAP
      messages.

   o  An emergency indication can be given by forming a specific NAI
      that is used as the identity in EAP-based authentication for
      network entry.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20Securing%20Network%20Attachment%20in%20NAA%20Cases"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Securing Network Attachment in NAA Cases</span>

   For network attachment in NAA cases, it may make sense to secure the
   link-layer connection between the device and the IAP/ISP.  This
   especially holds for wireless access with examples being access based
   on IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.16.  The latter even mandates secured
   communication across the wireless link for all IAP/ISP networks based
   on [<a href="#ref-nwgstg3" title='"WiMAX Forum Network Architecture - Detailed Protocols and Procedures Base Specification"'>nwgstg3</a>].

   Therefore, for network attachment that is by default based on EAP
   authentication, it is desirable also for NAA network attachment to
   use a key-generating EAP method (that provides a Master Session Key
   (MSK) to the authenticator to bootstrap further key derivation for
   protecting the wireless link).

   To match the above, the following approaches can be identified:

   1) Server-Only Authentication:

      The device of the emergency service requester performs an EAP
      method with the IAP/ISP EAP server that performs server-side
      authentication only.  An example for this is EAP-TLS [<a href="./rfc5216" title='"The EAP-TLS Authentication Protocol"'>RFC5216</a>].
      This provides a certain level of assurance about the IAP/ISP to
      the device user.  It requires the device to be provisioned with
      appropriate trusted root certificates to be able to verify the
      server certificate of the EAP server (unless this step is
      explicitly skipped in the device in case of an emergency service
      request).  This method is used to provide access of devices
      without existing credentials to an IEEE 802.1X network.  The
      details are incorporated in the IEEE 802.11-2012 specification
      [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.11">IEEE802.11</a>].







<span class="grey">Schulzrinne, et al.           Informational                    [Page 19]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-20"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7406">RFC 7406</a>            Unauthenticated Emergency Service      December 2014</span>


   2) Null Authentication:

      In one case (e.g., WiMAX), an EAP method is performed.  However,
      no credentials specific to either the server or the device or
      subscription are used as part of the authentication exchange.  An
      example for this would be an EAP-TLS exchange using the
      TLS_DH_anon (anonymous) ciphersuite.  Alternatively, a publicly
      available static key for emergency access could be used.  In the
      latter case, the device would need to be provisioned with the
      appropriate emergency key for the IAP/ISP in advance.  In another
      case (e.g., IEEE 802.11), no EAP method is used, so that empty
      frames are transported during the over-the-air IEEE 802.1X
      exchange.  In this case, the authentication state machine
      completes with no cryptographic keys being exchanged.

   3) Device Authentication:

      This case extends the server-only authentication case.  If the
      device is configured with a device certificate and the IAP/ISP EAP
      server can rely on a trusted root allowing the EAP server to
      verify the device certificate, at least the device identity (e.g.,
      the MAC address) can be authenticated by the IAP/ISP in NAA cases.
      An example for this is WiMAX devices that are shipped with device
      certificates issued under the global WiMAX device public-key
      infrastructure.  To perform unauthenticated emergency calls, if
      allowed by the IAP/ISP, such devices perform network attachment
      based on EAP-TLS with client authentication based on the device
      certificate.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security threats discussed in [<a href="./rfc5069" title='"Security Threats and Requirements for Emergency Call Marking and Mapping"'>RFC5069</a>] are applicable to this
   document.

   The NASP and NAA cases introduce new vulnerabilities since the PSAP
   operator will typically not have any information about the identity
   of the caller via the signaling path.  Today, in countries where this
   functionality is used for Global System for Mobile Communications
   (GSM) networks, this has lead to a significant amount of misuse.

   In the context of NAA, the IAP and the ISP will probably want to make
   sure that the claimed emergency caller indeed performs an emergency
   call rather than using the network for other purposes, and thereby
   acting fraudulent by skipping any authentication, authorization, and
   accounting procedures.  By restricting access of the unauthenticated
   emergency caller to the LoST server and the PSAP URI, traffic can be
   restricted only to emergency calls.  This can be accomplished with
   traffic separation.  However, the details, e.g., for using filtering,



<span class="grey">Schulzrinne, et al.           Informational                    [Page 20]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-21"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7406">RFC 7406</a>            Unauthenticated Emergency Service      December 2014</span>


   depend on the deployed ISP architecture and are beyond the scope of
   this document.

   We only illustrate a possible model.  If the ISP runs its own
   (caching) LoST server, the ISP would maintain an access control list
   populated with IP-address information obtained from LoST responses
   (in the mappings).  These URIs would either be URIs for contacting
   further LoST servers or PSAP URIs.  It may be necessary to translate
   domain names returned in LoST responses to IP addresses.  Since the
   media destination addresses are not predictable, the ISP also has to
   provide a SIP outbound proxy so that it can determine the media
   addresses and add those to the filter list.

   For the ZBP case, the additional aspect of fraud has to be
   considered.  Unless the emergency call traverses a PSTN gateway or
   the ASP charges for IP-to-IP calls, there is little potential for
   fraud.  If the ASP also operates the LoST server, the outbound proxy
   MAY restrict outbound calls to the SIP URIs returned by the LoST
   server.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED to rely on a fixed list of SIP URIs,
   as that list may change.

   <a href="./rfc6280">RFC 6280</a> [<a href="./rfc6280" title='"An Architecture for Location and Location Privacy in Internet Applications"'>RFC6280</a>] discusses security vulnerabilities that are caused
   by an adversary faking location information and thereby lying about
   the actual location of the emergency caller.  These threats may be
   less problematic in the context of an unauthenticated emergency when
   location information can be verified by the ISP to fall within a
   specific geographical area.
