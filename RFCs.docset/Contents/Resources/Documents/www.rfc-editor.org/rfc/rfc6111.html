   Occasionally, protocol designers need to designate a Kerberos
   principal name or a Kerberos realm name to have a special meaning
   other than identifying a particular instance.  An example is that the
   anonymous principal name and the anonymous realm name are defined for
   the Kerberos anonymity support [<a href="./rfc6112" title='"Anonymity Support for Kerberos"'>RFC6112</a>].  This anonymity name pair
   conveys no more meaning than that the client's identity is not
   disclosed.  In the case of the anonymity support, it is critical that
   deployed Kerberos implementations that do not support anonymity fail
   the authentication if the anonymity name pair is used; therefore, no
   access is granted accidentally to a principal who's name happens to
   match with that of the anonymous identity.

   However, Kerberos, as defined in [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>], does not have such
   reserved names.  As such, protocol designers have resolved to use
   names that are exceedingly unlikely to have been used to avoid
   collision.  Even if a registry were set up to avoid collision of new
   implementations, there is no guarantee for deployed implementations
   preventing accidental reuse of names that can lead to access being
   granted unexpectedly.

   The Kerberos realm name in [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] has a reserved name space
   although no specific name is defined and the criticality of unknown
   reserved realm names is not specified.

   This document remedies these issues by defining well-known Kerberos
   names and the protocol behavior when a well-known name is used but
   not supported.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Definitions</span>

   In this section, well-known names are defined for both the Kerberos
   principal name and the Kerberos realm name.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Well-Known%20Kerberos%20Principal%20Names"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Well-Known Kerberos Principal Names</span>

   A new name type KRB_NT_WELLKNOWN is defined for well-known principal
   names.  The Kerberos principal name is defined in <a href="./rfc4120#section-6.2">Section 6.2 of
   [RFC4120]</a>.

            KRB_NT_WELLKNOWN                  11

   A well-known principal name MUST have at least two or more
   KerberosString components, and the first component MUST be the string
   literal "WELLKNOWN".

   If a well-known principal name is used as the client principal name
   or the server principal name but not supported, the Authentication
   Service (AS) [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] and the application server MUST reject the
   authentication attempt.  Similarly, the Ticket Granting Service (TGS)
   [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] MAY reject the authentication attempt if a well-known
   principal name is used as the client principal name but not
   supported, and SHOULD reject the authentication attempt if a well-
   known principal name is used as the server principal name but not
   supported.  These rules were designed to allow incremental updates
   and ease migration.  More specifically, if a well-known principal is
   accepted in one realm, it is desirable to allow the cross-realm
   Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to work when not all of the realms in
   the cross-realm authentication path are updated; if the server
   principal with an identically named well-known name was created
   before the Key Distribution Center (KDC) is updated, it might be
   acceptable to allow authentication to work within a reasonably
   limited time window.  However, unless otherwise specified, if a well-

   known principal name is used but not supported in any other places of
   Kerberos messages, authentication MUST fail.  The error code is
   KRB_AP_ERR_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN, and there is no accompanying error data
   defined in this document for this error.

            KRB_AP_ERR_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN      82
                 -- A well-known Kerberos principal name is used but not
                 -- supported.

   <a href="./rfc4120#section-6.1">Section 6.1 of [RFC4120]</a> defines the "other" style of realm name, a
   new realm type WELLKNOWN is defined as a name of type "other", with
   the NAMETYPE part filled in with the string literal "WELLKNOWN".

            other: WELLKNOWN:realm-name

   This name type is designated for well-known Kerberos realms.

   The AS and the application server MUST reject the authentication
   attempt if a well-known realm name is used as the client realm or the
   server realm but not supported.  The TGS [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] MAY reject the
   authentication attempt if a well-known realm name is used as the
   client realm but not supported, and it SHOULD reject the
   authentication attempt if a well-known realm name is used as the
   server realm but not supported.  Unless otherwise specified, if a
   well-known realm name is used but not supported in any other places
   of Kerberos messages, authentication MUST fail.  The error code is
   KRB_AP_ERR_REALM_UNKNOWN, and there is no accompanying error data
   defined in this document for this error.

            KRB_AP_ERR_REALM_UNKNOWN          83
                 -- A well-known Kerberos realm name is used but not
                 -- supported.

   Unless otherwise specified, all principal names involving a well-
   known realm name are reserved, and if a reserved principal name is
   used but not supported, and if the authentication is rejected, the
   error code MUST be KRB_AP_ERR_PRINCIPAL_RESERVED.

            KRB_AP_ERR_PRINCIPAL_RESERVED     84
                 -- A reserved Kerberos principal name is used but not
                 -- supported.

   There is no accompanying error data defined in this document for this
   error.

   According to <a href="./rfc4120#section-3.3.3.2">Section 3.3.3.2 of [RFC4120]</a>, the TGS MUST add the name
   of the previous realm into the transited field of the returned
   ticket.  Typically, well-known realms are defined to carry special
   meanings, and they are not used to refer to intermediate realms in
   the client's authentication path.  Consequently, unless otherwise
   specified, the TGS MUST NOT encode a well-known Kerberos realm name
   into the transited field [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] of a ticket, and parties checking
   the transited realm path MUST reject a transited realm path that
   includes a well-known realm.  In the case of KDCs checking the
   transited realm path, this means that the TRANSITED-POLICY-CHECKED
   flag MUST NOT be set in the resulting ticket.  Aside from the
   hierarchical meaning of a null subfield, the DOMAIN-X500-COMPRESS
   encoding for transited realms [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] treats realm names as
   strings, although it is optimized for domain style and X.500 realm
   names; hence, the DOMAIN-X500-COMPRESS encoding can be used when the
   client realm or the server realm is reserved or when a reserved realm
   is in the transited field.  However, if the client's realm is a well-
   known realm, the abbreviation forms [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] that build on the
   preceding name cannot be used at the start of the transited encoding.
   The null-subfield form (e.g., encoding ending with ",") [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>]
   could not be used next to a well-known realm, including potentially
   at the beginning and end where the client and server realm names,
   respectively, are filled in.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   It is possible to have a name collision with well-known names because
   Kerberos, as defined in [<a href="./rfc4120" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>], does not reserve names that have
   special meanings; accidental reuse of names MUST be avoided.  If a
   well-known name is not supported, authentication MUST fail as
   specified in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  Otherwise, access can be granted
   unintentionally, resulting in a security weakness.  Consider, for
   example, a KDC that supports this specification but not the anonymous
   authentication described in [<a href="./rfc6112" title='"Anonymity Support for Kerberos"'>RFC6112</a>].  Assume further that the KDC
   allows a principal to be created named identically to the anonymous
   principal.  If that principal were created and given access to
   resources, then anonymous users might inadvertently gain access to
   those resources if the KDC supports anonymous authentication at some
   future time.  Similar issues may occur with other well-known names.
   By requiring that KDCs reject authentication with unknown well-known
   names, we minimize these concerns.

   If a well-known name was created before the KDC is updated to conform
   to this specification, it SHOULD be renamed.  The provisioning code
   that manages account creation MUST be updated to disallow creation of
   principals with unsupported well-known names.

   This document provides the framework for defining well-known Kerberos
   names and Kerberos realms.  Two new IANA registries have been created
   to contain well-known Kerberos principal names and Kerberos realm
   names that are defined based on this document.  The evaluation policy
   for each is "Specification Required", as specified in [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].
