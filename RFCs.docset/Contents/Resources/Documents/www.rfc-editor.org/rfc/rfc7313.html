Abstract

   In this document, we enhance the existing BGP route refresh
   mechanisms to provide for the demarcation of the beginning and the
   ending of a route refresh.  The enhancement can be used to facilitate
   correction of BGP Routing Information Base (RIB) inconsistencies in a
   non-disruptive manner.  This document updates <a href="./rfc2918">RFC 2918</a>.

   It is sometimes necessary to perform routing consistency validations
   such as checking for possible missing route withdrawals between BGP
   speakers [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>].  Currently, such validations typically involve
   offline, manual operations that can be tedious and time-consuming.

   In this document, we enhance the existing BGP route refresh
   mechanisms [<a href="./rfc2918" title='"Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC2918</a>] to provide for the demarcation of the beginning
   and the ending of a route refresh (which refers to the complete
   re-advertisement of the Adj-RIB-Out to a peer, subject to routing
   policies).  The enhancement can be used to facilitate online, non-
   disruptive consistency validation of BGP routing updates.

   This document updates [<a href="./rfc2918" title='"Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC2918</a>] by redefining a field in the ROUTE-
   REFRESH message that was previously designated as Reserved.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Language</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] only when
   they appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower or
   mixed case as English words, without any normative meaning.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Protocol%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Protocol Extensions</span>

   The BGP protocol extensions introduced in this document include the
   definition of a new BGP capability, named "Enhanced Route Refresh
   Capability", and the specification of the message subtypes for the
   ROUTE-REFRESH message.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7313">RFC 7313</a>       Enhanced Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4     July 2014</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Enhanced%20Route%20Refresh%20Capability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Enhanced Route Refresh Capability</span>

   The "Enhanced Route Refresh Capability" is a new BGP capability
   [<a href="./rfc5492" title='"Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4"'>RFC5492</a>].  IANA has assigned a Capability Code of 70 for this
   capability.  The Capability Length field of this capability is zero.

   By advertising this capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys to
   the peer that the speaker supports the message subtypes for the
   ROUTE-REFRESH message and the related procedures described in this
   document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Subtypes%20for%20ROUTE-REFRESH%20Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Subtypes for ROUTE-REFRESH Message</span>

   The "Reserved" field of the ROUTE-REFRESH message specified in
   [<a href="./rfc2918" title='"Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC2918</a>] is redefined as the "Message Subtype" with the following
   values:

             0 - Normal route refresh request [<a href="./rfc2918" title='"Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC2918</a>]
                 with/without Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) [<a href="./rfc5291" title='"Outbound Route Filtering Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC5291</a>]
             1 - Demarcation of the beginning of a route refresh
                 (BoRR) operation
             2 - Demarcation of the ending of a route refresh
                 (EoRR) operation
           255 - Reserved

   The remaining values of the message subtypes are reserved for future
   use; see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> ("IANA Considerations").  The use of the new
   message subtypes is described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> ("Operation").

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Operation</span>

   A BGP speaker that supports the message subtypes for the ROUTE-
   REFRESH message and the related procedures SHOULD advertise the
   "Enhanced Route Refresh Capability".

   The following procedures are applicable only if a BGP speaker has
   received the "Enhanced Route Refresh Capability" from a peer.

   Before the speaker starts a route refresh that is either initiated
   locally, or in response to a "normal route refresh request" from the
   peer, the speaker MUST send a BoRR message.  After the speaker
   completes the re-advertisement of the entire Adj-RIB-Out to the peer,
   it MUST send an EoRR message.

   Conceptually, the "entire Adj-RIB-Out" for a peer in this section
   refers to all the route entries in the "Adj-RIB-Out" for the peer at
   the start of the route refresh operation.  These route entries
   comprise both the reachability as well as unreachability information.



<span class="grey">Patel, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7313">RFC 7313</a>       Enhanced Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4     July 2014</span>


   When a route entry in the "Adj-RIB-Out" changes, only the modified
   route entry needs to be advertised.

   In processing a ROUTE-REFRESH message from a peer, the BGP speaker
   MUST examine the "message subtype" field of the message and take the
   appropriate actions.  The message processing rules for ROUTE-REFRESH
   message with subtype of 0 are described in [<a href="./rfc2918" title='"Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC2918</a>] and [<a href="./rfc5291" title='"Outbound Route Filtering Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC5291</a>].
   A BGP speaker can receive a BoRR message from a peer at any time,
   either as a result of a peer responding to a ROUTE-REFRESH message,
   or as a result of a peer unilaterally initiating a route refresh.
   When a BGP speaker receives a BoRR message from a peer, it MUST mark
   all the routes with the given Address Family Identifier and
   Subsequent Address Family Identifier, &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt; [<a href="./rfc2918" title='"Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC2918</a>], from
   that peer as stale.  As it receives routes from its peer's subsequent
   Adj-RIB-Out re-advertisement, these replace any corresponding stale
   routes.  When a BGP speaker receives an EoRR message from a peer, it
   MUST immediately remove any routes from the peer that are still
   marked as stale for that &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;.  Such purged routes MAY be
   logged for future analysis.  A BGP speaker MAY ignore any EoRR
   message received without a prior receipt of an associated BoRR
   message.  Such messages MAY be logged for future analysis.

   An implementation MAY impose a locally configurable upper bound on
   how long it would retain any stale routes.  Once the upper bound is
   reached, the implementation MAY remove any routes from the peer that
   are still marked as stale for that &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt; without waiting for an
   EoRR message.

   The following procedures are specified in order to simplify the
   interaction with the BGP Graceful Restart [<a href="./rfc4724" title='"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"'>RFC4724</a>].  In particular,
   these procedures ensure that End-of-RIB (EoR) defined in Graceful
   Restart and EoRR as defined in this specification are kept separate,
   thereby avoiding any premature cleanup of stale routes.  For a BGP
   speaker that supports the BGP Graceful Restart, it MUST NOT send a
   BoRR for an &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt; to a neighbor before it sends the EoR for the
   &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt; to the neighbor.  A BGP speaker that has received the
   Graceful Restart Capability from its neighbor MUST ignore any BoRRs
   for an &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt; from the neighbor before the speaker receives the
   EoR for the given &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt; from the neighbor.  The BGP speaker
   SHOULD log an error of the condition for further analysis.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Error%20Handling"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Error Handling</span>

   This document defines a new NOTIFICATION error code:

          Error Code   Name

              7        ROUTE-REFRESH Message Error

   The following error subcode is defined as well:

          Subcode      Name

             1         Invalid Message Length

   The error handling specified in this section is applicable only when
   a BGP speaker has received the "Enhanced Route Refresh Capability"
   from a peer.

   If the length, excluding the fixed-size message header, of the
   received ROUTE-REFRESH message with Message Subtype 1 and 2 is not 4,
   then the BGP speaker MUST send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error
   Code of "ROUTE-REFRESH Message Error" and the subcode of "Invalid
   Message Length".  The Data field of the NOTIFICATION message MUST
   contain the complete ROUTE-REFRESH message.

   When the BGP speaker receives a ROUTE-REFRESH message with a "Message
   Subtype" field other than 0, 1, or 2, it MUST ignore the received
   ROUTE-REFRESH message.  It SHOULD log an error for further analysis.

   This document defines the Enhanced Route Refresh Capability for BGP.
   In the "Capability Codes" registry, IANA has assigned it value 70,
   referencing this document.

   This document also defines two new subcodes for the Route Refresh
   message.  They have been registered with the IANA in a new registry
   as follows:

           Under "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters":
           Registry: "BGP Route Refresh Subcodes"
           Reference: [<a href="./rfc7313">RFC7313</a>]
           Registration Procedure(s): Values 0-127 Standards Action,
             values 128-254 First Come First Served

           Value   Code                Reference
           0       Route-Refresh       [<a href="./rfc2918" title='"Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC2918</a>], [<a href="./rfc5291" title='"Outbound Route Filtering Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC5291</a>]
           1       BoRR                [<a href="./rfc7313">RFC7313</a>]
           2       EoRR                [<a href="./rfc7313">RFC7313</a>]
           3-254   Unassigned
           255     Reserved            [<a href="./rfc7313">RFC7313</a>]

   In addition, this document defines a NOTIFICATION error code and an
   error subcode related to the ROUTE-REFRESH message.  IANA has changed
   the name of the "BGP Error Codes" to "BGP Error (Notification) Codes"
   and added this document as a reference.  IANA has allocated a new
   error code from that registry with the name "ROUTE-REFRESH Message
   Error", referencing this document.

   IANA has created a new registry for the error subcodes as follows:

           Under "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters",
           under "BGP Error Subcodes":
           Registry: "BGP ROUTE-REFRESH Message Error subcodes"
           Reference: [<a href="./rfc7313">RFC7313</a>]
           Registration Procedure(s): Values 0-127 Standards Action,
             values 128-255 First Come First Served

           Value   Name                     Reference

           1       Invalid Message Length   [<a href="./rfc7313">RFC7313</a>]
           2-255   Unassigned
