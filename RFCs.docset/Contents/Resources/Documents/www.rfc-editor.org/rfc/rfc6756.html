<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6756">RFC 6756</a>         IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines  September 2012</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction%20and%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction and Scope</span>

   This document provides non-normative guidance to aid in the
   understanding of collaboration on standards development between the
   Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International
   Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and the Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF) of the Internet Society (ISOC).  Early identification of
   topics of mutual interest will allow for constructive efforts between
   the two organizations based on mutual respect.

   In the IETF, work is done in working groups (WGs), mostly through
   open, public mailing lists rather than face-to-face meetings.  WGs
   are organized into areas, each area being managed by two co-area
   directors.  Collectively, the area directors comprise the Internet
   Engineering Steering Group (IESG).

   In the ITU-T, work is defined by study Questions which are worked on
   mostly through meetings led by rapporteurs (these are sometimes
   called "rapporteur's group" meetings).  Questions are generally
   grouped within working parties (WPs) led by a WP chairman.  Working
   parties report to a parent study group (SG) led by an SG chairman.
   Work may also be conducted in ITU-T focus groups (see <a href="#section-2.7">Section 2.7</a>).

   To foster ongoing communication between the ITU-T and IETF, it is
   important to identify and establish contact points within each
   organization.  Contact points may include:

   1. ITU-T Study Group Chairman and IETF Area Director

      An IETF area director is the individual responsible for overseeing
      a major focus of activity with a scope similar to that of an ITU-T
      study group chairman.  These positions are both relatively long-
      term (of several years) and offer the stability of contact points
      between the two organizations for a given topic.

   2. ITU-T Rapporteur and IETF Working Group Chair

      An IETF working group chair is an individual who is assigned to
      lead the work on a specific task within one particular area with a
      scope similar to that of an ITU-T rapporteur.  These positions are
      working positions (of a year or more) that typically end when the
      work on a specific topic ends.  Collaboration here is very
      beneficial to ensure the actual work gets done.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6756">RFC 6756</a>         IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines  September 2012</span>


   3. Other Contact Points

      It may be beneficial to establish additional contact points for
      specific topics of mutual interest.  These contact points should
      be established early in the work effort, and in some cases the
      contact point identified by each organization may be the same
      individual.  ITU-T has an additional level of management, the
      working party chairman.  From time to time, it may be beneficial
      for this person to exchange views with IETF working group chairs
      and area directors.

   Note: The current list of IETF area directors and working group
   chairs can be found in the IETF working group charters.  The current
   ITU-T study group chairmen and rapporteurs are listed on the ITU-T
   study group web pages.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Guidance%20on%20Collaboration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Guidance on Collaboration</span>

   This section describes how the existing processes within the IETF and
   ITU-T may be utilized to enable collaboration between the
   organizations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20How%20to%20Interact%20on%20ITU-T%20or%20IETF%20Work%20Items"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  How to Interact on ITU-T or IETF Work Items</span>

   Study groups that have identified work topics that are related to the
   Internet Protocol (IP) should evaluate the relationship with topics
   defined in the IETF. Current IETF working groups and their charters
   (IETF definition of the scope of work) are listed in the IETF
   archives (see <a href="#section-2.8.1">Section 2.8.1</a>).

   A study group may decide that development of a Recommendation on a
   particular topic may benefit from collaboration with the IETF.  The
   study group should identify this collaboration in its work plan
   (specifically in that of each Question involved), describing the goal
   of the collaboration and its expected outcome.

   An IETF working group should also evaluate and identify areas of
   relationship with the ITU-T and document the collaboration with the
   ITU-T study group in its charter.

   The following sections outline a process that can be used to enable
   each group to be informed about the other's new work items.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.1.%20%20How%20the%20ITU-T%20Is%20Informed%20about%20Existing%20IETF%20Work%20Items"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.1" id="section-2.1.1">2.1.1</a>.  How the ITU-T Is Informed about Existing IETF Work Items</span>

   The responsibility is on individual study groups to review the
   current IETF working groups to determine if there are any topics of
   mutual interest.  Working group charters and active Internet-Drafts
   can be found on the IETF web site (<a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/">http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/</a>).
   If a study group identifies a common area of work, the study group
   leadership should contact both the IETF working group chair and the
   area director(s) responsible.  This may be accompanied by a formal
   liaison statement (see <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.2.%20%20How%20the%20IETF%20Is%20Informed%20about%20Existing%20ITU-T%20Work%20Items"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.2" id="section-2.1.2">2.1.2</a>.  How the IETF Is Informed about Existing ITU-T Work Items</span>

   The IETF through its representatives will review the current work of
   the various study groups from time to time.  Each ITU-T study group's
   web page on the ITU-T web site contains its current list of Questions
   as well as its current work programme.  When an area or working group
   identifies a common area of work, the matter is referred to
   appropriate working group chairs and area directors, where they may
   consider sending a liaison statement to the appropriate study group.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.3.%20%20How%20the%20ITU-T%20Is%20Informed%20about%20Proposed%20New%20IETF%20Work%20Items"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.3" id="section-2.1.3">2.1.3</a>.  How the ITU-T Is Informed about Proposed New IETF Work Items</span>

   The IETF maintains a mailing list for the distribution of proposed
   new work items among standards development organizations.  Many such
   items can be identified in proposed Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF)
   sessions, as well as draft charters for working groups.  The IETF
   forwards all such draft charters for all new and revised working
   groups and BOF session announcements to the IETF new-work mailing
   list.  An ITU-T mailing list is subscribed to this list. Leadership
   of study groups may subscribe to this ITU-T mailing list, which is
   maintained by the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB).
   Members of the SG-specific listname may include the SG chairman, SG
   vice-chairmen, working party chairmen, concerned rapporteurs, other
   experts designated by the SG, and the SG Counsellor.  This will
   enable the SGs to monitor the new work items for possible overlap or
   interest to their study group.  It is expected that this mailing list
   will see a few messages per month.

   Each SG chairman, or designated representative, may provide comments
   on these charters by responding to the IESG mailing list at
   iesg@ietf.org clearly indicating their ITU-T position and the nature
   of their concern.  Plain-text email is preferred on the IESG mailing
   list.

   It should be noted that the IETF turnaround time for new working
   group charters can be as short as two weeks.  As a result, the
   mailing list should be consistently monitored.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.4.%20%20How%20the%20IETF%20Is%20Informed%20about%20ITU-T%20Work%20Items"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.4" id="section-2.1.4">2.1.4</a>.  How the IETF Is Informed about ITU-T Work Items</span>

   The ITU-T accepts new areas of work through the creation or update of
   Questions and these can be found on the ITU-T study group web pages.
   In addition, the ITU-T work programme is documented on each ITU-T
   study group's web page on the ITU-T web site.

   Study groups send updates to the IETF new-work mailing list as new
   Questions are first drafted or created, terms of reference for
   Questions are first drafted or updated, or otherwise when there is
   reason to believe that a particular effort might be of interest to
   the IETF.  Area directors or WG chairs should provide comments
   through liaison statements or direct email to the relevant SG
   chairman in cases of possible overlap or interest.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Representation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Representation</span>

   ISOC, including its standards body IETF, is a Sector Member of the
   ITU-T.  As a result, ISOC delegates are afforded the same rights as
   other ITU-T Sector Members (see <a href="#section-2.2.1">Section 2.2.1</a>).  Conversely, ITU-T
   delegates may participate in the work of the IETF as representatives
   of the ITU-T (see <a href="#section-2.2.2">Section 2.2.2</a>).  To promote collaboration, it is
   useful to facilitate communication between the organizations as
   further described below.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.1.%20%20IETF%20Recognition%20at%20ITU-T"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" id="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  IETF Recognition at ITU-T</span>

   Experts and representatives from the IETF that are chosen by IETF
   leadership normally participate in ITU-T meetings as ISOC delegates.
   The ISOC focal point will facilitate registration and verification of
   these people, as appropriate.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.2.%20%20ITU-T%20Recognition%20at%20ISOC%2FIETF"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2" id="section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  ITU-T Recognition at ISOC/IETF</span>

   ITU-T study group chairmen can authorize one or more members to
   attend an IETF meeting as an official ITU-T delegate speaking
   authoritatively on behalf of the activities of the study group (or a
   particular rapporteur group).  The study group chairman sends the
   ITU-T list of delegates by email to the working group chair, with a
   copy to the area directors, and also to the study group.  According
   to IETF process, opinions expressed by any such delegate are given
   equal weight with opinions expressed by any other working group
   participant.

   Informal communication between contact points and experts of both
   organizations is encouraged.  However, formal communication from an
   ITU-T study group, working party, or rapporteur group to an
   associated IETF contact point must be explicitly approved and
   identified as coming from the study group, working party, or
   rapporteur group, respectively.  Formal liaison statements from the
   ITU-T to the IETF are transmitted according to the procedures
   described in <a href="./rfc4053">RFC 4053</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Procedures for Handling Liaison Statements to and from the IETF"'>2</a>].  These liaison statements are placed by
   the IETF onto a liaison statements web page at
   <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/</a>.  An individual at the IETF is
   assigned responsibility for dealing with each liaison statement that
   is received.  The name and contact information of the responsible
   person and any applicable deadline is listed with the links to the
   liaison statement on this web page.

   Formal liaison statements from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB),
   the IESG, the IETF, an IETF working group or area to the ITU-T are
   generated, approved, and transmitted according to the procedures
   described in <a href="./rfc4053">RFC 4053</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Procedures for Handling Liaison Statements to and from the IETF"'>2</a>] and Recommendation ITU-T A.1 [<a href="#ref-15" title="Work methods for study groups of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)">15</a>].  Formal
   communication is intended to allow the sharing of positions between
   the IETF and the ITU-T outside of actual documents (as described in
   <a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>).  This covers such things as comments on documents and
   requests for input.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.4.%20%20Mailing%20Lists"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" id="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Mailing Lists</span>

   All IETF working groups and all ITU-T study group Questions have
   associated mailing lists.

   In the IETF, the mailing list is the primary vehicle for discussion
   and decision-making.  It is recommended that the ITU-T experts
   interested in particular IETF working group topics subscribe to and
   participate in these lists.  IETF WG mailing lists are open to all
   subscribers.  The IETF working group mailing list subscription and
   archive information are noted in each working group's charter.  In
   the ITU-T, the TSB has set up formal mailing lists for Questions,
   working parties, and other topics within study groups (more detail
   can be found on the ITU-T web site).  These mailing lists are
   typically used for ITU-T correspondence, including technical
   discussion, meeting logistics, reports, etc.

   Note: Individual subscribers to this list must be affiliated with an
   ITU-T member or associate (at this time, there is no blanket
   inclusion of all IETF participants as members, however, as a member,
   the ISOC focal point can facilitate access by IETF technical experts,
   liaison representatives, or liaison managers).

   IETF participants may subscribe to ITU-T focus group email lists if
   they are individuals from a country that is a member of ITU-T.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.%20%20Document%20Sharing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5" id="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Document Sharing</span>

   During the course of ITU-T and IETF collaboration, it is important to
   share working drafts and documents among the technical working
   groups.  Initially proposed concepts and specifications typically can
   be circulated by email (often just repeating the concept and not
   including the details of the specification) on both the IETF and
   ITU-T mailing lists.  In addition, working texts (or URLs) of draft
   Recommendations, Internet-Drafts, or RFCs may also be sent between
   the organizations as described below.

   Internet-Drafts are available on the IETF web site.  The ITU-T can
   make selected ITU-T documents at any stage of development available
   to the IETF by attaching them to a formal liaison statement.
   Although a communication can point to a URL where a non-ASCII
   document (e.g., Word) can be downloaded, attachments in proprietary
   formats to an IETF mailing list are discouraged.  It should also be
   recognized that the official versions of all IETF documents are in
   ASCII.

Contributions and Liaison Statements from the IETF to ITU-T</span>

   IETF documents (e.g., Internet-Drafts) or URLs of those documents are
   most commonly transmitted to ITU-T study groups as liaison statements
   (see <a href="./rfc4053">RFC 4053</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Procedures for Handling Liaison Statements to and from the IETF"'>2</a>]), but exceptionally can be submitted to a study
   group as a contribution from ISOC in accordance with Recommendation
   ITU-T A.2 [<a href="#ref-16" title="Presentation of contributions to the ITU-T">16</a>].  In order to ensure that the IETF has properly
   authorized this, the IETF working group must agree that the specific
   drafts are of mutual interest; that there is a benefit in forwarding
   them to the ITU-T for review, comment, and potential use; and that
   the document status is accurately represented in the cover letter.
   Once agreed, the appropriate area directors review the working group
   request and give approval.  The rules of the IETF Trust are followed
   in these circumstances [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust"'>3</a>].  The contributions are then forwarded
   (with the noted approval) to the TSB for circulation as a
   contribution to the appropriate ITU-T study group.  Material
   submitted to the ITU-T as an ISOC contribution is governed by clause
   3.1.5 of Recommendation ITU-T A.1 [<a href="#ref-15" title="Work methods for study groups of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)">15</a>].  Any such contribution will
   be made only after receiving necessary approval of owners of the work
   in question.  In other circumstances, a liaison statement may be
   appropriate.  See <a href="./rfc5378">RFC 5378</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust"'>3</a>] and Recommendation ITU-T A.1 [<a href="#ref-15" title="Work methods for study groups of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)">15</a>] for
   more information.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.5.2.%20%20Contributions%20and%20Liaison%20Statements%20from%20the%20ITU-T%20to%20IETF"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.2" id="section-2.5.2">2.5.2</a>.  Contributions and Liaison Statements from the ITU-T to IETF</span>

   An ITU-T study group or working party may send texts of draft new or
   revised Recommendations, clearly indicating their status, to the IETF
   as contributions in the form of liaison statements or Internet-
   Drafts.  Internet-Drafts are IETF temporary documents that expire six
   months after being published.  The study group or working party must
   decide that there is a benefit in forwarding them to the IETF for
   review, comment, and potential use.  Terms of reference for
   rapporteur group meetings may authorize rapporteur groups to send
   working documents, in the form of Internet-Drafts, to the IETF.

   If the study group or working party elects to transmit the text as an
   Internet-Draft, the document editor would be instructed to prepare
   the contribution in Internet-Draft format (in ASCII and optionally
   postscript format as per <a href="./rfc2223">RFC 2223</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Instructions to RFC Authors"'>8</a>]) and upload it via
   <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/idst/upload.cgi">https://datatracker.ietf.org/idst/upload.cgi</a>.  Material submitted as
   an Internet-Draft or intended for inclusion in an Internet-Draft or
   RFC is governed by the rules set forth in RFCs 5378 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust"'>3</a>], 3979 [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology"'>4</a>],
   and 4879 [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Clarification of the Third Party Disclosure Procedure in RFC 3979"'>5</a>].  Alternatively, the study group, working party, or
   rapporteur group could attach the text to a formal liaison statement.

   Both the rapporteur and the document editor should be identified as
   contacts in the contribution.  The document should also clearly
   indicate the state of development in a particular ITU-T study group.

   Note: Liaison statements and their attachments sent to the IETF are
   made publicly available on the IETF web site.

   It is envisaged that the processes of Sections <a href="#section-2.5.1">2.5.1</a> and <a href="#section-2.5.2">2.5.2</a> will
   often be used simultaneously by both an IETF working group and an
   ITU-T study group to collaborate on a topic of mutual interest.

   It is also envisaged that the outcome of the collaboration will be
   the documentation in full by one body and its referencing by the
   other (see <a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a> for details).  That is, common or joint text
   is discouraged because of the current differences in procedures for
   document approval and revision.  Where complementary work is being
   undertaken in both organizations that will result in Recommendations
   or RFCs, due allowance should be given to the differing perspectives,
   working methods, and procedures of the two organizations.  That is,
   each organization should understand the other organization's
   procedures and strive to respect them in the collaboration.

   Recommendation ITU-T A.5 [<a href="#ref-6" title="Generic procedures for including references to documents of other organizations in ITU-T Recommendations">6</a>] describes the process for including
   references to documents of other organizations in ITU-T
   Recommendations.  Recommendation ITU-T A.5 also addresses the
   situation where a study group or working party decides to incorporate
   the text of another organization into the text of a Recommendation,
   rather than referencing it.  Information specific to referencing IETF
   RFCs is found at <a href="http://itu.int/ITU-T/go/ref-ietf-isoc">http://itu.int/ITU-T/go/ref-ietf-isoc</a>.

   <a href="./rfc2026#section-6.1.1">Section 6.1.1 of RFC 2026</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>7</a>] describes the process for referencing
   other open standards (like ITU-T Recommendations) in IETF RFCs.

   Both ITU-T and IETF provide mechanisms for early discussion of
   potential new work areas prior to the official start of work in an
   ITU-T study group or creation of an IETF working group.

   Objectives, methods, and procedures for the creation and operation of
   ITU-T focus groups are defined in Recommendation ITU-T A.7 [<a href="#ref-17" title="Focus groups: Working methods and procedures">17</a>].
   Focus groups are frequently created in new work areas where there is
   a need for deliverables to be produced on a specific topic within a
   short timeframe.  IETF participants who are not members or associates
   of ITU-T may participate fully in the work of ITU-T focus groups if
   they are from a country that is a member of ITU-T.

   In the IETF, guidance for BOF sessions is provided in <a href="./rfc5434">RFC 5434</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Considerations for Having a Successful Birds-of-a- Feather (BOF) Session"'>13</a>].
   Efforts that have not yet reached the working group stage may be
   discussed in BOF sessions.  These sessions typically gauge interest
   in pursuing creation of working groups.  In some cases, these
   discussions continue on mailing lists.
