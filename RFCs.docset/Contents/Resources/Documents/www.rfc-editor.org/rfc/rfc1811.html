Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document describes the registration policies for the top-level
   domain ".GOV".   Thus far, Federal Agencies and their subsidiaries
   have registered without any guidance.  This has resulted in multiple
   registrations for Federal Agencies and naming schemes that do not
   facilitate responsiveness to the public.  This document fixes this by
   restricting registrations to coincide with the approved structure of
   the US government.  The document cited, FIPS 95-1, provides a
   standard recognized structure into which domain registrations for
   top-level domains.  The IANA requires that an organization/country
   apply for and get a 2 letter code from ISO/ITU (e.g., US for United
   States) for additional top-level registration.

   As a side effect, this reduces the number of .GOV level registrations
   and reduces the workload on the Internic.

U.S. GOVERNMENT INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES POLICY

   The .GOV domain is delegated from the root authority to the US
   Federal Networking Council.  The .GOV domain is for registration of
   US governmental entities on the federal level only.  Registrations
   for state and local governmental agencies shall be made under the .US
   domain in accordance with the policies for that domain.

   1) The document "Codes for the Identification of Federal and
   Federally Assisted Organizations", FIPS 95-1 (or its successor)
   lists the official names of US Government agencies.

     A) Top-level entities (e.g., those with codes ending in 00 such as
     "1200 Department of Agriculture"), and independent agencies and
     organizations (e.g., "National Science Foundation and other non-
     indented listings unless prohibited below) as listed in this
     document are eligible for registration directly under .GOV.

     B) Autonomous law enforcement components of top-level entities
     (e.g., "Federal Bureau of Investigation", "Secret Service", "Coast
     Guard") are also eligible for registration.

     C) Cross-agency collaborative organizations (e.g., "Federal
     Networking Council", "Information Infrastructure Task Force") are
     eligible for registration under .GOV upon presentation of the
     chartering document and are the only non-FIPS-listed
     organizations eligible for registration under .GOV.

     D) Subsidiary, non-autonomous components of top-level or other
     entities are not eligible for separate registration.
     International organizations listed in this document are NOT
     eligible for registration under .GOV.

     E) Organizations listed as "Federally Aided Organizations" are not
     eligible for registration under .GOV and should register under
     .ORG or other appropriate top-level domain.

     F) Organizations subsidiary to "Department of Defense" must
     register under the ".MIL" domain via the Defense Data Network
     Network Information Center - contact registrar@nic.ddn.mil.

   The only standard exceptions to these rules are changes to
   governmental structure due to statutory, regulatory or executive
   directives not yet reflected in the above document.  The requesting
   agency should provide documentation in one of the above forms to
   request an exception.  Other requests for exception should be
   referred to the Federal Networking Council.

   2) A domain name should be derived from the official name for the
   organization (e.g., "USDA.Gov" or "Agriculture.GOV".)  The
   registration shall be listed in the registration database under the
   official name (per FIPS 95-1) for the organization or under the name
   in the chartering document.

   3) Only ONE registration and delegation shall be made per agency.
   The .GOV registration authority shall provide registrations on a
   first-come first-served basis.  It is an individual agency matter as
   to which portion of the agency is responsible for managing the domain
   space under a delegated agency domain.

   4) Those agencies and entities that have multiple registrations under
   .GOV may retain them for a maximum of 3 years from the publication
   date of this document.  Within 6 months after the publication of this
   document, one primary domain must be selected for the agency.  The
   other (secondary) domains must cease further sub-delegations and
   registrations at this time.  As of 1 year after the publication of

   this document, the secondary domains will become undelegated and will
   revert to the control of the .GOV owner. As of 2 years after the
   publication of this document, all registrations in the secondary
   domains must be mirrored in the primary domain and those names should
   be used where possible. At the 3 year point, all secondary domain
   registrations will be deleted.

   5) Those agencies and entities already registered in .GOV but not
   listed in FIPS 95-1 (e.g., DOE labs, state entities) may retain their
   registration within the constraint of the single registration rule
   (see para 4).  No further non-FIPS-listed registrations will be made.
   State and local entities are strongly encouraged to re-register under
   .US, but this is not mandatory.
