               <span class="h1">Specification Changes for</span>
               <span class="h1">OLS, RJE/RJOR, and SMFS</span>

     The following documents are hereby revised:

     (1)  'Specifications for Network Use of the UCSB
          On-Line System [16 October 70, <a href="./rfc74">RFC 74</a>, NIC 5417],

     (2)  'Network Specifications for Remote Job Entry and
          Remote Job Output Retrieval at UCSB' [22 March 71,
          <a href="./rfc105">RFC 105</a>, NIC 5775], and

     (3)  'Network Specifications for UCSB's Simple-
          Minded File System' [26 April 71, <a href="./rfc122">RFC 122</a>,
          NIC 5834].

     Revisions are as follows:

     (1)  As far as can be determined, no Network site has
          written code to interface to the UCSB software
          documented in <a href="./rfc74">RFC 74</a> last October.  Accordingly,
          UCSB has terminated support for that software,
          and hence <a href="./rfc74">RFC 74</a> is obsolete.

     (2)  In accordance with subsequent Host-Host protocol
          changes, the notion of 'message type' has been
          dropped from the specifications for RJE and RJOR,
          <a href="./rfc105">RFC 105</a>.  RJE/RJOR no longer send, nor expect to
          receive 8 bits of zeros as the first byte trans-
          mitted over a connection.

     (3)  In accordance with Document 2, RJE and RJOR now
          employ a standard ICP to create a full duplex
          connection to the user.  Accordingly, RJE and
          RJOR listen on sockets x'201' and x'301',
          respectively (rather than on x'200' and x'300'
          as before).  As documented in <a href="./rfc105">RFC 105</a>, RJE
          required only a simplex connection to the user.
          A full duplex connection is now supported, but
          no data is transmitted to the user over the




<span class="grey">                                                                [Page 1]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-2"></span>

          added simplex connection.  RJOR now also supports
          a full duplex connection.  However, if RJOR is
          required to call the user back when a requested
          job's output is ready, it still does so employing
          a simplex connection to the user's receive socket.

     (4)  RJE/RJOR and SMFS specify a byte size of
          eight for their connection to the user's
          receive socket.  The user may choose the
          byte size for the other simplex connection
          to suit himself;  any valid byte size is
          acceptable to UCSB.
