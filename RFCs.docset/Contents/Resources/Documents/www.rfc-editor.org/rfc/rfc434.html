                    <span class="h1">IMP/TIP MEMORY RETROFIT SCHEDULE</span>

   During the first several months of 1973 we will be retrofitting each
   IMP and TIP with additional core memory.  At the end of the retrofit
   program, the memory sizes of the various machines will be as follows:

      IMP (516 or 316) - 16K words

      TIP - 28K words

      TIP with magnetic Tape Option - 32K words

   In addition, the expansion of the TIP core memory will necessitate
   enlarging the TIP to two cabinets.

   Listed below is the preliminary schedule for these retrofits.  We
   have arranged this schedule to coincide with the usual monthly
   Preventive Maintenance at each site so as to minimize user
   inconvenience, but the work required will frequently require the
   machines to be down longer than normal.  I will issue additional
   RFC's updating this schedule as necessary.

   Any site which anticipate difficulty with the expansion of TIP size,
   and thus the floor space requirement, should contact Hawley Rising
   (BBN) at
