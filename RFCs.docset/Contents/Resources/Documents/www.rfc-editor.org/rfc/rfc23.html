                <span class="h1">TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES</span>




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.
