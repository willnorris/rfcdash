   A management system contains:  several (potentially many) nodes, each
   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to
   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a
   management protocol, used to convey management information between
   the agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are
   carried out under an administrative framework which defines
   authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy policies.

   Management stations execute management applications which monitor and
   control managed elements.  Managed elements are devices such as
   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and
   controlled via access to their management information.

   Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
   residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined
   in MIB modules.  These modules are written using a subset of OSI's
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-1" title="(December">1</a>], termed the Structure of
   Management Information (SMI) [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure of Management Information for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].

   The management protocol, SNMPv2 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>], provides for the exchange of
   messages which convey management information between the agents and
   the management stations.  It is the purpose of this document to
   define managed objects which describe the behavior of a SNMPv2
   entity.

   For the purpose of exposition, the original Internet-standard Network
   Management Framework, as described in RFCs 1155 (STD 16), 1157 (STD
   15), and 1212 (STD 16), is termed the SNMP version 1 framework
   (SNMPv1).  The current framework is termed the SNMP version 2
   framework (SNMPv2).
