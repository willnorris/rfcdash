         <span class="h1">Deprecating the Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers</span>

Abstract

   Experience with the 6to4 transition mechanism defined in <a href="./rfc3056">RFC 3056</a>
   ("Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds") has shown that the
   mechanism is unsuitable for widespread deployment and use in the
   Internet when used in its anycast mode.  Therefore, this document
   requests that <a href="./rfc3068">RFC 3068</a> ("An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers")
   and <a href="./rfc6732">RFC 6732</a> ("6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels") be made obsolete and
   moved to Historic status.  It recommends that future products should
   not support 6to4 anycast and that existing deployments should be
   reviewed.  This complements the guidelines in <a href="./rfc6343">RFC 6343</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7526">RFC 7526</a>                Deprecating 6to4 Anycast                May 2015</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The original form of the 6to4 transition mechanism [<a href="./rfc3056" title='"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds"'>RFC3056</a>] relies
   on unicast addressing.  However, its extension specified in "An
   Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" [<a href="./rfc3068" title='"An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers"'>RFC3068</a>] has been shown to
   have severe practical problems when used in the Internet.  This
   document requests that RFCs 3068 and 6732 be moved to Historic
   status, as defined in <a href="./rfc2026#section-4.2.4">Section 4.2.4 of [RFC2026]</a>.  It complements the
   deployment guidelines in [<a href="./rfc6343" title='"Advisory Guidelines for 6to4 Deployment"'>RFC6343</a>].

   6to4 was designed to help transition the Internet from IPv4 to IPv6.
   It has been a good mechanism for experimenting with IPv6, but because
   of the high failure rates seen with anycast 6to4 [<a href="#ref-HUSTON" title='"Flailing IPv6"'>HUSTON</a>], end users
   may end up disabling IPv6 on hosts; this has resulted in some content
   providers being reluctant to make content available over IPv6 in the
   past.

   [<a id="ref-RFC6343">RFC6343</a>] analyzes the known operational issues in detail and
   describes a set of suggestions to improve 6to4 reliability, given the
   widespread presence of hosts and customer premises equipment that
   support it.  The advice to disable 6to4 by default has been widely
   adopted in recent operating systems, and the failure modes have been
   widely hidden from users by many browsers adopting the "Happy
   Eyeballs" approach [<a href="./rfc6555" title='"Happy Eyeballs: Success with Dual-Stack Hosts"'>RFC6555</a>].

   Nevertheless, a measurable amount of 6to4 traffic is still observed
   by IPv6 content providers.  The remaining successful users of anycast
   6to4 are likely to be on hosts using the obsolete policy table
   [<a href="./rfc3484" title='"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC3484</a>] (which prefers 6to4 above IPv4) and running without Happy
   Eyeballs.  Furthermore, they must have a route to an operational
   anycast relay and they must be accessing an IPv6 host that has a
   route to an operational return relay.

   However, experience shows that operational failures caused by anycast
   6to4 have continued despite the advice in <a href="./rfc6343">RFC 6343</a> being available.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Related%20Work"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Related Work</span>

   "IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) -- Protocol
   Specification" [<a href="./rfc5969" title='"IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) -- Protocol Specification"'>RFC5969</a>] explicitly builds on the 6to4 mechanism,
   using a service provider prefix instead of 2002::/16.  However, the
   deployment model is based on service provider support such that 6rd
   avoids the problems observed with anycast 6to4.

   The framework for "6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels" [<a href="./rfc6732" title='"6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels"'>RFC6732</a>] is
   intended to help a service provider manage 6to4 anycast tunnels.
   This framework only exists because of the problems observed with
   anycast 6to4.

   compatibility.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%206to4%20Operational%20Problems"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  6to4 Operational Problems</span>

   6to4 is a mechanism designed to allow isolated IPv6 islands to reach
   each other using IPv6-over-IPv4 automatic tunneling.  To reach the
   native IPv6 Internet, the mechanism uses relay routers in both the
   forward and reverse direction.  The mechanism is supported in many
   IPv6 implementations.  With the increased deployment of IPv6, the
   mechanism has been shown to have a number of shortcomings.

   In the forward direction, a 6to4 node will send IPv4-encapsulated
   IPv6 traffic to a 6to4 relay that is connected to both the 6to4 cloud
   and native IPv6.  In the reverse direction, a 2002::/16 route is
   injected into the native IPv6 routing domain to attract traffic from
   native IPv6 nodes to a 6to4 relay router.  It is expected that
   traffic will use different relays in the forward and reverse
   direction.

   One model of 6to4 deployment, described in <a href="./rfc3056#section-5.2">Section 5.2 of RFC 3056</a>,
   suggests that a 6to4 router should have a set of managed connections
   (via BGP connections) to a set of 6to4 relay routers.  While this
   makes the forward path more controlled, it does not guarantee a
   functional reverse path.  In any case, this model has the same
   operational burden as manually configured tunnels and has seen no
   deployment in the public Internet.

   <a href="./rfc3068">RFC 3068</a> adds an extension that allows the use of a well-known IPv4
   anycast address to reach the nearest 6to4 relay in the forward
   direction.  However, this anycast mechanism has a number of
   operational issues and problems, which are described in detail in
   <a href="./rfc6343#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC6343]</a>.  This document is intended to deprecate the
   anycast mechanism.

   Peer-to-peer usage of the 6to4 mechanism exists in the Internet,
   likely unknown to many operators.  This usage is harmless to third
   parties and is not dependent on the anycast 6to4 mechanism that this
   document deprecates.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Deprecation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Deprecation</span>

   This document formally deprecates the anycast 6to4 transition
   mechanism defined in [<a href="./rfc3068" title='"An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers"'>RFC3068</a>] and the associated anycast IPv4
   address 192.88.99.1.  It is no longer considered to be a useful
   service of last resort.

   The prefix 192.88.99.0/24 MUST NOT be reassigned for other use except
   by a future IETF Standards Action.

   The basic unicast 6to4 mechanism defined in [<a href="./rfc3056" title='"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds"'>RFC3056</a>] and the
   associated 6to4 IPv6 prefix 2002::/16 are not deprecated.  The
   default address selection rules specified in [<a href="./rfc6724" title='"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC6724</a>] are not
   modified.

   In the absence of 6to4 anycast, "6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels"
   [<a href="./rfc6732" title='"6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels"'>RFC6732</a>] will no longer be necessary, so they are also deprecated by
   this document.

   Incidental references to 6to4 should be reviewed and possibly removed
   from other IETF documents if and when they are updated.  These
   documents include <a href="./rfc3162">RFC 3162</a>, <a href="./rfc3178">RFC 3178</a>, <a href="./rfc3790">RFC 3790</a>, <a href="./rfc4191">RFC 4191</a>, <a href="./rfc4213">RFC 4213</a>,

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to include the anycast 6to4 transition
   mechanism in new implementations.  If included in any
   implementations, the anycast 6to4 mechanism MUST be disabled by
   default.

   In host implementations, unicast 6to4 MUST also be disabled by
   default.  All hosts using 6to4 MUST support the IPv6-address-
   selection policy described in [<a href="./rfc6724" title='"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC6724</a>].

   In router implementations, 6to4 MUST be disabled by default.  In
   particular, enabling IPv6 forwarding on a device MUST NOT
   automatically enable 6to4.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Operational%20Recommendations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Operational Recommendations</span>

   This document does not imply a recommendation for the generalized
   filtering of traffic or routes for 6to4 or even anycast 6to4.  It
   simply recommends against further deployment of the anycast 6to4
   mechanism, calls for current 6to4 deployments to evaluate the
   efficacy of continued use of the anycast 6to4 mechanism, and makes
   recommendations intended to prevent any use of 6to4 from hampering
   broader deployment and use of native IPv6 on the Internet as a whole.

   Networks SHOULD NOT filter out packets whose source address is
   192.88.99.1, because this is normal 6to4 traffic from a 6to4 return
   relay somewhere in the Internet.  This includes ensuring that traffic
   from a local 6to4 return relay with a source address of 192.88.99.1
   is allowed through anti-spoofing filters (such as those described in
   [<a href="./rfc2827" title='"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing"'>RFC2827</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3704" title='"Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Networks"'>RFC3704</a>]) or through Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding
   (uRPF) checks [<a href="./rfc5635" title='"Remote Triggered Black Hole Filtering with Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)"'>RFC5635</a>].

   The guidelines in <a href="./rfc6343#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC6343]</a> remain valid for those who
   choose to continue operating anycast 6to4 despite its deprecation.

   Current operators of an anycast 6to4 relay with the IPv4 address
   192.88.99.1 SHOULD review the information in [<a href="./rfc6343" title='"Advisory Guidelines for 6to4 Deployment"'>RFC6343</a>] and the
   present document, and then consider carefully whether the anycast
   relay can be discontinued as traffic diminishes.  Internet service
   providers that do not operate an anycast relay but do provide their
   customers with a route to 192.88.99.1 SHOULD verify that it does in
   fact lead to an operational anycast relay, as discussed in
   <a href="./rfc6343#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6343]</a>.  Furthermore, Internet service providers
   and other network providers MUST NOT originate a route to
   192.88.99.1, unless they actively operate and monitor an anycast 6to4
   relay service as detailed in <a href="./rfc6343#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6343]</a>.

   Operators of a 6to4 return relay responding to the IPv6 prefix
   2002::/16 SHOULD review the information in [<a href="./rfc6343" title='"Advisory Guidelines for 6to4 Deployment"'>RFC6343</a>] and the present
   document, and then consider carefully whether the return relay can be
   discontinued as traffic diminishes.  To avoid confusion, note that
   nothing in the design of 6to4 assumes or requires that return packets
   are handled by the same relay as outbound packets.  As discussed in
   <a href="./rfc6343#section-4.5">Section 4.5 of RFC 6343</a>, content providers might choose to continue
   operating a return relay for the benefit of their own residual 6to4
   clients.  Internet service providers SHOULD announce the IPv6 prefix
   2002::/16 to their own customers if and only if it leads to a
   correctly operating return relay as described in <a href="./rfc6343">RFC 6343</a>.  IPv6-only
   service providers, including those operating a NAT64 service
   [<a href="./rfc6146" title='"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6146</a>], are advised that their own customers need a route to such
   a relay in case a residual 6to4 user served by a different service
   provider attempts to communicate with them.

   Operators of "6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels" [<a href="./rfc6732" title='"6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels"'>RFC6732</a>] SHOULD

   The document creating the "IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address
   Registry" [<a href="./rfc6890" title='"Special-Purpose IP Address Registries"'>RFC6890</a>] included the 6to4 Relay Anycast prefix
   (192.88.99.0/24) as Table 10.  Per this document, IANA has marked the
   192.88.99.0/24 prefix (originally defined by [<a href="./rfc3068" title='"An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers"'>RFC3068</a>]) as
   "Deprecated (6to4 Relay Anycast)" and added a reference to this RFC.
   The Boolean values for the address block 192.88.99.0/24 have been
   removed.  Redelegation of this prefix for any use requires
   justification via an IETF Standards Action [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].
