Abstract

   This document defines the Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) for the
   Kerberos V mechanism for the Generic Security Service Application
   Program Interface (GSS-API), based on the PRF defined for the
   Kerberos V cryptographic framework, for keying application protocols
   given an established Kerberos V GSS-API security context.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document specifies the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism's [<a href="./rfc4121" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2"'>RFC4121</a>]
   pseudo-random function corresponding to [<a href="./rfc4401" title='"A Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) API Extension for the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)"'>RFC4401</a>].  The function is a
   "PRF+" style construction.  For more information see [<a href="./rfc4401" title='"A Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) API Extension for the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)"'>RFC4401</a>],
   [<a href="./rfc2743" title='"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1"'>RFC2743</a>], [<a href="./rfc2744" title='"Generic Security Service API Version 2 : C-bindings"'>RFC2744</a>], and [<a href="./rfc4121" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2"'>RFC4121</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Conventions%20Used%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Kerberos%20V%20GSS%20Mechanism%20PRF"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Kerberos V GSS Mechanism PRF</span>

   The GSS-API PRF [<a href="./rfc4401" title='"A Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) API Extension for the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)"'>RFC4401</a>] function for the Kerberos V mechanism
   [<a href="./rfc4121" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2"'>RFC4121</a>] shall be the output of a PRF+ function based on the
   encryption type's PRF function keyed with the negotiated session key
   of the security context corresponding to the 'prf_key' input
   parameter of GSS_Pseudo_random().

   This PRF+ MUST be keyed with the key indicated by the 'prf_key' input
   parameter as follows:

   o  GSS_C_PRF_KEY_FULL -- use the sub-session key asserted by the
      acceptor, if any, or the sub-session asserted by the initiator, if
      any, or the Ticket's session key

   o  GSS_C_PRF_KEY_PARTIAL -- use the sub-session key asserted by the
      initiator, if any, or the Ticket's session key

   The PRF+ function is a simple counter-based extension of the Kerberos
   V pseudo-random function [<a href="./rfc3961" title='"Encryption and Checksum Specifications for Kerberos 5"'>RFC3961</a>] for the encryption type of the
   security context's keys:

         PRF+(K, L, S) = truncate(L, T1 || T2 || .. || Tn)

         Tn = pseudo-random(K, n || S)

   where '||' is the concatenation operator, 'n' is encoded as a network
   byte order 32-bit unsigned binary number, truncate(L, S) truncates
   the input octet string S to length L, and pseudo-random() is the
   Kerberos V pseudo-random function [<a href="./rfc3961" title='"Encryption and Checksum Specifications for Kerberos 5"'>RFC3961</a>].

   The maximum output size of the Kerberos V mechanism's GSS-API PRF
   then is, necessarily, 2^32 times the output size of the pseudo-
   random() function for the encryption type of the given key.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4402">RFC 4402</a>           A PRF for the Kerberos V Mechanism      February 2006</span>


   When the input size is longer than 2^14 octets as per [<a href="./rfc4401" title='"A Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) API Extension for the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)"'>RFC4401</a>] and
   exceeds an implementation's resources, then the mechanism MUST return
   GSS_S_FAILURE and GSS_KRB5_S_KG_INPUT_TOO_LONG as the minor status
   code.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   This document has no IANA considerations currently.  If and when a
   relevant IANA registry of GSS-API symbols and constants is created,
   then the GSS_KRB5_S_KG_INPUT_TOO_LONG minor status code should be
   added to such a registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Kerberos V encryption types' PRF functions use a key derived from
   contexts' session keys and should preserve the forward security
   properties of the mechanisms' key exchanges.

   Legacy Kerberos V encryption types may be weak, particularly the
   single-DES encryption types.

   See also [<a href="./rfc4401" title='"A Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) API Extension for the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)"'>RFC4401</a>] for generic security considerations of
   GSS_Pseudo_random().

   See also [<a href="./rfc3961" title='"Encryption and Checksum Specifications for Kerberos 5"'>RFC3961</a>] for generic security considerations of the
   Kerberos V cryptographic framework.

   Use of Ticket session keys, rather than sub-session keys, when
   initiators and acceptors fail to assert sub-session keys, is
   dangerous as ticket reuse can lead to key reuse; therefore,
   initiators should assert sub-session keys always, and acceptors
   should assert sub-session keys at least when initiators fail to do
   so.

   The computational cost of computing this PRF+ may vary depending on
   the Kerberos V encryption types being used, but generally the
   computation of this PRF+ gets more expensive as the input and output
   octet string lengths grow (note that the use of a counter in the PRF+
   construction allows for parallelization).  This means that if an
   application can be tricked into providing very large input octet
   strings and requesting very long output octet strings, then that may
   constitute a denial of service attack on the application; therefore,
   applications SHOULD place appropriate limits on the size of any input
   octet strings received from their peers without integrity protection.
