             <span class="h1">A Voucher Artifact for Bootstrapping Protocols</span>

Abstract

   This document defines a strategy to securely assign a pledge to an
   owner using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the
   pledge's manufacturer.  This artifact is known as a "voucher".

   This document defines an artifact format as a YANG-defined JSON
   document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS) structure.  Other YANG-derived formats are possible.  The
   voucher artifact is normally generated by the pledge's manufacturer
   (i.e., the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA)).

   This document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving it to other
   documents to describe specialized protocols for accessing it.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document defines a strategy to securely assign a candidate
   device (pledge) to an owner using an artifact signed, directly or
   indirectly, by the pledge's manufacturer, i.e., the Manufacturer
   Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).  This artifact is known as the
   "voucher".

   The voucher artifact is a JSON [<a href="./rfc8259" title='"The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format"'>RFC8259</a>] document that conforms with
   a data model described by YANG [<a href="./rfc7950" title='"The YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language"'>RFC7950</a>], is encoded using the rules
   defined in [<a href="./rfc8259" title='"The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format"'>RFC8259</a>], and is signed using (by default) a CMS
   structure [<a href="./rfc5652" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5652</a>].

   The primary purpose of a voucher is to securely convey a certificate,
   the "pinned-domain-cert", that a pledge can use to authenticate
   subsequent interactions.  A voucher may be useful in several
   contexts, but the driving motivation herein is to support secure
   bootstrapping mechanisms.  Assigning ownership is important to
   bootstrapping mechanisms so that the pledge can authenticate the
   network that is trying to take control of it.

   The lifetimes of vouchers may vary.  In some bootstrapping protocols,
   the vouchers may include a nonce restricting them to a single use,
   whereas the vouchers in other bootstrapping protocols may have an
   indicated lifetime.  In order to support long lifetimes, this
   document recommends using short lifetimes with programmatic renewal,
   see <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.

   This document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving it to other
   documents to describe specialized protocols for accessing it.  Some
   bootstrapping protocols using the voucher artifact defined in this
   document include: [<a href="#ref-ZERO-TOUCH" title='"Zero Touch Provisioning for Networking Devices"'>ZERO-TOUCH</a>], [<a href="#ref-SECUREJOIN" title='"6tisch Secure Join protocol"'>SECUREJOIN</a>], and [<a href="#ref-KEYINFRA" title='"Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI)"'>KEYINFRA</a>]).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   This document uses the following terms:

   Artifact:  Used throughout to represent the voucher as instantiated
      in the form of a signed structure.

   Domain:  The set of entities or infrastructure under common
      administrative control.  The goal of the bootstrapping protocol is
      to enable a pledge to discover and join a domain.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8366">RFC 8366</a>                     Voucher Profile                    May 2018</span>


   Imprint:  The process where a device obtains the cryptographic key
      material to identify and trust future interactions with a network.
      This term is taken from Konrad Lorenz's work in biology with new
      ducklings: "during a critical period, the duckling would assume
      that anything that looks like a mother duck is in fact their
      mother" [<a href="#ref-Stajano99theresurrecting">Stajano99theresurrecting</a>].  An equivalent for a device is
      to obtain the fingerprint of the network's root certification
      authority certificate.  A device that imprints on an attacker
      suffers a similar fate to a duckling that imprints on a hungry
      wolf.  Imprinting is a term from psychology and ethology, as
      described in [<a href="#ref-imprinting" title='"Wikipedia article: Imprinting"'>imprinting</a>].

   Join Registrar (and Coordinator):  A representative of the domain
      that is configured, perhaps autonomically, to decide whether a new
      device is allowed to join the domain.  The administrator of the
      domain interfaces with a join registrar (and Coordinator) to
      control this process.  Typically, a join registrar is "inside" its
      domain.  For simplicity, this document often refers to this as
      just "registrar".

   MASA (Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority):  The entity that,
      for the purpose of this document, signs the vouchers for a
      manufacturer's pledges.  In some bootstrapping protocols, the MASA
      may have an Internet presence and be integral to the bootstrapping
      process, whereas in other protocols the MASA may be an offline
      service that has no active role in the bootstrapping process.

   Owner:  The entity that controls the private key of the "pinned-
      domain-cert" certificate conveyed by the voucher.

   Pledge:  The prospective device attempting to find and securely join
      a domain.  When shipped, it only trusts authorized representatives
      of the manufacturer.

   Registrar:  See join registrar.

   TOFU (Trust on First Use):  Where a pledge device makes no security
      decisions but rather simply trusts the first domain entity it is
      contacted by.  Used similarly to [<a href="./rfc7435" title='"Opportunistic Security: Some Protection Most of the Time"'>RFC7435</a>].  This is also known as
      the "resurrecting duckling" model.

   Voucher:  A signed statement from the MASA service that indicates to
      a pledge the cryptographic identity of the domain it should trust.

   A voucher is a cryptographically protected statement to the pledge
   device authorizing a zero-touch "imprint" on the join registrar of
   the domain.  The specific information a voucher provides is
   influenced by the bootstrapping use case.

   The voucher can impart the following information to the join
   registrar and pledge:

   Assertion Basis:  Indicates the method that protects the imprint
      (this is distinct from the voucher signature that protects the
      voucher itself).  This might include manufacturer-asserted
      ownership verification, assured logging operations, or reliance on
      pledge endpoint behavior such as secure root of trust of
      measurement.  The join registrar might use this information.  Only
      some methods are normatively defined in this document.  Other
      methods are left for future work.

   Authentication of Join Registrar:  Indicates how the pledge can
      authenticate the join registrar.  This document defines a
      mechanism to pin the domain certificate.  Pinning a symmetric key,
      a raw key, or "CN-ID" or "DNS-ID" information (as defined in
      [<a href="./rfc6125" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>]) is left for future work.

   Anti-Replay Protections:  Time- or nonce-based information to
      constrain the voucher to time periods or bootstrap attempts.

   A number of bootstrapping scenarios can be met using differing
   combinations of this information.  All scenarios address the primary
   threat of a Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) registrar gaining control over
   the pledge device.  The following combinations are "types" of
   vouchers:

   Voucher      |Log-|Veri-  |Trust  |CN-ID or| RTC | Nonce |

   out-of-scope |    |       |                |             |
   -------------|----|-------|----------------|-------------|

   NOTE: All voucher types include a 'pledge ID serial-number'
         (not shown here for space reasons).

   Audit Voucher:  An Audit Voucher is named after the logging assertion
      mechanisms that the registrar then "audits" to enforce local
      policy.  The registrar mitigates a MiTM registrar by auditing that
      an unknown MiTM registrar does not appear in the log entries.
      This does not directly prevent the MiTM but provides a response
      mechanism that ensures the MiTM is unsuccessful.  The advantage is
      that actual ownership knowledge is not required on the MASA
      service.

   Nonceless Audit Voucher:  An Audit Voucher without a validity period
      statement.  Fundamentally, it is the same as an Audit Voucher
      except that it can be issued in advance to support network
      partitions or to provide a permanent voucher for remote
      deployments.

   Ownership Audit Voucher:  An Audit Voucher where the MASA service has
      verified the registrar as the authorized owner.  The MASA service
      mitigates a MiTM registrar by refusing to generate Audit Vouchers
      for unauthorized registrars.  The registrar uses audit techniques
      to supplement the MASA.  This provides an ideal sharing of policy
      decisions and enforcement between the vendor and the owner.

   Ownership ID Voucher:  Named after inclusion of the pledge's CN-ID or
      DNS-ID within the voucher.  The MASA service mitigates a MiTM
      registrar by identifying the specific registrar (via WebPKI)
      authorized to own the pledge.

   Bearer Voucher:  A Bearer Voucher is named after the inclusion of a
      registrar ID wildcard.  Because the registrar identity is not
      indicated, this voucher type must be treated as a secret and
      protected from exposure as any 'bearer' of the voucher can claim
      the pledge device.  Publishing a nonceless bearer voucher
      effectively turns the specified pledge into a "TOFU" device with
      minimal mitigation against MiTM registrars.  Bearer vouchers are
      out of scope.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Voucher%20Artifact"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Voucher Artifact</span>

   The voucher's primary purpose is to securely assign a pledge to an
   owner.  The voucher informs the pledge which entity it should
   consider to be its owner.

   This document defines a voucher that is a JSON-encoded instance of
   the YANG module defined in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a> that has been, by default, CMS
   signed.

   This format is described here as a practical basis for some uses
   (such as in NETCONF), but more to clearly indicate what vouchers look
   like in practice.  This description also serves to validate the YANG
   data model.

   Future work is expected to define new mappings of the voucher to
   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (from JSON) and to change
   the signature container from CMS to JSON Object Signing and
   Encryption (JOSE) or CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).  XML
   or ASN.1 formats are also conceivable.

   This document defines a media type and a filename extension for the
   CMS-encoded JSON type.  Future documents on additional formats would
   define additional media types.  Signaling is in the form of a MIME
   Content-Type, an HTTP Accept: header, or more mundane methods like
   use of a filename extension when a voucher is transferred on a USB
   key.

   This section provides voucher examples for illustration purposes.
   These examples conform to the encoding rules defined in [<a href="./rfc8259" title='"The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format"'>RFC8259</a>].

   The following example illustrates an ephemeral voucher (uses a
   nonce).  The MASA generated this voucher using the 'logged' assertion
   type, knowing that it would be suitable for the pledge making the
   request.

   {
     "ietf-voucher:voucher": {
       "created-on": "2016-10-07T19:31:42Z",
       "assertion": "logged",
       "serial-number": "JADA123456789",
       "idevid-issuer": "base64encodedvalue==",
       "pinned-domain-cert": "base64encodedvalue==",
       "nonce": "base64encodedvalue=="
     }

   The following example illustrates a non-ephemeral voucher (no nonce).
   While the voucher itself expires after two weeks, it presumably can
   be renewed for up to a year.  The MASA generated this voucher using
   the 'verified' assertion type, which should satisfy all pledges.

   The IETF evolution of PKCS#7 is CMS [<a href="./rfc5652" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5652</a>].  A CMS-signed voucher,
   the default type, contains a ContentInfo structure with the voucher
   content.  An eContentType of 40 indicates that the content is a JSON-
   encoded voucher.

   The signing structure is a CMS SignedData structure, as specified by
   <a href="./rfc5652#section-5.1">Section 5.1 of [RFC5652]</a>, encoded using ASN.1 Distinguished Encoding
   Rules (DER), as specified in ITU-T X.690 [<a href="#ref-ITU.X690.2015">ITU.X690.2015</a>].

   To facilitate interoperability, <a href="#section-8.3">Section 8.3</a> in this document
   registers the media type "application/voucher-cms+json" and the
   filename extension ".vcj".

   The CMS structure MUST contain a 'signerInfo' structure, as described
   in <a href="./rfc5652#section-5.1">Section 5.1 of [RFC5652]</a>, containing the signature generated over
   the content using a private key trusted by the recipient.  Normally,
   the recipient is the pledge and the signer is the MASA.  Another
   possible use could be as a "signed voucher request" format
   originating from the pledge or registrar toward the MASA.  Within
   this document, the signer is assumed to be the MASA.

   Note that <a href="./rfc5652#section-5.1">Section 5.1 of [RFC5652]</a> includes a discussion about how to
   validate a CMS object, which is really a PKCS7 object (cmsVersion=1).
   Intermediate systems (such the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
   Infrastructures (BRSKI) registrar) that might need to evaluate the
   voucher in flight MUST be prepared for such an older format.  No
   signaling is necessary, as the manufacturer knows the capabilities of
   the pledge and will use an appropriate format voucher for each
   pledge.

   The CMS structure SHOULD also contain all of the certificates leading
   up to and including the signer's trust anchor certificate known to
   the recipient.  The inclusion of the trust anchor is unusual in many
   applications, but third parties cannot accurately audit the
   transaction without it.

   The CMS structure MAY also contain revocation objects for any
   intermediate certificate authorities (CAs) between the voucher issuer
   and the trust anchor known to the recipient.  However, the use of
   CRLs and other validity mechanisms is discouraged, as the pledge is
   unlikely to be able to perform online checks and is unlikely to have
   a trusted clock source.  As described below, the use of short-lived
   vouchers and/or a pledge-provided nonce provides a freshness
   guarantee.

   The lifetimes of vouchers may vary.  In some bootstrapping protocols,
   the vouchers may be created and consumed immediately, whereas in
   other bootstrapping solutions, there may be a significant time delay
   between when a voucher is created and when it is consumed.  In cases
   when there is a time delay, there is a need for the pledge to ensure
   that the assertions made when the voucher was created are still
   valid.

   A revocation artifact is generally used to verify the continued
   validity of an assertion such as a PKIX certificate, web token, or a
   "voucher".  With this approach, a potentially long-lived assertion is
   paired with a reasonably fresh revocation status check to ensure that
   the assertion is still valid.  However, this approach increases
   solution complexity, as it introduces the need for additional
   protocols and code paths to distribute and process the revocations.

   Addressing the shortcomings of revocations, this document recommends
   instead the use of lightweight renewals of short-lived non-revocable
   vouchers.  That is, rather than issue a long-lived voucher, where the
   'expires-on' leaf is set to some distant date, the expectation is for
   the MASA to instead issue a short-lived voucher, where the 'expires-
   on' leaf is set to a relatively near date, along with a promise
   (reflected in the 'last-renewal-date' field) to reissue the voucher
   again when needed.  Importantly, while issuing the initial voucher
   may incur heavyweight verification checks ("Are you who you say you
   are?"  "Does the pledge actually belong to you?"), reissuing the
   voucher should be a lightweight process, as it ostensibly only
   updates the voucher's validity period.  With this approach, there is
   only the one artifact, and only one code path is needed to process
   it; there is no possibility of a pledge choosing to skip the
   revocation status check because, for instance, the OCSP Responder is
   not reachable.

   While this document recommends issuing short-lived vouchers, the
   voucher artifact does not restrict the ability to create long-lived
   voucher, if required; however, no revocation method is described.

   Note that a voucher may be signed by a chain of intermediate CAs
   leading up to the trust anchor certificate known by the pledge.  Even
   though the voucher itself is not revocable, it may still be revoked,
   per se, if one of the intermediate CA certificates is revoked.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20Voucher%20Per%20Pledge"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Voucher Per Pledge</span>

   The solution described herein originally enabled a single voucher to
   apply to many pledges, using lists of regular expressions to
   represent ranges of serial-numbers.  However, it was determined that
   blocking the renewal of a voucher that applied to many devices would
   be excessive when only the ownership for a single pledge needed to be
   blocked.  Thus, the voucher format now only supports a single serial-
   number to be listed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.1.%20%20Clock%20Sensitivity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" id="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Clock Sensitivity</span>

   An attacker could use an expired voucher to gain control over a
   device that has no understanding of time.  The device cannot trust
   NTP as a time reference, as an attacker could control the NTP stream.

   There are three things to defend against this: 1) devices are
   required to verify that the expires-on field has not yet passed, 2)
   devices without access to time can use nonces to get ephemeral
   vouchers, and 3) vouchers without expiration times may be used, which
   will appear in the audit log, informing the security decision.

   This document defines a voucher format that contains time values for
   expirations, which require an accurate clock in order to be processed
   correctly.  Vendors planning on issuing vouchers with expiration
   values must ensure that devices have an accurate clock when shipped
   from manufacturing facilities and take steps to prevent clock
   tampering.  If it is not possible to ensure clock accuracy, then
   vouchers with expirations should not be issued.

   Pursuant the recommendation made in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> for the MASA to be
   deployed as an online voucher signing service, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the MASA's private key used for signing vouchers is protected by a
   hardware security module (HSM).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.3.%20%20Test%20Domain%20Certificate%20Validity%20When%20Signing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3" id="section-7.3">7.3</a>.  Test Domain Certificate Validity When Signing</span>

   If a domain certificate is compromised, then any outstanding vouchers
   for that domain could be used by the attacker.  The domain
   administrator is clearly expected to initiate revocation of any
   domain identity certificates (as is normal in PKI solutions).

   Similarly,they are expected to contact the MASA to indicate that an
   outstanding (presumably short lifetime) voucher should be blocked
   from automated renewal.  Protocols for voucher distribution are
   RECOMMENDED to check for revocation of domain identity certificates
   before the signing of vouchers.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.4.%20%20YANG%20Module%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.4" id="section-7.4">7.4</a>.  YANG Module Security Considerations</span>

   The YANG module specified in this document defines the schema for
   data that is subsequently encapsulated by a CMS signed-data content
   type, as described in <a href="./rfc5652#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC5652]</a>.  As such, all of the
   YANG modeled data is protected from modification.

   Implementations should be aware that the signed data is only
   protected from external modification; the data is still visible.
   This potential disclosure of information doesn't affect security so
   much as privacy.  In particular, adversaries can glean information
   such as which devices belong to which organizations and which CRL
   Distribution Point and/or OCSP Responder URLs are accessed to
   validate the vouchers.  When privacy is important, the CMS signed-
   data content type SHOULD be encrypted, either by conveying it via a
   mutually authenticated secure transport protocol (e.g., TLS
   [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>]) or by encapsulating the signed-data content type with an
   enveloped-data content type (<a href="./rfc5652#section-6">Section 6 of [RFC5652]</a>), though details
   for how to do this are outside the scope of this document.

   The use of YANG to define data structures, via the 'yang-data'
   statement, is relatively new and distinct from the traditional use of
   YANG to define an API accessed by network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [<a href="./rfc6241" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>] and RESTCONF [<a href="./rfc8040" title='"RESTCONF Protocol"'>RFC8040</a>].  For this reason, these
   guidelines do not follow template described by Section 3.7 of
   [<a href="#ref-YANG-GUIDE" title='"Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers of YANG Data Model Documents"'>YANG-GUIDE</a>].
