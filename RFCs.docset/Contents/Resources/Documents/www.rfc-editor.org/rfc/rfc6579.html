<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc5988">RFC 5988</a> [<a href="./rfc5988" title='"Web Linking"'>RFC5988</a>] defined a way of indicating relationships between
   resources on the Web.  This document specifies the 'disclosure' link
   relation type.  It designates a list of IPR disclosures made with
   respect to the material for which such a relation type is specified.
   Please note that the term "patent disclosure" should be considered
   synonymous with "IPR disclosure" for the purposes of 'disclosure'
   link relation type semantics, as patent disclosures are a subset of
   IPR disclosures.

   The W3C already mandates the use of the 'disclosure' link relation
   type for links to patent disclosures in all its documents.  However,
   it has long been used with no proper specification and registration.
   This document is to fill this gap and encourage wider use of the
   'disclosure' relation type.  It formally specifies the existing
   practice of use of the link relation type and registers it in the
   registry created by <a href="./rfc5988">RFC 5988</a>.

   Please note that the 'disclosure' relation type designates a
   different resource than the 'copyright' type does; the latter refers
   to the copyright statement while the former is used to reference a
   list of patent disclosures.  Please see <a href="./rfc5988">RFC 5988</a> [<a href="./rfc5988" title='"Web Linking"'>RFC5988</a>] for more
   information on the 'copyright' relation type.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20%27disclosure%27%20Link%20Relation%20Type"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  'disclosure' Link Relation Type</span>

   Whenever the 'disclosure' relation type is used, the resource at the
   target Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) [<a href="./rfc5988" title='"Web Linking"'>RFC5988</a>] MUST
   represent a list of patent disclosures made with respect to the
   material referenced by context IRI.  This also covers the case of an
   empty list and a list containing one entry.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Examples</span>

   This section provides an example of possible use of the 'disclosure'
   relation type.

   If the page &lt;http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/&gt; contains a list of
   patent disclosures made with respect to the specification found at
   &lt;http://example.org/specs/meta-spec/spec.html&gt;, the latter would have
   the following fragment of HTML source code:

   &lt;html&gt;
     ...
     Please visit
     &lt;a rel="disclosure" href="http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/"&gt;
     the IPR page&lt;/a&gt; for the list of patent disclosures made with
     respect to this specification.
     ...
   &lt;/html&gt;

   In the case of Link header field, the HTTP response would contain the
   following header field:

      Link: &lt;http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/&gt;; rel="disclosure";
            title="Patent Disclosures List"

   (Please note that the actual header field will not contain the line
   break and spaces after the 'rel' parameter.)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The 'disclosure' relation type is truly believed not to raise any new
   security issues that are not discussed in <a href="./rfc5988">RFC 5988</a> for generic use of
   the Web linking mechanism.
