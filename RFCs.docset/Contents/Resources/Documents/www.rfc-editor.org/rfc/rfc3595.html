Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet

Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent the commonly
   used IPv6 Flow Label.  The intent is that these textual conventions
   (TCs) will be imported and used in MIB modules that would otherwise
   define their own representations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Several standards-track MIB modules have defined objects to represent
   an IPv6 Flow Label (sometimes referred to as Flow ID) [<a href="./rfc2460" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-FLOWLABEL" title='"IPv6 Flow Label Specification"'>FLOWLABEL</a>] and IPv6 Flow Label filters.  Unfortunately the result is
   a set of different definitions for the same piece of management
   information.  This may lead to confusion and unnecessary complexity.

   This document defines a set of textual conventions (TCs) that can and
   should be (re-)used in MIB modules, so that they all represent an
   IPv6 Flow Label in the same way.  In fact, PIB modules can and should
   also use these TCs when they need to represent an IPv6 Flow label.

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="./rfc3410#section-7">sectionÂ 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="./rfc3410" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>

   The MIB module contained in this memo does not define any management
   objects.  Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions which may
   be used by other MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written for MIB
   modules that define concrete management objects.  This document has
   therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.

   This document was produced as a result of a review of the use of
   FlowID in a PIB module and a MIB module.  Further investigation found
   that FlowID and FlowLabel objects were defined in a few other MIB
   modules.  The editor would like to thank all who contributed to the
   discussion that resulted in this document, particularly Juergen
   Schoenwaelder for finding and reporting most of the other MIB modules
   that were using/defining a FlowLabel object.  Juergen also suggested
   the very first direction for a common TC for these objects.  Further
   contributions were received from Fred Baker, Dan Romascanu, Kwok Ho
   Chan, Margaret Wasserman, Brian Carpenter, Andy Bierman, Randy
   Presuhn, Branislav Meandzija, Brian Williams, Ravi Sahita.  We also
   received initial input from 3GPP that expressed the requirement to be
   able to specify a wildcard for FlowID or FlowLabel.  Further helpful
   review comments were received from Brian Carpenter, John Loughney,
   Pekka Savola.
