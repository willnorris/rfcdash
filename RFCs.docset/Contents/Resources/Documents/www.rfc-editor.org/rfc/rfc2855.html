Abstract

   IEEE Std 1394-1995 is a standard for a High Performance Serial Bus.
   Since 1394 uses a different link-layer addressing method than
   conventional IEEE802/Ethernet, the usage of some fields must be
   clarified to achieve interoperability.  This memo describes the 1394
   specific usage of some fields of DHCP messages.

   IEEE Std 1394-1995 is a standard for a High Performance Serial Bus.
   IETF IP1394 Working Group specified the method to carry IPv4
   datagrams and 1394 ARP packets over an IEEE1394 network [<a href="./rfc2734" title='"IPv4 over IEEE 1394"'>RFC2734</a>].

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>] provides a
   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP
   network.

   Since 1394 uses a different link-layer addressing method than
   conventional IEEE802/Ethernet, the usage of some fields must be
   clarified to achieve interoperability.  This memo describes the 1394
   specific usage of some fields of DHCP.  See [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>] for the
   mechanism of DHCP and the explanations of each field.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2855">RFC 2855</a>                   DHCP for IEEE 1394                  June 2000</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Issues%20related%20to%201394%20link%20address"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>. Issues related to 1394 link address</span>

   With conventional link-layer protocols, such as an Ethernet, the
   'chaddr' (client hardware address) field may be used to return a
   reply message from a DHCP server (or relay-agent) to a client.  Since
   a 1394 link address (node_ID) is transient and will not be consistent
   across the 1394 bridge, we have chosen not to put it in the 'chaddr'
   field.  A DHCP client should request that the server sends a
   broadcast reply by setting the BROADCAST flag when 1394 ARP is not
   possible yet.

      Note: In general, the use of a broadcast reply is discouraged, but
      we consider the impact in a 1394 network as a non issue.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%201394%20specific%20usage%20of%20DHCP%20message%20fields"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>. 1394 specific usage of DHCP message fields</span>

   Following rules should be used when a DHCP client is connected to an
   IEEE1394 network.

   'htype' (hardware address type) MUST be 24 [<a href="#ref-ARPPARAM">ARPPARAM</a>].

   'hlen' (hardware address length) MUST be 0.

   The 'chaddr' (client hardware address) field is reserved.  The sender
   MUST set this field to zero, and the recipient and the relay agent
   MUST ignore its value on receipt.

   A DHCP client on 1394 SHOULD set a BROADCAST flag in DHCPDISCOVER and
   DHCPREQUEST messages (and set 'ciaddr' to zero) to ensure that the
   server (or the relay agent) broadcasts its reply to the client.

      Note: As described in [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>], 'ciaddr' MUST be filled in with
      client's IP address during BOUND, RENEWING or REBINDING state,
      therefore, the BROADCAST flag MUST NOT be set.  In these cases,
      the DHCP server unicasts DHCPACK message to the address in
      'ciaddr'. The link address will be resolved by 1394 ARP.

   'client identifier' option MUST be used in DHCP messages from the
   client to the server due to the lack of the 'chaddr'.  'client
   identifier' option may consist of any data.  Because every IP over
   1394 node has an EUI-64 (node unique ID), the EUI-64 makes an obvious
   'client identifier'.  1394 clients SHOULD include an EUI-64
   identifier in the 'client identifier' option. The type value for the
   EUI-64 is 27 [<a href="#ref-ARPPARAM">ARPPARAM</a>], and the format is illustrated as follows.

    Code  Len   Type  Client-Identifier
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  61 |  9  | 27  |           EUI-64 (node unique ID)             |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   Note that the use of other 'client identifier' type, such as a fully
   qualified domain name (FQDN), is not precluded by this memo.

   For more details, see "9.14. Client-identifier" in [<a href="./rfc2132" title='"DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions"'>RFC2132</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in <a href="#section-7">section 7</a> of the DHCP
   protocol specification [<a href="./rfc2131" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>].

   A malicious client can falsify its EUI-64 identifier, thus
   masquerading as another client.
