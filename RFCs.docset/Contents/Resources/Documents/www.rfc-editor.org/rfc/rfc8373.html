         <span class="h1">Negotiating Human Language in Real-Time Communications</span>

Abstract

   Users have various human (i.e., natural) language needs, abilities,
   and preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.
   This document defines new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-
   level attributes so that when establishing interactive communication
   sessions ("calls"), it is possible to negotiate (i.e., communicate
   and match) the caller's language and media needs with the
   capabilities of the called party.  This is especially important for
   emergency calls, because it allows for a call to be handled by a call
   taker capable of communicating with the user or for a translator or
   relay operator to be bridged into the call during setup.  However,
   this also applies to non-emergency calls (for example, calls to a
   company call center).

   This document describes the need as well as a solution that uses new
   SDP media attributes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   A mutually comprehensible language is helpful for human
   communication.  This document addresses the negotiation of human
   language and media modality (spoken, signed, or written) in real-time
   communications.  A companion document [<a href="./rfc8255" title='"Multiple Language Content Type"'>RFC8255</a>] addresses language
   selection in email.

   Unless the caller and callee know each other or there is contextual
   or out-of-band information from which the language(s) and media
   modalities can be determined, there is a need for spoken, signed, or
   written languages to be negotiated based on the caller's needs and
   the callee's capabilities.  This need applies to both emergency and
   non-emergency calls.  An example of a non-emergency call is when a
   caller contacts a company call center; an emergency call typically
   involves a caller contacting a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).
   In such scenarios, it is helpful for the caller to be able to
   indicate preferred signed, written, and/or spoken languages and for
   the callee to be able to indicate its capabilities; this allows the
   call to proceed using the language(s) and media forms supported by
   both.

   For various reasons, including the ability to establish multiple
   streams using different media (i.e., voice, text, and/or video), it
   makes sense to use a per-stream negotiation mechanism known as the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP).  Utilizing SDP [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] enables
   the solution described in this document to be applied to all
   interactive communications negotiated using SDP, in emergency as well
   as non-emergency scenarios.

   By treating language as another SDP attribute that is negotiated
   along with other aspects of a media stream, it becomes possible to
   accommodate a range of users' needs and called-party facilities.  For
   example, some users may be able to speak several languages but have a
   preference.  Some called parties may support some of those languages
   internally but require the use of a translation service for others,
   or they may have a limited number of call takers able to use certain
   languages.  Another example would be a user who is able to speak but
   is deaf or hard of hearing and desires a voice stream to send spoken
   language plus a text stream to receive written language.  Making
   language a media attribute allows standard session negotiation to
   handle this by providing the information and mechanism for the
   endpoints to make appropriate decisions.

   The term "negotiation" is used here rather than "indication" because
   human language (spoken/written/signed) can be negotiated in the same
   manner as media (audio/text/video) and codecs.  For example, if we
   think of a user calling an airline reservation center, the user may



<span class="grey">Gellens                      Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8373">RFC 8373</a>               Negotiating Human Language               May 2018</span>


   be able to use a set of languages, perhaps with preferences for one
   or a few, while the airline reservation center may support a fixed
   set of languages.  Negotiation should select the user's most
   preferred language that is supported by the call center.  Both sides
   should be aware of which language was negotiated.

   In the offer/answer model used here, the offer contains a set of
   languages per media (and direction) that the offerer is capable of
   using, and the answer contains one language per media (and direction)
   that the answerer will support.  Supporting languages and/or
   modalities can require taking extra steps, such as bridging external
   translation or relay resources into the call or having a call handled
   by an agent who speaks a requested language and/or has the ability to
   use a requested modality.  The answer indicates the media and
   languages that the answerer is committing to support (possibly after
   additional steps have been taken).  This model also provides
   knowledge so both ends know what has been negotiated.  Note that
   additional steps required to support the indicated languages or
   modalities may or may not be in place in time for any early media.

   Since this is a protocol mechanism, the user equipment (UE) client
   needs to know the user's preferred languages; while this document
   does not address how clients determine this, reasonable techniques
   could include a configuration mechanism with a default of the
   language of the user interface.  In some cases, a UE client could tie
   language and media preferences, such as a preference for a video
   stream using a signed language and/or a text or audio stream using a
   written/spoken language.

   This document does not address user interface (UI) issues, such as if
   or how a UE client informs a user about the result of language and
   media negotiation.

   Within this document, it is assumed that the negotiating endpoints
   have already been determined so that a per-stream negotiation based
   on SDP can proceed.

   When setting up interactive communication sessions, it is necessary
   to route signaling messages to the appropriate endpoint(s).  This
   document does not address the problem of language-based routing.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8373">RFC 8373</a>               Negotiating Human Language               May 2018</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Desired%20Semantics"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Desired Semantics</span>

   The desired solution is a media attribute (preferably per direction)
   that may be used within an offer to indicate the preferred
   language(s) of each (direction of a) media stream and within an
   answer to indicate the accepted language.  When multiple languages
   are included for a media stream within an offer, the languages are
   listed in order of preference (most preferred first).

   Note that negotiating multiple simultaneous languages within a media
   stream is out of scope of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20Existing%20%27lang%27%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The Existing 'lang' Attribute</span>

   <a href="./rfc4566">RFC 4566</a> [<a href="./rfc4566" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] specifies an attribute 'lang' that is similar to
   what is needed here but is not sufficiently specific or flexible for
   the needs of this document.  In addition, 'lang' is not mentioned in
   [<a href="./rfc3264" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>], and there are no known implementations in SIP.  Further,
   it is useful to be able to specify language per direction (sending
   and receiving).  This document therefore defines two new attributes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Solution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Solution</span>

   An SDP attribute (per direction) seems the natural choice to
   negotiate human language of an interactive media stream, using the
   language tags of [<a href="#ref-BCP47" title='"Matching of Language Tags"'>BCP47</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20The%20%27hlang-send%27%20and%20%27hlang-recv%27%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  The 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' Attributes</span>

   This document defines two media-level attributes: 'hlang-send' and
   'hlang-recv' (registered in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>).  Both start with 'hlang',
   short for "human language".  These attributes are used to negotiate
   which human language is selected for use in (each direction of) each
   interactive media stream.  (Note that not all streams will
   necessarily be used.)  Each can appear for media streams in offers
   and answers.

   In an offer, the 'hlang-send' value is a list of one or more
   language(s) the offerer is willing to use when sending using the
   media, and the 'hlang-recv' value is a list of one or more



<span class="grey">Gellens                      Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8373">RFC 8373</a>               Negotiating Human Language               May 2018</span>


   language(s) the offerer is willing to use when receiving using the
   media.  The list of languages is in preference order (first is most
   preferred).  When a media is intended for interactive communication
   in only one direction (e.g., a user in France with difficulty
   speaking but able to hear who indicates a desire to receive French
   using audio and send French using text), either 'hlang-send' or
   'hlang-recv' MAY be omitted.  Note that the media can still be useful
   in both directions.  When a media is not primarily intended for
   language (for example, a video or audio stream intended for
   background only), both SHOULD be omitted.  Otherwise, both SHOULD
   have the same value.  Note that specifying different languages for
   each direction (as opposed to the same, or essentially the same,
   language in different modalities) can make it difficult to complete
   the call (e.g., specifying a desire to send audio in Hungarian and
   receive audio in Portuguese).

   In an answer, 'hlang-send' is the language the answerer will send if
   using the media for language (which in most cases is one of the
   languages in the offer's 'hlang-recv'), and 'hlang-recv' is the
   language the answerer expects to receive if using the media for
   language (which in most cases is one of the languages in the offer's
   'hlang-send').

   In an offer, each value MUST be a list of one or more language tags
   per [<a href="#ref-BCP47" title='"Matching of Language Tags"'>BCP47</a>], separated by white space.  In an answer, each value MUST
   be one language tag per [<a href="#ref-BCP47" title='"Matching of Language Tags"'>BCP47</a>].  [<a href="#ref-BCP47" title='"Matching of Language Tags"'>BCP47</a>] describes mechanisms for
   matching language tags.  Note that <a href="./rfc5646#section-4.1">SectionÂ 4.1 of RFC 5646</a> [<a href="#ref-BCP47" title='"Matching of Language Tags"'>BCP47</a>]
   advises to "tag content wisely" and not include unnecessary subtags.

   When placing an emergency call, and in any other case where the
   language cannot be inferred from context, each OFFERed media stream
   primarily intended for human language communication SHOULD specify
   the 'hlang-send' and/or 'hlang-recv' attributes for the direction(s)
   intended for interactive communication.

   Clients acting on behalf of end users are expected to set one or both
   of the 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' attributes on each OFFERed media
   stream primarily intended for human communication when placing an
   outgoing session, and either ignore or take into consideration the
   attributes when receiving incoming calls, based on local
   configuration and capabilities.  Systems acting on behalf of call
   centers and PSAPs are expected to take the attributes into account
   when processing inbound calls.

   Note that media and language negotiation might result in more media
   streams being accepted than are needed by the users (e.g., if more
   preferred and less preferred combinations of media and language are
   all accepted).  This is not a problem.

   A consideration regarding the ability to negotiate language is
   whether the call proceeds or fails if the callee does not support any
   of the languages requested by the caller.  This document does not
   mandate either behavior.

   When a call is rejected due to lack of any language in common, the
   SIP response has SIP response code 488 (Not Acceptable Here) or 606
   (Not Acceptable) [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and a Warning header field [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] with
   a warning code of 308 and warning text indicating that there are no
   mutually supported languages; the warning text SHOULD also contain
   the supported languages and media.

   Example:

   Warning:  308 proxy.example.com  "Incompatible language
      specification: Requested languages not supported.  Supported
      languages are: es, en; supported media are: audio, text."

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.%20%20Usage%20Notes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Usage Notes</span>

   A sign-language tag with a video media stream is interpreted as an
   indication for sign language in the video stream.  A non-sign-
   language tag with a text media stream is interpreted as an indication
   for written language in the text stream.  A non-sign-language tag
   with an audio media stream is interpreted as an indication for spoken
   language in the audio stream.

   This document does not define any other use for language tags in
   video media (such as how to indicate visible captions in the video
   stream).

   This document does not define the use of sign-language tags in text
   or audio media.

   In the IANA registry for language subtags per [<a href="#ref-BCP47" title='"Matching of Language Tags"'>BCP47</a>], a language
   subtag with a Type field "extlang" combined with a Prefix field value
   "sgn" indicates a sign-language tag.  The absence of such "sgn"
   prefix indicates a non-sign-language tag.

   This document does not define the use of language tags in media other
   than interactive streams of audio, video, and text (such as "message"
   or "application").  Such use could be supported by future work or by
   application agreement.

   Note that, even though the examples show the same (or essentially the
   same) language being used in both directions (even when the modality
   differs), there is no requirement that this be the case.  However, in
   practice, doing so is likely to increase the chances of successful
   matching.

   IANA has added two entries to the "att-field (media level only)"
   subregistry of the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters"
   registry.

   The first entry is for 'hlang-recv':

   The second entry is for 'hlang-send':

   Long-Form English Name:  human language send
   Contact Name:            Randall Gellens

   IANA has added the value 308 to the "Warning Codes (warn-codes)"
   subregistry of the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters"
   registry.  (The value lies within the range allocated for indicating
   problems with keywords in the session description.)  The reference is
   to this document.  The warn text is "Incompatible language

   languages are [list of supported languages]; supported media are:
   [list of supported media]."

   The Security Considerations of [<a href="#ref-BCP47" title='"Matching of Language Tags"'>BCP47</a>] apply here.  An attacker with
   the ability to modify signaling could prevent a call from succeeding
   by altering any of several crucial elements, including the
   'hlang-send' or 'hlang-recv' values.  <a href="./rfc5069">RFC 5069</a> [<a href="./rfc5069" title='"Security Threats and Requirements for Emergency Call Marking and Mapping"'>RFC5069</a>] discusses
   such threats.  Use of TLS or IPsec can protect against such threats.
   Emergency calls are of particular concern; <a href="./rfc6881">RFC 6881</a> [<a href="./rfc6881" title='"Best Current Practice for Communications Services in Support of Emergency Calling"'>RFC6881</a>], which
   is specific to emergency calls, mandates use of TLS or IPsec (in
   ED-57/SP-30).

   Language and media information can suggest a user's nationality,
   background, abilities, disabilities, etc.
