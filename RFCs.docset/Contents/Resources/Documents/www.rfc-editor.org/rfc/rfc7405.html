   The base definition of ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) supports US-
   ASCII string literals.  The matching of these literals is done in a
   case-insensitive manner.  While this is often the desired behavior,
   in some situations, case-sensitive matching of string literals is
   needed.  Literals for case-sensitive matching must be specified using
   the numeric representation of those characters, which is inconvenient
   and error prone both to write and read.

   This document extends ABNF to have two different types of US-ASCII
   string literals.  One type is matched using case-sensitive matching,
   while the other is matched using case-insensitive matching.  These
   types are denoted using type prefixes similar to the type prefixes
   used with numeric values.  If no prefix is used, then case-
   insensitive matching is used (as is consistent with previous
   behavior).

   This document is structured as a set of changes to the full ABNF
   specification [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].

   This document makes changes to two parts of [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].  The two
   changes are as follows:

   o  Replace the last half of <a href="./rfc5234#section-2.3">Section 2.3 of [RFC5234]</a> (beginning with
      "ABNF permits the specification of literal text strings") with the
      contents of <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>.

   o  Replace the &lt;char-val&gt; rule in <a href="./rfc5234#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC5234]</a> with the
      contents of <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Terminal%20Values%20-%20Literal%20Text%20Strings"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Terminal Values - Literal Text Strings</span>

   ABNF permits the specification of literal text strings directly,
   enclosed in quotation marks.  Hence:

         command     =  "command string"

   Literal text strings are interpreted as a concatenated set of
   printable characters.

   NOTE:

   The character set for these strings is US-ASCII.

   Literal text strings in ABNF may be either case sensitive or case
   insensitive.  The form of matching used with a literal text string is
   denoted by a prefix to the quoted string.  The following prefixes are
   allowed:

         %s          =  case-sensitive
         %i          =  case-insensitive

   To be consistent with prior implementations of ABNF, having no prefix
   means that the string is case insensitive and is equivalent to having
   the "%i" prefix.

   Hence:

         rulename = %i"aBc"

   and:

         rulename = "abc"

   will both match "abc", "Abc", "aBc", "abC", "ABc", "aBC", "AbC", and
   "ABC".

   In contrast:

         rulename = %s"aBc"

   will match only "aBc" and will not match "abc", "Abc", "abC", "ABc",
   "aBC", "AbC", or "ABC".

   In the past, the numerical specification of individual characters was
   used to define a case-sensitive rule.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7405">RFC 7405</a>          Case-Sensitive String Support in ABNF    December 2014</span>


   For example:

         rulename    =  %d97 %d98 %d99

   or

         rulename    =  %x61.62.63

   will match only the string that comprises only the lowercase
   characters, abc.  Using a literal text string with a prefix has a
   clear readability advantage over the old way.

         char-val       =  case-insensitive-string /
                           case-sensitive-string

         case-insensitive-string =
                           [ "%i" ] quoted-string

         case-sensitive-string =
                           "%s" quoted-string

         quoted-string  =  DQUOTE *(%x20-21 / %x23-7E) DQUOTE
                                ; quoted string of SP and VCHAR
                                ;  without DQUOTE
