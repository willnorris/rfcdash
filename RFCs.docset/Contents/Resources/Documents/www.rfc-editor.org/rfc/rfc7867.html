   Multimedia applications often suffer from packet losses in IP
   networks.  In order to get a reasonable degree of quality when there
   is packet loss, it is necessary to have loss concealment mechanisms
   at the decoder.  Video loss concealment is a range of techniques to
   mask the effects of packet loss in video communications.

   In some applications, reporting the information of receivers applying
   video loss concealment could give monitors or senders useful
   information on the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the application.
   One example is no-reference video quality evaluation.  Video probes
   located upstream from the video endpoint or terminal may not see loss
   occurring between the probe and the endpoint, and also may not be
   fully aware of the specific loss concealment methods being
   dynamically applied by the video endpoint.  Evaluating error
   concealment is important in this circumstance to estimate the
   subjective impact of impairments.

   This document defines one new block type for video loss concealment
   to augment those defined in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>] and [<a href="./rfc7294" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Blocks for Concealment Metrics Reporting on Audio Applications"'>RFC7294</a>] for use in a
   range of RTP video applications.  The metrics defined in this
   document belong to the class of transport-related terminal metrics
   defined in [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>]
   defines an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block that
   is used as defined in [<a href="./rfc3550" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].

   The Performance Metrics Framework [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   monitoring framework [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>] provides guidelines for the reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The XR block type described in this
   document is in accordance with the guidelines in [<a href="./rfc6390" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc6792" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.3.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" id="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Applicability</span>

   These metrics are applicable to video applications the video
   component of audio/video applications using RTP and applying packet
   loss concealment mechanisms that are incorporated into the receiving
   endpoint to mitigate the impact of network impairments on QoE.  For
   example, in an IPTV system, set-top boxes could use this RTCP XR
   block to report loss and loss concealment metrics to an IPTV
   management system to enable the service provider to monitor the
   quality of the IPTV service being delivered to end users.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Video%20Loss%20Concealment%20Methods"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Video Loss Concealment Methods</span>

   Video loss concealment mechanisms can be classified into 4 types as
   follows:

   a) Frame freeze

      The impaired video frame is not displayed; instead, the previously
      displayed frame is frozen for the duration of the loss event.

   b) Interframe extrapolation

      If an area of the video frame is damaged by loss, the same area
      from the previous frame(s) can be used to estimate what the
      missing pixels would have been.  This can work well in a scene



<span class="grey">Huang                        Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

      with no motion but can be very noticeable if there is significant
      movement from one frame to another.  Simple decoders can simply
      reuse the pixels that were in the missing area, while more complex
      decoders can try to use several frames to do a more complex
      extrapolation.  Another example of a sophisticated form of
      interframe repair is to estimate the motion of the damaged region
      based on the motion of surrounding regions, and use that to select
      what part of the previous frame to use for repair.  Some important
      frames, such as Instantaneous Decoding Refresh (IDR) frames, may
      not depend on any other frames and may be involved in a scene
      change.  Using the interframe extrapolation method to conceal the
      loss of these frames may not obtain a satisfactory result.

   c) Interpolation

      A decoder uses the undamaged pixels in the video frame to estimate
      what the missing block of pixels should have.

   d) Error-resilient encoding

      The sender encodes the message in a redundant way so that the
      receiver can correct errors using the redundant information.
      There are usually two kinds of error-resilient encoding: One is
      that the redundant data useful for error resiliency performed at
      the decoder can be embedded into the compressed image/video
      bitstream.  The other is encoding at the bitstream level, e.g.,
      Forward Error Correction (FEC).

   Usually, methods b, c, and d are deployed together to provide
   comprehensive loss concealment in complex decoders, while method a is
   relatively independent and may be applied in some simple decoders.
   Moreover, the frame-freeze method repairs video based on frames,
   while the other methods repair video based on fine-grained elements,
   such as macroblocks or bitstreams; this will cause the measurement
   metrics of frame-freeze and the other methods to be slightly
   different.  Thus, In this document, we differentiate between frame-
   freeze and the other 3 loss concealment mechanisms.

   This block reports the video loss concealment metrics to complement
   the audio metrics defined in [<a href="./rfc7294" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Blocks for Concealment Metrics Reporting on Audio Applications"'>RFC7294</a>].  The report block MUST be
   sent in conjunction with the information from the Measurement

   Information Block [<a href="./rfc6776" title='"Measurement Identity and Information Reporting Using a Source Description (SDES) Item and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block"'>RFC6776</a>].  The Video Loss Concealment Report Block
   relies on the measurement period in the Measurement Information Block
   indicating the span of the report.  If the measurement period is not

   received in the same compound RTCP packet as this metric block, this
   metric block MUST be discarded at the receiving side.  The metrics in

   Video Loss Concealment Method Type (V): 2 bits

      This field is used to identify the video loss concealment method
      type used at the receiver.  The value is defined as follows:

         V=10: Frame-freeze
         V=11: Other Loss Concealment Method
         V=01 and V=00: Reserved

      If frame-freeze and another loss concealment method are used
      together for the media stream, two report blocks (one with V=10
      for frame freeze and one with V=11 for the other loss concealment
      method) SHOULD be compounded together to report complete
      concealment information.

   RSV: 4 bits

      These bits are reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to zero
      by senders and ignored by receivers (see <a href="./rfc6709#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of
      [RFC6709]</a>).

   Block Length: 16 bits

      This field is in accordance with the definition in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].  In
      this report block, it MUST be set to 5 when V=10 and set to 4 when
      V=11.  The block MUST be discarded if the block length is set to a
      different value.

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in <a href="./rfc3611#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of [RFC3611]</a>.

   Impaired Duration: 32 bits

      The total duration, expressed in units of RTP timestamp from the
      sending side of the reporting block, of video impaired by
      transmission loss before applying any loss concealment methods.

      Two values are reserved: A value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates out of
      range (that is, a measured value exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD), and a
      value of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates that the measurement is unavailable.

   Concealed Duration: 32 bits

      The total duration, expressed in units of RTP timestamp from the
      sending side of the reporting block, of concealed damaged video
      pictures on which the loss concealment method corresponding to the
      Video Loss Concealment Method Type is applied.

      Two values are reserved: A value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates out of
      range (that is, a measured value exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD), and a
      value of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates that the measurement is unavailable.

   Mean Frame-Freeze Duration: 32 bits

      Mean Frame-Freeze Duration is the mean duration, expressed in
      units of RTP timestamp from the sending side of the reporting
      block, of the frame-freeze events.  The value of Mean Frame-Freeze
      Duration is calculated by summing the total duration of all frame
      freeze events and dividing by the number of events.  This metric
      is optional.  It only exists when Video Loss Concealment Method
      Type=10.

   Mean Impaired Frame Proportion (MIFP): 8 bits

      Mean Impaired Frame Proportion is the mean proportion of each
      video frame impaired by loss before applying any loss concealment
      method during the interval, expressed as a fixed-point number with
      the binary point at the left edge of the field.  It is calculated
      by summing the impaired proportion of each video frame and
      dividing by the number of frames during this period.  The impaired
      proportion of each video frame is obtained by dividing the number
      of missing macroblocks from this video frame by the total
      macroblock number of the video frame, which is equivalent to
      multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting the
      maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the integer
      part.

      If a video frame is totally lost, a value of 0xFF SHOULD be used
      for the frame when calculating the MIFP.

   Mean Concealed Frame Proportion (MCFP): 8 bits

      Mean Concealed Frame Proportion is the mean proportion of each
      video frame to which loss concealment (depicted as "V" in the
      definition of "Video Loss Concealment Method Type") was applied
      during the interval, expressed as a fixed-point number with the
      binary point at the left edge of the field.  It is calculated by
      summing the concealed proportion of each video frame and dividing
      by the number of frames during this period.  The concealed
      proportion of each video frame is obtained by dividing the number
      of concealed macroblocks from this video frame by the total
      macroblock number of the video frame, which is equivalent to
      multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting the
      maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the integer
      part.

      When calculating the MCFP, a value of 0xFF SHOULD be used for a
      lost frame that is totally concealed, and a value of 0 SHOULD be
      used for the frame if there are no concealed macroblocks in it.
      For Video Loss Concealment Method Type=10, each frame covered in
      the period of frame freeze is considered to be totally concealed;
      this means a value of 0xFF MUST be assigned.

   Fraction of Frames Subject to Concealment (FFSC): 8 bits

      Fraction of Frames Subject to Concealment is calculated by
      dividing the number of frames to which loss concealment (using
      Video Loss Concealment Method Type) was applied by the total
      number of frames and expressing this value as a fixed-point number
      with the binary point at the left edge of the field.  It is
      equivalent to multiplying the result of the division by 256,
      limiting the maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking
      the integer part.

      A value of 0 indicates that there were no concealed frames, and a
      value of 0xFF indicates that the frames in the entire measurement
      interval are all concealed.

   Reserved: 8 bits

      These bits are reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to zero
      by senders and ignored by receivers (see <a href="./rfc6709#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of
      [RFC6709]</a>).

   When SDP is used in an offer/answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer
   usage defined in <a href="./rfc3611#section-5.2">Section 5.2 of [RFC3611]</a> for the unilateral
   "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters applies.  For detailed usage of
   Offer/Answer for unilateral parameters, refer to <a href="./rfc3611#section-5.2">Section 5.2 of

   It is believed that this RTCP XR block introduces no new security
   considerations beyond those described in [<a href="./rfc3611" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].  This block does
   not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to confidentiality
   documented in paragraph 3 of <a href="./rfc3611#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC3611]</a> does not apply.

   An attacker is likely to put incorrect information in the Video Loss
   Concealment reports; this will affect the estimation of the
   performance of video loss concealment mechanisms and the QoE of
   users.  Implementers SHOULD consider the guidance in [<a href="./rfc7202" title='"Securing the RTP Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution"'>RFC7202</a>] for
   using appropriate security mechanisms, i.e., where security is a
   concern, the implementation SHOULD apply encryption and
   authentication to the report block.  For example, this can be
   achieved by using the AVPF profile together with the Secure RTP
   profile as defined in [<a href="./rfc3711" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>]; an appropriate combination of the
   two profiles (an "SAVPF") is specified in [<a href="./rfc5124" title='"Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"'>RFC5124</a>].  However, other
   mechanisms also exist (documented in [<a href="./rfc7201" title='"Options for Securing RTP Sessions"'>RFC7201</a>]) and might be more
   suitable.

         of network impairments on QoE.

   d. Mean Impaired Video Frame Proportion Metric

      *  Metric Name: Mean Impaired Video Frame Proportion Metric

      *  Metric Description: Mean proportion of each video frame
         impaired by loss before applying any loss concealment method
         during the interval.

      *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: The metric is based on
         measurements that are typically made at the time that a video
         frame is decoded and rendered for playout.  It is calculated by
         summing the impaired proportion of each video frame and
         dividing by the number of frames during this period.  The
         impaired proportion of each video frame is obtained by dividing
         the number of missing macroblocks from this video frame by the

         total macroblock number of the video frame, which is equivalent
         to multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting the
         maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the
         integer part.

      *  Units of Measurement: This metric is expressed as a fixed-point
         number with the binary point at the left edge of the field.

      *  Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: It is
         measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream.

      *  Measurement Timing: See paragraph 1 of <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

      *  Use and Applications: These metrics are applicable to video
         applications of RTP and the video component of audio/video
         applications in which packet loss concealment mechanisms are
         incorporated into the receiving endpoint to mitigate the impact
         of network impairments on QoE.

   e. Mean Concealed Video Frame Proportion Metric

      *  Metric Name: Mean Concealed Video Frame Proportion Metric

      *  Metric Description: Mean proportion of each video frame to
         which loss concealment (using Video Loss Concealment Method
         Type) was applied during the interval.

      *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: The metric is based on
         measurements that are typically made at the time that a video
         frame is decoded and rendered for playout.  It is calculated by
         summing the concealed proportion of each video frame and

         concealed proportion of each video frame is obtained by
         dividing the number of concealed macroblocks from this video
         frame by the total macroblock number of the video frame, which
         is equivalent to multiplying the result of the division by 256,
         limiting the maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and
         taking the integer part.

      *  Units of Measurement: This metric is expressed as a fixed-point
