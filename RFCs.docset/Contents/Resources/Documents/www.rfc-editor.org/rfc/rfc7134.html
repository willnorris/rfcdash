<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7134">RFC 7134</a>                 RPH Registry Management              March 2014</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC4412">RFC4412</a>] defines the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" and "Resource-
   Priority Priority-values" registries.  The management policy of these
   registries is "Standards Action" [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].  Experience suggests that
   a document that only defines a new namespace with its priorities, and
   does not create new protocol semantics, should not be a Standards-
   Track document.  Therefore, this document updates [<a href="./rfc4412" title='"Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4412</a>] to change
   the management policy of the registries to "IETF Review".

   This document does not introduce any security considerations beyond
   those discussed in [<a href="./rfc4412" title='"Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4412</a>].

   IANA has changed the management policy of the "Resource-Priority
   Namespaces" and "Resource-Priority Priority-values" registries to
   "IETF Review" [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>].
