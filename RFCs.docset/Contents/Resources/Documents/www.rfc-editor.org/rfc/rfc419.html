   TO: Network Liaisons and Station Agents

   The PDP-10 at Project MAC, affectionately known as the Dynamic
   Modeling System, will, during the holiday season, take a short
   vacation from all activities including networking.  The best estimate
   I have, at present, is that we expect that on or about December 26,
   1972, the system will cease operation for a period of at least 10
   days and possibly as long as three weeks.  During this period, we
   will be installing a paging system.  I wish to advise people of this
   hiatus in system operation and also to advise them that during the
   first few weeks the paging system is in operation, the Dynamic
   Modeling system may not be as available as it has been in the past.
