Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) based event notification
   management of Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification
   (DOCSIS) compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.
   This MIB is defined as an extension to the DOCSIS Cable Device MIB.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2).  The set of
   objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP
   standards.

   DOCSIS 2.0 [<a href="#ref-15" title='"Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications: Radio Frequency Interface Specification CM-SP-RFIv2.0-I10- 051209"'>15</a>] builds upon DOCSIS 1.1 and provides all of the
   features and functionality that DOCSIS 1.1 provides.  In addition, it
   provides some significant enhancements in upstream capacity over
   DOCSIS 1.1, such as 30.72 Mbps maximum upstream channel capacity,
   Synchronous-Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) operation, increased
   robustness to upstream noise and channel impairments, Enhanced Reed-
   Solomon error correction, and Trellis Coded Modulation.

   Offering High Speed Internet Service in the cable industry has become
   extremely successful.  DOCSIS devices are being deployed at a rate of
   multiple thousands per day.  Although operators are enjoying
   successful deployment, they are also facing the challenge of properly
   managing deployed devices.  Operators are using Simple Network
   Management Protocol, a set of Management Information Base (MIB)
   required by DOCSIS, and SNMP Notifications to manage deployed DOCSIS
   devices.  The usage of SNMP Notification for event reporting is
   becoming more popular as an effective and efficient method for
   network monitoring.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4547">RFC 4547</a>                 Event Notification MIB                June 2006</span>


   Unfortunately, only a minimal set of SNMP Notifications is currently
   available.  This notification MIB, in conjunction with [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications: Operations Support System Interface Specification CM-SP- OSSIv1.1-C01-050907"'>11</a>] and [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications: Operations Support System Interface Specification CM-SP- OSSIv2.0-I09-050812"'>12</a>],
   provides a minimum set of standard DOCSIS Notifications that DOCSIS
   devices SHOULD support to enable successful management of DOCSIS
   devices and networks.

   This document defines a set of objects required for the event
   notification management of DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modems (CMs) and
   Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTSs).  The MIB module is derived
   from the DOCSIS [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications: Operations Support System Interface Specification CM-SP- OSSIv1.1-C01-050907"'>11</a>] and [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications: Operations Support System Interface Specification CM-SP- OSSIv2.0-I09-050812"'>12</a>].

   <a href="#appendix-H">Appendix H</a> of [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications: Operations Support System Interface Specification CM-SP- OSSIv1.1-C01-050907"'>11</a>] defines all DOCSIS 1.1 required events, and
   <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a> of [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications: Operations Support System Interface Specification CM-SP- OSSIv2.0-I09-050812"'>12</a>] does that for DOCSIS 2.0.  The notifications
   specified in this document are used to notify these events via SNMP.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>1</a>].

   This DOCS-IETF-CABLE-DEVICE-NOTIFICATION-MIB was designed to extend
   the <a href="./rfc2669">RFC2669</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"DOCSIS Cable Device MIB Cable Device Management Information Base for DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems"'>5</a>] notification module.

   Two groups of SNMP notification objects are defined in this document.
   One group defines notifications for cable modem events, and the other
   group defines notifications for cable modem termination system
   events.

   DOCSIS defines numerous events, and each event is assigned to a
   functional category.  This MIB defines a notification object for each
   functional category.  The varbinding list of each notification
   includes information about the event that occurred on the device.

           DESCRIPTION
               "The Event Notification MIB is an extension of the
               CABLE DEVICE MIB.  It defines various notification
               objects for both cable modem and cable modem termination
               systems.  Two groups of SNMP notification objects are
               defined.  One group is for notifying cable modem events,
               and one group is for notifying cable modem termination
               system events.

               DOCSIS defines numerous events, and each event is

   This document was produced by the IPCDN Working Group.  Thanks to
   Harrie Hazewinkel and Bert Wijnen for their thorough review and
   insightful comments on this document.  Special thanks to Rich Woundy,
   who made several valuable suggestions to improve the notifications.

   There are two management objects defined in this MIB module with a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create
   (docsDevCmNotifControl and docsDevCmtsNotifControl).  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Setting docsDevCmNotifControl or docsDevCmtsNotifControl may cause
   flooding of notifications, which can disrupt network service.
   Besides causing "flooding", changing the objects can also mean that
   notifications will not be emitted when one intends that to happen.

   This MIB defines a number of notification objects that send detailed
   information about the event that caused the generation of the
   notification.  Information in the notification message includes:
   event priority, the event Id, the event message body, the CM DOCSIS
   capability, the CM DOCSIS QOS level, the CM DOCSIS upstream
   modulation type, the cable interface MAC address of the cable modem,
   and the cable card MAC address of the CMTS to which the modem is
   connected.  The monitoring of these notification messages could be
   used to gather information about the state of the network and devices
   (CM and CMTS) attached to the network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework"'>16</a>], section 8), including
   full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
