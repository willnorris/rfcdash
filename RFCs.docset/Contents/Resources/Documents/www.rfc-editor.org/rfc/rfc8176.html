Abstract

   The "amr" (Authentication Methods References) claim is defined and
   registered in the IANA "JSON Web Token Claims" registry, but no
   standard Authentication Method Reference values are currently
   defined.  This specification establishes a registry for
   Authentication Method Reference values and defines an initial set of
   Authentication Method Reference values.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The "amr" (Authentication Methods References) claim is defined and
   registered in the IANA "JSON Web Token Claims" registry
   [<a href="#ref-IANA.JWT.Claims">IANA.JWT.Claims</a>], but no standard Authentication Method Reference
   values are currently defined.  This specification establishes a
   registry for Authentication Method Reference values and defines an
   initial set of Authentication Method Reference values.

   For context, the "amr" (Authentication Methods References) claim is
   defined by <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification
   [<a href="#ref-OpenID.Core">OpenID.Core</a>] as follows:

   amr
      OPTIONAL.  Authentication Methods References.  JSON array of
      strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in
      the authentication.  For instance, values might indicate that both
      password and OTP authentication methods were used.  The definition
      of particular values to be used in the "amr" Claim is beyond the
      scope of this specification.  Parties using this claim will need
      to agree upon the meanings of the values used, which may be
      context-specific.  The "amr" value is an array of case sensitive
      strings.

   Typically, each "amr" value provides an identifier for a family of
   closely related authentication methods.  For example, the "otp"
   identifier intentionally covers OTPs (One-Time Passwords) based on
   both time and HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code).  Many
   relying parties will be content to know that an OTP has been used in
   addition to a password; the distinction between which kind of OTP was
   used is not useful to them.  Thus, there's a single identifier that
   can be satisfied in two or more nearly equivalent ways.

   Similarly, there's a whole range of nuances between different
   fingerprint-matching algorithms.  They differ in false-positive and
   false-negative rates over different population samples and also
   differ based on the kind and model of fingerprint sensor used.  Like
   the OTP case, many relying parties will be content to know that a
   fingerprint match was made, without delving into and differentiating
   based on every aspect of the implementation of fingerprint capture
   and match.  The "fpt" identifier accomplishes this.

   Ultimately, the relying party is depending upon the identity provider
   to do reasonable things.  If it does not trust the identity provider
   to do so, it has no business using it.  The "amr" value lets the
   identity provider signal to the relying party additional information
   about what it did, for the cases in which that information is useful
   to the relying party.



<span class="grey">Jones, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8176">RFC 8176</a>         Authentication Method Reference Values        June 2017</span>


   The "amr" values defined by this specification are not intended to be
   an exhaustive set covering all use cases.  Additional values can and
   will be added to the registry by other specifications.  Rather, the
   values defined herein are an intentionally small set and are already
   actually being used in practice.

   The values defined by this specification only make distinctions that
   are known to be useful to relying parties.  Slicing things more
   finely than would be used in practice would actually hurt
   interoperability, rather than helping it, because it would force
   relying parties to recognize that several or many different values
   actually mean the same thing to them.

   For context, while the claim values registered pertain to
   authentication, note that OAuth 2.0 [<a href="./rfc6749" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>] is designed for
   resource authorization and cannot be used for authentication without
   employing appropriate extensions, such as those defined by OpenID
   Connect Core 1.0 [<a href="#ref-OpenID.Core">OpenID.Core</a>].  The existence of the "amr" claim and
   values for it should not be taken as encouragement to try to use
   OAuth 2.0 for authentication without employing extensions that enable
   secure authentication to be performed.

   When used with OpenID Connect, if the identity provider supplies an
   "amr" claim in the ID Token resulting from a successful
   authentication, the relying party can inspect the values returned and
   thereby learn details about how the authentication was performed.
   For instance, the relying party might learn that only a password was
   used or it might learn that iris recognition was used in combination
   with a hardware-secured key.  Whether "amr" values are provided and
   which values are understood by what parties are both beyond the scope
   of this specification.  The OpenID Connect MODRNA Authentication
   Profile 1.0 [<a href="#ref-OpenID.MODRNA">OpenID.MODRNA</a>] is one example of an application context
   that uses "amr" values defined by this specification.

   The following is a list of Authentication Method Reference values
   defined by this specification:

   face
      Biometric authentication [<a href="./rfc4949" title='"Internet Security Glossary, Version 2"'>RFC4949</a>] using facial recognition.

   fpt
      Biometric authentication [<a href="./rfc4949" title='"Internet Security Glossary, Version 2"'>RFC4949</a>] using a fingerprint.

   geo
      Use of geolocation information for authentication, such as that
      provided by [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-geolocation-API-20161108">W3C.REC-geolocation-API-20161108</a>].

   hwk
      Proof-of-Possession (PoP) of a hardware-secured key.  See
      <a href="./rfc4211#appendix-C">Appendix C of [RFC4211]</a> for a discussion on PoP.

   iris
      Biometric authentication [<a href="./rfc4949" title='"Internet Security Glossary, Version 2"'>RFC4949</a>] using an iris scan.

   mca
      Multiple-channel authentication [<a href="#ref-MCA" title='"Multiple-channel Authentication"'>MCA</a>].  The authentication
      involves communication over more than one distinct communication
      channel.  For instance, a multiple-channel authentication might
      involve both entering information into a workstation's browser and
      providing information on a telephone call to a pre-registered
      number.

   mfa
      Multiple-factor authentication [<a href="#ref-NIST.800-63-2">NIST.800-63-2</a>] [<a href="#ref-ISO29115" title='"ISO/IEC 29115:2013 Information technology - Security techniques - Entity authentication assurance framework"'>ISO29115</a>].  When
      this is present, specific authentication methods used may also be
      included.

   otp
      One-time password [<a href="./rfc4949" title='"Internet Security Glossary, Version 2"'>RFC4949</a>].  One-time password specifications
      that this authentication method applies to include [<a href="./rfc4226" title='"HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm"'>RFC4226</a>] and

      Personal Identification Number (PIN) [<a href="./rfc4949" title='"Internet Security Glossary, Version 2"'>RFC4949</a>] or pattern (not
      restricted to containing only numbers) that a user enters to
      unlock a key on the device.  This mechanism should have a way to
      deter an attacker from obtaining the PIN by trying repeated
      guesses.

      Proof-of-Possession (PoP) of a software-secured key.  See
      <a href="./rfc4211#appendix-C">Appendix C of [RFC4211]</a> for a discussion on PoP.

   tel
      Confirmation by telephone call to the user at a registered number.
      This authentication technique is sometimes also referred to as
      "call back" [<a href="./rfc4949" title='"Internet Security Glossary, Version 2"'>RFC4949</a>].

   user
      User presence test.  Evidence that the end user is present and

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Relationship%20to%20%22acr%22%20%28Authentication%20Context%20Class%20Reference%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Relationship to "acr" (Authentication Context Class Reference)</span>

   The "acr" (Authentication Context Class Reference) claim and
   "acr_values" request parameter are related to the "amr"
   (Authentication Methods References) claim, but with important
   differences.  An Authentication Context Class specifies a set of
   business rules that authentications are being requested to satisfy.
   These rules can often be satisfied by using a number of different
   specific authentication methods, either singly or in combination.
   Interactions using "acr_values" request that the specified
   Authentication Context Classes be used and that the result should
   contain an "acr" claim saying which Authentication Context Class was
   satisfied.  The "acr" claim in the reply states that the business
   rules for the class were satisfied -- not how they were satisfied.

   In contrast, interactions using the "amr" claim make statements about
   the particular authentication methods that were used.  This tends to
   be more brittle than using "acr", since the authentication methods
   that may be appropriate for a given authentication will vary over
   time, both because of the evolution of attacks on existing methods
   and the deployment of new authentication methods.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Privacy%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Privacy Considerations</span>

   The list of "amr" claim values returned in an ID Token reveals
   information about the way that the end user authenticated to the
   identity provider.  In some cases, this information may have privacy
   implications.

   While this specification defines identifiers for particular kinds of
   credentials, it does not define how these credentials are stored or
   protected.  For instance, ensuring the security and privacy of
   biometric credentials that are referenced by some of the defined
   Authentication Method Reference values is beyond the scope of this
   specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations in OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [<a href="#ref-OpenID.Core">OpenID.Core</a>],
   OAuth 2.0 [<a href="./rfc6749" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>], and the entire OAuth 2.0 Threat Model [<a href="./rfc6819" title='"OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations"'>RFC6819</a>]
   apply to applications using this specification.

   As described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, taking a dependence upon particular
   authentication methods may result in brittle systems since the
   authentication methods that may be appropriate for a given
   authentication will vary over time.

   This specification establishes the IANA "Authentication Method
   Reference Values" registry for "amr" claim array element values.  The
   registry records the Authentication Method Reference value and a
   reference to the specification that defines it.  This specification
   registers the Authentication Method Reference values defined in
   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.

   Values are registered on an Expert Review [<a href="./rfc5226" title="">RFC5226</a>] basis after a
   three-week review period on the &lt;jwt-reg-review@ietf.org&gt; mailing
   list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.  To increase
   potential interoperability, the Designated Experts are requested to
   encourage registrants to provide the location of a publicly
   accessible specification defining the values being registered, so
   that their intended usage can be more easily understood.

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register Authentication
   Method Reference value: otp").

   Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation and, if
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.
   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than
   21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   &lt;iesg@ietf.org&gt; mailing list) for resolution.

   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

   It is suggested that the same Designated Experts evaluate these
   registration requests as those who evaluate registration requests for
   the IANA "JSON Web Token Claims" registry [<a href="#ref-IANA.JWT.Claims">IANA.JWT.Claims</a>].

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts include
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality; whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   whether it is useful only for a single application; whether the value
   is actually being used; and whether the registration description is
   clear.

   Authentication Method Reference Name:
      The name requested (e.g., "otp") for the authentication method or
      family of closely related authentication methods.  Because a core
      goal of this specification is for the resulting representations to
      be compact, it is RECOMMENDED that the name be short -- that is,
      not to exceed 8 characters without a compelling reason to do so.
      To facilitate interoperability, the name must use only printable
      ASCII characters excluding double quote ('"') and backslash ('\')
      (the Unicode characters with code points U+0021, U+0023 through
      U+005B, and U+005D through U+007E).  This name is case sensitive.
      Names may not match other registered names in a case-insensitive
      manner unless the Designated Experts state that there is a
      compelling reason to allow an exception.

   Authentication Method Reference Description:
      Brief description of the Authentication Method Reference (e.g.,
      "One-time password").

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, state "IESG".  For others, give the name
      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document or documents that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URIs that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the documents.  An indication of the relevant sections may also be
      included but is not required.

   In some cases, the "amr" claim value returned may contain a single
   Authentication Method Reference value.  For example, the following
   "amr" claim value indicates that the authentication performed used an
   iris scan biometric:

     "amr": ["iris"]

   In other cases, the "amr" claim value returned may contain multiple
   Authentication Method Reference values.  For example, the following
   "amr" claim value indicates that the authentication performed used a
   password and knowledge-based authentication:

     "amr": ["pwd", "kba"]
