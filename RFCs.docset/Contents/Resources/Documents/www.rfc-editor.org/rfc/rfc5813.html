   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

   The ForCES MIB module is a read-only MIB module that captures
   information related to the ForCES protocol ([<a href="./rfc3654" title='"Requirements for Separation of IP Control and Forwarding"'>RFC3654</a>], [<a href="./rfc3746" title='"Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) Framework"'>RFC3746</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-FORCES-APP">FORCES-APP</a>], and [<a href="./rfc5810" title='"Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) Protocol Specification"'>RFC5810</a>]).

   The ForCES MIB module does not include information that is specified
   in other MIB modules, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.

   More specifically, the information in the ForCES MIB module relative
   to associations (between Control Elements and Forwarding Elements)
   that are in the UP state includes:

   o  identifiers of the elements in the association,

   o  configuration parameters of the association, and

   o  statistics of the association.

   The MIB module contains the latest ForCES protocol version supported
   by the Control Element (CE) (forcesLatestProtocolVersionSupported).
   Note that the CE must also allow interaction with Forwarding Elements
   (FEs) supporting earlier versions.

   For each association identified by the pair CE ID and FE ID, the
   following associated information is provided by the MIB module as an
   entry (forcesAssociationEntry) in the association table
   (forcesAssociationTable):

   o  Version number of the ForCES protocol running in this association
      (forcesAssociationRunningProtocolVersion).

   o  Time when the association entered the UP state
      (forcesAssociationTimeUp).

   o  Time when the association left the UP state
      (forcesAssociationTimeDown).  Note that this is only used for
      notification purposes as the association is removed from the MIB
      immediately after it leaves the UP state.

   o  Number of ForCES Heartbeat messages sent from the CE
      (forcesAssociationHBMsgSent) and received by the CE
      (forcesAssociationHBMsgReceived) since the association entered the
      UP state.

   o  Number of operational ForCES messages sent from the CE
      (forcesAssociationOperMsgSent) and received by the CE
      (forcesAssociationOperMsgReceived) since the association entered
      the UP state.  Only messages other than Heartbeat, Association
      Setup, Association Setup Response, and Association Teardown are
      counted.

   Finally, the MIB module defines the following notifications:

   o  Whenever an association enters the UP state, a notification
      (forcesAssociationEntryUp) is issued containing the version of the
      ForCES protocol running.  CE ID and FE ID are concatenated to form
      the table index, hence they appear in the OID of the ForCES-
      protocol running-version object.  Optionally, a notification

      (forcesAssociationEntryUpStats) can instead be issued with all
      associated information for this association, except
      forcesAssociationTimeDown.

   o  Whenever an association leaves the UP state, a notification
      (forcesAssociationEntryDown) is issued containing the version of
      the ForCES protocol running.  Optionally, a notification
      (forcesAssociationEntryDownStats) can instead be issued with all
      associated information for this association.  The reason is that
      the association and all its associated information will be removed
      from the MIB immediately after this notification has been issued.

   Associations enter the UP state as soon as the CE has sent to the FE
   an Association Setup Response message containing a successful
   Association Setup Result.  Only associations that are UP are
   reflected in this MIB module.

   Associations are removed from the MIB module as soon as they leave
   the UP state, i.e., if the CE has not received any message (Heartbeat
   or other protocol message) from the FE within a given time period or
   if an Association Teardown message has been sent by the CE.

   Statistics counters are initialized to zero when the association is
   created.  If the same association goes down and comes back up, the
   counters will reset and the discontinuity can be discovered by
   checking the discontinuity timestamp.  In addition, the time-up
   timestamp in the association allows to distinguish new associations
   from past ones with the same index.  Note that the optional down
   notification contains the statistics with the final values of the
   statistics counters.

   An NE consists of one or more FEs and one or more CEs.  Where there
   is a single CE, that CE will have knowledge of all the associations
   in the NE and so can provide the information necessary to support the
   managed objects defined in this MIB module.  Where there is more than
   one CE, information about the associations may be distributed among
   the CEs.  Whether each CE implements the managed objects for the
   associations of which it is aware or whether the CEs cooperate to
   present the appearance of a single set of managed objects for all the
   associations in the NE is outside the scope of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Objects in the forcesMibGroup are protocol versions.  They are
      neither sensitive nor vulnerable.

   o  Objects in the forcesStatsGroup are statistics.  They are neither
      sensitive nor vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="./rfc3410#section-8">[RFC3410], section 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
