      <span class="h1">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - SAVEDATE Extension</span>

Abstract

   This document adds a new capability called "SAVEDATE" to the Internet
   Message Access Protocol (IMAP).  It defines a new IMAP message
   attribute called "save date" that, unlike the existing "internal
   date" attribute, always indicates the moment at which the message was
   saved in its current mailbox.  The SAVEDATE capability extends the
   FETCH command with the means to retrieve the save date attribute and
   extends the SEARCH command to allow using the save date attribute in
   searching criteria.

   This document extends the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
   [<a href="#ref-IMAP4rev1">IMAP4rev1</a>] with a new capability called "SAVEDATE".  This capability
   adds a new IMAP message attribute called "save date".  The save date
   is the date and time at which a message was saved in the mailbox in
   which it currently resides.  The save date is similar to the existing
   "internal date" attribute in that it is set at the time of delivery.
   However, the internal date attribute can be set to an arbitrary value
   for messages delivered to the mailbox using the APPEND command and is
   usually copied from the source message for messages delivered using
   the COPY command.  In contrast, the save date attribute is always set
   to the current date and time at the moment the message is saved in
   the mailbox, irrespective of how the message is delivered and from
   where it originates.

   The save date attribute is useful for implementing automated removal
   of messages from a mailbox after a configured amount of time.  For
   that application, it is necessary to know when the message was saved
   in the mailbox, which cannot be reliably determined using the
   internal date attribute.

   For example, a common client usage pattern is to move deleted
   messages to a Trash mailbox.  These messages are considered "deleted"
   at the time they are moved to the Trash mailbox.  In an effort to
   limit the size of the Trash mailbox, a client may subsequently desire
   to permanently remove (expunge) all messages in that Trash mailbox
   deleted before a certain time (e.g., a configurable expiration
   interval).  In that case, the internal date attribute cannot be used
   since it likely refers to the time at which the message was
   originally received.  The proper time comparison attribute should

   instead be the time at which the message was saved to the Trash
   mailbox.  Similar usage patterns can be observed for archiving
   solutions.

   The SAVEDATE capability extends the FETCH command and response to
   allow retrieving the date and time at which a message was saved.
   Also, the SAVEDATE capability extends the SEARCH command to allow
   searching messages with criteria based on when they were saved in the
   mailbox.

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORDS</a>] [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS-UPD">KEYWORDS-UPD</a>] when, and only when, they appear in
   all capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Save%20Date%20Message%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Save Date Message Attribute</span>

   The save date message attribute is the date and time at which the
   message was saved in the mailbox it is now located in.  Unlike the
   internal date message attribute defined by [<a href="#ref-IMAP4rev1">IMAP4rev1</a>], this date and
   time value cannot be set arbitrarily when a message is delivered by
   the IMAP APPEND command.  Also, when a message is delivered to the
   mailbox by the IMAP COPY command [<a href="#ref-IMAP4rev1">IMAP4rev1</a>] or the IMAP MOVE command
   [<a href="#ref-IMAP-MOVE">IMAP-MOVE</a>], the save date attribute is not copied from the source
   message.  Instead, the current date and time at which the message is
   delivered to a mailbox MUST be used to set the save date attribute.
   Once calculated, the save date attribute MUST NOT change as long as
   the message is contained within the same mailbox.

   This means that when the message is copied to another mailbox, the
   save date of the message in the source mailbox remains unaffected;
   only the new copy of the message gets a new save date.  Consequently,
   when the message is moved to another mailbox, either using the MOVE
   command or a command sequence involving the COPY command [<a href="#ref-IMAP-MOVE">IMAP-MOVE</a>],
   the message always gets a new save date in the destination mailbox.

   For some specific mailboxes, the underlying storage may not support
   the save date attribute.  The handling of this situation is described
   in detail in the next section for each involved IMAP command.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8514">RFC 8514</a>                IMAP - SAVEDATE Extension           January 2019</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20IMAP%20Protocol%20Changes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  IMAP Protocol Changes</span>

   IMAP servers that support this extension MUST include "SAVEDATE" in
   the response list to the CAPABILITY command.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20FETCH%20Command%20and%20Response%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  FETCH Command and Response Extensions</span>

   This extension defines one new data item for the FETCH command:

   SAVEDATE
      The save date of the message.

   This extension defines one new data item for the FETCH response:

   SAVEDATE
      A string representing the save date of the message.  However, if
      the underlying mailbox storage does not support the save date
      message attribute, the value returned for the SAVEDATE item is
      always NIL, rather than a string.

   Example:

         C: A101 FETCH 998 (SAVEDATE)
         S: * 998 FETCH (SAVEDATE "01-Jan-2015 18:50:53 +0100")
         S: A101 OK Fetch completed.

   This extension defines four new search keys for the SEARCH command:

   SAVEDBEFORE &lt;date&gt;
      Messages whose save date (disregarding time and timezone) is
      earlier than the specified date.

   SAVEDON &lt;date&gt;
      Messages whose save date (disregarding time and timezone) is
      within the specified date.

   SAVEDSINCE &lt;date&gt;
      Messages whose save date (disregarding time and timezone) is
      within or later than the specified date.

   SAVEDATESUPPORTED
      Matches all messages in the mailbox when the underlying storage of
      that mailbox supports the save date attribute.  Conversely, it
      matches no messages in the mailbox when the save date attribute is
      not supported.

   When the underlying storage of a mailbox does not support the save
   date attribute, the SAVEDBEFORE, SAVEDON, and SAVEDSINCE search keys
   MUST use the internal date attribute instead.  In the context of the
   IMAP Multimailbox SEARCH Extension [<a href="#ref-MULTISEARCH">MULTISEARCH</a>], this fallback
   behavior MUST apply to each mailbox individually, meaning that only
   the mailboxes that lack support for the save date attribute use the
   internal date attribute instead.

   Example:

         C: A102 SEARCH SAVEDON 28-Dec-2014
         S: * SEARCH 993 994
         S: A102 OK Search completed.
         C: A103 SEARCH SAVEDSINCE 28-Dec-2014
         S: * SEARCH 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 1000 1001
         S: A103 OK Search completed.
