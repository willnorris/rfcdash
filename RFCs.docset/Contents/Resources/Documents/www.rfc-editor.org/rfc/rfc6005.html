Abstract

   This document describes a method for controlling two specific types
   of Ethernet switching via a GMPLS-based User Network Interface (UNI).
   This document supports the types of switching required by the
   Ethernet services that have been defined in the context of the Metro
   Ethernet Forum (MEF) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
   G.8011.  This document is the UNI companion to "Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service
   Switching".  This document does not define or limit the underlying
   intra-domain or Internal NNI (I-NNI) technology used to support the
   UNI.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-MEF6">MEF6</a>] and [<a href="#ref-G.8011" title='"Ethernet over Transport Ethernet services framework"'>G.8011</a>] provide parallel frameworks for defining network-
   oriented characteristics of Ethernet services in transport networks.
   The framework discusses general Ethernet connection characteristics,
   Ethernet User Network Interfaces (UNIs), and Ethernet Network-Network
   Interfaces (NNIs).  Within this framework, [<a href="#ref-G.8011.1" title='"Ethernet private line service"'>G.8011.1</a>] defines the
   Ethernet Private Line (EPL) service and [<a href="#ref-G.8011.2" title='"Ethernet virtual private line service"'>G.8011.2</a>] defines the
   Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) service. [<a href="#ref-MEF6" title='"Ethernet Services Definitions - Phase I"'>MEF6</a>] covers both
   service types.  [<a href="#ref-MEF10.1" title='"Ethernet Services Attributes Phase 2"'>MEF10.1</a>] defines service parameters and [<a href="#ref-MEF11" title='"User Network Interface (UNI) Requirements and Framework"'>MEF11</a>]
   provides UNI requirements and framework.

   This document provides a method for GMPLS-based control of Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) that support the transport services defined in
   the above documents at the UNI network reference points.  This
   document does not define or limit the underlying intra-domain or
   Internal NNI (I-NNI) technology used to support the UNI.  This
   document makes use of the GMPLS extensions defined in [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc6002" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Data Channel Switching Capable (DCSC) and Channel Set Label Extensions"'>RFC6002</a>].

   The scope of this document covers Ethernet UNI applications, and it
   is intended to be consistent with the GMPLS overlay model presented
   in [<a href="./rfc4208" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User- Network Interface (UNI): Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Support for the Overlay Model"'>RFC4208</a>] and aligned with GMPLS Core Network signaling.  The
   scope and reference model used in this document are represented in
   Figure 1, which is based on Figure 1 of [<a href="./rfc4208" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User- Network Interface (UNI): Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Support for the Overlay Model"'>RFC4208</a>].

   Figure 1 shows two core networks, each containing two core nodes.
   The core nodes are labeled 'CN'.  Connected to each CN is an edge
   node.  The edge nodes are labeled 'EN'.  Each EN supports Ethernet
   Networks and use Ethernet services provided by the core nodes via a
   UNI.  Two services are represented: one EPL and one EVPL type
   service.  Signaling within the core network is out of scope of this
   document and may include any technology that supports overlay UNI
   services.  The UNI function in the edge node can be referred to as
   the UNI client, or UNI-C, and in the CN as UNI network, or UNI-N.

   This document uses a common approach to supporting the switching
   implied by the Ethernet services defined in [<a href="#ref-MEF6" title='"Ethernet Services Definitions - Phase I"'>MEF6</a>], [<a href="#ref-G.8011.1" title='"Ethernet private line service"'>G.8011.1</a>], and
   [<a href="#ref-G.8011.2" title='"Ethernet virtual private line service"'>G.8011.2</a>].  The approach builds on standard GMPLS mechanisms to
   deliver the required control capabilities.  This document reuses the
   GMPLS mechanisms specified in [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>], [<a href="./rfc4208" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User- Network Interface (UNI): Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Support for the Overlay Model"'>RFC4208</a>], and [<a href="./rfc4974" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE Signaling Extensions in Support of Calls"'>RFC4974</a>].

   Support for Point-to-Point (P2P) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP)
   service is required by [<a href="#ref-G.8011" title='"Ethernet over Transport Ethernet services framework"'>G.8011</a>] and [<a href="#ref-MEF11" title='"User Network Interface (UNI) Requirements and Framework"'>MEF11</a>].  P2P service delivery
   support is based on the GMPLS support for Ethernet services covered
   in [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>].  As with [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>], the definition of support for MP2MP
   service is left for future study and is not addressed in this
   document.

   [<a id="ref-MEF11">MEF11</a>] defines multiple types of control for UNI Ethernet services.
   In MEF UNI Type 1, services are configured manually.  In MEF UNI Type
   2, services may be configured manually or via a link management
   interface.  In MEF UNI Type 3, services may be established and

   managed via a signaling interface.  As with [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>], this document
   is aimed at supporting the MEF UNI Type 3 mode of operation (and not
   MEF UNI Types 1 and 2).  As mentioned above, this document is limited
   to covering UNI-specific topics.

   Common procedures used to signal Ethernet connections are described
   in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document.  Procedures related to signaling
   switching in support of EPL services are described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.
   Procedures related to signaling switching in support of EVPL services
   are described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   This section describes the common mechanisms for supporting a UNI
   reference point for LSPs that provide the Ethernet Services described
   in [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>].

   Except as specifically modified in this document, the procedures
   related to the processing of Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)
   objects is not modified by this document.  The relevant procedures in
   existing documents, notably [<a href="./rfc6002" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Data Channel Switching Capable (DCSC) and Channel Set Label Extensions"'>RFC6002</a>], [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>], [<a href="./rfc4208" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User- Network Interface (UNI): Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Support for the Overlay Model"'>RFC4208</a>], and
   [<a href="./rfc4974" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE Signaling Extensions in Support of Calls"'>RFC4974</a>], MUST be followed in all cases not explicitly described in
   this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20UNI%20Addressing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  UNI Addressing</span>

   LSPs providing Ethernet connections controlled via the mechanisms
   defined in this document MUST use the addressing and other procedures
   defined in [<a href="./rfc4208" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User- Network Interface (UNI): Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Support for the Overlay Model"'>RFC4208</a>].  Of note, this includes the use of the egress
   edge node's IP address in the endpoint address field in the SESSION
   object.

   One issue that presents itself with the addressing approach taken in
   [<a href="./rfc4208" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User- Network Interface (UNI): Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Support for the Overlay Model"'>RFC4208</a>] is that an ingress edge node may not receive the egress
   edge node's IP address as part of the management, or other, request
   that results in the initiation of a new Ethernet connection.  This
   case is covered as described in <a href="./rfc4974#section-7.2">Section 7.2 of [RFC4974]</a> and modified
   below in <a href="#section-2.2.1">Section 2.2.1</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Ethernet%20Endpoint%20%28UNI%29%20Identification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Ethernet Endpoint (UNI) Identification</span>

   UNI identification, except as noted below, MUST follow Ethernet
   endpoint (UNI) identification as defined in [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>].  There is one
   additional case that is covered in this document where the scope of
   the Ethernet endpoint identifier is relevant beyond the typical case
   of just ingress and egress nodes.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.1.%20%20Address%20Resolution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" id="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  Address Resolution</span>

   At the UNI reference point, it is possible for the ingress edge node
   to not have the egress edge node's IP address when initiating an LSP.
   This presents an issue as the egress edge node's IP address is
   carried in the SESSION object.  This case is handled leveraging the
   approach described in <a href="./rfc4974#section-7.2">Section 7.2 of [RFC4974]</a> to address call ID
   assignment by the first core node.

   When an edge node (the UNI-C) initiates an LSP and it has the egress
   Ethernet endpoint identifier, but does not have its IP address, the
   edge node MUST create a Notify message as described in [<a href="./rfc4974" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE Signaling Extensions in Support of Calls"'>RFC4974</a>].
   The Notify message MUST include the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object with the
   Endpoint ID TLV defined [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>].  The tunnel endpoint address field
   of the SESSION object in the Notify message MUST be set to zero (0).
   The message MUST be addressed and sent to an address associated with
   the first core node.

   When a core node, i.e., the node providing the network side of the
   UNI (the UNI-N), receives a Notify message with the tunnel endpoint
   address field of the SESSION object set to zero, it MUST locate the
   Endpoint ID TLV in the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object.  If the object or TLV
   are not present, the node MUST discard the message.  In this case, a
   Message ID Acknowledgment MUST NOT be sent for the Notify message.

   When the Endpoint ID TLV is located, the node MUST map the Endpoint
   ID into an IP address associated with the egress edge node.  If the
   node is unable to obtain an egress address, it MUST issue an error
   response Notify messages according to <a href="./rfc4974#section-6.2.2">Section 6.2.2. of [RFC4974]</a>.
   The Error code and value SHOULD be "Routing Problem/Unknown Endpoint"
   (Error code 24, Error value 35).

   When the node is able to obtain an egress address, the endpoint
   address field of the SESSION object MUST be set to the obtained
   address, and the Notify message should be sent according to the
   standard processing defined in [<a href="./rfc4974" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE Signaling Extensions in Support of Calls"'>RFC4974</a>].  The downstream nodes will
   then process the Notify according to standard processing rules.

   When the ingress receives the response Notify message, it SHOULD
   identify the call based on the Endpoint ID TLV and, when not set to
   zero on the corresponding setup Notify message, the short and long
   Call IDs.  The endpoint address field of the SESSION object carried
   in the response Notify message will include the egress's IP address.
   This returned address MUST be used in all subsequent messages
   associated with the Ethernet connection.

   Note that the procedure described in this section MAY be used when
   the Call IDs are generated by the initiating UNI or generated by the
   first core node.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.3.%20%20Connection%20Identification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" id="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Connection Identification</span>

   With one exception, UNI signaling for Ethernet connections MUST
   follow the Connection Identification procedures defined in [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>].
   The exception is that the procedures defined in <a href="./rfc4974#section-7.2">Section 7.2 of
   [RFC4974]</a> MAY be used to provide support for allocation of Call IDs
   by the first core node rather than by the initiating edge node.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20EPL%20Service"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  EPL Service</span>

   There are no additional UNI-specific requirements for signaling LSPs
   supporting Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services.  The procedures
   defined in [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>], as modified above, MUST be followed when
   signaling an LSPs supporting an EPL Service.

   There is one additional UNI-specific requirement for signaling LSPs
   supporting an EVPL type service as described in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.  Except
   as modified above and by this section, the procedures defined in
   [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>] MUST be followed when signaling an EVPL Service.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20Egress%20VLAN%20ID%20Control%20and%20VLAN%20ID%20Preservation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Egress VLAN ID Control and VLAN ID Preservation</span>

   Per [<a href="#ref-MEF6" title='"Ethernet Services Definitions - Phase I"'>MEF6</a>], the mapping of the single VLAN ID used at the ingress UNI
   to a different VLAN ID at the egress UNI is allowed for EVPL services
   that do not support both bundling and VLAN ID preservation.  Such a
   mapping MUST be requested and signaled based on the explicit label
   control mechanism defined in [<a href="./rfc4208" title='"Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User- Network Interface (UNI): Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Support for the Overlay Model"'>RFC4208</a>], and not the mechanisms
   defined in [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>].

   As is the case in [<a href="./rfc6004" title='"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Support for Metro Ethernet Forum and G.8011 Ethernet Service Switching"'>RFC6004</a>], when the explicit label control
   mechanism is not used VLAN IDs MUST be preserved, i.e., not modified,
   across the LSP.
