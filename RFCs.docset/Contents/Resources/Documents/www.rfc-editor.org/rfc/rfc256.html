                       <span class="h1">IMPSYS Change Notification</span>

        We will shortly install (or perhaps will have already
   installed) a new version of the IMP system, Version 2513.  The
   new version incorporates two principal changes:

     1.  A Host will be prevented from sending any messages
         into the Network for between 40 seconds and a
         minute and a quarter after he comes alive (this
         has been changed from between 30 seconds and a
         minute).

     2.  The IMP has been given the ability to test its Host
         interfaces under control of the NCC.  This will help
         us isolate the trouble when the IMP Host communication
         path is faulty.
