           <span class="h1">A Telephony Gateway REgistration Protocol (TGREP)</span>

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document describes the Telephony Gateway Registration Protocol
   (TGREP) for registration of telephony prefixes supported by telephony
   gateways and soft switches.  The registration mechanism can also be
   used to export resource information.  The prefix and resource
   information can then be passed on to a Telephony Routing over IP
   (TRIP) Location Server, which in turn can propagate that routing
   information within and between Internet Telephony Administrative
   Domains (ITADs).  TGREP shares a lot of similarities with the TRIP
   protocol.  It has similar procedures and finite state machine for
   session establishment.  It also shares the same format for messages
   and a subset of attributes with TRIP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   It is assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with TRIP
   [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>, <a href="#ref-12" title='"A Framework for Telephony Routing over IP"'>12</a>].  In typical Voice over IP (VoIP) networks, Internet
   Telephony Administrative Domains (ITADs) will deploy numerous
   gateways for the purposes of geographical diversity, capacity, and
   redundancy.  When a call arrives at the domain, it must be routed to
   one of those gateways.  Frequently, an ITAD will break its network
   into geographic Points of Presence (POPs), with each POP containing
   some number of gateways, and a proxy server element that fronts those
   gateways.  The proxy element is a SIP proxy [<a href="#ref-11" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>11</a>] or H.323 gatekeeper.
   The proxy server is responsible for managing the access to the POP,
   and also for determining which of the gateways will receive any given
   call that arrives at the POP.  In conjunction with the proxy server
   that routes the call signaling, there are two components, the
   "Ingress LS" (aka "TGREP receiver") and the "Egress LS".  The TGREP
   receiver component maintains TGREP peering relationship with one or
   more gateways.  The routing information received from the gateways is
   further injected into the Egress LS, which in turn disseminates into
   the rest of the network on TRIP.  For convenience, gateway and GW are
   used interchangeably.

   This configuration is depicted graphically in Figure 1.

                  Figure 1: Gateway and LS Configuration

   The decision about which gateway to use depends on many factors,
   including their availability, remaining call capacity, and call
   success statistics to a particular Public Switched Telephone Network
   (PSTN) destination (see [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Requirements for Gateway Registration"'>14</a>]).  For the proxy to do this adequately,
   it needs to have access to this information in real-time, as it
   changes.  This means there must be some kind of communications
   between the proxy and the gateways to convey this information.

   The TRIP protocol [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>] is defined for carrying telephony routing
   information between providers, for the purposes of getting a call
   routed to the right provider for termination to the PSTN.  However,
   there is no mechanism defined in TRIP that defines how routes get
   injected into the TRIP protocol from within the network.  Nor does it




<span class="grey">Bangalore, et al.           Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5140">RFC 5140</a>                         TGREP                        March 2008</span>


   define mechanisms that would allow the provider to select the
   specific gateway for terminating a call when it arrives.  Those gaps
   are filled by TGREP.

   TGREP allows PSTN gateways or soft switches to inform a signaling
   server, such as a SIP proxy server or H.323 gatekeeper, of routes it
   has to the PSTN.  These advertisements include fairly dynamic
   information, such as the remaining capacity in a particular trunk,
   which is essential for selecting the right gateway.

   TGREP is identical in syntax and overall operation to TRIP.  However,
   it differs in the route processing rules followed by the TGREP
   receiver, allowing for a route processing function called
   "consolidation".  Consolidation combines multiple routes for the same
   route destination with different attributes to a single route to
   prevent loss of routing information.  TGREP also defines a set of new
   attributes, usable by TGREP or TRIP.  Finally, TGREP only utilizes a
   subset of overall TRIP capabilities.  Specifically, certain
   attributes are not utilized (as described below), and the TGREP
   entities (the sender and receiver) operate in an asymmetric
   relationship, whereas TRIP allows symmetric and asymmetric.

   As a general rule, because of a lot of similarities between TRIP and
   TGREP, frequent reference will be made to the terminologies and
   formats defined in TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>].  It is suggested that the reader be
   familiar with the concepts of TRIP like attributes, flags, route
   types, address families, etc.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>1</a>].

   Some other useful definitions are:

   Circuit: A circuit is a discrete (specific) path between two or more
   points along which signals can be carried.  In this context, a
   circuit is a physical path, consisting of one or more wires and
   possibly intermediate switching points.

   Trunk: In a network, a trunk is a communication path connecting two
   switching systems used in the establishment of an end-to-end
   connection.  In selected applications, it may have both its
   terminations in the same switching system.

   TrunkGroup: A trunkgroup is a set of trunks, traffic engineered as a
   unit, for the establishment of connections within or between
   switching systems in which all of the paths are interchangeable
   except where subgrouped.

   Carrier: A carrier is a company offering telephone and data
   communications between points (end-users and/or exchanges).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20TGREP%3A%20Overview%20of%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  TGREP: Overview of Operation</span>

   TGREP is a route registration protocol for telephony destinations on
   a gateway.  These telephony destinations could be prefixes,
   trunkgroups, or carriers.  The TGREP sender resides on the GW and
   gathers all the information from the GW to relay to the TRIP Location
   Server.  A TGREP Receiver is defined, which receives this information
   and optionally performs operations like consolidation and aggregation
   (see <a href="#section-7.3">Section 7.3</a>), and hands over the reachability information to a
   TRIP Location Server.  The routing proxy also uses the information to
   select the gateway for incoming calls.

   The TGREP sender establishes a session to the TGREP receiver using a
   procedure similar to session establishment in TRIP.  After the
   session establishment, the TGREP sender sends the reachability
   information in the UPDATE messages.  The UPDATE messages have the
   same format as in TRIP.  However, certain TRIP attributes are not
   relevant in TGREP; a TGREP receiver MAY ignore them if they are
   present in a TGREP message.  The following TRIP attributes do not
   apply to TGREP:

      1. AdvertisementPath
      2. RoutedPath
      3. AtomicAggregate
      4. LocalPreference
      5. MultiExitDisc
      6. ITADTopology
      7. ConvertedRoute

   In addition, TGREP defines the following new attributes in this
   document that can be carried in a TGREP UPDATE message.

      - TotalCircuitCapacity: This attribute identifies the total number
        of PSTN circuits that are available on a route to complete
        calls.

      - AvailableCircuits: This attribute identifies the number of PSTN
        circuits that are currently available on a route to complete
        calls.

      - CallSuccess: This attribute represents information about the
        number of normally terminated calls out of a total number of
        attempted calls.

      - Prefix (E164): This attribute is used to represent the list of
        E164 prefixes to which the respective route can complete calls.

      - Prefix (Decimal Routing Number): This attribute is used to
        represent the list of Decimal prefixes to which the respective
        route can complete calls.

      - Prefix (Hexadecimal Routing Number): This attribute is used to
        represent the list of Hexadecimal prefixes to which the
        respective route can complete calls.

      - TrunkGroup: This attribute enables providers to route calls to
        destinations through preferred trunks.

      - Carrier: This attribute enables providers to route calls to
        destinations through preferred carriers.

   In the rest of the document, we specify attributes and address
   families used in TGREP.  The new attributes and address families
   introduced are also applicable for general usage in TRIP except where
   noted (AvailableCircuits attribute, for example).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20TGREP%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  TGREP Attributes</span>

   Due to its usage within a service provider network, TGREP makes use
   of a subset of the attributes defined for TRIP, in addition to
   defining several new ones.  In particular, the following attributes
   from TRIP are applicable to TGREP:

      1. WithdrawnRoutes
      2. ReachableRoutes
      3. NexthopServer
      4. Prefix
      5. Communities

   TGREP also defines several new attributes, described in this section.
   These are TotalCircuitCapacity, AvailableCircuits, CallSuccess,
   TrunkGroup, and Carrier.  As mentioned above, these new attributes
   are usable by TRIP unless noted otherwise.

   A TGREP UPDATE supports the following attributes:

      1. TotalCircuitCapacity
      2. AvailableCircuits
      3. CallSuccess
      4. Prefix (E.164, Pentadecimal routing number, Decimal routing
         number)
      5. TrunkGroup
      6. Carrier

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20TotalCircuitCapacity%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  TotalCircuitCapacity Attribute</span>

   Mandatory: False.
   Required Flags: Not well-known.
   Potential Flags: None.
   TRIP Type Code: 13.

   The TotalCircuitCapacity attribute identifies the total number of
   PSTN circuits that are available on a route to complete calls.  It is
   used in conjunction with the AvailableCircuits attribute in gateway
   selection by the LS.  The total number of calls sent to the specified
   route on the gateway cannot exceed this total circuit capacity under
   steady state conditions.

   The TotalCircuitCapacity attribute is used to reflect the
   administratively provisioned capacity as opposed to the availability
   at a given point in time as provided by the AvailableCircuits
   attribute.  Because of its relatively static nature, this attribute
   MAY be propagated beyond the LS that receives it.

   TotalCircuitCapacity represents the total number of possible calls at
   any instant.  This is not expected to change frequently.  This can
   change, for instance, when certain telephony trunks on the gateway
   are taken out of service for maintenance purposes.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.1.%20%20TotalCircuitCapacity%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1" id="section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  TotalCircuitCapacity Syntax</span>

   The TotalCircuitCapacity attribute is a 4-octet unsigned integer.  It
   represents the total number of circuits available for terminating
   calls through this advertised route.  This attribute represents a

   The TotalCircuitCapacity attribute MAY be used for route selection.
   Since one of its primary applications is load balancing, an LS will
   wish to choose a potentially different route (amongst a set of routes
   for the same destination), on a call-by-call basis.  This can be
   modeled as re-running the decision process on the arrival of each
   call.  The aggregation and dissemination rules for routes with this
   attribute ensure that re-running this selection process never results
   in propagation of a new route to other peers.

   The CallSuccess attribute is an attribute used ONLY between a gateway

   The CallSuccess attribute provides information about the number of
   normally terminated calls out of a total number of attempted calls.

   CallSuccess is to be determined by the gateway based on the
   Disconnect cause code at call termination.  For example, a call that
   reaches the Alerting stage but does not get connected due to the

   unavailability of the called party, or the called party being busy,
   is conventionally considered a successful call.  On the other hand, a
   call that gets disconnected because of a circuit or resource being
   unavailable is conventionally considered a failed call.  The exact
   mapping of disconnect causes to CallSuccess is at the discretion of
   the gateway reporting the attribute.

   The CallSuccess attribute is used by the LS to keep track of failures
   in reaching certain telephony destinations through a gateway(s) and
   to use that information in the gateway selection process to enhance
   the probability of successful call termination.

   This information can be used by the LS to consider alternative
   gateways to terminate calls to those destinations with a better
   likelihood of success.

   The CallSuccess attribute is composed of two component fields -- each
   represented as a 4-octet unsigned integer.  The first component field
   represents the total number of calls terminated successfully for the
   advertised destination on a given address family over a given window
   of time.  The second component field represents the total number of
   attempted calls for the advertised destination within the same window
   of time.

   When the value for the total number of attempted calls wraps around,
   the counter value for the number of successful calls is reset to keep
   it aligned with the other component over a given window of time.  The
   TGREP receiver using this information should obtain this information
   frequently enough to prevent loss of significance.

   As described in TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>], the Address Family field gives the type of
   address for the route.  Two new address families and their codes are
   defined in this section:

               Code              Address Family
               4                 TrunkGroup
               5                 Carrier

   When a set of GWs is to be managed at the granularity of carriers or
   trunkgroups, then it may be more appropriate for a GW to advertise
   routes using the Carrier address family or TrunkGroup address family,
   respectively.  Also, in a TGREP association between the gateway and
   the LS responsible for managing that gateway, there are some
   attributes that more naturally fit in as advertised properties of
   trunkgroups or carriers rather than that of advertised prefixes, for
   example, the AvailableCircuit information on a particular trunkgroup
   or a particular carrier.  To express this relationship, the existing
   TRIP address families are inadequate.  We need separate address
   families that can associate certain properties like AvailableCircuits
   information to trunkgroups or carriers.

   The primary benefits of this model are as follows:

   - It allows a service provider to route calls based strictly on the
     trunkgroups or carriers.

   - It facilitates more accurate reporting of attributes of a dynamic
     nature like AvailableCircuits by providing the ability to manage
     resources at the granularity of a trunkgroup or a carrier.

   - It enables scalability as gateways can get really large with the
     ability to provision hundreds or a few thousand circuits, and this
     can increase the potential for traffic that reports dynamic
     resource information between the gateway and the LS.  The model
     introduced can potentially alleviate this UPDATE traffic, hence
     increasing efficiency and providing a scalable gateway registration
     model.

   Consider the generic TRIP route format from TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>] shown below.

                    Figure 5: Generic TRIP Route Format

   The Address Family field will be used to represent the type of the
   address associated for this family, which is based on the TrunkGroup
   or Carrier.  The codes for the new address families have been
   allocated by IANA.

   The code for the TrunkGroup address family is 4, and the code for the
   Carrier address family is 5.

   The Application Protocol field is the same as the one for the
   Decimal, Pentadecimal, and E.164 address families defined in TRIP
   [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>].  The Length field represents the total size of the Address field
   in bytes.

   The value in the Address field represents either the TrunkGroup or
   Carrier address family, and the syntax is as follows:

   For the TrunkGroup address family, the Address field represents a
   TrunkGroup value that is defined as specified in <a href="#section-4.5.1">Section 4.5.1</a>,
   "TrunkGroup Syntax".

   For the Carrier address family, the Address field represents a
   Carrier value.  This is the same as the Value field specified in an
   earlier <a href="#section-4.6.1">Section 4.6.1</a>, "Carrier Syntax".

   The above mentioned address families are not hierarchical, but flat.
   If a gateway supports any of these address families, it should
   include that address family as one of the Route types supported in
   the OPEN message capability negotiation phase.

   The following attributes are currently defined to be used with all
   the address families including the TrunkGroup and Carrier address
   families.

     - AvailableCircuits attribute
     - TotalCircuitCapacity attribute
     - CallSuccess attribute

   It is recommended that the above three attributes be used by the
   gateway with the TrunkGroup or Carrier address family, if possible.
   This will potentially offer a more efficient resource reporting
   framework, and a scalable model for gateway provisioning.

   However, when the gateway is not using the TrunkGroup or Carrier
   address family, it MAY use the above attributes with the Decimal,
   Pentadecimal, and E.164 address families.

   The Prefix attribute cannot be used when the address family is E164
   numbers, Pentadecimal routing numbers, or Decimal routing numbers.

   The Carrier attribute cannot be used if the address family type is
   Carrier.

   The TrunkGroup attribute cannot be used if the address family type is
   TrunkGroup.

   A gateway uses TGREP to advertise its reachability to its domain's
   Location Server(s) (LS, which are closely coupled with proxies).  The
   gateway operates in TRIP Send Only mode since it is only interested
   in advertising its reachability, but is not interested in learning
   about the reachability of other gateways and other domains.  Also,
   the gateway will not create its own call routing database.  In this
   section, we describe the operation of TGREP on a gateway.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.1.%20%20Session%20Establishment"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" id="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Session Establishment</span>

   When opening a peering session with a TGREP receiver, a TGREP gateway
   follows exactly the same procedures as any other TRIP entity.  The
   TGREP gateway sends an OPEN message that includes a Send Receive
   Capability in the Optional Parameters.  The Send Receive Capability

   is set by the gateway to Send Only.  The OPEN message also contains
   the address families supported by the gateway.  The remainder of the
   peer session establishment is identical to TRIP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20UPDATE%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  UPDATE Messages</span>

   Once the peer session has been established, the gateway sends UPDATE
   messages to the TRIP LS with the gateway's entire reachability.  The
   gateway also sends any attributes associated with the routes.

   TGREP processing of the UPDATE message at the gateway is identical to
   UPDATE processing in TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>].  A TGREP sender MUST support all
   mandatory TRIP attributes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.3.%20%20KEEPALIVE%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" id="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  KEEPALIVE Messages</span>

   KEEPALIVE messages are periodically exchanged over the peering
   session between the TGREP gateway and the TRIP LS as specified in
   <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a> of TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>].

   The same procedures used with TRIP are used with TGREP for error
   handling and generating NOTIFICATION messages.  The only difference
   is that a TGREP gateway will never generate a NOTIFICATION message in
   response to an UPDATE message, irrespective of the contents of the
   UPDATE message.  Any UPDATE message is silently discarded.

   When the TGREP finite state machine is in the Established state and
   an UPDATE message is received, the UPDATE message is silently
   discarded and the TGREP gateway remains in the Established state.
   Other than that, the TRIP finite state machine and the TGREP finite
   state machine are identical.

   A TGREP gateway may maintain simultaneous sessions with more than one
   TRIP LS.  A TGREP gateway maintains one call routing database per
   peer TRIP LS.  These databases are equivalent to TRIP's Adj-TRIBs-
   Out, and hence we will call them Adj-TRIBs-GW-Out.  An Adj-TRIB-GW-
   Out contains the gateway's reachability information advertised to its
   peer TRIP LS.  How an Adj-TRIB-GW-Out database gets populated is
   outside the scope of this document (possibly by manual
   configuration).

   The TGREP gateway does not have databases equivalent to TRIP's
   Adj-TRIBs-In and Loc-TRIB, because the TGREP gateway does not learn
   routes from its peer TRIP LSs, and hence it does not run call route
   selection.

   As mentioned above, TGREP supports various address families in order
   to convey the reachability of telephony destinations.  A TGREP
   session MUST NOT send UPDATEs of more than one of the following
   categories (a) Prefix address families (E164, Pentadecimal, and
   Decimal), (b) TrunkGroup address family, or (c) Carrier address
   family for a given established session.  TGREP should specify its
   choice address family through the route-type capability in the OPEN
   message.  And route-type specification in the OPEN message violating
   the above rule should be rejected with a NOTIFICATION message.

   As mentioned earlier, TGREP can be considered as a protocol
   complimentary to TRIP in providing reachability information, which
   can then be further fed into the Location Server.  The architecture
   of an LS/Proxy system is as follows: There exists a TRIP LS
   application that functions as a speaker in the I-TRIP/E-TRIP network
   as documented in TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>].  This component is termed as "Egress LS"
   for the purposes of this discussion.  Then, there is a signaling
   server fronting a set of gateways.  In conjunction with this
   signaling server is also a second component operating in receive
   mode, which peers with one or more gateways, each of them using TGREP
   to advertise routing information.  This component on the receiving
   end of one or more TGREP sessions is termed as the "Ingress LS" or
   "TGREP receiver" for the purposes of this discussion.  Also, the
   entity (typically, a gateway) advertising the routes on the TGREP
   session is termed as the "TGREP sender".  The TGREP receiver
   receiving the TRIP messages takes the resulting routing information
   from each gateway, and "exports" it to another process we define
   below, that performs consolidation and aggregation, in that order.
   These operations would take as input the collective set of routes
   from all the gateways.  Subsequently, the resulting TRIB is passed as
   input into the LS-Egress process as shown below, that can then
   disseminate these via TRIP.  The interface between the TGREP receiver
   (aka Ingress LS) peering with the GW(s) and the TRIP LS (Egress LS)
   is entirely a local matter.

   The nature of the consolidation and aggregation operations and the
   accompanying motivation are described in the subsections below.  The
   order in which the operations are listed represents an implicit
   logical sequence in which they are applied.  The architecture for an

   The TGREP receiver (Ingress LS) may receive routing information from
   one or more gateways.  It is possible that multiple routes are
   available for the same destination.  These different alternative
   routes may be received from the same gateway or from multiple
   gateways.  It is RECOMMENDED that the set of gateway routes for each
   destination be consolidated, before presenting a candidate route, to
   the Egress LS entity.  The motivation for this operation should be to
   define a route that can maximally represent the collective routing
   capabilities of the set of gateways, managed by this TGREP receiver.
   Let us take an example scenario in order to bring out the motivation
   for this operation.  Let us say, the TGREP receiver maintains peering
   sessions with gateways A and B.

     - Gateway A advertises a route for destination "SIP 408" on the
       E.164 address family with the Carrier attribute value C1.

     - Gateway B advertises a route for destination "SIP 408" on the
       E.164 address family with Carrier attribute value C2.

   The TGREP receiver that receives these routes can consolidate these
   constituent routes into a single route for destination "SIP 408" with
   its Carrier attribute being a union of the Carrier attribute values
   of the individual routes, namely, "C1 C2".  This operation is
   referred to as consolidation.  In the above example, it is possible
   that a route to the destination "SIP 408" through one or more
   carriers may have been lost if the individual routes were not
   consolidated.

   Another example is to consolidate the Prefix attribute from multiple
   Carrier or TrunkGroup updates received from different gateways for
   the same destination.  Let us say, there are Carrier address family
   (AF) updates from two gateways for Carrier destination X, and the
   prefix attribute values are {408, 650} from one update and {919, 973}
   from the other.  The prefix values from these two updates can be
   consolidated into a single Carrier AF route advertisement with prefix
   value {408, 650, 919, 973}.

   In general, there is a potential for loss of gateway routing
   information when TGREP routes from a set of gateways are not
   consolidated when a candidate route is presented to the TRIP LS.  The
   specifics of applying the consolidation operation to different
   attributes and routes from different address families is left to the
   individual TGREP receiver implementations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.2.%20%20Aggregation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" id="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Aggregation</span>

   The set of gateway routes, which are in a consolidated form or
   otherwise, may be aggregated before importing it to the LS instance
   that is responsible for I-TRIP/E-TRIP processing (Egress LS).  This
   operation follows the standard aggregation procedures described in
   TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>], while adhering to the aggregation rules for each route
   attribute.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.3.%20%20Consolidation%20versus%20Aggregation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3" id="section-7.3">7.3</a>.  Consolidation versus Aggregation</span>

   To highlight the difference between the two operations discussed
   above, "consolidation" combines multiple routes for the same route
   destination, whereas "aggregation" combines routes for different
   route destinations that qualify as candidates to be summarized
   resulting in route information reduction.

   To take an example, if there are multiple gateways offering routes to
   an E.164 destination "408" but with possibly different attributes
   (e.g., Carrier), the LS/Proxy can combine these to form one route for
   "408" but representing the attribute information collectively.  This
   process is consolidation.

   If, for example, the LS/Proxy receives routes for 4080, 4081, 4082,
   ...  4089 from amongst a set of gateways, it could aggregate these
   different candidate routes to have a summarized route destination
   "408" with each of the attributes computed using the aggregation
   procedures defined in TRIP.

   The security considerations for TGREP are identical to that
   identified in TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>] and are just restated here for the purposes of
   clarity.

   The security mechanism for the peering session between TGREP GW and a
   TRIP LS, in an IP network, is IPsec [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>3</a>].  IPsec uses two protocols to
   provide traffic security: Authentication Header (AH) [<a href="#ref-6" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>6</a>] and
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [<a href="#ref-7" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>7</a>].

   The AH header affords data origin authentication, connectionless
   integrity, and optional anti-replay protection of messages passed
   between the peer LSs.  The ESP header provides origin authentication,
   connectionless integrity, anti-replay protection, and confidentiality
   of messages.

   Implementations of the protocol defined in this document employing
   the ESP header SHALL comply with Section 3.1.1 of [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH)"'>10</a>], which defines
   a minimum set of algorithms for integrity checking and encryption.
   Similarly, implementations employing the AH header SHALL comply with
   Section 3.2 of [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH)"'>10</a>], which defines a minimum set of algorithms for
   integrity checking.

   Implementations SHOULD use the Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKEv2)
   [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol"'>9</a>] to permit more robust keying options.  Implementations employing
   IKEv2 SHOULD support 3DES-CBC for confidentiality and HMAC-SHA1 for
   integrity.

   A Security Association (SA) [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>3</a>] is a simplex "connection" that
   affords security services to the traffic carried by it.  Security
   services are afforded to an SA by the use of AH or ESP, but not both.
   Two types of SAs are defined: transport mode and tunnel mode.  A
   transport mode SA is a security association between two hosts, and is
   appropriate for protecting the TRIP session between two peer LSs.

   Both TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>] and TGREP share the same IANA registry for
   Capabilities, Attributes, Address Families, and Application
   Protocols.  IANA has added the following attribute codes and address
   family codes to the TRIP [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP)"'>2</a>] registries.
