Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent Facility and
   Severity information commonly used in syslog messages.  The intent is
   that these textual conventions will be imported and used in MIB
   modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="./rfc3410#section-7">sectionÂ 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="./rfc3410" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2580" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Background</span>

   Operating systems, processes, and applications, collectively termed
   "Facilities" in the following, generate messages indicating their own
   status or the occurrence of events.  These messages have come to be
   known as syslog messages.  A syslog message in general will contain
   among other things a code representing the Facility that generated
   the message and a code representing the Severity of the message.  The
   Facility and the Severity codes are commonly used to categorize and
   select received syslog messages for processing and display.  The
   Facility codes have been useful in qualifying the originator of the
   content of the messages but in some cases they are not specific
   enough to explicitly identify the originator.  Implementations of the
   syslog protocol [<a href="./rfc5424" title='"The Syslog Protocol"'>RFC5424</a>] that contain structured data elements
   (SDEs) should use these SDEs to clarify the entity that originated
   the content of the message.

   This document defines a set of textual conventions (TCs) that can be
   used to represent Facility and Severity codes commonly used in syslog
   messages.

   SyslogFacility  ::=  TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
           "This textual convention enumerates the Facilities that
            originate syslog messages.

            The Facilities of syslog messages are numerically coded
            with decimal values.  For interoperability and backwards-
            compatibility reasons, this document specifies a
            normative mapping between a label, which represents a
            Facility, and the corresponding numeric value.  This label
            could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager user
            interfaces.




<span class="grey">Keeni                       Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5427">RFC 5427</a>                     Syslog MIB-TC                    March 2009</span>


            The label itself is often semantically meaningless
            because it is impractical to attempt to enumerate all
            possible Facilities, and many daemons and processes do
            not have an explicitly assigned Facility code or label.
            For example, there is no Facility label corresponding to
            an HTTP service.  An HTTP service implementation might log
            messages as coming from, for example, 'local7' or 'uucp'.
            This is typical current practice, and originators, relays,
            and collectors can be configured to properly handle this
            situation.  For improved accuracy, an application can also
            include an APP-NAME structured data element.

            Note that operating system mechanisms for configuring
            syslog, such as syslog.conf, have not yet been standardized
            and might use different sets of Facility labels and/or
            mapping between Facility labels and Facility codes than the
            MIB.

            In particular, the labels corresponding to Facility codes 4,
            10, 13, and 14, and the code corresponding to the Facility
            label 'cron' are known to vary across different operating
            systems.  To distinguish between the labels corresponding
            to Facility codes 9 and 15, a label of 'cron2' is assigned
            to the Facility code 15.  This list is not intended to be
            exhaustive; other differences might exist, and new
            differences might be introduced in the future.

            The mapping specified here MUST be used in a MIB network
            management interface, even though a particular syslog
            implementation might use a different mapping in a
            different network management interface.

   SyslogSeverity  ::=  TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
           "This textual convention enumerates the Severity levels
            of syslog messages.

            The Severity levels of syslog messages are numerically
            coded with decimal values.  For interoperability and
            backwards-compatibility reasons, this document specifies
            a normative mapping between a label, which represents a
            Severity level, and the corresponding numeric value.
            This label could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager
            user interfaces.

            The label itself is often semantically meaningless
            because it is impractical to attempt to strictly define
            the criteria for each Severity level, and the criteria
            that is used by syslog originators is, and has
            historically been, implementation-dependent.

            Note that operating system mechanisms for configuring
            syslog, such as syslog.conf, have not yet been standardized
            and might use different sets of Severity labels and/or
            mapping between Severity labels and Severity codes than the
            MIB.

            For example, the foobar application might log messages as
            'crit' based on some subjective criteria.  Yet the operator
            can configure syslog to forward these messages, even though
            the criteria for 'crit' may differ from one originator to
            another.  This is typical current practice, and originators,
            relays, and collectors can be configured to properly handle
            this situation.

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.  Meaningful security
   considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define
   management objects.  This document has therefore no impact on the
   security of the Internet.  Since objects defined using the TCs
   defined in this document may introduce security issues, the user of
   these TCs should read the security considerations section of
   [<a href="./rfc5424" title='"The Syslog Protocol"'>RFC5424</a>].
