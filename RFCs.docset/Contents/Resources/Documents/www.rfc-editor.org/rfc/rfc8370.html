      <span class="h1">Techniques to Improve the Scalability of RSVP-TE Deployments</span>

Abstract

   Networks that utilize RSVP-TE LSPs are encountering implementations
   that have a limited ability to support the growth in the number of
   LSPs deployed.

   This document defines two techniques, Refresh-Interval Independent
   RSVP (RI-RSVP) and Per-Peer Flow Control, that reduce the number of
   processing cycles required to maintain RSVP-TE LSP state in Label
   Switching Routers (LSRs) and hence allow implementations to support
   larger scale deployments.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Networks that utilize RSVP-TE [<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>] LSPs are encountering
   implementations that have a limited ability to support the growth in
   the number of LSPs deployed.

   The set of RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction procedures [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>]
   serves as a powerful toolkit for RSVP-TE implementations to help
   cover a majority of the concerns about soft-state scaling.  However,
   even with these tools in the toolkit, analysis of existing
   implementations [<a href="./rfc5439" title='"An Analysis of Scaling Issues in MPLS-TE Core Networks"'>RFC5439</a>] indicates that the processing required
   beyond a certain scale may still cause significant disruption to a
   Label Switching Router (LSR).

   This document builds on existing scaling work and analysis and
   defines protocol extensions to help RSVP-TE deployments push the
   envelope further on scaling by increasing the threshold above which
   an LSR struggles to achieve sufficient processing to maintain LSP
   state.

   This document defines two techniques, Refresh-Interval Independent
   RSVP (RI-RSVP) and Per-Peer Flow Control, that cut down the number of
   processing cycles required to maintain LSP state.  RI-RSVP helps
   completely eliminate RSVP's reliance on refreshes and refresh
   timeouts, while Per-Peer Flow Control enables a busy RSVP speaker to
   apply back pressure to its peer(s).  This document defines a unique
   RSVP Capability [<a href="./rfc5063" title='"Extensions to GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Graceful Restart"'>RFC5063</a>] for each technique (support for the
   CAPABILITY object is a prerequisite for implementing these
   techniques).  Note that the Per-Peer Flow-Control technique requires
   the RI-RSVP technique as a prerequisite.  In order to reap maximum
   scaling benefits, it is strongly recommended that implementations
   support both techniques and have them enabled by default.  Both
   techniques are fully backward compatible and can be deployed
   incrementally.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP</a>

   capitals, as shown here.

   The techniques defined in Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a> and <a href="#section-4">4</a> are based on proposals
   made in [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>].  Implementations of these techniques need to
   support the RSVP messages and procedures defined in [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>] with
   some minor modifications and alterations to recommended time
   intervals and iteration counts (see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> for the set of
   recommended defaults).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Required%20Functionality%20from%20RFC%202961"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Required Functionality from <a href="./rfc2961">RFC 2961</a></span>

   An implementation that supports the techniques discussed in Sections
   3 and 4 must support the functionality described in [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>] as
   follows:

   o  It MUST indicate support for RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction
      extensions (as specified in <a href="./rfc2961#section-2">Section 2 of [RFC2961]</a>).

   o  It MUST support receipt of any RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction
      message as defined in [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>].

   o  It MUST initiate all RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction mechanisms as
      defined in [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>] (including the SRefresh message) with the
      default behavior being to initiate the mechanisms; however, a
      configuration override should be offered.

   o  It MUST support reliable delivery of Path/Resv and the
      corresponding Tear/Err messages (as specified in <a href="./rfc2961#section-4">Section 4 of
      [RFC2961]</a>).

   o  It MUST support retransmission of all unacknowledged RSVP-TE
      messages using exponential backoff (as specified in <a href="./rfc2961#section-6">Section 6 of
      [RFC2961]</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Making%20Acknowledgements%20Mandatory"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Making Acknowledgements Mandatory</span>

   The reliable message delivery mechanism specified in [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>] states
   that "Nodes receiving a non-out of order [sic] message containing a
   MESSAGE_ID object with the ACK_Desired flag set, SHOULD respond with
   a MESSAGE_ID_ACK object."

   In an implementation that supports the techniques discussed in
   Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a> and <a href="#section-4">4</a>, nodes receiving a non-out-of-order message
   containing a MESSAGE_ID object with the ACK_Desired flag set MUST
   respond with a MESSAGE_ID_ACK object.  This MESSAGE_ID_ACK object can
   be packed with other MESSAGE_ID_ACK or MESSAGE_ID_NACK objects and
   sent in an Ack message (or piggybacked in any other RSVP message).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8370">RFC 8370</a>              RSVP-TE Scaling - Techniques              May 2018</span>


   This improvement to the predictability of the system in terms of
   reliable message delivery is key for being able to take any action
   based on a non-receipt of an ACK.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Refresh-Interval%20Independent%20RSVP%20%28RI-RSVP%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Refresh-Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP)</span>

   The RSVP protocol relies on periodic refreshes for state
   synchronization between RSVP neighbors and recovery from lost RSVP
   messages.  It relies on a refresh timeout for stale-state cleanup.
   The primary motivation behind introducing the notion of Refresh-
   Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP) is to completely eliminate RSVP's
   reliance on refreshes and refresh timeouts.  This is done by simply
   increasing the refresh interval to a fairly large value.  [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>]
   and [<a href="./rfc5439" title='"An Analysis of Scaling Issues in MPLS-TE Core Networks"'>RFC5439</a>] talk about increasing the value of the refresh interval
   to provide linear improvement of transmission overhead, but they also
   point out the degree of functionality that is lost by doing so.  This
   section revisits this notion, but also sets out additional
   requirements to make sure that there is no loss of functionality
   incurred by increasing the value of the refresh interval.

   An implementation that supports RI-RSVP:

   o  MUST support all of the requirements specified in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.

   o  MUST make the default value of the configurable refresh interval
      (R) be a large value (tens of minutes).  A default value of 20
      minutes is RECOMMENDED by this document.

   o  MUST use a separate shorter refresh interval for refreshing state
      associated with unacknowledged Path/Resv (uR) messages.  A default
      value of 30 seconds is RECOMMENDED by this document.

   o  MUST implement coupling the state of individual LSPs with the
      state of the corresponding RSVP-TE signaling adjacency.  When an
      RSVP-TE speaker detects RSVP-TE signaling adjacency failure, the
      speaker MUST act as if all the Path and Resv states learned via
      the failed signaling adjacency have timed out.

   o  MUST make use of the Hello session based on the Node-ID ([<a href="./rfc3209" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>]
      [<a href="./rfc4558" title='"Node-ID Based Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Hello: A Clarification Statement"'>RFC4558</a>]) for detection of RSVP-TE signaling adjacency failures.
      A default value of 9 seconds is RECOMMENDED by this document for
      the configurable node hello interval (as opposed to the default
      value of 5 milliseconds proposed in <a href="./rfc3209#section-5.3">Section 5.3 of [RFC3209]</a>).

   o  MUST indicate support for RI-RSVP via the CAPABILITY object
      [<a href="./rfc5063" title='"Extensions to GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Graceful Restart"'>RFC5063</a>] in Hello messages.

   An implementation supporting the RI-RSVP technique MUST set a new
   flag, RI-RSVP Capable, in the CAPABILITY object signaled in Hello
   messages.  The following bit indicates that the sender supports
   RI-RSVP:

      Bit Number 28 (0x0008) - RI-RSVP Capable (I-bit)

   Any node that sets the new I-bit in its CAPABILITY object MUST also
   set the Refresh-Reduction-Capable bit [<a href="./rfc2961" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>RFC2961</a>] in the common header
   of all RSVP-TE messages.  If a peer sets the I-bit in the CAPABILITY
   object but does not set the Refresh-Reduction-Capable bit, then the
   RI-RSVP functionality MUST NOT be activated for that peer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Compatibility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Compatibility</span>

   The RI-RSVP functionality MUST NOT be activated with a peer that does
   not indicate support for this functionality.  Inactivation of the
   RI-RSVP functionality MUST result in the use of the traditional
   smaller refresh interval [<a href="./rfc2205" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1 Functional Specification"'>RFC2205</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Per-Peer%20Flow%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Per-Peer Flow Control</span>

   The functionality discussed in this section provides an RSVP speaker
   with the ability to apply back pressure to its peer(s) to reduce/
   eliminate a significant portion of the RSVP-TE control message load.

   An implementation that supports Per-Peer Flow Control:

   o  MUST support all of the requirements specified in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.

   o  MUST support RI-RSVP (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).

   o  MUST treat lack of ACKs from a peer as an indication of a peer's
      RSVP-TE control-plane congestion.  If congestion is detected, the
      local system MUST throttle RSVP-TE messages to the affected peer.
      This MUST be done on a per-peer basis.  (Per-peer throttling MAY
      be implemented by a traffic-shaping mechanism that proportionally
      reduces the RSVP-signaling packet rate as the number of
      outstanding ACKs increases.  When the number of outstanding ACKs
      decreases, the send rate would be adjusted up again.)

   o  SHOULD use a Retry Limit (Rl) value of 7 (<a href="./rfc2961#section-6.2">Section 6.2 of [RFC2961]</a>
      suggests using 3).

   o  SHOULD prioritize Hello messages and messages carrying
      Acknowledgements over other RSVP messages.

   o  SHOULD prioritize Tear/Error over trigger Path/Resv (messages that
      bring up new LSP state) sent to a peer when the local system
      detects RSVP-TE control-plane congestion in the peer.

   o  MUST indicate support for this technique via the CAPABILITY object
      [<a href="./rfc5063" title='"Extensions to GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Graceful Restart"'>RFC5063</a>] in Hello messages.

   An implementation supporting the Per-Peer Flow-Control technique MUST
   set a new flag, Per-Peer Flow-Control Capable, in the CAPABILITY
   object signaled in Hello messages.  The following bit indicates that
   the sender supports Per-Peer Flow Control:

      Bit Number 27 (0x0010) - Per-Peer Flow-Control Capable (F-bit)

   Any node that sets the new F-bit in its CAPABILITY object MUST also
   set the Refresh-Reduction-Capable bit in the common header of all
   RSVP-TE messages.  If a peer sets the F-bit in the CAPABILITY object
   but does not set the Refresh-Reduction-Capable bit, then the Per-Peer
   Flow-Control functionality MUST NOT be activated for that peer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.2.%20%20Compatibility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Compatibility</span>

   The Per-Peer Flow-Control functionality MUST NOT be activated with a
   peer that does not indicate support for this functionality.  If a
   peer hasn't indicated that it is capable of participating in Per-Peer
   Flow Control, then it SHOULD NOT be assumed that the peer would
   always acknowledge a non-out-of-order message containing a MESSAGE_ID
   object with the ACK_Desired flag set.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Recommended%20Defaults"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" id="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Recommended Defaults</span>

   a.  Refresh Interval (R) - 20 minutes (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>):
       Given that an implementation supporting RI-RSVP doesn't rely on
       refreshes for state sync between peers, the function of the RSVP
       refresh interval is analogous to that of IGP refresh interval
       (the default of which is typically in the order of tens of
       minutes).  Choosing a default of 20 minutes allows the refresh
       timer to be randomly set to a value in the range [10 minutes
       (0.5R), 30 minutes (1.5R)].

   b.  Node Hello Interval - 9 seconds (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>):

       [<a id="ref-RFC3209">RFC3209</a>] defines the hello timeout as 3.5 times the hello
       interval.  Choosing 9 seconds for the node hello interval gives a
       hello timeout of 3.5 * 9 = 31.5 seconds.  This puts the hello
       timeout value in the vicinity of the IGP hello timeout value.

   c.  Retry-Limit (Rl) - 7 (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>):
       Choosing 7 as the retry-limit results in an overall rapid
       retransmit phase of 31.5 seconds.  This matches up with the hello
       timeout of 31.5 seconds.

   d.  Refresh Interval for refreshing state associated with
       unacknowledged Path/Resv messages (uR) - 30 seconds (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>):
       The recommended refresh interval (R) value of 20 minutes (for an
       implementation supporting RI-RSVP) cannot be used for refreshing
       state associated with unacknowledged Path/Resv messages.  This
       document recommends the use of the traditional default refresh
       interval value of 30 seconds for uR.
