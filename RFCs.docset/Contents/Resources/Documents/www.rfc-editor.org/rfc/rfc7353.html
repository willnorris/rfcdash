   Origin validation based on Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   [<a href="./rfc6811" title='"BGP Prefix Origin Validation"'>RFC6811</a>] provides a measure of resilience to accidental
   mis-origination of prefixes; however, it provides neither
   cryptographic assurance (announcements are not signed) nor assurance
   of the AS Path of the announcement.

   This document describes requirements to be placed on a BGP security
   protocol, herein termed "BGPsec", intended to rectify these gaps.

   The threat model assumed here is documented in [<a href="./rfc4593" title='"Generic Threats to Routing Protocols"'>RFC4593</a>] and
   [<a href="./rfc7132" title='"Threat Model for BGP Path Security"'>RFC7132</a>].

   As noted in the threat model [<a href="./rfc7132" title='"Threat Model for BGP Path Security"'>RFC7132</a>], this work is limited to
   threats to the BGP protocol.  Issues of business relationship
   conformance, while quite important to operators, are not security
   issues per se and are outside the scope of this document.  It is
   hoped that these issues will be better understood in the future.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] only when they
   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed
   case, without normative meaning.

   This document assumes ongoing incremental deployment of Route Origin
   Authorizations (ROAs) [<a href="./rfc6482" title='"A Profile for Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)"'>RFC6482</a>], the RPKI to the Router Protocol
   [<a href="./rfc6810" title='"The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router Protocol"'>RFC6810</a>], and RPKI-based Prefix Validation [<a href="./rfc6811" title='"BGP Prefix Origin Validation"'>RFC6811</a>].

   And, of course, a knowledge of BGP [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] is required.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20General%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  General Requirements</span>

   The following are general requirements for a BGPsec protocol:

   3.1   A BGPsec design MUST allow the receiver of a BGP announcement
         to determine, to a strong level of certainty, that the
         originating AS in the received PATH attribute possessed the
         authority to announce the prefix.

   3.2   A BGPsec design MUST allow the receiver of a BGP announcement
         to determine, to a strong level of certainty, that the received
         PATH attribute accurately represents the sequence of External
         BGP (eBGP) exchanges that propagated the prefix from the origin
         AS to the receiver, particularly if an AS has added or deleted
         any AS number other than its own in the PATH attribute.  This
         includes modification to the number of AS prepends.

   3.3   BGP attributes other than the AS_PATH are used only locally, or
         have meaning only between immediate neighbors, may be modified
         by intermediate systems and figure less prominently in the
         decision process.  Consequently, it is not appropriate to try
         to protect such attributes in a BGPsec design.

   3.4   A BGPsec design MUST be amenable to incremental deployment.
         This implies that incompatible protocol capabilities MUST be
         negotiated.

   3.5   A BGPsec design MUST provide analysis of the operational
         considerations for deployment and particularly of incremental
         deployment, e.g., contiguous islands, non-contiguous islands,
         universal deployment, etc.

   3.6   As proofs of possession and authentication may require
         cryptographic payloads and/or storage and computation, likely
         increasing processing and memory requirements on routers, a
         BGPsec design MAY require use of new hardware.  That is,
         compatibility with current hardware abilities is not a
         requirement that this document imposes on a solution.

   3.7   A BGPsec design need not prevent attacks on data-plane traffic.
         It need not provide assurance that the data plane even follows
         the control plane.



<span class="grey">Bellovin, et al.              Informational                     [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7353">RFC 7353</a>          Requirements for BGP Path Validation       August 2014</span>


   3.8   A BGPsec design MUST resist attacks by an enemy who has access
         to the inter-router link layer, per <a href="./rfc4593#section-3.1.1.2">SectionÂ 3.1.1.2 of
         [RFC4593]</a>.  In particular, such a design MUST provide
         mechanisms for authentication of all data, including protecting
         against message insertion, deletion, modification, or replay.
         Mechanisms that suffice include TCP sessions authenticated with
         the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [<a href="./rfc5925" title='"The TCP Authentication Option"'>RFC5925</a>], IPsec
         [<a href="./rfc4301" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>], or Transport Layer Security (TLS) [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>].

   3.9   It is assumed that a BGPsec design will require information
         about holdings of address space and Autonomous System Numbers
         (ASNs), and assertions about binding of address space to ASNs.
         A BGPsec design MAY make use of a security infrastructure
         (e.g., a PKI) to distribute such authenticated data.

   3.10  It is entirely OPTIONAL to secure AS SETs and prefix
         aggregation.  The long-range solution to this is the
         deprecation of AS_SETs; see [<a href="./rfc6472" title='"Recommendation for Not Using AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET in BGP"'>RFC6472</a>].

   3.11  If a BGPsec design uses signed prefixes, given the difficulty
         of splitting a signed message while preserving the signature,
         it need not handle multiple prefixes in a single UPDATE PDU.

   3.12  A BGPsec design MUST enable each BGPsec speaker to configure
         use of the security mechanism on a per-peer basis.

   3.13  A BGPsec design MUST provide backward compatibility in the
         message formatting, transmission, and processing of routing
         information carried through a mixed security environment.
         Message formatting in a fully secured environment MAY be
         handled in a non-backward compatible manner.

   3.14  While the formal validity of a routing announcement should be
         determined by the BGPsec protocol, local routing policy MUST be
         the final arbiter of the best path and other routing decisions.

   3.15  A BGPsec design MUST support 'transparent' route servers,
         meaning that the AS of the route server is not counted in
         downstream BGP AS-path-length tie-breaking decisions.

   3.16  A BGPsec design MUST support AS aliasing.  This technique is
         not well defined or universally implemented but is being
         documented in [<a href="#ref-AS-MIGRATION">AS-MIGRATION</a>].  A BGPsec design SHOULD
         accommodate AS 'migration' techniques such as common
         proprietary and non-standard methods that allow a router to
         have two AS identities, without lengthening the effective AS
         Path.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7353">RFC 7353</a>          Requirements for BGP Path Validation       August 2014</span>


   3.17  If a BGPsec design makes use of a security infrastructure, that
         infrastructure SHOULD enable each network operator to select
         the entities it will trust when authenticating data in the
         security infrastructure.  See, for example, [<a href="#ref-LTA-USE-CASES">LTA-USE-CASES</a>].

   3.18  A BGPsec design MUST NOT require operators to reveal more than
         is currently revealed in the operational inter-domain routing
         environment, other than the inclusion of necessary security
         credentials to allow others to ascertain for themselves the
         necessary degree of assurance regarding the validity of Network
         Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) received via BGPsec.
         This includes peering, customer/provider relationships, an
         ISP's internal infrastructure, etc.  It is understood that some
         data are revealed to the savvy seeker by BGP, traceroute, etc.,
         today.

   3.19  A BGPsec design MUST signal (e.g., via logging or SNMP)
         security exceptions that are significant to the operator.  The
         specific data to be signaled are an implementation matter.

   3.20  Any routing information database MUST be re-authenticated
         periodically or in an event-driven manner, especially in
         response to events such as, for example, PKI updates.

   3.21  Any inter-AS use of cryptographic hashes or signatures MUST
         provide mechanisms for algorithm agility.  For a discussion,
         see [<a href="#ref-ALG-AGILITY">ALG-AGILITY</a>].

   3.22  A BGPsec design SHOULD NOT presume to know the intent of the
         originator of a NLRI, nor that of any AS on the AS Path, other
         than that they intend to pass it to the next AS in the path.

   3.23  A BGPsec listener SHOULD NOT trust non-BGPsec markings, such as
         communities, across trust boundaries.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20BGP%20UPDATE%20Security%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  BGP UPDATE Security Requirements</span>

   The following requirements MUST be met in the processing of BGP
   UPDATE messages:

   4.1  A BGPsec design MUST enable each recipient of an UPDATE to
        formally validate that the origin AS in the message is
        authorized to originate a route to the prefix(es) in the
        message.







<span class="grey">Bellovin, et al.              Informational                     [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7353">RFC 7353</a>          Requirements for BGP Path Validation       August 2014</span>


   4.2  A BGPsec design MUST enable the recipient of an UPDATE to
        formally determine that the NLRI has traversed the AS Path
        indicated in the UPDATE.  Note that this is more stringent than
        showing that the path is merely not impossible.

   4.3  Replay of BGP UPDATE messages need not be completely prevented,
        but a BGPsec design SHOULD provide a mechanism to control the
        window of exposure to replay attacks.

   4.4  A BGPsec design SHOULD provide some level of assurance that the
        origin of a prefix is still 'alive', i.e., that a monkey in the
        middle has not withheld a WITHDRAW message or the effects
        thereof.

   4.5  The AS Path of an UPDATE message SHOULD be able to be
        authenticated as the message is processed.

   4.6  Normal sanity checks of received announcements MUST be done,
        e.g., verification that the first element of the AS_PATH list
        corresponds to the locally configured AS of the peer from which
        the UPDATE was received.

   4.7  The output of a router applying BGPsec validation to a received
        UPDATE MUST be unequivocal and conform to a fully specified
        state in the design.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   If an external "security infrastructure" is used, as mentioned in
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, paragraphs 9 and 17 above, the authenticity and integrity
   of the data of such an infrastructure MUST be assured.  In addition,
   the integrity of those data MUST be assured when they are used by
   BGPsec, e.g., in transport.

   The requirement of backward compatibility to BGP4 may open an avenue
   to downgrade attacks.

   The data plane might not follow the path signaled by the control
   plane.

   Security for subscriber traffic is outside the scope of this document
   and of BGP security in general.  IETF standards for payload data
   security should be employed.  While adoption of BGP security measures
   may ameliorate some classes of attacks on traffic, these measures are
   not a substitute for use of subscriber-based security.
