<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)"'>2</a>]) is a system that transforms
   E.164 numbers [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The International Public Telecommunication Number Plan"'>3</a>] into domain names and that then uses DNS (Domain
   Name Service, <a href="./rfc1034">RFC 1034</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>4</a>]) services such as delegation through NS
   records and NAPTR records to look up what services are available for
   a specific domain name.

   This document registers 'Enumservices' according to the guidelines
   given in <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)"'>2</a>] to be used for provisioning in the services
   field of an NAPTR [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database"'>7</a>] resource record to indicate what class of
   functionality a given end point offers.  The registration is defined
   within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS"'>5</a>][6][<a href="#ref-7" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database"'>7</a>][8][<a href="#ref-9" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part Five: URI.ARPA Assignment Procedures"'>9</a>])
   hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application, defined in <a href="./rfc3761">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3761">3761</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)"'>2</a>].

   The following 'Enumservices' are registered with this document: 'web'
   and 'ft'.  These share a common feature in that they each indicate
   that the functionality of the given end points and the associated
   resources are primarily sources of information.

   According to <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)"'>2</a>], the 'Enumservice' registered must be able
   to function as a selection mechanism when one chooses between one
   NAPTR resource record and another.  This means that the registration
   MUST specify what is expected when that NAPTR record is used, and the
   URI scheme that is the outcome of use.

   Therefore an 'Enumservice' acts as a hint, indicating the kind of
   service with which the URI constructed by using the regexp field is
   associated.  More than one 'Enumservice' can be included within a
   single NAPTR; this indicates that there is more than one service that
   can be achieved by using the associated URI scheme.

   The common thread with this set of definitions is that they reflect
   the kind of service that the end user will hope to achieve with the
   communication by using the associated URI.

   The services specified here are NOT intended to specify the protocol
   or even the method of connection that MUST be used to achieve each
   service.  Instead, we define the kind of interactive behavior that an
   end user will expect, leaving the end system to decide (based on
   policies outside the scope of this specification) how to execute the
   service.

   As the same URI scheme may be used for different services (e.g.,
   'tel:') and the same kind of service may use different URI schemes
   (e.g., for VoIP, 'sip:', 'h323:', and 'tel:' may be used), it is
   necessary in some cases to specify the service and the URI scheme
   used.

   The service parameters defined in <a href="./rfc3761">RFC 3761</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)"'>2</a>] therefore allow a
   'type' and a 'subtype' to be specified.  Within this set of
   specifications, it is assumed that the 'type' (being the more generic
   term) defines the service and the 'subtype' defines the URI scheme.

   The Enumservices registered in this section indicate that the

   source of information.

   Enumservice Name: "web"

   Enumservice Type: "web"

   Enumservice Subtype: "http"

   URI Scheme: 'http:'

   Functional Specification:

   This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
   associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of information.

   Note that the kind of information retrieved can be manifold.
   Usually, contacting a resource by an 'http:' [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>11</a>] URI provides a
   document.  This document can contain references that will trigger the
   download of many different kinds of information, such as audio,
   video, or executable code.  Thus, one cannot be more specific about
   the kind of information expected when contacting the resource.

   which can be contacted by using TLS or the Secure Socket Layer
   protocol.

   Note that the kind of information retrieved can be manifold.
   Usually, contacting a resource by an 'https:' URI [<a href="#ref-12" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>12</a>] provides a

   As used by ENUM, DNS is a global, distributed database.  Thus any
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.  Although
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a telephone
   directory, it does expose the data subject to having "their"




<span class="grey">Brandner, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>

   information collected automatically without any indication that this
   has been done, or by whom.

   Data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists of
   targets for unrequested information; in short, it is used to address
   "spam".  Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware that
   the volume of "spam" email they receive increases when they post to
   the mailing list; publication of a telephone number in ENUM is no
   different and may be used to send "junk faxes" or "junk SMS", for
   example.

   Many mailing list users have more than one email address and use
   "sacrificial" email accounts when they post to these lists to help
   filter out unrequested emails.  This is not so easy with published
   telephone numbers; the PSTN E.164 number assignment process is much
   more involved, and usually a single E.164 number (or a fixed range of
   numbers) is associated with each PSTN access.  Thus, providing a
   "sacrificial" phone number in any publication is not possible.

   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible
   database, as a principle the data subject MUST give explicit informed
   consent when data is published in ENUM.

   In addition, the data subject should be made aware that, due to
   storage of such data during harvesting by third parties, removal of
   the data from publication will not remove any copies that have been
   taken; in effect, any publication may be permanent.

   However, regulations in many regions will require that the data
   subject can at any time request that the data is removed from
   publication, and that consent for its publication is explicitly
   confirmed at regular intervals.

   The user SHOULD be asked to confirm opening a web page or starting an
   ftp session (particularly if the ftp client is configured to send the
   user's email address as an "anonymous" user password).

   Using a web:http or ft:ftp service is not secure, so the user should
   apply the same caution when entering personal data as they would do
   if using a client application started with any other method.
   Although this is not a feature of ENUM or these Enumservices, the
   ENUM-using application on the end system may appear different from
   the user's "normal" browser, so the user SHOULD receive an indication
   of whether their communication is secured.

   As evaluating a web page can involve execution of embedded (or
   linked) content that may include executable code, evaluating a web
   URL involves risks.  If automatic evaluation of a web link were to be
   used, the querying user would be exposed to risks associated with
   that automatic download and execution of content.  Thus, the client
   MUST ask the querying user for confirmation before evaluating the web
   URL; the client MUST NOT download and evaluate the web content
   automatically.
