Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   This memo obsoletes <a href="./rfc1650">RFC 1650</a> "Definitions of Managed Objects for the
   Ethernet-like Interface Types using SMIv2".  This memo extends that
   specification by including management information useful for the
   management of 100 Mb/s Ethernet interfaces.

   Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the
   IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new
   types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.  This evolution
   may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this
   new functionality.  This document, as with other documents issued by
   this working group, reflect a certain stage in the evolution of
   Ethernet technology.  In the future, this document might be revised,
   or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet
   technology.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing ethernet-like
   interfaces.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module extends the
   list of managed objects specified in the earlier version of this MIB:
   <a href="./rfc1650">RFC1650</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types using SMIv2"'>11</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirements Levels"'>13</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20SNMP%20Network%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The SNMP Network Management Framework</span>

   The SNMP Network Management Framework consists of several components.
   For the purpose of this specification, the applicable components of
   the Framework are the SMI and related documents [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure of Management Information for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>, <a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>, <a href="#ref-4" title='"Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>4</a>], which
   define the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the
   purpose of management.



<span class="grey">Flick &amp; Johnson             Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-3"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2358">RFC 2358</a>         MIB for Ethernet-like Interface Types         June 1998</span>


   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Object%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Object Definitions</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-1" title=" International Organization for Standardization">1</a>]
   defined in the SMI [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure of Management Information for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].  In particular, each object object type is
   named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
   The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.   Overview</span>

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface
   to an ethernet-like communications medium.  At present, ethernet-like
   media are identified by the following values of the ifType object in
   the Interfaces MIB [<a href="#ref-12" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>12</a>]:

                             ethernetCsmacd(6)
                             iso88023Csmacd(7)
                                starLan(11)

   The definitions presented here are based on the IEEE 802.3 Layer
   Management Specification [<a href="#ref-5" title="IEEE 802.3 Layer Management">5</a>], as originally interpreted by Frank
   Kastenholz then of Interlan in [<a href="#ref-7" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks"'>7</a>].  Implementors of these MIB
   objects should note that the IEEE document explicitly describes (in
   the form of Pascal pseudocode) when, where, and how various MAC
   attributes are measured.  The IEEE document also describes the
   effects of MAC actions that may be invoked by manipulating instances
   of the MIB objects defined here.

   To the extent that some of the attributes defined in [<a href="#ref-5" title="IEEE 802.3 Layer Management">5</a>] are
   represented by previously defined objects in MIB-2 [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>16</a>] or in the
   Interfaces MIB [<a href="#ref-12" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>12</a>], such attributes are not redundantly represented
   by objects defined in this memo.  Among the attributes represented by
   objects defined in other memos are the number of octets transmitted
   or received on a particular interface, the number of frames
   transmitted or received on a particular interface, the promiscuous
   status of an interface, the MAC address of an interface, and
   multicast information associated with an interface.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2358">RFC 2358</a>         MIB for Ethernet-like Interface Types         June 1998</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20Relation%20to%20MIB-2"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Relation to MIB-2</span>

   This section applies only when this MIB is used in conjunction with
   the "old" (<a href="./rfc1213">RFC 1213</a>) [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>16</a>] interface group.

   The relationship between an ethernet-like interface and an interface
   in the context of the Internet-standard MIB is one-to-one.  As such,
   the value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to
   identify corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.

   For agents which implement the (now deprecated) ifSpecific object, an
   instance of that object that is associated with an ethernet-like
   interface has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

              dot3    OBJECT IDENTIFER ::= { transmission 7 }

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Relation%20to%20the%20Interfaces%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Relation to the Interfaces MIB</span>

   The Interface MIB [<a href="#ref-12" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>12</a>] requires that any MIB which is an adjunct of
   the Interface MIB clarify specific areas within the Interface MIB.
   These areas were intentionally left vague in the Interface MIB to
   avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of
   certain media-types.

   Section 3.3 of [<a href="#ref-12" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>12</a>] enumerates several areas which a media-specific
   MIB must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in a following
   subsection.  The implementor is referred to [<a href="#ref-12" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>12</a>] in order to
   understand the general intent of these areas.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.1.%20%20Layering%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1" id="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Layering Model</span>

   This MIB does not provide for layering.  There are no sublayers.

   EDITOR'S NOTE:

   One could foresee the development of an 802.2 and enet-transceiver
   MIB.  They could be higher and lower sublayers, respectively.  All
   that THIS document should do is allude to the possibilities and urge
   the implementor to be aware of the possibility and that they may have
   requirements which supersede the requirements in this document.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.2.%20%20Virtual%20Circuits"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.2" id="section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  Virtual Circuits</span>

   This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not
   applicable to this MIB.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2358">RFC 2358</a>         MIB for Ethernet-like Interface Types         June 1998</span>


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.3.%20%20ifTestTable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.3" id="section-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>.  ifTestTable</span>

   This MIB defines two tests for media which are instrumented with this
   MIB; TDR and Loopback.  Implementation of these tests is not
   required.  Many common interface chips do not support one or both of
   these tests.

   These two tests are provided as a convenience, allowing a common
   method to invoke the test.

   Standard MIBs do not include objects in which to return the results
   of the TDR test.  Any needed objects MUST be provided in the vendor
   specific MIB.

   Note that the ifTestTable is now deprecated.  Work is underway to
   define a replacement MIB for system and interface testing.  It is
   expected that the tests defined in this document will be usable in
   this replacement MIB.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.4.%20%20ifRcvAddressTable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.4" id="section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  ifRcvAddressTable</span>

   This table contains all IEEE 802.3 addresses, unicast, multicast, and
   broadcast, for which this interface will receive packets and forward
   them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.  The format
   of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for
   ifPhysAddress.

   In the event that the interface is part of a MAC bridge, this table
   does not include unicast addresses which are accepted for possible
   forwarding out some other port.  This table is explicitly not
   intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.5.%20%20ifPhysAddress"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.5" id="section-3.2.5">3.2.5</a>.  ifPhysAddress</span>

   This object contains the IEEE 802.3 address which is placed in the
   source-address field of any Ethernet, Starlan, or IEEE 802.3 frames
   that originate at this interface.  Usually this will be kept in ROM
   on the interface hardware.  Some systems may set this address via
   software.

   In a system where there are several such addresses the designer has a
   tougher choice.  The address chosen should be the one most likely to
   be of use to network management (e.g.  the address placed in ARP
   responses for systems which are primarily IP systems).

   If the designer truly can not chose, use of the factory- provided ROM
   address is suggested.




<span class="grey">Flick &amp; Johnson             Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2358">RFC 2358</a>         MIB for Ethernet-like Interface Types         June 1998</span>


   If the address can not be determined, an octet string of zero length
   should be returned.

   The address is stored in binary in this object.  The address is
   stored in "canonical" bit order, that is, the Group Bit is positioned
   as the low-order bit of the first octet.  Thus, the first byte of a
   multicast address would have the bit 0x01 set.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.6.%20%20ifType"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.6" id="section-3.2.6">3.2.6</a>.  ifType</span>

   This MIB applies to interfaces which have any of the following ifType
   values:

                             ethernetCsmacd(6)
                             iso88023Csmacd(7)
                                starLan(11)

   It is RECOMMENDED that all Ethernet-like interfaces use an ifType of
   ethernetCsmacd(6) regardless of the speed that the interface is
   running or the link-layer encapsulation in use.  iso88023Csmacd(7)
   and starLan(11) are supported for backwards compatability.

   There are two other interface types defined in the IANAifType-MIB for
   100 Mbit Ethernet.  They are fastEther(62), and fastEtherFX(69).
   This document takes the position that an Ethernet is an Ethernet, and
   Ethernet interfaces SHOULD always have the same value of ifType.
   Information on the particular flavor of Ethernet that an interface is
   running is available from ifSpeed in the Interfaces MIB, and
   ifMauType in the 802.3 MAU MIB.  An Ethernet-like interface SHOULD
   NOT use the fastEther(62) or fastEtherFX(69) ifTypes.

   Interfaces with any of the supported ifType values map to the
   EtherLike-MIB in the same manner.  Which compliance statement an
   interface should implement is dependent on the maximum speed
   supported on the interface.  The EtherLike-MIB etherCompliance
   compliance statement applies to all Ethernet-like interfaces whose
   maximum supported speed is 10 Mbit/sec or less.  There are no
   implementation differences. Similarly, the EtherLike-MIB
   ether100MbsCompliance compliance statement applies to all Ethernet-
   like interfaces whose maximum supported speed is 100Mbit/sec.

   An interface that is capable of operating at 100Mbit/sec MUST
   implement the ether100MbsCompliance compliance statement, even if it
   is currently operating at a lower speed.  Counters in the
   ether100MbsCompliance compliance statement that only apply to 100
   Mbit interfaces would simply not increment when the interface is
   operating at a lower speed.

   The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for
   applying the interface group objects to ethernet-like media.

     Object

     ifIndex                    Each ethernet-like interface is
                                represented by an ifEntry.  The
                                dot3StatsTable in this MIB module is
                                indexed by dot3StatsIndex. The interface
                                identified by a particular value of
                                dot3StatsIndex is the same interface as
                                identified by the same value of ifIndex.

     ifDescr                    Refer to [<a href="#ref-12" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>12</a>].

     ifType                     Refer to <a href="#section-3.2.6">section 3.2.6</a>.

     ifMtu                      1500 octets.

     ifSpeed                    The current operational speed of the
                                interface in bits per second. For
                                current ethernet-like interfaces, this
                                will be equal to 1,000,000 (1 million),
                                10,000,000 (10 million), or 100,000,000
                                (100 million). If the interface
                                implements auto-negotiation,
                                auto-negotiation is enabled for this
                                interface, and the interface has not yet
                                negotiated to an operational speed, this
                                object SHOULD reflect the maximum speed
                                supported by the interface.  Note that
                                this object MUST NOT indicate a doubled
                                value when operating in full-duplex
                                mode.  It MUST indicate the correct
                                line speed regardless of the current
                                duplex mode.  The correct object to use
                                to determine the duplex mode of the
                                interface is the ifMauType object in the
                                802.3 MAU MIB.

     ifPhysAddress              Refer to <a href="#section-3.2.5">section 3.2.5</a>.

   Support for the mauModIfCompl compliance statement of the MAU-MIB
   [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) using SMIv2"'>14</a>] is REQUIRED for Ethernet-like interfaces.  This MIB is needed in
   order to allow applications to determine the current MAU type in use
   by the interface.  The MAU type indicates not only the media type in
   use, but also indicates whether the interface is operating in half-
   duplex or full-duplex mode.  Implementing this MIB module without
   implementing the MAU-MIB would leave applications with no standard
   way to determine the duplex mode of the interface.

   This document was produced by the 802.3 Hub MIB Working Group.

   This document is almost completely based on both the Standard
   Ethernet MIB, <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>10</a>], and the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB
   using the SNMPv2 SMI, <a href="./rfc1650">RFC 1650</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types using SMIv2"'>11</a>], both of which were edited by
   Frank Kastenholz of FTP Software and produced by the Ethernet MIB
   Working Group.  This document extends those documents by providing
   support for 100 Mb/sec ethernet interfaces as outlined in [<a href="#ref-6" title='"10 &amp; 100 Mb/s Management,"'>6</a>].

   <a href="./rfc1643">RFC 1643</a> and <a href="./rfc1650">RFC 1650</a>, in turn, are based on the Draft Standard
   Ethernet MIB, <a href="./rfc1398">RFC 1398</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>9</a>], also edited by Frank Kastenholz and
   produced by the Ethernet MIB Working Group.

   <a href="./rfc1398">RFC 1398</a>, in turn, is based on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB,
   <a href="./rfc1284">RFC 1284</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Ethernet-Like Interface Types"'>8</a>], which was edited by John Cook of Chipcom and produced
   by the Transmission MIB Working Group.  The Ethernet MIB Working
   Group gathered implementation experience of the variables specified
   in <a href="./rfc1284">RFC 1284</a> and used that information to develop this revised MIB.

   <a href="./rfc1284">RFC 1284</a>, in turn, is based on a document written by Frank
   Kastenholz, then of Interlan, entitled IEEE 802.3 Layer Management
   Draft M compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks [<a href="#ref-7" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks"'>7</a>].  This document has
   been modestly reworked, initially by the SNMP Working Group, and then
   by the Transmission Working Group, to reflect the current conventions
   for defining objects for MIB interfaces.  James Davin, of the MIT
   Laboratory for Computer Science, and Keith McCloghrie of Hughes LAN
   Systems, contributed to later drafts of this memo. Marshall Rose of
   Performance Systems International, Inc. converted the document into
   its current concise format. Anil Rijsinghani of DEC contributed text
   that more adequately describes the TDR test.  Thanks to Frank
   Kastenholz of Interlan and Louis Steinberg of IBM for their
   experimentation.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.






<span class="grey">Flick &amp; Johnson             Standards Track                    [Page 36]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-37"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2358">RFC 2358</a>         MIB for Ethernet-like Interface Types         June 1998</span>


   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be
   considered to contain sensitive information.  In particular, the
   dot3StatsEtherChipSet object may be considered sensitive in many
   environments, since it would allow an intruder to obtain information
   about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.

   Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all
   versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="./rfc2274">RFC 2274</a> [<a href="#ref-17" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>17</a>] and the View-based
   Access Control Model <a href="./rfc2275">RFC 2275</a> [<a href="#ref-18" title='"View-based Access Control Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>18</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

   This section enumerates changes made to <a href="./rfc1650">RFC 1650</a> to produce this
   document.

      (1)   The MODULE-IDENTITY has been updated to reflect the changes
            in the MIB.

      (2)   A new object, dot3StatsSymbolErrors, has been added.

      (3)   The definition of the object dot3StatsIndex has been
            converted to use the SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE macro.

      (4)   A new conformance group, etherStats100MbsGroup, has been
            added.

      (5)   A new compliance statement, ether100MbsCompliance, has
            been added.

      (6)   The Acknowledgements were extended to provide a more
            complete history of the origin of this document.

      (7)   The discussion of ifType has been expanded.

      (8)   A section on mapping of Interfaces MIB objects has
            been added.

      (9)   A section defining the relationship of this MIB to
            the MAU MIB has been added.

      (10)  A section on the mapping of IEEE 802.3 managed objects
            to this MIB and the Interfaces MIB has been added.

      (11)  Converted the dot3Tests, dot3Errors, and dot3ChipSets
            OIDs to use the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro.

      (12)  Added to the list of registered dot3ChipSets.

      (13)  An intellectual property notice and copyright notice
            were added, as required by <a href="./rfc2026">RFC 2026</a>.
