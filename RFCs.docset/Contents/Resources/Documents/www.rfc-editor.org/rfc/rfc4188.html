Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on
   the IEEE 802.1D-1998 standard between Local Area Network (LAN)
   segments.  Provisions are made for the support of transparent
   bridging.  Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to
   bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.

   The MIB module presented in this memo is a translation of the
   BRIDGE-MIB defined in <a href="./rfc1493">RFC 1493</a> to the SMIv2 syntax.

   This memo obsoletes <a href="./rfc1493">RFC 1493</a>.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="./rfc2578" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="./rfc2579" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a>

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This device
   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network
   layer.

   There are two major modes defined for this bridging: transparent and
   source route.  The transparent method of bridging is defined in the
   IEEE 802.1D specification [<a href="#ref-IEEE8021D" title='"ANSI/IEEE Standard 802.1D-1998 MAC Bridges"'>IEEE8021D</a>].  This memo defines those
   objects needed for the management of a bridging entity that operates
   in the transparent mode, as well as some objects that apply to all
   types of bridges.

   To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practices,
   an explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB module as simple as
   possible.  This was accomplished by applying the following criteria
   to objects proposed for inclusion:

   1. Start with a small set of essential objects and add only as
      further objects are needed.

   2. Require that objects be essential for either fault or
      configuration management.

   3. Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

   4. Limit the total number of objects.

   5. Exclude objects that are simply derivable from others in this or
      other MIB modules.

   6. Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.  The
      guideline that was followed is one counter per critical section
      per layer.

   Objects in this MIB module are arranged into subtrees.  Each subtree
   is organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their subtrees is shown below.  Where
   appropriate, the corresponding IEEE 802.1D [<a href="#ref-IEEE8021D" title='"ANSI/IEEE Standard 802.1D-1998 MAC Bridges"'>IEEE8021D</a>] management
   object name is also included.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4188">RFC 4188</a>                       Bridge MIB                 September 2005</span>


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.1%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20SNMPv2-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1" id="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB</span>

   The SNMPv2-MIB [<a href="./rfc3418" title='"Management Information Base (MIB) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC3418</a>] defines objects that are generally
   applicable to managed devices.  These objects apply to the device as
   a whole, irrespective of whether the device's sole functionality is
   bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of the device's
   functionality.

   As explained in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>, full support for the 802.1D management
   objects requires that the SNMPv2-MIB objects sysDescr and sysUpTime
   be implemented.  Note that compliance with the current SNMPv2-MIB
   module requires additional objects and notifications to be
   implemented, as specified in <a href="./rfc3418">RFC 3418</a> [<a href="./rfc3418" title='"Management Information Base (MIB) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC3418</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.2%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20IF-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.2" id="section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>  Relationship to the IF-MIB</span>

   The IF-MIB [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>] defines managed objects for managing network
   interfaces.  A network interface is thought of as being attached to a
   `subnetwork'.  Note that this term is not to be confused with
   `subnet', which refers to an addressing partitioning scheme used in
   the Internet suite of protocols.  The term 'segment' is used in this
   memo to refer to such a subnetwork, whether it be an Ethernet
   segment, a 'ring', a WAN link, or even an X.25 virtual circuit.

   As explained in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>, full support for the 802.1D management
   objects requires that the IF-MIB objects ifIndex, ifType, ifDescr,
   ifPhysAddress, and ifLastChange are implemented.  Note that
   compliance to the current IF-MIB module requires additional objects
   and notifications to be implemented as specified in <a href="./rfc2863">RFC 2863</a>
   [<a href="./rfc2863" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>].

   Implicit in this BRIDGE-MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each
   of these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces'
   subtree, and in most situations, each port is associated with a
   different interface.  However, there are situations in which multiple
   ports are associated with the same interface.  An example of such a
   situation would be several ports, each corresponding, one-to-one,
   with several X.25 virtual circuits that are all on the same
   interface.

   Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port number has
   no mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the simple
   case, a port number will have the same value as the corresponding
   interface's interface number.  Port numbers are in the range
   (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).

   through the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.  In
   such situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an
   interface is within the domain of the entity's bridging
   functionality.  This subset is considered to be delineated according
   to a set of protocols, with some protocols being bridged, and other
   protocols not being bridged.  For example, in an entity that
   exclusively performs bridging, all protocols would be considered as
   bridged, whereas in an entity that performs IP routing on IP
   datagrams and only bridges other protocols, only the non-IP data
   would be considered as having been bridged.

   Thus, this BRIDGE-MIB (and in particular, its counters) are
   applicable only to that subset of the data on an entity's interfaces
   that is sent/received for a protocol being bridged.  All such data is
   sent/received via the ports of the bridge.

            The MIB module has been converted to SMIv2 format.
            Conformance statements have been added and some
            description and reference clauses have been updated.

            The object dot1dStpPortPathCost32 was added to
            support IEEE 802.1t and the permissible values of
            dot1dStpPriority and dot1dStpPortPriority have been
            clarified for bridges supporting IEEE 802.1t or
            IEEE 802.1w.

            The interpretation of dot1dStpTimeSinceTopologyChange

       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "A Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) timer in units of 1/100
           seconds.  Several objects in this MIB module represent
           values of timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.
           In this MIB, these timers have values in units of
           hundredths of a second (i.e., 1/100 secs).

           These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
           BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however, that
           802.1D-1998 specifies a settable granularity of no more
           than one second for these timers.  To avoid ambiguity,
           a conversion algorithm is defined below for converting
           between the different units, which ensures a timer's
           value is not distorted by multiple conversions.

           To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
           1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:

               b = floor( (n * 256) / 100)

           where:
               floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
               n is the value in 1/100 second units
               b is the value in 1/256 second units

           To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
           1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:

               n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)

           where:
               ceiling = quotient [if remainder is 0], or
                         quotient + 1 [if remainder is nonzero]
               n is the value in 1/100 second units

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values that are recorded in the SMI Numbers
   registry:

      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------
      dot1dBridge       { mib-2 17 }

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The writable objects dot1dStpPriority, dot1dStpBridgeMaxAge,
      dot1dStpBridgeHelloTime, dot1dStpBridgeForwardDelay,
      dot1dStpPortPriority, dot1dStpPortEnable, dot1dStpPortPathCost,
      and dot1dStpPortPathCost32 influence the spanning tree protocol.
      Unauthorized write access to these objects can cause the spanning
      tree protocol to compute other default topologies or it can change
      the speed in which the spanning tree protocol reacts to failures.

   o  The writable object dot1dTpAgingTime controls how fast
      dynamically-learned forwarding information is aged out.  Setting
      this object to a large value may simplify forwarding table
      overflow attacks.

   o  The writable dot1dStaticTable provides a filtering mechanism
      controlling to which ports frames originating from a specific
      source may be forwarded.  Write access to this table can be used
      to turn provisioned filtering off or to add filters to prevent
      rightful use of the network.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4188">RFC 4188</a>                       Bridge MIB                 September 2005</span>


   o  The readable objects defined in the BRIDGE-MIB module provide
      information about the topology of a bridged network and the
      attached active stations.  The addresses listed in the
      dot1dTpFdbTable usually reveal information about the manufacturer
      of the MAC hardware, which can be useful information for mounting
      other specific attacks.

   o  The two notifications newRoot and topologyChange are emitted
      during spanning tree computation and may trigger management
      systems to inspect the status of bridges and to recompute internal
      topology information.  Hence, forged notifications may cause
      management systems to perform unnecessary computations and to
      generate additional SNMP traffic directed to the bridges in a
      network.  Therefore, forged notifications may be part of a denial
      of service attack.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="./rfc3410#section-8">[RFC3410], section 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   The following changes have been made from <a href="./rfc1493">RFC 1493</a>.

   1. Translated the MIB definitions to use SMIv2.  This includes the
      introduction of conformance statements.  ASN.1 type definitions
      have been converted into textual-conventions and several UNITS
      clauses were added.

   2. The object dot1dStpPortPathCost32 was added to support IEEE
      802.1t.

   3. Permissible values for dot1dStpPriority and dot1dStpPortPriority
      have been clarified for bridges supporting IEEE 802.1t or IEEE
      802.1w.

   4. Interpretation of dot1dStpTimeSinceTopologyChange has been
      clarified for bridges supporting the rapid spanning tree protocol
      (RSTP).

   5. Updated the introductory boilerplate text, the security
      considerations section, and the references to comply with the
      current IETF standards and guidelines.

   6. Updated references to point to newer IEEE 802.1d documents.

   7. Additions and clarifications in various description clauses.
