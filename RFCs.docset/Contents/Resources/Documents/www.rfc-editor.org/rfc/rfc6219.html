Abstract

   This document presents the China Education and Research Network
   (CERNET)'s IVI translation design and deployment for the IPv4/IPv6
   coexistence and transition.

   The IVI is a prefix-specific and stateless address mapping mechanism
   for "an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet" and "the IPv4 Internet to
   an IPv6 network" scenarios.  In the IVI design, subsets of the ISP's
   IPv4 addresses are embedded in the ISP's IPv6 addresses, and the
   hosts using these IPv6 addresses can therefore communicate with the
   global IPv6 Internet directly and can communicate with the global
   IPv4 Internet via stateless translators.  The communications can
   either be IPv6 initiated or IPv4 initiated.  The IVI mechanism
   supports the end-to-end address transparency and incremental
   deployment.  The IVI is an early design deployed in the CERNET as a
   reference for the IETF standard documents on IPv4/IPv6 stateless
   translation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document presents the CERNET IVI translation design and
   deployment for the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition.  In Roman
   numerals, the "IV" stands for 4, and "VI" stands for 6, so "IVI"
   stands for the IPv4/IPv6 translation.

   The experiences with IPv6 deployment in the past 10 years indicate
   that the ability to communicate between IPv4 and IPv6 address
   families would be beneficial.  However, the current transition
   methods do not fully support this requirement [<a href="./rfc4213" title='"Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers"'>RFC4213</a>].  For
   example, dual-stack hosts can communicate with both the IPv4 and IPv6
   hosts, but single-stack hosts can only communicate with hosts in the
   same address family.  While the dual-stack approach continues to work
   in many cases even in the face of IPv4 address depletion [<a href="#ref-COUNT" title='"IPv4 address countdown: http://penrose.uk6x.com/"'>COUNT</a>],
   there are situations where it would be desirable to communicate with
   a device in another address family.  Tunneling-based architectures
   can link the IPv6 islands across IPv4 networks, but they cannot
   provide communication between the two different address families
   [<a href="./rfc3056" title='"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds"'>RFC3056</a>] [<a href="./rfc5214" title='"Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)"'>RFC5214</a>] [<a href="./rfc4380" title='"Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through Network Address Translations (NATs)"'>RFC4380</a>].  Translation can relay communications
   for hosts located in IPv4 and IPv6 networks, but the current
   implementation of this kind of architecture is not scalable, and it
   cannot maintain end-to-end address transparency [<a href="./rfc2766" title='"Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation (NAT-PT)"'>RFC2766</a>] [<a href="./rfc3142" title='"An IPv6-to-IPv4 Transport Relay Translator"'>RFC3142</a>]
   [<a href="./rfc4966" title='"Reasons to Move the Network Address Translator - Protocol Translator (NAT-PT) to Historic Status"'>RFC4966</a>] [<a href="./rfc2775" title='"Internet Transparency"'>RFC2775</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Analysis%20of%20IPv4-IPv6%20Translation%20Mechanisms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Analysis of IPv4-IPv6 Translation Mechanisms</span>

   Since IPv4 and IPv6 are different protocols with different addressing
   structures, a translation mechanism is necessary for communication
   between endpoints using different address families.  There are
   several ways to implement the translation.  One is the Stateless IP/
   ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT) [<a href="./rfc2765" title='"Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT)"'>RFC2765</a>], which provides a
   mechanism for translation between IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers
   (including ICMP headers) without requiring any per-connection state.
   However, SIIT does not specify the address assignment and routing
   scheme [<a href="./rfc2766" title='"Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation (NAT-PT)"'>RFC2766</a>].  For example, SIIT uses IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
   [::ffff:ipv4-addr/96] and IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses
   [::ipv4-address/96] for the address mapping, but these addresses
   violate the aggregation principle of IPv6 routing [<a href="./rfc4291" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>].  The
   other translation mechanism is Network Address Translation - Protocol
   Translation (NAT-PT), which has serious technical and operational
   difficulties; the IETF has reclassified it from Proposed Standard to
   Historic status [<a href="./rfc4966" title='"Reasons to Move the Network Address Translator - Protocol Translator (NAT-PT) to Historic Status"'>RFC4966</a>].

   In order to solve the technical difficulties in NAT-PT, the issues
   and the possible workarounds are:





<span class="grey">Li, et al.                    Informational                     [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6219">RFC 6219</a>              CERNET IVI Translation Design             May 2011</span>


   1.  NAT-PT disrupts all protocols that embed IP addresses (and/or
       ports) in packet payloads.  There is little that can be done
       about this, other than using Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) or
       preferring protocols that transport DNS names instead of
       addresses.

   2.  Loss of end-to-end address transparency may occur.  End-to-end
       address transparency implies a global address space, the ability
       to pass packets unaltered throughout the network, and the ability
       to use source and destination addresses as unique labels
       [<a href="./rfc2775" title='"Internet Transparency"'>RFC2775</a>].  A reversible, algorithmic mapping can restore some of
       this transparency.  However, it is still not possible to ensure
       that all nodes in the existing Internet support such reversible
       mappings.

   3.  The states maintained in the translator cause scalability,
       multihoming, and load-sharing problems.  Hence, a stateless
       translation scheme is preferred.

   4.  Loss of information due to incompatible semantics between IPv4
       and IPv6 versions of headers and protocols may occur.  A partial
       remedy to this is the proper attention to the details of the
       protocol translation, for example, the error-codes mapping
       between ICMP and ICMPv6.  However, some semantic differences
       remain.

   5.  The DNS is tightly coupled with the translator and lack of
       address mapping persistence discussed in <a href="./rfc4966#section-3.3">SectionÂ 3.3 of
       [RFC4966]</a>.  Hence, the DNS should be decoupled from the
       translator.

   6.  Support for referrals is difficult in NAT-PT, given that
       translated addresses may leak outside the network where these
       addresses have a meaning.  Stateless translation, algorithmic
       address mappings, and the decoupling of DNS from the translation
       process can help the handling of referrals.  Nevertheless, it is
       still possible that an address-based referral is passed to
       someone who cannot employ it.  For instance, an IPv6-only node
       may pass a referral based on an IPv6 address to a node that only
       understands IPv4.

   The China Education and Research Network has two backbones using
   different address families.  The CERNET is IPv4-only [<a href="#ref-CERNET" title='"CERNET Homepage: http://www.edu.cn/english_1369/index.shtml"'>CERNET</a>] and
   CERNET2 is IPv6-only [<a href="#ref-CNGI-CERNET2">CNGI-CERNET2</a>], which fit in "an IPv6 network to
   the IPv4 Internet" and "the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network"
   scenarios in the IETF BEHAVE working group definition [<a href="#ref-BEHAVE" title='"The IETF Behave Working Group Charter: http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/behave/charter/"'>BEHAVE</a>]

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6219">RFC 6219</a>              CERNET IVI Translation Design             May 2011</span>


   [<a href="./rfc6144" title='"Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation"'>RFC6144</a>].  In order to make CERNET2 communicate with the IPv4
   Internet, we designed the IVI mechanism and installed IVI translators
   between the CERNET and CERNET2.

   The requirements of the IVI mechanism are:

   1.  It should support both IPv6-initiated and IPv4-initiated
       communications for the IPv6 clients/servers in "an IPv6 network".

   2.  It should follow current IPv4 and IPv6 routing practice without
       increasing the global routing table size in both address
       families.

   3.  It should be able to be deployed incrementally.

   4.  It should be able to use IPv4 addresses effectively due to the
       IPv4 address depletion problem.

   5.  It should be stateless to achieve scalability.

   6.  The DNS function should be decoupled from the translator.

   The specific IVI design presented in this document can satisfy the
   above requirements, with the following notes:

   1.  It restricts the IPv6 hosts to use a subset of the addresses
       inside the ISP's IPv6 block.  Therefore, IPv6 autoconfiguration
       cannot be used for these IPv6 hosts.  Manual configuration or
       autoconfiguration via stateful DHCPv6 is required.

   2.  It defines a one-to-one mapping between IPv4 addresses and IPv6
       addresses; hence, the IPv4 addresses cannot be used efficiently.
       However, the IVI6 addresses can be used both for IPv6 clients and
       IPv6 servers.  Due to this limitation, we suggest using IVI6
       addresses for servers.

   3.  An ALG is still required for any applications that embed
       address(es) in the payload.

   4.  Some issues with end-to-end transparency, address referrals, and
       incompatible semantics between protocol versions still remain, as
       discussed above.

   The IVI is an early design deployed in the CERNET for the stateless
   translation.  The IETF standard IPv4-IPv6 stateless and stateful
   translation mechanisms are defined in [<a href="./rfc6144" title='"Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation"'>RFC6144</a>], [<a href="./rfc6052" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>],
   [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>], [<a href="./rfc6146" title='"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6146</a>], and [<a href="./rfc6147" title='"DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6147</a>].

   The IVI is a prefix-specific and stateless address mapping scheme
   that can be carried out by individual ISPs.  In the IVI design,
   subsets of the ISP's IPv4 addresses are embedded in the ISP's IPv6
   addresses, and the hosts using these IPv6 addresses can therefore
   communicate with the global IPv6 Internet directly and can
   communicate with the global IPv4 Internet via stateless translators.
   The communications can either be IPv6 initiated or IPv4 initiated.

   The IVI mapping and translation mechanism is implemented in an IVI
   translator that connects between "an IPv6 network" and the IPv4
   Internet via the ISP's IPv4 network, as shown in the following
   figure.

            ------                        -----           ------
          /  The   \       -----        /  An   \       /  The   \
         |  IPv4    |-----|Xlate|------|  IPv6   |-----|  IPv6    |
          \Internet/       -----        \Network/       \Internet/

                           &lt;===&gt;

    Figure 1: The Scenarios: "An IPv6 Network to the IPv4 Internet" and
                  "the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 Network"

   In order to perform the translation function between IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses, the translator needs to represent the IPv4 addresses in
   IPv6 and the IPv6 addresses in IPv4.

   To represent the IPv4 addresses in IPv6, a unique, prefix-specific,
   and stateless mapping scheme is defined between IPv4 addresses and
   subsets of IPv6 addresses, so each provider-independent IPv6 address
   block (usually a /32) will have a small portion of IPv6 addresses
   (for example, /40 defined by PREFIX), which is the image of the
   totality of the global IPv4 addresses, as shown in the following
   figure.  The SUFFIX is all zeros.

                            +-+-+-+-+-+-+

   To represent the IPv6 addresses in IPv4, each provider can borrow a
   portion of its IPv4 addresses and map them into IPv6 based on the
   above mapping rule.  These special IPv6 addresses will be physically
   used by IPv6 hosts.  The original IPv4 form of the borrowed addresses
   is the image of these special IPv6 addresses, and it can be accessed
   by the IPv4 Internet, as shown in the following figure.  The SUFFIX
   can either be all zeros, or some other value for future extensions.

   The IVI address format is defined based on an individual ISP's IPv6
   prefix, as shown in the following figure

   where bit 0 to bit 31 are the prefix of ISP(i)'s /32 (e.g., using
   document IPv6 address IPS6=2001:db8::/32) in the CERNET
   implementation, bit 32 to bit 39 are all ones as the identifier of
   the IVI addresses, and bit 40 to bit 71 are embedded global IPv4
   space (IVIG4), presented in hexadecimal format (e.g.,
   2001:db8:ff00::/40).  Note that based on the IVI mapping mechanism,
   an IPv4 /24 is mapped to an IPv6 /64, and an IPv4 /32 is mapped to an
   IPv6 /72.

   The IETF standard for the address format is defined in [<a href="./rfc6052" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>].

   Based on the IVI address mapping rule, routing is straightforward, as
   shown in the following figure

   The IPv4 Internet                                   The IPv6 Internet

                           Figure 5: IVI Routing

   where

   1.  IVI Xlate is a special dual-stack router, with two interfaces,
       one to the IPv4 network and the other to the IPv6 network (it is
       also possible to have a single interface configured with both
       IPv4 and IPv6 addresses).  IVI Xlate can support dynamic routing
       protocols in IPv4 and IPv6 address families.  In the above
       configuration, the static routing configuration can be used.

   2.  Router R1 has an IPv4 route for IVI4(i)/k (k is the prefix length
       of IVI4(i)) with the next hop equal to 192.0.2.1, and this route
       is distributed to the Internet with proper aggregation.

   3.  Router R2 has an IPv6 route for IVIG6(i)/40 with the next hop
       equal to 2001:db8::1, and this route is distributed to the IPv6
       Internet with proper aggregation.

   4.  The IVI translator has an IPv6 route for IVI6(i)/(40+k) with the
       next hop equal to 2001:db8::2.  The IVI translator also has an
       IPv4 default route 0.0.0.0/0 with the next hop equal to
       192.0.2.2.

   Note that the routes described above can be learned/inserted by
   dynamic routing protocols (IGP or BGP) in the IVI translator peering
   with R1 and R2.

   Since both IVI4(i) and IVI6(i) are aggregated to IPS4(i) and IPS6(i)
   in ISP(i)'s border routers, respectively, they will not affect the
   global IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables [<a href="./rfc4632" title='"Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan"'>RFC4632</a>].

   Since the IVI translation is stateless, it can support multihoming
   when the same prefix is used for multiple translators.

   Since the IVI translation can be implemented independently in each
   ISP's network, it can be incrementally deployed in the global
   Internet.

   The IETF standard for IP/ICMP translation is defined in [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>],

   Since the TCP and UDP headers [<a href="./rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>] [<a href="./rfc0768" title='"User Datagram Protocol"'>RFC0768</a>] consist of
   checksums that include the IP header, the recalculation and updating
   of the transport-layer headers MUST be performed.  Note that SIIT
   does not recalculate the transport-layer checksum, since checksum-
   neutral IPv6 addresses are used in SIIT [<a href="./rfc2765" title='"Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT)"'>RFC2765</a>].

   The IETF standard for transport-layer header translation is defined

   When the packet is translated by the IVI translator, due to the
   different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 headers, the IVI6 packets will
   be at least 20 bytes larger than the IVI4 packets, which may exceed
   the MTU of the next link in the IPv6 network.  Therefore, the MTU
   handling and translation between IPv6 fragmentation headers and the
   fragmentation field in the IPv4 headers are necessary; this is
   performed in the IVI translator according to SIIT [<a href="./rfc2765" title='"Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT)"'>RFC2765</a>].

   The IETF standard for fragmentation and MTU handling is defined in
   [<a href="./rfc6145" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>], which contains updated technical specifications.

   For ICMP message translation between IPv4 and IPv6, IVI follows the
   ICMP/ICMPv6 message correspondence as defined in SIIT [<a href="./rfc2765" title='"Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT)"'>RFC2765</a>].
   Note that the ICMP message may be generated by an intermediate router
   whose IPv6 address does not belong to IVIG6(i).  Since ICMP
   translation is important to the path MTU discovery and
   troubleshooting, the IPv4 representation of the non-IVIG6 addresses
   in the ICMP packets is required.  In the current IVI prototype, a
   small IPv4 address block is used to identify the non-IVIG6 addresses.
   This prevents translated ICMP messages from being discarded due to
   unknown or private IP sources.

   which contains updated technical specifications.

   Due to the features of 1-to-1 address mapping and stateless
   operation, IVI can support most of the existing applications, such as
   HTTP, Secure SHell (SSH), and Telnet.  However, some applications are
   designed such that IP addresses are used to identify application-
   layer entities (e.g., FTP).  In these cases, an Application Layer
   Gateway (ALG) is unavoidable, and it can be integrated into the IVI
   translator.

   The discussion of the use of ALGs is in [<a href="./rfc6144" title='"Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation"'>RFC6144</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20IVI%20DNS%20Configuration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The IVI DNS Configuration</span>

   The DNS [<a href="./rfc1035" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>] service is important for the IVI mechanism.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.1.%20%20DNS%20Configuration%20for%20the%20IVI6%28i%29%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  DNS Configuration for the IVI6(i) Addresses</span>

   For providing authoritative DNS service for IVI4(i) and IVI6(i), each
   host name will have both an A record and a AAAA record pointing to
   IVI4(i) and IVI6(i), respectively.  Note that the same name always
   points to a unique host, which is an IVI6(i) host, and it has IVI4(i)
   representation via the IVI translator.

   For resolving the IPv6 form of the global IPv4 space (IVIG6(i)), each
   ISP must provide customized IVI DNS service for the IVI6(i) hosts.
   The IVI DNS server MUST be deployed in a dual-stack environment.
   When the IVI6(i) host queries a AAAA record for an IPv4-only domain
   name, the IVI DNS will query the AAAA record first.  If the AAAA
   record does not exist, the IVI DNS will query the A record and map it
   to IVIG6(i), and return a AAAA record to the IVI6(i) host.  The
   technical specifications for this process are defined in [<a href="./rfc6147" title='"DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6147</a>].

   The IVI mechanism can support IPv4/IPv6 communication of Protocol

   There will be 2^24 group addresses for IPv4 SSM.  The corresponding
   IPv6 SSM group addresses can be defined as shown in the following
   figure.

               Figure 8: IVI Multicast Group Address Mapping

   The source address in IPv6 MUST be IVI6(i) in order to perform
   Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) as required by PIM - Sparse Mode
   (PIM-SM).

   The interoperation of PIM-SM for IPv4 and IPv6 address families can
   either be implemented via an Application Layer Gateway or via static
   joins based on IGMPv3 and Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2
   (MLDv2) in IPv4 and IPv6, respectively.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20IVI%20Host%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  IVI Host Operation</span>

   The IVI6 address has a special format (for example, IVI4=192.0.2.1/32
   and IVI6=2001:db8:ffc0:2:100::/72); therefore, stateless IPv6 address
   autoconfiguration cannot be used.  However, the IVI6 can be assigned
   to the IPv6 end system via manual configuration or stateful
   autoconfiguration via DHCPv6.

   o  For the manual configuration, the host needs to configure the IVI6
      address and the corresponding prefix length, as well as the
      default gateway address and the DNS resolver address.

   o  For the DHCPv6 configuration, the DHCPv6 will assign the IVI6
      address and the DNS resolver address to the host.  The router in
      the subnet should enable router advertisement (RA), since the
      default gateway is learned from the router.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.2.%20%20IPv6%20Source%20Address%20Selection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" id="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  IPv6 Source Address Selection</span>

   Since each IPv6 host may have multiple addresses, it is important for
   the host to use an IVI6(i) address to reach the global IPv4 networks.
   The short-term workaround is to use IVI6(i) as the default source
   IPv6 address of the host, defined as the policy table in [<a href="./rfc3484" title='"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC3484</a>].
   The long-term solution requires that the application should be able
   to select the source addresses for different services.

   deployed between [<a href="#ref-CERNET" title='"CERNET Homepage: http://www.edu.cn/english_1369/index.shtml"'>CERNET</a>] (IPv4-only) and [<a href="#ref-CNGI-CERNET2">CNGI-CERNET2</a>] (IPv6-only)
   since March 2006.  The pure-IPv6 web servers using IVI6 addresses
   [2001:250:ffca:2672:100::] behind the IVI translator can be accessed
   by the IPv4 hosts [<a href="#ref-TEST4" title="">TEST4</a>], and also by the global IPv6 hosts [<a href="#ref-TEST6" title="">TEST6</a>].
   The pure-IPv6 clients using IVI6 addresses behind the IVI translator
   can access IPv4 servers on the IPv4 Internet.

   Two traceroute results are presented in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> to show the
   address mapping of the IVI mechanism.

   IVI6 manual configuration and DHCPv6 configuration of the IPv6 end
   system have also been tested with success.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document presents the prefix-specific and stateless address
   mapping mechanism (IVI) for the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition.
   The IPv4 security and IPv6 security issues should be addressed by
   related documents of each address family and are not included in this
   document.

   However, there are several issues that need special considerations,
   specifically (a) IPsec and its NAT traversal, (b) DNS Security
   Extensions (DNSSEC), and (c) firewall filter rules.

   o  IPsec and its NAT traversal: Since the IVI scheme maintains end-
      to-end address transparency, IPsec could work with or without NAT
      traversal techniques.

   o  DNSSEC: DNSSEC verification will be terminated at the IVI DNS for
      the "A record to AAAA record" translation.  It would be fine to
      have a translation in a local IVI DNS server that also verifies

      DNSSEC, or in the host, if the host both translates the DNS entry
      and again verifies DNSSEC validity.  The DNSSEC discussion is in
      [<a href="./rfc6147" title='"DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6147</a>].

   o  Firewall filter rules: Since the IVI scheme maintains the end-to-
      end address transparency and there is a unique mapping between
      IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, the firewall filter rule can therefore be
      implemented for one address family, or mapped to another address
      family and implemented in that address family.  However, the
      current IPv6 routers may only support the access-list or uRPF
      (unicast Reverse Path Forwarding) for the prefix length shorter
      than /64; there may a practical constraint for the construction of
      such rules.

   Except for the issues discussed above, we have not found special
   security problems introduced by the IVI translation in our
   experiments.
