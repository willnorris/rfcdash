           <span class="h1">Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router Links</span>

Abstract

   On inter-router point-to-point links, it is useful, for security and
   other reasons, to use 127-bit IPv6 prefixes.  Such a practice
   parallels the use of 31-bit prefixes in IPv4.  This document
   specifies the motivation for, and usages of, 127-bit IPv6 prefix
   lengths on inter-router point-to-point links.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC4291">RFC4291</a>] specifies that interface IDs for all unicast addresses,
   except those that start with the binary value 000, are required to be
   64 bits long and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64 format.  In
   addition, it defines the Subnet-Router anycast address, which is
   intended to be used for applications where a node needs to
   communicate with any one of the set of routers on a link.

   Some operators have been using 127-bit prefixes, but this has been
   discouraged due to conflicts with Subnet-Router anycast [<a href="./rfc3627" title='"Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers Considered Harmful"'>RFC3627</a>].
   However, using 64-bit prefixes creates security issues that are
   particularly problematic on inter-router links, and there are other
   valid reasons to use prefixes longer than 64 bits, in particular /127
   (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>).

   This document provides a rationale for using 127-bit prefix lengths,
   reevaluates the reasons why doing so was considered harmful, and
   specifies how /127 prefixes can be used on inter-router links
   configured for use as point-to-point links.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Scope%20of%20This%20Memo"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Scope of This Memo</span>

   This document is applicable to cases where operators assign specific
   addresses on inter-router point-to-point links and do not rely on
   link-local addresses.  Many operators assign specific addresses for
   the purposes of network monitoring, reverse DNS resolution for
   traceroute and other management tools, External Border Gateway
   Protocol (EBGP) [<a href="./rfc4271" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] peering sessions, and so on.

   For the purposes of this document, an inter-router point-to-point
   link is a link to which only two routers and no hosts are attached.
   This may include Ethernet links that are configured to be point-to-
   point.  Links between a router and a host, or links to which both
   routers and hosts are attached, are out of scope of this document.

   The recommendations in this document do not apply to the link-local
   address scope.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Problems%20Identified%20with%20127-Bit%20Prefix%20Lengths%20in%20the%20Past"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Problems Identified with 127-Bit Prefix Lengths in the Past</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC3627">RFC3627</a>] discourages the use of 127-bit prefix lengths due to
   conflicts with the Subnet-Router anycast addresses, while stating
   that the utility of Subnet-Router anycast for point-to-point links is
   questionable.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5375">RFC5375</a>] also says the usage of 127-bit prefix lengths is not valid
   and should be strongly discouraged, but the stated reason for doing
   this is to be in compliance with [<a href="./rfc3627" title='"Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers Considered Harmful"'>RFC3627</a>].

   Though the analyses in the RFCs are correct, operational experience
   with IPv6 has shown that /127 prefixes can be used successfully.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Reasons%20for%20Using%20Longer%20Prefixes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Reasons for Using Longer Prefixes</span>

   There are reasons network operators use IPv6 prefix lengths greater
   than 64, particularly 127, for inter-router point-to-point links.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.1.%20%20Ping-Pong%20Issue"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" id="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Ping-Pong Issue</span>

   A forwarding loop may occur on a point-to-point link with a prefix
   length shorter than 127.  This does not affect interfaces that
   perform Neighbor Discovery, but some point-to-point links, which use
   a medium such as the Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), do not use
   Neighbor Discovery.  As a consequence, configuring any prefix length
   shorter than 127 bits on these links can create an attack vector in
   the network.

   The ping-pong issue happens in the case of IPv4 as well.  But due to
   the scarcity of IPv4 address space, the current practice is to assign
   long prefix lengths such as /30 or /31 [<a href="./rfc3021" title='"Using 31-Bit Prefixes on IPv4 Point-to-Point Links"'>RFC3021</a>] on point-to-point
   links; thus, the problem did not come to the fore.

   The latest ICMPv6 specification [<a href="./rfc4443" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC4443</a>] mitigates this problem by
   specifying that a router receiving a packet on a point-to-point link,
   where the packet is destined to an address within a subnet assigned
   to that same link (other than one of the receiving router's own
   addresses), MUST NOT forward the packet back on that link.  Instead,
   it SHOULD generate an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message (code 3)
   in response.  This check is on the forwarding processing path, so it
   may have performance impact.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.2.%20%20Neighbor%20Cache%20Exhaustion%20Issue"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" id="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Neighbor Cache Exhaustion Issue</span>

   As described in <a href="./rfc3756#section-4.3.2">SectionÂ 4.3.2 of [RFC3756]</a>, the use of a 64-bit
   prefix length on an inter-router link that uses Neighbor Discovery
   (e.g., Ethernet) potentially allows for denial-of-service attacks on
   the routers on the link.

   Consider an Ethernet link between two routers, A and B, to which a
   /64 subnet has been assigned.  A packet sent to any address on the
   /64 (except the addresses of A and B) will cause the router
   attempting to forward it to create a new cache entry in INCOMPLETE
   state, send a Neighbor Solicitation message on the link, start a
   retransmit timer, and so on [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

   By sending a continuous stream of packets to a large number of the
   2^64 - 3 unassigned addresses on the link (one for each router and
   one for Subnet-Router anycast), an attacker can create a large number
   of neighbor cache entries and cause one of the routers to send a
   large number of Neighbor Solicitation packets that will never receive



<span class="grey">Kohno, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6164">RFC 6164</a>                   IPv6 prefixlen p2p                 April 2011</span>


   replies, thereby consuming large amounts of memory and processing
   resources.  Sending the packets to one of the 2^24 addresses on the
   link that has the same Solicited-Node multicast address as one of the
   routers also causes the victim to spend large amounts of processing
   time discarding useless Neighbor Solicitation messages.

   Careful implementation and rate-limiting can limit the impact of such
   an attack, but are unlikely to neutralize it completely.  Rate-
   limiting Neighbor Solicitation messages will reduce CPU usage, and
   following the garbage-collection recommendations in [<a href="./rfc4861" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] will
   maintain reachability, but if the link is down and neighbor cache
   entries have expired while the attack is ongoing, legitimate traffic
   (for example, BGP sessions) over the link might never be
   re-established, because the routers cannot resolve each others' IPv6
   addresses to link-layer addresses.

   This attack is not specific to point-to-point links, but is
   particularly harmful in the case of point-to-point backbone links,
   which may carry large amounts of traffic to many destinations over
   long distances.

   While there are a number of ways to mitigate this kind of issue,
   assigning /127 subnets eliminates it completely.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.3.%20%20Other%20Reasons"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" id="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Other Reasons</span>

   Though address space conservation considerations are less important
   for IPv6 than they are in IPv4, some operators prefer not to assign
   /64s to individual point-to-point links.  Instead, they may be able
   to number all of their point-to-point links out of a single /64 or a
   small number of /64s.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.%20%20Recommendations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" id="section-6">6</a>.  Recommendations</span>

   Routers MUST support the assignment of /127 prefixes on point-to-
   point inter-router links.  Routers MUST disable Subnet-Router anycast
   for the prefix when /127 prefixes are used.

   When assigning and using any /127 prefixes, the following
   considerations apply.  Some addresses have special meanings, in
   particular addresses corresponding to reserved anycast addresses.
   When assigning prefixes (and addresses) to links, care should be
   taken to ensure that addresses reserved for such purposes aren't
   inadvertently assigned and used as unicast addresses.  Otherwise,
   nodes may receive packets that they are not intended to receive.
   Specifically, assuming that a number of point-to-point links will be
   numbered out of a single /64 prefix:

   (a)  Addresses with all zeros in the rightmost 64 bits SHOULD NOT be
        assigned as unicast addresses, to avoid colliding with the
        Subnet-Router anycast address [<a href="./rfc4291" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>].

   (b)  Addresses in which the rightmost 64 bits are assigned the
        highest 128 values (i.e., ffff:ffff:ffff:ff7f to ffff:ffff:ffff:
        ffff) SHOULD NOT be used as unicast addresses, to avoid
