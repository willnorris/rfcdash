Abstract

   Some implementations of IP Security (IPsec) may want to use a
   pseudo-random function derived from the Advanced Encryption Standard
   (AES).  This document describes such an algorithm, called
   AES-XCBC-PRF-128.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-AES-XCBC-MAC">AES-XCBC-MAC</a>] describes a method to use the Advanced Encryption
   Standard (AES) as a message authentication code (MAC) whose output is
   96 bits long.  While 96 bits is considered appropriate for a MAC, it
   is too short to be useful as a long-lived pseudo-random function
   (PRF) in either IKE version 1 or version 2.  Both versions of IKE use
   the PRF to create keys in a fashion that is dependent on the length
   of the output of the PRF.  Using a PRF that has 96 bits of output
   creates keys that are easier to attack with brute force than a PRF
   that uses 128 bits of output.

   Fortunately, there is a very simple method to use much of
   [<a href="#ref-AES-XCBC-MAC" title='"The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use With IPsec"'>AES-XCBC-MAC</a>] as a PRF whose output is 128 bits: omit the step that
   truncates the 128-bit value to 96 bits.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4434">RFC 4434</a>               AES-XCBC-PRF-128 Algorithm          February 2006</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Differences%20from%20RFC%203664"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Differences from <a href="./rfc3664">RFC 3664</a></span>

   This document specifies the same algorithm as <a href="./rfc3664">RFC 3664</a> except that
   the restriction that keys be exactly 128 bits from [<a href="#ref-AES-XCBC-MAC" title='"The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use With IPsec"'>AES-XCBC-MAC</a>] is
   removed.  Implementations of <a href="./rfc3664">RFC 3664</a> will have the same
   bits-on-the-wire results as this algorithm; the only difference is
   that keys that were not equal in length to 128 bits will no longer be
   rejected but instead will be made 128 bits.

   IKEv2 [<a href="#ref-IKEv2" title='"Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol"'>IKEv2</a>] uses PRFs for multiple purposes, most notably for
   generating keying material and authentication of the IKE_SA.  The
   IKEv2 specification differentiates between PRFs with fixed key sizes
   and those with variable key sizes.

   When the PRF described in this document is used with IKEv2, the PRF
   is considered fixed-length for generating keying material but
   variable-length for authentication.  That is, when generating keying
   material, "half the bits must come from Ni and half from Nr, taking
   the first bits of each" as described in IKEv2, <a href="#section-2.14">section 2.14</a>; but for
   authenticating with shared secrets (IKEv2, <a href="#section-2.16">section 2.16</a>), the shared
   secret does not have to be 128 bits long.  This somewhat tortured
   logic allows IKEv2 implementations that use the fixed-length-key
   semantics from <a href="./rfc3664">RFC 3664</a> to interoperate with implementations that use
   the variable-length-key semantics of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20The%20AES-XCBC-PRF-128%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  The AES-XCBC-PRF-128 Algorithm</span>

   The AES-XCBC-PRF-128 algorithm is identical to [<a href="#ref-AES-XCBC-MAC" title='"The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use With IPsec"'>AES-XCBC-MAC</a>] except
   for two changes.  First, the key length restriction of exactly 128
   bits in [<a href="#ref-AES-XCBC-MAC" title='"The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use With IPsec"'>AES-XCBC-MAC</a>] is eliminated, as described below; this brings
   AES-XCBC-PRF-128 in alignment with HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-MD5 when they
   are used as PRFs in IKE.  Second, the truncation step in section 4.3
   of [<a href="#ref-AES-XCBC-MAC" title='"The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use With IPsec"'>AES-XCBC-MAC</a>] is *not* performed; that is, there is no processing
   after section 4.2 of [<a href="#ref-AES-XCBC-MAC" title='"The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use With IPsec"'>AES-XCBC-MAC</a>].

   The key for AES-XCBC-PRF-128 is created as follows:

   o  If the key is exactly 128 bits long, use it as-is.

   o  If the key has fewer than 128 bits, lengthen it to exactly 128
      bits by padding it on the right with zero bits.

   o  If the key is 129 bits or longer, shorten it to exactly 128 bits
      by performing the steps in AES-XCBC-PRF-128 (that is, the
      algorithm described in this document).  In that re-application of
      this algorithm, the key is 128 zero bits; the message is the
      too-long current key.

   The security provided by AES-XCBC-MAC-PRF is based on the strengths
   of AES and HMAC.  At the time of this writing, there are no known
   practical cryptographic attacks against AES, AES-XCBC-MAC-PRF, or
   HMACs.

   As is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of its strength
   lies in the security of the key management mechanism, the strength of
   the associated secret key, and the correctness of the implementations
   in all the participating systems.  [<a href="#ref-AES-XCBC-MAC" title='"The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use With IPsec"'>AES-XCBC-MAC</a>] contains test
   vectors to assist in verifying the correctness of the
   AES-XCBC-MAC-PRF code.  The test vectors all show the full MAC value
   before it is truncated to 96 bits.  The PRF makes use of the full MAC
   value, not the truncated one.
