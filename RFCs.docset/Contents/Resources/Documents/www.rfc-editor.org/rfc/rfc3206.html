Abstract

   This memo proposes two response codes: SYS and AUTH, which enable
   clients to unambiguously determine an optimal response to an
   authentication failure.  In addition, a new capability (AUTH-RESP-
   CODE) is defined.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   <a href="./rfc2449">RFC 2449</a> [<a href="#ref-POP3-EXT" title='"POP3 Extension Mechanism"'>POP3-EXT</a>] defined extended [<a href="#ref-POP3" title='"Post Office Protocol -- Version 3"'>POP3</a>] response codes, to give
   clients more information about errors so clients can respond more
   appropriately.  In addition to the mechanism, two initial response
   codes were defined (IN-USE and LOGIN-DELAY), in an attempt to
   differentiate between authentication failures related to user
   credentials, and other errors.

   In practice, these two response codes, while helpful, do not go far
   enough.  This memo proposes two additional response codes:  SYS and
   AUTH, which enable clients to unambiguously determine an optimal
   response to an authentication failure.

   In addition, a new capability (AUTH-RESP-CODE) is defined.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Conventions%20Used%20in%20this%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Conventions Used in this Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORDS</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Background</span>

   <a href="./rfc2449">RFC 2449</a> [<a href="#ref-POP3-EXT" title='"POP3 Extension Mechanism"'>POP3-EXT</a>] introduced the IN-USE and LOGIN-DELAY response
   codes.  The intent is to allow clients to clearly determine the
   underlying cause of a failure in order to respond.  For example,
   clients need to know if the user should be asked for new credentials,
   or if the POP3 session should simply be tried again later.  (Some
   deployed POP3 clients attempt to parse the text of authentication
   failure errors, looking for strings known to be issued by various
   servers which indicate the mailbox is locked.)

   IN-USE indicates that an exclusive lock could not be obtained for the
   user's mailbox, probably because another POP3 session is in progress.
   LOGIN-DELAY informs the client that the user has not waited long
   enough before authenticating again.

   However, there are other error conditions which do not require new
   credentials, some of which should be brought to the user's attention.

   Despite the IN-USE and LOGIN-DELAY responses, clients cannot be sure
   if any other error requires new user credentials.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3206">RFC 3206</a>          The SYS and AUTH POP Response Codes      February 2002</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20The%20SYS%20Response%20Code"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  The SYS Response Code</span>

   The SYS response code announces that a failure is due to a system
   error, as opposed to the user's credentials or an external condition.
   It is hierarchical, with two possible second-level codes: TEMP and
   PERM.  (Case is not significant at any level of the hierarchy.)

   SYS/TEMP indicates a problem which is likely to be temporary in
   nature, and therefore there is no need to alarm the user, unless the
   failure persists.  Examples might include a central resource which is
   currently locked or otherwise temporarily unavailable, insufficient
   free disk or memory, etc.

   SYS/PERM is used for problems which are unlikely to be resolved
   without intervention.  It is appropriate to alert the user and
   suggest that the organization's support or assistance personnel be
   contacted.  Examples include corrupted mailboxes, system
   configuration errors, etc.

   The SYS response code is valid with an -ERR response to any command.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20The%20AUTH%20Response%20Code"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  The AUTH Response Code</span>

   The AUTH response code informs the client that there is a problem
   with the user's credentials.  This might be an incorrect password, an
   unknown user name, an expired account, an attempt to authenticate in
   violation of policy (such as from an invalid location or during an
   unauthorized time), or some other problem.

   The AUTH response code is valid with an -ERR response to any
   authentication command including AUTH, USER (see note), PASS, or
   APOP.

   Servers which include the AUTH response code with any authentication
   failure SHOULD support the CAPA command [<a href="#ref-POP3-EXT" title='"POP3 Extension Mechanism"'>POP3-EXT</a>] and SHOULD include
   the AUTH-RESP-CODE capability in the CAPA response.  AUTH-RESP-CODE
   assures the client that only errors with the AUTH code are caused by
   credential problems.

      NOTE:  Returning the AUTH response code to the USER command
      reveals to the client that the specified user exists.  It is
      strongly RECOMMENDED that the server not issue this response code
      to the USER command.

   Discussion:
       The AUTH-RESP-CODE capability indicates that the server includes
       the AUTH response code with any authentication error caused by a
       problem with the user's credentials.

   IANA has added the AUTH-RESP-CODE capability to the list of POP3
   capabilities (established by <a href="./rfc2449">RFC 2449</a> [<a href="#ref-POP3-EXT" title='"POP3 Extension Mechanism"'>POP3-EXT</a>]).

   IANA has also added the SYS and AUTH response codes to the list of
