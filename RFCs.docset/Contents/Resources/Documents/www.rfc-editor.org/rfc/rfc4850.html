Abstract

   The Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) protocol,
   described in <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a>, allows for extension items to the protocol in
   the form of Private or Public Extension Keys.  This document
   describes a Public Extension Key for the purpose of enhancing iSCSI
   supportability.  The key accomplishes this objective by allowing
   iSCSI nodes to communicate architecture details during the iSCSI
   login sequence.  The receiving node can then use this information for
   enhanced logging and support.  This document updates <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a> to
   allow iSCSI extension items to be defined by standards track RFCs and
   experimental RFCs in addition to informational RFCs.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4850">RFC 4850</a>                iSCSI Node Architecture               April 2007</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Overview</span>

   This document describes a declarative Public Extension Key, as
   defined by <a href="./rfc3720#section-12.22">Section 12.22 of RFC 3720</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)"'>2</a>], that may be used to
   communicate additional iSCSI node information to the peer node in a
   session.  The information carried in the described key has been found
   to be valuable in real iSCSI customer environments as initiator and
   target vendors collaborate to resolve technical issues and better
   understand the interaction of iSCSI implementations.

   The key has been modeled after the HTTP "Server" and "User-Agent"
   header fields as specified in Sections <a href="#section-14.38">14.38</a> and <a href="#section-14.43">14.43</a> of <a href="./rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>
   [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>3</a>], with the text-value(s) of the key roughly equivalent to Product
   Tokens in <a href="./rfc2616#section-3.8">Section 3.8 of RFC 2616</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>3</a>].  Note, however, that the text-
   value(s) in the key's list-of-values MUST conform to the Text Format
   as specified in <a href="./rfc3720#section-5.1">Section 5.1 of RFC 3720</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)"'>2</a>].

   The key is sent during operational parameter negotiation of an iSCSI
   session's login phase.  The intended use of this key is to provide
   enhanced logging and support capabilities, and to enable collection
   of iSCSI implementation and usage information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" id="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>1</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Definition</span>

   The definition of the key is as follows, conforming to Sections <a href="#section-11">11</a>
   and 12 of <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)"'>2</a>], with example list-of-values conforming to
   <a href="./rfc3720#section-5.1">Section 5.1 of RFC 3720</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)"'>2</a>].

   The key is defined with a use of "LO", making it a Leading Only key,
   and does not modify Sections <a href="#section-11">11</a> or <a href="#section-12">12</a> of <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)"'>2</a>].  Thus, the key
   MUST only be sent on the leading connection, MUST NOT be changed
   after the leading connection login, and MUST only be sent after the
   security negotiation login stage has completed (during operational
   negotiation login stage).  The key may be sent during normal or
   discovery sessions.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20X%23NodeArchitecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  X#NodeArchitecture</span>

   Use: LO, Declarative
   Senders: Initiator and Target
   Scope: SW

   X#NodeArchitecture=&lt;list-of-values&gt;

   Examples:

      X#NodeArchitecture=ExampleOS/v1234,ExampleInc_SW_Initiator/1.05a
      X#NodeArchitecture=ExampleInc_HW_Initiator/4010,Firmware/2.0.0.5
      X#NodeArchitecture=ExampleInc_SW_Initiator/2.1,CPU_Arch/i686

   The initiator or target declares the details of its iSCSI node
   architecture to the remote endpoint.  These details may include, but
   are not limited to, iSCSI vendor software, firmware, or hardware
   versions, the OS version, or hardware architecture.

   The length of the key value (total length of the list-of-values) MUST
   NOT be greater than 255 bytes.

   X#NodeArchitecture MUST NOT be redeclared.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Implementation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Implementation</span>

   Functional behavior of the iSCSI node (this includes the iSCSI
   protocol logic -- the SCSI, iSCSI, and TCP/IP protocols) MUST NOT
   depend on the presence, absence, or content of the key.  The key MUST
   NOT be used by iSCSI nodes for interoperability, or exclusion of
   other nodes.  To ensure proper use, key values SHOULD be set by the
   node itself, and there SHOULD NOT be provisions for the key values to
   contain user-defined text.

   Nodes implementing this key MUST choose one of the following
   implementation options:

      o  only transmit the key,
      o  only log the key values received from other nodes, or
      o  both transmit and log the key values.

   Each node choosing to implement transmission of the key values MUST
   be prepared to handle the response of <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)"'>2</a>] compliant nodes
   that do not understand the key (<a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)"'>2</a>] states that compliant
   nodes MUST respond with X#NodeArchitecture=NotUnderstood).

   Nodes that implement transmission and/or logging of the key values
   may also implement administrative mechanisms that disable and/or



<span class="grey">Wysochanski                 Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4850">RFC 4850</a>                iSCSI Node Architecture               April 2007</span>


   change the logging and key transmission detail (see Security
   Considerations).  Thus, a valid behavior for this key may be that a
   node is completely silent (the node does not transmit any key value,
   and simply discards any key values it receives without issuing a
   NotUnderstood response).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This extension key transmits specific implementation details about
   the node that sends it; such details may be considered sensitive in
   some environments.  For example, if a certain software or firmware
   version is known to contain security weaknesses, announcing the
   presence of that version via this key may not be desirable.  The
   countermeasures for this security concern are:

   o  sending less detailed information in the key values,

   o  not sending the extension key, or

   o  using IPsec to provide confidentiality for the iSCSI connection on
      which the key is sent (see <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)"'>2</a>] and <a href="./rfc3723">RFC 3723</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Securing Block Storage Protocols over IP"'>4</a>]).

   To support the first and second countermeasures, all implementations
   of this extension key MUST provide an administrative mechanism to
   disable sending the key.  In addition, all implementations SHOULD
   provide an administrative mechanism to configure a verbosity level of
   the key value, thereby controlling the amount of information sent.
   For example, a lower verbosity might enable transmission of node
   architecture component names only, but no version numbers.

   The choice of which countermeasure is most appropriate depends on the
   environment.  However, sending less detailed information in the key
   values may be an acceptable countermeasure in many environments,
   since it provides a compromise between sending too much information
   and the other more complete countermeasures of not sending the key at
   all or using IPsec.

   In addition to security considerations involving transmission of the
   key contents, any logging method(s) used for the key values MUST keep
   the information secure from intruders.  For all implementations, the
   requirements to address this security concern are:

   o  Display of the log MUST only be possible with administrative
      rights to the node.

   o  Options to disable logging to disk and to keep logs for a fixed
      duration SHOULD be provided.

   Finally, it is important to note that different nodes may have
   different levels of risk, and these differences may affect the
   implementation.  The components of risk include assets, threats, and
   vulnerabilities.  Consider the following example iSCSI nodes, which
   demonstrate differences in assets and vulnerabilities of the nodes,
   and as a result, differences in implementation:

   o  One iSCSI target based on a special-purpose operating system.
      Since the iSCSI target controls access to the data storage
      containing company assets, the asset level is seen as very high.
      Also, because of the special-purpose operating system, in which
      vulnerabilities are less well-known, the vulnerability level is
      viewed as low.

   o  Multiple iSCSI initiators in a blade farm, each running a general-
      purpose operating system.  The asset level of each node is viewed
      as low, since blades are replaceable and low cost.  However, the
      vulnerability level is viewed as high, since there are many well-
      known vulnerabilities to the general-purpose operating system.

   For the above target, an appropriate implementation might be logging
   of received key values, but no transmission of the key.  For the
   initiators, an appropriate implementation might be transmission of
   the key, but no logging of received key values.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   The standards action of this document updates <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a> to allow any
   iSCSI extension item, specifically X# extension text keys, Y# digest
   algorithms, and Z# authentication methods, to be defined by a
   standards track, experimental, or informational RFC.  This document
   is a standards track RFC that defines an X# extension text key.

   IANA registered this key as follows:

   o  Key Name: X#NodeArchitecture

   o  Description: Node architecture details

   o  Reference: [<a href="./rfc4850">RFC4850</a>]

   The update to <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a> to allow additional types of RFCs for iSCSI
   Extension items has the same effect as if the following changes were
   made to the text of <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a> (RFC text cannot be changed after
   publication):

   1) In <a href="#section-11.1">Section 11.1</a>, the requirement that Z# Authentication methods
      "MUST be described by an informational RFC." is changed to "MUST
      be described by a standards track RFC, an experimental RFC, or an
      informational RFC."

   2) In <a href="#section-12.1">Section 12.1</a>, the requirement that Y# Digest algorithms "MUST
      be described by an informational RFC." is changed to "MUST be
      described by a standards track RFC, an experimental RFC, or an
      informational RFC."

   3) In <a href="#section-12.22">Section 12.22</a>, the requirement that X# text keys "MUST be
      described by an informational RFC." is changed to "MUST be
      described by a standards track RFC, an experimental RFC, or an
      informational RFC."

   4) In <a href="#section-13.3">Section 13.3</a>, the description of allowed RFC types for
      extension items is changed from "The RFC may be informational
      rather than Standards-Track," to "The RFC MUST be standards track,
      experimental, or informational,"

   5) In <a href="#section-13.5.2">Section 13.5.2</a>, the phrase "standards track" is changed to
      "standards track or experimental" in the last sentence of the
      first paragraph, so that the sentence reads: "If the specification
      is a standards track or experimental document, the usual IETF
      procedures for such documents are followed."

   The registries for iSCSI extension items should be managed as if
   these changes had been made to the text of <a href="./rfc3720">RFC 3720</a>.
