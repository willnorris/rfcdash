Abstract

   When IP multicast trees created by Protocol Independent Multicast -
   Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) in Any-Source Multicast (ASM) mode need to pass
   through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable to map such trees to
   Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths (P2MP LSPs).  This document
   describes how to accomplish this in the case where such P2MP LSPs are
   established using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Extensions for
   P2MP and Multipoint-to-Multipoint LSPs: Multipoint LDP (mLDP).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7442">RFC 7442</a>               PIM-SM over P2MP mLDP LSPs          February 2015</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC6826">RFC6826</a>] describes how to map Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched
   Paths (P2MP LSPs) created by mLDP [<a href="./rfc6388" title='"Label Distribution Protocol Extensions for Point- to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6388</a>] to multicast trees
   created by Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) in
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) mode [<a href="./rfc4607" title='"Source-Specific Multicast for IP"'>RFC4607</a>].  This document
   describes how to map mLDP P2MP trees to multicast trees created by
   PIM-SM in Any-Source Multicast (ASM) mode.  It describes two possible
   mechanisms for doing this.

   The first mechanism, described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, is OPTIONAL for
   implementations, but the second mechanism, described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, is
   REQUIRED for all implementations claiming conformance to this
   specification.

   Note that from a deployment point of view these two mechanisms are
   mutually exclusive.  That is, on the same network one could deploy
   either one of the mechanisms, but not both.

   The reader of this document is expected to be familiar with PIM-SM
   [<a href="./rfc4601" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC4601</a>] and mLDP [<a href="./rfc6388" title='"Label Distribution Protocol Extensions for Point- to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6388</a>].

   This document relies on the procedures in [<a href="./rfc6826" title='"Multipoint LDP In-Band Signaling for Point-to- Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6826</a>] to support source
   trees.  For example, following these procedures a Label Switching
   Router (LSR) may initiate an mLDP Label Map with the Transit
   IPv4/IPv6 Source TLV for (S,G) when receiving a PIM (S,G) Join.

   This document uses BGP Source Active auto-discovery routes, as
   defined in [<a href="./rfc6514" title='"BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6514</a>].  For the sake of brevity in the rest of this
   document, we'll refer to these routes as just "Source Active
   auto-discovery routes".

   Consider a deployment scenario where the service provider has
   provisioned the network in such a way that the Rendezvous Point (RP)
   for a particular ASM group G is always between the receivers and the
   sources.  If the network is provisioned in this manner, the ingress
   Provider Edge (PE) for (S,G) is always the same as the ingress PE for
   the RP, and thus the Source Active auto-discovery (A-D) routes are
   never needed.  If it is known a priori that the network is
   provisioned in this manner, mLDP in-band signaling can be supported
   using a different set of procedures, as specified in [<a href="./rfc7438" title='"Multipoint LDP (mLDP) In-Band Signaling with Wildcards"'>RFC7438</a>].  A
   service provider will provision the PE routers to use either the
   procedures in [<a href="./rfc7438" title='"Multipoint LDP (mLDP) In-Band Signaling with Wildcards"'>RFC7438</a>] or those described in this document.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7442">RFC 7442</a>               PIM-SM over P2MP mLDP LSPs          February 2015</span>


   Like [<a href="./rfc6826" title='"Multipoint LDP In-Band Signaling for Point-to- Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6826</a>], each IP multicast tree is mapped one-to-one to a P2MP
   LSP in the MPLS network.  This type of service works well if the
   number of LSPs that are created is under the control of the MPLS
   network operator, or if the number of LSPs for a particular service
   is known to be limited.

   It is to be noted that the existing BGP Multicast VPN (MVPN)
   procedures [<a href="./rfc6514" title='"BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6514</a>] can be used to map Internet IP multicast trees
   to P2MP LSPs.  These procedures would accomplish this for IP
   multicast trees created by PIM-SM in SSM mode, as well as for IP
   multicast trees created by PIM-SM in ASM mode.  Furthermore, these
   procedures would also support the ability to aggregate multiple IP
   multicast trees to one P2MP LSP in the MPLS network.  The details of
   this particular approach are out of scope for this document.

   This document assumes that a given LSR may have some interfaces that
   are IP multicast capable, while other interfaces would be MPLS
   capable.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Mechanism%201%20-%20Non-transitive%20Mapping%20of%20IP%20Multicast%20Shared%20Trees"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Mechanism 1 - Non-transitive Mapping of IP Multicast Shared Trees</span>

   This mechanism does not transit IP multicast shared trees over the
   MPLS network.  Therefore, when an LSR creates (*,G) state (as a
   result of receiving PIM messages on one of its IP multicast
   interfaces), the LSR does not propagate this state in mLDP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20Originating%20Source%20Active%20Auto-discovery%20Routes%20%28Mechanism%201%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Originating Source Active Auto-discovery Routes (Mechanism 1)</span>

   Whenever (as a result of receiving either PIM Register or Multicast
   Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) messages) an RP discovers a new
   multicast source, the RP SHOULD originate a Source Active
   auto-discovery route.  The route carries a single MCAST-VPN Network
   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) [<a href="./rfc6514" title='"BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6514</a>], constructed as
   follows:

   + The Route Distinguisher (RD) in this NLRI is set to 0.

   + The Multicast Source field is set to S.  This could be either an
     IPv4 or an IPv6 address.  The Multicast Source Length field is set
     appropriately to reflect the address type.





<span class="grey">Rekhter, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>

   + The Multicast Group field is set to G.  This could be either an
     IPv4 or an IPv6 address.  The Multicast Group Length field is set
     appropriately to reflect this address type.

   To constrain distribution of the Source Active auto-discovery route
   to the Autonomous System (AS) of the advertising RP, this route
   SHOULD carry the NO_EXPORT Community ([<a href="./rfc1997" title='"BGP Communities Attribute"'>RFC1997</a>]).

   Using the normal BGP procedures, the Source Active auto-discovery
   route is propagated to all other LSRs within the AS.

   Whenever the RP discovers that the source is no longer active, the RP
   MUST withdraw the Source Active auto-discovery route if such a route
   was previously advertised by the RP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Receiving%20Source%20Active%20Auto-discovery%20Routes%20by%20LSR"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Receiving Source Active Auto-discovery Routes by LSR</span>

   Consider an LSR that has some of its interfaces capable of IP
   multicast and some capable of MPLS multicast.

   When, as a result of receiving PIM messages on one of its IP
   multicast interfaces, an LSR creates in its Tree Information Base
   (TIB) a new (*,G) entry with a non-empty outgoing interface list that
   contains one or more IP multicast interfaces, the LSR MUST check to
   see if it has any Source Active auto-discovery routes for that G.  If
   there is such a route, S of that route is reachable via an MPLS
   interface, and the LSR does not have (S,G) state in its TIB for (S,G)
   carried in the route, then the LSR originates the mLDP Label Map with
   the Transit IPv4/IPv6 Source TLV carrying (S,G), as specified in
   [<a href="./rfc6826" title='"Multipoint LDP In-Band Signaling for Point-to- Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6826</a>].

   When an LSR receives a new Source Active auto-discovery route, the
   LSR MUST check to see if its TIB contains a (*,G) entry with the same
   G as that carried in the Source Active auto-discovery route.  If such
   an entry is found, S is reachable via an MPLS interface, and the LSR
   does not have (S,G) state in its TIB for (S,G) carried in the route,
   then the LSR originates an mLDP Label Map with the Transit IPv4/IPv6
   Source TLV carrying (S,G), as specified in [<a href="./rfc6826" title='"Multipoint LDP In-Band Signaling for Point-to- Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6826</a>].

   The creation and deletion of (S,G,RPT-bit) PIM state ([<a href="./rfc4601" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC4601</a>]) on
   an LSR that resulted from receiving PIM messages on one of its IP
   multicast interfaces do not result in any mLDP and/or BGP actions by
   the LSR.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7442">RFC 7442</a>               PIM-SM over P2MP mLDP LSPs          February 2015</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Mechanism%202%20-%20Transitive%20Mapping%20of%20IP%20Multicast%20Shared%20Trees"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Mechanism 2 - Transitive Mapping of IP Multicast Shared Trees</span>

   This mechanism enables transit of IP multicast shared trees over the
   MPLS network.  Therefore, when an LSR creates (*,G) state as a result
   of receiving PIM messages on one of its IP multicast interfaces, the
   LSR propagates this state in mLDP, as described below.

   Note that in the deployment scenarios where, for a given G, none of
   the PEs originate an (S,G) mLDP Label Map with the Transit IPv4/IPv6
   Source TLV, no Source Active auto-discovery routes will be used.  One
   other scenario where no Source Active auto-discovery routes will be
   used is described in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> ("Originating Source Active
   Auto-discovery Routes (Mechanism 2)").  In all of these scenarios,
   the only part of Mechanism 2 that is used is the in-band signaling
   for IP Multicast Shared Trees, as described in the next section.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.1.%20%20In-Band%20Signaling%20for%20IP%20Multicast%20Shared%20Trees"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  In-Band Signaling for IP Multicast Shared Trees</span>

   To provide support for in-band mLDP signaling of IP multicast shared
   trees, this document defines two new mLDP TLVs: the Transit IPv4
   Shared Tree TLV and the Transit IPv6 Shared Tree TLV.

   These two TLVs have exactly the same encoding/format as the IPv4/IPv6
   Source Tree TLVs defined in [<a href="./rfc6826" title='"Multipoint LDP In-Band Signaling for Point-to- Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6826</a>], except that instead of the
   Source field they have an RP field that carries the address of the
   RP, as follows:

   Procedures for in-band signaling for IP multicast shared trees with

   IP multicast source trees, as specified in [<a href="./rfc6826" title='"Multipoint LDP In-Band Signaling for Point-to- Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6826</a>], except that
   while the latter signals (S,G) state using Transit IPv4/IPv6 Source
   TLVs, the former signals (*,G) state using Transit IPv4/IPv6 Shared
   Tree TLVs.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Originating%20Source%20Active%20Auto-discovery%20Routes%20%28Mechanism%202%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Originating Source Active Auto-discovery Routes (Mechanism 2)</span>

   Consider an LSR that has some of its interfaces capable of IP
   multicast and some capable of MPLS multicast.

   Whenever such an LSR creates an (S,G) state as a result of receiving
   an mLDP Label Map with the Transit IPv4/IPv6 Source TLV for (S,G),
   the LSR MUST originate a Source Active auto-discovery route if all of
   the following are true:

   + S is reachable via one of the IP-multicast-capable interfaces,

   + the LSR determines that G is in the PIM-SM in ASM mode range, and

   + the LSR does not have a (*,G) state with one of the IP-multicast-
     capable interfaces as an incoming interface (iif) for that state.

   The route carries a single MCAST-VPN NLRI, constructed as follows:

   + The RD in this NLRI is set to 0.

   + The Multicast Source field is set to S.  The Multicast Source
     Length field is set appropriately to reflect this address type.

   + The Multicast Group field is set to G.  The Multicast Group Length
     field is set appropriately to reflect this address type.

   To constrain distribution of the Source Active auto-discovery route
   to the AS of the advertising LSR, this route SHOULD carry the
   NO_EXPORT Community ([<a href="./rfc1997" title='"BGP Communities Attribute"'>RFC1997</a>]).

   Using the normal BGP procedures, the Source Active auto-discovery
   route is propagated to all other LSRs within the AS.

   Whenever the LSR receiving an mLDP Label Map with the Transit
   IPv4/IPv6 Source TLV for (S,G) deletes the (S,G) state that was
   previously created, the LSR that deletes the state MUST also withdraw
   the Source Active auto-discovery route, if such a route was
   advertised when the state was created.

   Note that whenever an LSR creates an (S,G) state as a result of
   receiving an mLDP Label Map with the Transit IPv4/IPv6 Source TLV for
   (S,G) with S reachable via one of the IP-multicast-capable
   interfaces, and the LSR already has a (*,G) state with the RP
   reachable via one of the IP-multicast-capable interfaces as a result
   of receiving an mLDP Label Map with the Transit IPv4/IPv6 Shared Tree
   TLV for (*,G), the LSR does not originate a Source Active
   auto-discovery route.

   Procedures for receiving Source Active auto-discovery routes are the
   same as those for Mechanism 1.

   If, after receiving a new Source Active auto-discovery route for
   (S,G), the LSR determines that (a) it has the (*,G) entry in its TIB,
   (b) the incoming interface (iif) list for that entry contains one of
   the IP interfaces, (c) at least one of the MPLS interfaces is in the
   outgoing interface (oif) list for that entry, and (d) the LSR does
   not originate an mLDP Label Mapping message for (S,G) with the
   Transit IPv4/IPv6 Source TLV, then the LSR MUST transition the
   (S,G,RPT-bit) downstream state to the Prune state.  (Conceptually,
   the PIM state machine on the LSR will act "as if" it had received

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7442">RFC 7442</a>               PIM-SM over P2MP mLDP LSPs          February 2015</span>


   Prune(S,G,rpt) on one of its MPLS interfaces, without actually having
   received one.)  Depending on the (S,G,RPT-bit) state on the iif, this
   may result in the LSR using PIM procedures to prune S off the Shared
   (*,G) tree.

   The LSR MUST keep the (S,G,RPT-bit) downstream state machine in the
   Prune state for as long as (a) the outgoing interface (oif) list for
   (*,G) contains one of the MPLS interfaces, (b) the LSR has at least
   one Source Active auto-discovery route for (S,G), and (c) the LSR
   does not originate the mLDP Label Mapping message for (S,G) with the
   Transit IPv4/IPv6 Source TLV.  Once one or more of these conditions
   become no longer valid, the LSR MUST transition the (S,G,RPT-bit)
   downstream state machine to the NoInfo state.

   Note that except for the scenario described in the first paragraph of
   this section, it is sufficient to rely solely on the PIM procedures
   on the LSR to ensure the correct behavior when pruning sources off
   the shared tree.

   The creation and deletion of (S,G,RPT-bit) state on an LSR that
   resulted from receiving PIM messages on one of its IP multicast
   interfaces do not result in any mLDP and/or BGP actions by the LSR.

   IANA maintains a registry called "Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
   Parameters" with a subregistry called "LDP MP Opaque Value Element
   basic type".  IANA has allocated two new values, as follows:

      Value | Name                         | Reference
      ------+------------------------------+------------
        11  | Transit IPv4 Shared Tree TLV | [<a href="./rfc7442">RFC7442</a>]

   All of the security considerations for mLDP ([<a href="./rfc6388" title='"Label Distribution Protocol Extensions for Point- to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6388</a>]) apply here.

   From the security considerations point of view, the use of Shared
   Tree TLVs is no different than the use of Source TLVs [<a href="./rfc6826" title='"Multipoint LDP In-Band Signaling for Point-to- Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6826</a>].
