    <span class="h1">Update to IANA Registration Procedures for Pool 3 Values in the</span>
        <span class="h1">Differentiated Services Field Codepoints (DSCP) Registry</span>

Abstract

   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of
   the DS field in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry one of 64
   distinct differentiated services field codepoint (DSCP) values.  The
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of
   assigned DSCP values.

   This update to <a href="./rfc2474">RFC 2474</a> changes the IANA registration policy for Pool
   3 of the registry (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx01) to Standards
   Action, i.e., values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best
   Current Practice RFC.  The update also removes permission for
   experimental and local use of the codepoints that form Pool 3 of the
   DSCP registry; Pool 2 Codepoints (i.e., DSCP values of the form
   xxxx11) remain available for these purposes.

   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) [<a href="./rfc2475" title='"An Architecture for Differentiated Services"'>RFC2475</a>] architecture
   (updated by [<a href="./rfc3260" title='"New Terminology and Clarifications for Diffserv"'>RFC3260</a>]) provides scalable service differentiation in
   the Internet.  Diffserv uses the six most significant bits of the
   former IPv4 Type of Service (TOS) octet or the former IPv6 Traffic
   Class octet to convey the field, which is used to carry the DSCP.
   This DSCP value is used to select a Diffserv per-hop behavior (PHB).

   The six-bit field is capable of conveying 64 distinct codepoints, and
   this codepoint space has been divided into three pools for the
   purpose of codepoint assignment and management (as shown in
   Figure 1).  Pool 1 comprises 32 codepoints [<a href="./rfc2474" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>RFC2474</a>].  These are
   assigned by Standards Action, as defined in [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  Pool 2
   comprises a pool of 16 codepoints reserved for Experimental or Local
   Use (EXP/LU) as defined in [<a href="./rfc2474" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>RFC2474</a>].  Pool 3 comprises 16
   codepoints, which were originally specified as "initially available
   for experimental or local use, but which should be preferentially
   utilized for standardized assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted" by
   [<a href="./rfc2474" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>RFC2474</a>].

    Figure 1: Format of the Field for Codepoints Allocated in the Three
            IANA Pools (Where "x" Refers to Either "0" or "1")

   At the time of writing this document, 22 of the 32 Pool 1 codepoints
   have been assigned.

   Although Pool 1 has not yet been completely exhausted, there is a
   need to assign codepoints for particular PHBs that are unable to use
   any of the unassigned values in Pool 1.  This document changes the
   IANA registration policy of Pool 3 to assignment by Standards Action.
   (<a href="./rfc8126#section-4.9">Section 4.9 of [RFC8126]</a> defines this as "assigned only through
   Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFCs in the IETF Stream".)

   An example is the need to assign a suitable recommended default
   codepoint for the Lower Effort (LE) PHB [<a href="#ref-LE-PHB" title='"A Lower Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB)"'>LE-PHB</a>].  The LE PHB is
   designed to protect best-effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with
   the default PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations (when
   resources become scarce, best-effort traffic has precedence over LE
   traffic and is allowed to preempt it).  In deployed networks,
   bleaching (i.e. intentionally setting to zero) of the IP Precedence
   field continues to be used.  (Setting the IP Precedence field to zero
   disables any class-based flow management by routers configured with
   TOS-based packet processing.)  This causes the first three bits of
   the former TOS byte (now the upper part of the DSCP field) to become
   zero.  Therefore, there is a need to avoid this remapping of the DSCP
   for the LE PHB by assigning a codepoint that already has a zero value
   in the first three bits [<a href="#ref-LE-PHB" title='"A Lower Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB)"'>LE-PHB</a>].

   Furthermore, if the LE PHB were to have been assigned one of the
   currently unused Pool 1 codepoints with a zero value in the first
   three bits, any bleaching of the IP Precedence field would result in
   other (higher assurance) traffic being also remapped to the assigned
   DSCP.  This remapping could then cause Diffserv-marked traffic to
   receive an unintentional LE treatment for the remainder of the
   Internet path.  Therefore, it is important to avoid the resulting
   priority inversion.  The absence of unassigned codepoints in Pool 1
   that exhibit these important properties motivates assigning a Pool 3
   codepoint as the default that is recommended for use with this PHB.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8436">RFC 8436</a>      IANA Registration Procedures for DSCP Pool 3   August 2018</span>


   To allow the IETF to utilize Pool 3 codepoints, this document
   requests IANA to manage Pool 3 assignments for DSCP values in Pool 3
   via the Standards Action policy [<a href="./rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].

   This document updates <a href="./rfc2474#section-6">Section 6 of [RFC2474]</a> in the following ways.

   It updates the following text concerning the assignment policy:

   OLD:  which are initially available for experimental or local use,
      but which should be preferentially utilized for standardized
      assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted.

   NEW:  which are utilized for standardized assignments (replacing the
      previous availability for experimental or local use).

   It removes the footnote in <a href="./rfc2474">RFC 2474</a> relating to Pool 3:

   DELETE:  "(*) may be utilized for future Standards Action allocations
      as necessary"

   The new registry assignment policy is shown in Figure 2.

   Security considerations for the use of DSCP values are described in
   the RFCs that define their usage.  This document does not present new
   security considerations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has changed the use of Pool 3 in the "Differentiated Services
   Field Codepoints (DSCP)" registry and will manage this pool using
   Standards Action, as defined as <a href="./rfc8126#section-4.9">Section 4.9 of [RFC8126]</a>.

   IANA has made the following changes to the "Differentiated Services
   Field Codepoints (DSCP)" registry, made available at [<a href="#ref-Registry">Registry</a>].

   IANA has referenced <a href="./rfc2474">RFC 2474</a> and <a href="./rfc3260#section-4">Section 4 of RFC 3260</a> for the
   overall format of this registry.

   IANA has referenced <a href="./rfc2474">RFC 2474</a> and <a href="./rfc3260#section-4">Section 4 of RFC 3260</a> for Pool 1.

   This document does not modify the IANA registry text for Pool 2.
   This pool continues to preserve the note shown in Figure 2.

   The previous registry text for Pool 3:

      3 xxxx01 Experimental or local use may be utilized for future
      Standards Action allocations as necessary.

   is replaced with the following registry text:

      3 xxxx01 Standards Action.

   To manage codepoints in Pool 3, IANA has created and will maintain
   the "DSCP Pool 3 Codepoints" subregistry.  Pool 3 of the registry has
   been created initially empty, with a format identical to that used
   for "DSCP Pool 1 Codepoints".

   IANA has referenced <a href="./rfc2474./rfc3260#section-4">RFC 2474, Section  4 of RFC 3260</a>, and the current
   document for Pool 3.

   The registration procedure for use of Pool 3 is Standards Action, as
   defined as <a href="./rfc8126#section-4.9">Section 4.9 of [RFC8126]</a>.  IANA is expected to normally
   make assignments from Pool 1, until this Pool is exhausted, but it
   MAY make assignments from Pool 3 when the format of the codepoint has
   properties that are needed for a specific PHB.  The required
   characteristics for choosing a requested DSCP value MUST be explained
   in the IANA Considerations section of the document that requests any
   assignment from Pool 3.
