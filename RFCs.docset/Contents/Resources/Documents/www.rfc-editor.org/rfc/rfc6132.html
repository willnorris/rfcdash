<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Sometimes, it's desirable to tailor Sieve [<a href="./rfc5228" title='"Sieve: An Email Filtering Language"'>RFC5228</a>] notifications to
   a user's current situation.  Presence information provides some
   information about the user that would be useful to have access to in
   these cases.  The Notification extension [<a href="./rfc5435" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Extension for Notifications"'>RFC5435</a>] defines a
   mechanism to test for presence (the notify_method_capability
   feature), and defines one test for presence (the "online"
   notification-capability, described in <a href="./rfc5435#section-5">Section 5 of RFC 5435</a>).  This
   extension defines more presence tests by registering additional
   notification-capability parameters in the IANA registry, allowing
   testing of a wider variety of presence information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20Terminology%20Used%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology Used in This Document</span>

   The upper-case key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Testing%20Presence%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Testing Presence Information</span>

   This extension uses the notify_method_capability test, as defined in
   the Sieve [<a href="./rfc5228" title='"Sieve: An Email Filtering Language"'>RFC5228</a>] Notify extension [<a href="./rfc5435" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Extension for Notifications"'>RFC5435</a>], to test presence
   information.  When a Sieve event occurs (mail arrives) for a user, a
   Sieve script running on behalf of that user can present the user's
   presence URI (in the "notification-uri" parameter) and test a
   specific item of notification presence as defined below (in the
   "notification-capability" parameter) against one or more values (in
   the "key-list" parameter).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6132">RFC 6132</a>                 Sieve Notify: Presence                July 2011</span>


   This document defines an initial set of items of notification
   presence, which may be specified in the notification-capability
   parameter.  It is expected that future extensions will add additional
   presence items derived from diverse sources, including calendar
   information, geographic location, and so on.

   Note that, while the items below are documented as similar to items
   in Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [<a href="./rfc6121" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence"'>RFC6121</a>], it is
   not the intent that this extension be tied to XMPP, nor to any
   particular source of presence, and flexible implementations will be
   ready for future extensions.  Useful informational references for
   presence data and formats include Presence Information Data Format
   (PIDF) [<a href="./rfc3863" title='"Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)"'>RFC3863</a>], RPID: Rich Presence Extensions to PIDF [<a href="./rfc4480" title='"RPID: Rich Presence Extensions to the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)"'>RFC4480</a>],
   and GEOPRIV Presence Information Data Format Location Object
   (PIDF-LO) [<a href="./rfc5491" title='"GEOPRIV Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) Usage Clarification, Considerations, and Recommendations"'>RFC5491</a>].

   The script tests the values of notification presence items in the
   key-list parameter.  The values that each item may have are specified
   in the list below.  Note that in addition to the presence values, any
   item may have the value "unknown" if it is not possible to determine
   the correct presence value of the item.

   If a particular presence item is tested multiple times within the
   same script execution context, implementations MUST present the same
   value each time (for example, by caching the value on first use).
   This provides consistency within a single execution.

   Supported presence items are as follows:

   busy:    An indication of whether the user is considered "busy" now
            (the value "yes") or not (the value "no"), or "unknown" if
            it cannot be determined.  The meaning of "busy" is left to
            the implementation, and may be a state that's synthesized
            from other information (including "show", below).

   show:    The availability status of the user, formally specified.
            Note that this is similar to the presence element with the
            same name that's defined in <a href="./rfc6121#section-4.7.2.1">Section 4.7.2.1 of RFC 6121</a>
            [<a href="./rfc6121" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence"'>RFC6121</a>].  The value of this item is one of the following:

            away:    The user is temporarily away.

            chat:    The user is online and actively interested in
                     chatting.

            dnd:     Do Not Disturb; the user does not wish to be
                     disturbed now.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6132">RFC 6132</a>                 Sieve Notify: Presence                July 2011</span>


            offline: The user is offline.

            xa:      The user is away for an extended period (xa =
                     "eXtended Away").

            unknown: The correct presence value could not be determined.

   status:  A human-readable description of the user's availability
            status, in natural language.  There is no formal definition
            for the values this item may take.  It is free-form, and may
            be in any language.  Direct comparisons against the value of
            this field are unlikely to be useful; rather, it is provided
            to enable extraction of the value into a variable [<a href="./rfc5229" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Variables Extension"'>RFC5229</a>]
            for use elsewhere (see example 3 in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).  Note that
            this is similar to the presence element with the same name
            that's defined in <a href="./rfc6121#section-4.7.2.2">Section 4.7.2.2 of RFC 6121</a> [<a href="./rfc6121" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence"'>RFC6121</a>], and
            to the &lt;note&gt; element defined in <a href="#section-4.1.6">section 4.1.6</a> of PIDF
            [<a href="./rfc3863" title='"Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)"'>RFC3863</a>].

            Because this is a free-form value that might be created
            directly by a user, no value, including "unknown", can have
            any special meaning.  If the Sieve processor is unable to
            determine the value of this item, it might be best to leave
            it as an empty string.  In any case, it is not meant for
            machine-readable processing, beyond possible XML
            interpretation.

   There is no capability string associated with this extension, but
   this requires support for "enotify" [<a href="./rfc5435" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Extension for Notifications"'>RFC5435</a>].  If the implementation
   does not support the item being tested (that is, the specified
   notification-capability item is not known to the Sieve interpreter),
   <a href="./rfc5435">RFC 5435</a> already specifies that the test fail without an error.

   Although this feature was conceived to assist in notifications, and
   the test requires support of the Sieve Notify feature, it is only a
   condition test, and any Sieve action can appear inside it.  There are
   no Sieve actions that conflict with this extension.

   1.  This example will send a notification only if the recipient is
       not "busy".  If the test for "busy" is not supported, this
       example will not send a notification.

   require ["enotify"];

   if notify_method_capability "xmpp:tim@example.com" "busy" "no"
     {
       notify :message "You got mail"
           "xmpp:tim@example.com?message;subject=SIEVE";
     }


   2.  This example will send a notification only if the recipient is
       not "busy".  If the test for "busy" is not supported, this
       example will send a notification.

   require ["enotify"];

   if not notify_method_capability "xmpp:tim@example.com" "busy" "yes"
     {
       notify :message "You got mail"
           "xmpp:tim@example.com?message;subject=SIEVE";
     }


   3.  This example uses the vacation extension [<a href="./rfc5230" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Vacation Extension"'>RFC5230</a>] to generate an
       auto-reply [<a href="./rfc6133" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Use of Presence Information with Auto-Responder Functionality"'>RFC6133</a>] if the sender is in the recipient's address
       book [<a href="./rfc6134" title='"Sieve Extension: Externally Stored Lists"'>RFC6134</a>] and the recipient's presence shows "extended
       away".  The variables extension [<a href="./rfc5229" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Variables Extension"'>RFC5229</a>] is used to extract the
       value of the recipient's presence status message, which will be
       used in the response to the sender.  If the test for "show" is
       not supported, this example will not send an auto-reply.

   require ["extlists", "vacation", "enotify", "variables"];

   if allof (
       envelope :list "from" ":addrbook:default",
       notify_method_capability "xmpp:myjid@example.com" "show" "xa"
     ) {
       # :matches "*" is used here to extract the value
       if notify_method_capability :matches
           "xmpp:myjid@example.com" "status" "*" {
         set "resp_msg" "${1}";
       } else {
         set "resp_msg" "I'm away from email for a while."
       }
       vacation :handle "ext-away" "${resp_msg}";
     }

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Security considerations for Sieve [<a href="./rfc5228" title='"Sieve: An Email Filtering Language"'>RFC5228</a>] and the Notify extension
   [<a href="./rfc5435" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Extension for Notifications"'>RFC5435</a>] apply equally here.  In addition, implementations MUST
   ensure that users cannot create scripts that access the presence
   information of others without the proper access controls.

   In some situations, scripts may act on some of the recipient's
   presence information that the sender of the triggering message is not
   allowed to see.  This can be a benefit to the recipient in many
   cases, but it can also present an opportunity for a sender to use
   messages to probe the recipient's presence (if, for example, messages
   sometimes result in auto-replies, and sometimes do not).  Script
   authors should take care in considering this aspect of presence-
   triggered actions.

   It's possible for a large number of messages to arrive at or around
   the same time and be processed by Sieve scripts that all test
   presence.  If many of the users share the same presence server, such
   a burst could put an unexpectedly heavy load on the presence server.
   Implementations might consider providing options for rate limiting,
   or for caching presence tests for periods of time, even across Sieve
   script instances.  When caching presence tests, the server must be
   careful not to violate access controls that the presence server might
   have.  Thus, cached results MUST NOT be used outside the context in
   which they were retrieved.  If, for example, a script running on
   behalf of Adam requests presence information for Barbara, that
   information MAY be cached for a future script running on behalf of
   Adam, but MUST NOT be used to satisfy the same query in a script
   running on behalf of Cindy -- because the presence server will have
   to decide whether Cindy has access to that information.

   This registers each presence item as a notification-capability
   parameter.  Future extensions that add new presence items should
   register those items similarly, using the instructions in <a href="./rfc5435#section-9.3">Section 9.3
   of RFC 5435</a> [<a href="./rfc5435" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Extension for Notifications"'>RFC5435</a>].

   Capability name:  busy
   Description:  An indication of whether the user is considered "busy"
        now (the value "yes") or not (the value "no").  The meaning of
        "busy" is left to the implementation, and may be a state that's
        synthesized from other information.
   Syntax:  Has one of the values "yes", "no", or "unknown".  The value
        MUST be in lower case.
