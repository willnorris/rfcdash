     The ground rules for attendance and topics for discussion are as

outlined in RFC #87.  Basically, each organization represented is

expected to participate by presenting one or more working papers in

one or more of the areas chosen for discussion.  A minimal working

paper is defined to consist of a set of written notes and an oral

presentation.  We suggest that the RFC mechanism be used to

disseminate the written working notes.  I am asking that all attendees

make reservations no later than June 1st and that all RFC's and

working notes which are pertinent to this meeting be in my hand no

later than Tuesday, June 22nd.  We will publish by June 25th a

bibliography of reading material pertinent to this graphic meeting and

a list of prospective attendees.  Authors of working notes not

disseminated through the RFC mechanism are responsible for mailing to

each attendee a copy of his working notes no later than July 1, 1971.


     Each attendee making a presentation can expect a telephone call

from me about July 5 to find how much time he wants for his

presentation.  The times will be scaled appropriately to fit the

schedule.
