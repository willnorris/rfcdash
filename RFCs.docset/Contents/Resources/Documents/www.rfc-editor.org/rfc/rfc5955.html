   This document defines a new media type for TimeStampedData envelopes.
   A TimeStampedData envelope, described in [<a href="./rfc5544" title='"Syntax for Binding Documents with Time- Stamps"'>RFC5544</a>], binds a file with
   one or more time-stamp tokens obtained for that file.  A media type
   registration, lacking in [<a href="./rfc5544" title='"Syntax for Binding Documents with Time- Stamps"'>RFC5544</a>], enhances shareability.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Registration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Registration</span>

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: timestamped-data

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: binary

   Security considerations:

      See the Security Considerations in the published specification.

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification: <a href="./rfc5544">RFC 5544</a>

   Applications which use this media type:

      Any application that exchanges TimeStampedData envelopes over a
      MIME-based transport and possibly processes them, either directly
      or via external handlers or viewers.  Such applications may be,
      for instance, digital signature applications, archival systems,
      email clients, web browsers, etc.
