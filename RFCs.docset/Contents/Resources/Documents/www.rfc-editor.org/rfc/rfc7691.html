Abstract

   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp101">BCP 101</a> defines the start and end dates for the terms of IETF
   Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) members; these terms have
   proven to be impractical.  This memo updates <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp101">BCP 101</a> to direct the
   IAOC to establish more practical start and end dates for terms of
   IAOC members.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Background</span>

   <a href="./rfc4071#section-4">Section 4 of RFC 4071</a> [<a href="#ref-BCP101" title='"Structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)"'>BCP101</a>] says "IAOC terms normally end at the
   end of the first IETF meeting of a year."  Having the terms of the
   IAOC members expire at the end of the first IETF meeting of the year
   has proved impractical for the IAOC to carry out its business and to
   elect its Chair during the meeting week.  For a number of years, the
   IAOC has improvised by defaulting to an informal process of having
   the transition occur during the administrative plenary (as the IESG
   does).  This informal arrangement violates the letter of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp101">BCP 101</a>.
   But even this arrangement is problematic if the transfer happens
   after the IAOC's face-to-face meeting takes place that week.  Under
   the informal arrangement, the IAOC typically meets on the morning of
   the administrative plenary, which means that the incoming IAOC
   members, while present, are not seated.

   Having the new IAOC members take office after the face-to-face
   meeting has caused difficulties in the chair selection and voting
   processes during the IAOC's face-to-face meeting held during the same
   week.  There has been confusion over who should vote in the chair
   election and on any business actions that require a vote of the
   Trustees.  If the incoming members are not seated, then they should
   not vote; however, to select a chair for the next year, for example,
   they, more than the outgoing members, should have a say in the chair
   selection.  There is also confusion over who is eligible to be
   elected as chair -- if the term of an IAOC member has not yet
   started, could that IAOC member be elected chair (as the chair is
   selected from among the members).  Having the terms expire at the end
   of the week also risks the IAOC not being able to raise a quorum if
   outgoing members decide to not come to the meeting.  Because the IAOC
   members are the Trustees of the IETF Trust, the same issues arise
   with the IETF Trust and its ability to carry out its business and
   elect a Chair during the meeting week.

   An additional issue with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp101">BCP 101</a> is the current definition of the
   term length of the IAOC Chair.  <a href="./rfc4071">RFC 4071</a> [<a href="#ref-BCP101" title='"Structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)"'>BCP101</a>] says "The term of
   the IAOC chair shall be one year from the time of selection or the
   remaining time of his or her tenure on the IAOC, whichever is less."
   Because the dates for the first IETF meeting of the year vary from
   year to year, the current <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp101">BCP 101</a> text could result in there being no

   IAOC chair for weeks before the a meeting or in overlapping terms for
   IAOC Chairs.

   This memo updates <a href="./rfc4071#section-4">Section 4 of RFC 4071</a> [<a href="#ref-BCP101" title='"Structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)"'>BCP101</a>] to remove the
   following sentence:

      IAOC terms normally end at the end of the first IETF meeting of a
      year.

   Furthermore, the following requirements are added:

   1. The IAOC and the IETF Trust each hold a regular meeting close to
      the time of, or during, the first IETF meeting of the year.

   2. The IAOC and the Trust select their chairs as the first order of
      business in their individual meetings in a manner of their
      choosing.

   3. The IAOC determines the beginning and end of the normal terms of
      its members relative to the above mentioned IAOC meeting; such
      terms must start and end close to the time of this meeting, unless
      those determinations are made by the appointing bodies.

   A regular meeting has proper notice, minutes that are posted, and may
   be held face-to-face, via teleconference, or as a combination of the
   two.
