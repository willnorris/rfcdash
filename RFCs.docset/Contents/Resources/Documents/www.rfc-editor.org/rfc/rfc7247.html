Abstract

   As a foundation for the definition of bidirectional protocol mappings
   between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), this document specifies the
   architectural assumptions underlying such mappings as well as the
   mapping of addresses and error conditions.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IETF has worked on two signaling technologies that can be used
   for multimedia session negotiation, instant messaging, presence,
   capabilities discovery, notifications, and other functions served by
   real-time communication applications:

   o  The Session Initiation Protocol [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>], along with various SIP
      extensions developed within the SIP for Instant Messaging and
      Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) Working Group.

   o  The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol [<a href="./rfc6120" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"'>RFC6120</a>], along
      with various XMPP extensions developed by the IETF as well as by
      the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF).

   Because these technologies are widely deployed, it is important to
   clearly define mappings between them for the sake of interworking.
   This document provides the basis for a series of SIP-XMPP
   interworking specifications by defining architectural assumptions,
   address translation methods, and error condition mappings.  Other
   documents in this series define mappings for presence, messaging, and
   media sessions.

   The guidelines in this series are based on implementation and
   deployment experience, and they describe techniques that have worked
   well in the field with existing systems.  In practice, interworking
   has been achieved through direct protocol mappings, not through
   mapping to an abstract model as described in, for example, [<a href="./rfc3859" title='"Common Profile for Presence (CPP)"'>RFC3859</a>]
   and [<a href="./rfc3860" title='"Common Profile for Instant Messaging (CPIM)"'>RFC3860</a>].  Therefore, this series describes the direct mapping
   approach in enough detail for developers of new implementations to
   achieve practical interworking between SIP systems and XMPP systems.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Intended%20Audience"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Intended Audience</span>

   The documents in this series are intended for use by software
   developers who have an existing system based on one of these
   technologies (e.g., SIP) and would like to enable communication from
   that existing system to systems based on the other technology (e.g.,
   XMPP).  With regard to this document, we assume that readers are
   familiar with the core specifications for both SIP and XMPP; with
   regard to the other documents in this series, we assume that readers
   are familiar with this document as well as with the relevant SIP and
   XMPP extensions.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Terminology</span>

   A number of terms used here are explained in [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and [<a href="./rfc6120" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"'>RFC6120</a>].

   Several examples use the "XML Notation" from the Internationalized
   Resource Identifier (IRI) specification [<a href="./rfc3987" title='"Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)"'>RFC3987</a>] to represent
   Unicode characters outside the ASCII range (e.g., the string "ue"
   stands for the Unicode character [<a href="#ref-UNICODE" title='"The Unicode Standard, Version 6.3"'>UNICODE</a>] LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH
   DIAERESIS, U+00FC).

   In architectural diagrams, SIP traffic is shown using arrows such as
   "***&gt;", whereas XMPP traffic is shown using arrows such as "...&gt;".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Architectural%20Assumptions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Architectural Assumptions</span>

   Protocol translation between SIP and XMPP could occur in a number of
   different entities, depending on the architecture of real-time
   communication deployments.  For example, protocol translation could
   occur within a multiprotocol server (which uses protocol-specific
   connection managers to initiate traffic to and accept traffic from
   clients or other servers natively using SIP/SIMPLE, XMPP, etc.),
   within a multiprotocol client (which enables a user to establish
   connections natively with various servers using SIP/SIMPLE, XMPP,
   etc.), or within a gateway that acts as a dedicated protocol
   translator (which takes one protocol as input and provides another
   protocol as output).

   This document assumes that the protocol translation will occur within
   a gateway, specifically:

   o  When information needs to flow from an XMPP-based system to a SIP-
      based system, protocol translation will occur within an "XMPP-to-
      SIP gateway" that translates XMPP syntax and semantics on behalf
      of an "XMPP server" (together, these two logical functions
      comprise an "XMPP service").

   o  When information needs to flow from a SIP-based system to an XMPP-
      based system, protocol translation will occur within a "SIP-to-
      XMPP gateway" that translates SIP syntax and semantics on behalf
      of a "SIP server" (together, these two logical functions comprise
      a "SIP service").





<span class="grey">Saint-Andre, et al.          Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>

   Naturally, these logical functions could occur in one and the same
   actual entity; we differentiate between them mainly for explanatory
   purposes (although, in practice, such gateways are indeed fairly
   common).

      Note: This assumption is not meant to discourage protocol
      translation within multiprotocol clients or servers; instead, this
      assumption is followed mainly to clarify the discussion and
      examples so that the protocol translation principles can be more
      easily understood and can be applied by client and server
      implementors with appropriate modifications to the examples and
      terminology.

   This document assumes that a gateway will translate directly from one
   protocol to the other.  For the sake of the examples, we further
   assume that protocol translation will occur within a gateway in the
   source domain, so that information generated by the user of an XMPP
   system will be translated by a gateway within the trust domain of
   that XMPP system, and information generated by the user of a SIP
   system will be translated by a gateway within the trust domain of
   that SIP system.  However, nothing in this document ought to be taken
   as recommending against protocol translation at the destination
   domain.

   An architectural diagram for a possible gateway deployment is shown
   below, where the entities have the following significance and the "#"
   character is used to show the boundary of a trust domain:

   o  romeo@example.net -- a SIP user.

   o  example.net -- a SIP server with an associated gateway ("S2X GW")
      to XMPP.

   o  juliet@example.com -- an XMPP user.

   o  example.com -- an XMPP server with an associated gateway ("X2S
      GW") to SIP.

            Figure 1: Possible Gateway Deployment Architecture

   Note that bidirectional communication between the SIP server and the
   XMPP server can be established over either SIP or XMPP.  If the XMPP
   user initiates the interaction, then the XMPP server would invoke its
   XMPP-to-SIP gateway; thus, the communication would occur over SIP.
   If the SIP user initiates the interaction, then the SIP server would
   invoke its SIP-to-XMPP gateway; thus, the communication would occur
   over XMPP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20%20Interdomain%20Federation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Interdomain Federation</span>

   The architectural assumptions underlying this document imply that
   communication between a SIP system and an XMPP system will take place
   using interdomain federation: the SIP server invokes its associated
   SIP-to-XMPP gateway, which communicates with the XMPP server using
   native XMPP server-to-server methods; similarly, the XMPP server
   invokes its associated XMPP-to-SIP gateway, which communicates with
   the SIP server using native SIP server-to-server methods.

   When an XMPP server receives an XMPP stanza whose 'to' address
   specifies or includes a domain other than the domain of the XMPP
   server, it needs to determine whether the destination domain
   communicates via XMPP or SIP.  To do so, it performs one or more DNS
   SRV lookups [<a href="./rfc2782" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC2782</a>] for "_xmpp-server" records as specified in
   [<a href="./rfc6120" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"'>RFC6120</a>].  If the response returns a hostname, the XMPP server can
   attempt XMPP communication.  If not, it can determine the appropriate
   location for SIP communication at the target domain using the
   procedures specified in [<a href="./rfc3263" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP Servers"'>RFC3263</a>].



<span class="grey">Saint-Andre, et al.          Standards Track                    [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7247">RFC 7247</a>               SIP-XMPP Interworking: Core              May 2014</span>


   Similarly, when a SIP server receives a SIP message whose Request-URI
   or To header specifies or includes a domain other than the domain of
   the SIP server, it needs to determine whether the destination domain
   communicates via SIP or XMPP.  To do so, it uses the procedures
   specified in [<a href="./rfc3263" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP Servers"'>RFC3263</a>].  If that response returns a hostname, the SIP
   server can attempt SIP communication.  If not, it can perform one or
   more DNS SRV lookups [<a href="./rfc2782" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC2782</a>] for "_xmpp-server" records as
   specified in [<a href="./rfc6120" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"'>RFC6120</a>].

   In both cases, the server in question might have previously
   determined that the foreign domain communicates via SIP or XMPP, in
   which case it would not need to perform the relevant DNS lookups.
   The caching of such information is a matter of implementation and
   local service policy and is therefore out of scope for this document.

   Existing SIP and XMPP server implementations do not typically include
   the ability to communicate using the other technology (XMPP for SIP
   implementations, SIP for XMPP implementations).  One common
   architectural pattern is to associate a gateway with the core server
   implementation (e.g., in XMPP such a gateway might be called a
   "connection manager").  How exactly such a gateway interacts with the
   core server to complete tasks such as address lookups and
   communication with systems that use the other technology is a matter
   of implementation (e.g., the gateway might be an add-on module that
   is trusted by the core server to act as a fallback delivery mechanism
   if the remote domain does not support the server's native
   communication technology).

   Because [<a href="./rfc6120" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"'>RFC6120</a>] specifies a binding of XMPP to TCP, a gateway from
   SIP to XMPP will need to support TCP as the underlying transport
   protocol.  By contrast, as specified in [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>], either TCP or UDP
   can be used as the underlying transport for SIP messages, and a given
   SIP deployment might support only UDP; therefore, a gateway from XMPP
   to SIP might need to communicate with a SIP server using either TCP
   or UDP.

   The basic SIP address format is a 'sip' or 'sips' URI as specified in
   [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>].  When a SIP entity supports extensions for instant
   messaging it might be identified by an 'im' URI as specified in the
   Common Profile for Instant Messaging [<a href="./rfc3860" title='"Common Profile for Instant Messaging (CPIM)"'>RFC3860</a>] (see [<a href="./rfc3428" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Instant Messaging"'>RFC3428</a>]), and
   when a SIP entity supports extensions for presence it might be

   identified by a 'pres' URI as specified in the Common Profile for
   Presence [<a href="./rfc3859" title='"Common Profile for Presence (CPP)"'>RFC3859</a>] (see [<a href="./rfc3856" title='"A Presence Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3856</a>]).  SIP entities typically also
   support the 'tel' URI scheme [<a href="./rfc3966" title='"The tel URI for Telephone Numbers"'>RFC3966</a>] and might support other URI
   schemes as well.

   The XMPP address format is specified in [<a href="./rfc6122" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Address Format"'>RFC6122</a>] (although note that
   XMPP URIs [<a href="./rfc5122" title='"Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)"'>RFC5122</a>] are not used natively on the XMPP network); in
   addition, [<a href="./rfc6121" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence"'>RFC6121</a>] encourages instant messaging and presence
   applications of XMPP to also support 'im' and 'pres' URIs as
   specified in [<a href="./rfc3860" title='"Common Profile for Instant Messaging (CPIM)"'>RFC3860</a>] and [<a href="./rfc3859" title='"Common Profile for Presence (CPP)"'>RFC3859</a>], respectively, although such
   support might simply involve leaving resolution of such addresses up
   to an XMPP server.

   In this document we primarily describe mappings for addresses of the
   form &lt;user@domain&gt;; however, we also provide guidelines for mapping
   the addresses of specific user agent instances, which take the form
   of Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in SIP and
   "resourceparts" in XMPP.  Mapping of protocol-specific identifiers
   (such as telephone numbers) is out of scope for this specification.
   In addition, we have ruled the mapping of domain names as out of
   scope for now, since that is a matter for the Domain Name System;
   specifically, the issue for interworking between SIP and XMPP relates
   to the translation of fully internationalized domain names (IDNs)
   into non-internationalized domain names (IDNs are not allowed in the
   SIP address format but are allowed in the XMPP address via
   Internationalized Domain Names in Applications; see [<a href="./rfc6122" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Address Format"'>RFC6122</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-XMPP-ADDRESS-FORMAT">XMPP-ADDRESS-FORMAT</a>]).  Therefore, in the following sections we
   focus primarily on the local part of an address (these are called
   variously "usernames", "instant inboxes", "presentities", and
   "localparts" in the protocols at issue), secondarily on the instance-
   specific part of an address, and not at all on the domain-name part
   of an address.

   The 'sip'/'sips', 'im'/'pres', and XMPP address schemes allow
   different sets of characters (although all three allow alphanumeric
   characters and disallow both spaces and control characters).  In some
   cases, characters allowed in one scheme are disallowed in others;
   these characters need to be mapped appropriately in order to ensure

   The local part of a 'sip'/'sips' URI inherits from the "userinfo"
   rule in [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>] with several changes; here we discuss the SIP
   "user" rule only (using ABNF as defined in [<a href="./rfc5234" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>]):

      user             =  1*( unreserved / escaped / user-unreserved )
      user-unreserved  =  "&amp;" / "=" / "+" / "$" / "," / ";" / "?" / "/"
      unreserved       =  alphanum / mark
      mark             =  "-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" / "'"
                          / "(" / ")"

   Here we make the simplifying assumption that the local part of an
   'im'/'pres' URI inherits from the "dot-atom-text" rule in [<a href="./rfc5322" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>]
   rather than the more complicated "local-part" rule:

      dot-atom-text =  1*atext *("." 1*atext)
      atext         =  ALPHA / DIGIT /    ; Any character except
                       "!" / "#" / "$" /  ; controls, SP, and
                       "%" / "&amp;" / "'" /  ; specials.  Used for
                       "*" / "+" / "-" /  ; atoms.
                       "/" / "=" / "?" /
                       "^" / "_" / "`" /
                       "{" / "|" / "}" /
                       "~"

   The local part of an XMPP address allows any ASCII character except
   space, controls, and the " &amp; ' / : &lt; &gt; @ characters.

   To summarize the foregoing information, the following table lists the
   allowed and disallowed characters in the local part of identifiers
   for each protocol (aside from the alphanumeric, space, and control
   characters), in order by hexadecimal character number (where each "A"
   row shows the allowed characters and each "D" row shows the
   disallowed characters).

                Table 1: Allowed and Disallowed Characters

   When transforming the local part of an address from one address
   format to another, an application SHOULD proceed as follows:

   1.  Unescape any escaped characters in the source address (e.g., from
       SIP to XMPP unescape "%23" to "#" per [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>], and from XMPP to
       SIP unescape "\27" to "'" per [<a href="#ref-XEP-0106" title='"JID Escaping"'>XEP-0106</a>]).

   2.  Leave unmodified any characters that are allowed in the
       destination scheme.

   3.  Escape any characters that are allowed in the source scheme but
       reserved in the destination scheme, as escaping is defined for
       the destination scheme.  In particular:

       *  Where the destination scheme is a URI (i.e., an 'im', 'pres',
          'sip', or 'sips' URI), each reserved character MUST be
          percent-encoded to "%hexhex" as specified in <a href="./rfc3986#section-2.5">SectionÂ 2.5 of
          [RFC3986]</a> (e.g., when transforming from XMPP to SIP, encode
          "#" as "%23").

       *  Where the destination scheme is a native XMPP address, each
          reserved character MUST be encoded to "\hexhex" as specified
          in [<a href="#ref-XEP-0106" title='"JID Escaping"'>XEP-0106</a>] (e.g., when transforming from SIP to XMPP,
          encode "'" as "\27").

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.3.%20%20Instance-Specific%20Mapping"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" id="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Instance-Specific Mapping</span>

   The meaning of a resourcepart in XMPP (i.e., the portion of a Jabber
   ID (JID) after the slash character, such as "foo" in
   "user@example.com/foo") matches that of a Globally Routable User
   Agent URI (GRUU) in SIP [<a href="./rfc5627" title='"Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5627</a>].  In both cases, these constructs
   identify a particular device associated with the bare JID
   ("localpart@domainpart") of an XMPP entity or with the Address of
   Record (AOR) of a SIP entity.  Therefore, it is reasonable to map the
   value of a "gr" URI parameter to an XMPP resourcepart and vice versa.

   The mapping described here does not apply to temporary GRUUs -- only
   to GRUUs associated with an Address of Record.

   The "gr" URI parameter in SIP can contain only characters from the
   ASCII range (although characters outside the ASCII range can be
   percent-encoded in accordance with [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>]), whereas an XMPP
   resourcepart can contain nearly any Unicode character [<a href="#ref-UNICODE" title='"The Unicode Standard, Version 6.3"'>UNICODE</a>].
   Therefore, Unicode characters outside the ASCII range need to be
   mapped to characters in the ASCII range, as described below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.4.%20%20SIP%20to%20XMPP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.4" id="section-6.4">6.4</a>.  SIP to XMPP</span>

   The following is a high-level algorithm for mapping a 'sip', 'sips',
   'im', or 'pres' URI to an XMPP address:

   1.  Remove URI scheme.

   2.  Split at the first '@' character into local part and hostname
       (mapping the latter is out of scope).

   3.  Translate any percent-encoded strings ("%hexhex") to percent-
       decoded octets.

   4.  Treat result as a UTF-8 string.

   5.  Translate "&amp;" to "\26", "'" to "\27", and "/" to "\2f",
       respectively in order to properly handle the characters
       disallowed in XMPP addresses but allowed in 'sip'/'sips' URIs and
       'im'/'pres' URIs as shown in Table 1 above (this is consistent
       with [<a href="#ref-XEP-0106" title='"JID Escaping"'>XEP-0106</a>]).

   6.  Apply Nodeprep profile of stringprep [<a href="./rfc3454" title='"Preparation of Internationalized Strings ("'>RFC3454</a>] or its replacement
       (see [<a href="./rfc6122" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Address Format"'>RFC6122</a>] and [<a href="#ref-XMPP-ADDRESS-FORMAT">XMPP-ADDRESS-FORMAT</a>]) for canonicalization
       (OPTIONAL).

   7.  Recombine local part with mapped hostname to form a bare JID
       ("localpart@domainpart").

   8.  If the (SIP) address contained a "gr" URI parameter, append a
       slash character "/" and the "gr" value to the bare JID to form a
       full JID ("localpart@domainpart/resourcepart").

   Several examples follow, illustrating steps 3, 5, and 8 described
   above.

      +----------------------------+--------------------------+
      | SIP URI                    |  XMPP Address            |
      +----------------------------+--------------------------+
      | sip:f%C3%BC@sip.example    |  f&amp;#xFC;@sip.example     |
      +----------------------------+--------------------------+
      | sip:o'malley@sip.example   |  o\27malley@sip.example  |
      +----------------------------+--------------------------+
      | sip:foo@sip.example;gr=bar |  foo@sip.example/bar     |
      +----------------------------+--------------------------+

   In the first example, the string "%C3%BC" is a percent-encoded
   representation of the UTF-8-encoded Unicode character LATIN SMALL
   LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS (U+00FC), whereas the string "&amp;#xFC;" is the
   same character shown for documentation purposes using the XML
   Notation defined in [<a href="./rfc3987" title='"Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)"'>RFC3987</a>] (in XMPP, it would be sent directly as
   a UTF-8-encoded Unicode character and not percent-encoded as in a SIP
   URI to comply with the URI syntax defined in [<a href="./rfc3986" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>]).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/6.5.%20%20XMPP%20to%20SIP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.5" id="section-6.5">6.5</a>.  XMPP to SIP</span>

   The following is a high-level algorithm for mapping an XMPP address
   to a 'sip', 'sips', 'im', or 'pres' URI:

   1.  Split XMPP address into localpart (mapping described in remaining
       steps), domainpart (hostname; mapping is out of scope), and
       resourcepart (specifier for particular device or connection, for
       which an OPTIONAL mapping is described below).

   2.  Apply Nodeprep profile of stringprep [<a href="./rfc3454" title='"Preparation of Internationalized Strings ("'>RFC3454</a>] or its replacement
       (see [<a href="./rfc6122" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Address Format"'>RFC6122</a>] and [<a href="#ref-XMPP-ADDRESS-FORMAT">XMPP-ADDRESS-FORMAT</a>]) for canonicalization of
       the XMPP localpart (OPTIONAL).

   3.  Translate "\26" to "&amp;", "\27" to "'", and "\2f" to "/",
       respectively (this is consistent with [<a href="#ref-XEP-0106" title='"JID Escaping"'>XEP-0106</a>]).

   4.  Determine if the foreign domain supports 'im' and 'pres' URIs
       (discovered via [<a href="./rfc2782" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC2782</a>] lookup as specified in [<a href="./rfc6121" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence"'>RFC6121</a>]), else
       assume that the foreign domain supports 'sip'/'sips' URIs.

   5.  If converting into 'im' or 'pres' URI, for each byte, if the byte
       is in the set (),.;[\] or is a UTF-8 character outside the ASCII
       range, then percent-encode that byte to "%hexhex" format.  If
       converting into 'sip' or 'sips' URI, for each byte, if the byte
       is in the set #%[\]^`{|} or is a UTF-8 character outside the
       ASCII range, then percent-encode that byte to "%hexhex" format.

   6.  Combine resulting local part with mapped hostname to form
       local@domain address.

   7.  Prepend with the string 'im:' (for XMPP &lt;message/&gt; stanzas) or
       'pres:' (for XMPP &lt;presence/&gt; stanzas) if foreign domain supports
       these, else prepend with the string 'sip:' or 'sips:' according
       to local service policy.

   8.  If the XMPP address included a resourcepart and the destination
       URI scheme is 'sip' or 'sips', optionally append the slash
       character '/' and then append the resourcepart (making sure to
       percent-encode any UTF-8 characters outside the ASCII range) as
       the "gr" URI parameter.

   Several examples follow, illustrating steps 3, 5, and 8 described
   above.

      +---------------------------+---------------------------------+
      | XMPP Address              |  SIP URI                        |
      +---------------------------+---------------------------------+
      | m\26m@xmpp.example        |  sip:m&amp;m@xmpp.example           |
      | tsch&amp;#xFC;ss@xmpp.example |  sip:tsch%C3%BCss@xmpp.example  |
      | baz@xmpp.example/qux      |  sip:baz@xmpp.example;gr=qux    |
      +---------------------------+---------------------------------+

   As above, in the first example the string "&amp;#xFC;" is the Unicode
   character LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS (U+00FC) shown for
   documentation purposes using the XML Notation defined in [<a href="./rfc3987" title='"Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)"'>RFC3987</a>]
   (in XMPP, it would be sent directly as a UTF-8-encoded Unicode
   character and not percent-encoded, whereas the string "%C3%BC" is a
   percent-encoded representation of the same character.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7.%20%20Error%20Mapping"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" id="section-7">7</a>.  Error Mapping</span>

   Various differences between XMPP error conditions and SIP response
   codes make it hard to provide a comprehensive and consistent mapping
   between the protocols:

   o  Whereas the set of XMPP error conditions is fixed in the core XMPP
      specification (and supplemented where needed by application-
      specific extensions), the set of SIP response codes is more open
      to change, as evidenced by the IANA registry of SIP response
      codes.

   o  XMPP has defined fewer error conditions related to stanza handling
      (22 are defined in [<a href="./rfc6120" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"'>RFC6120</a>]) than SIP has defined response codes
      related to message handling (at the date of this writing, 71 SIP
      response codes are registered with IANA as defined in [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>]
      and numerous SIP extensions).

   o  In many cases, the SIP response codes are more specific than the
      XMPP error conditions (e.g., from an XMPP perspective the SIP
      codes "413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI Too
      Long" are simply two different types of response to the same bad
      request, and the SIP codes "415 Unsupported Media Type" and "416
      Unsupported URI Scheme" are two different responses to a request
      that is not acceptable).

   o  SIP differentiates between responses about a particular endpoint
      or resource (the 4xx series) and responses about a user, i.e., all
      of a user's endpoints or resources (the 6xx series).  There is no
      such distinction in XMPP, since the same error condition can be
      returned in relation to the "bare JID" (localpart@domainpart) of a
      user or the "full JID" (localpart@domainpart/resourcepart) of a
      particular endpoint or resource, depending on the 'to' address of
      the original request.

   As a result of these and other factors, the mapping of error
   conditions and response codes is more of an art than a science.  This
   document provides suggested mappings, but implementations are free to
   deviate from these mappings if needed.  Also, because no XMPP error
   conditions are equivalent to the provisional (1xx) and successful
   (2xx) response codes in SIP, this document suggests mappings only for
   the SIP redirection (3xx), request failure (4xx), server failure
   (5xx), and global failure (6xx) response code families.

   Supplementary information about SIP response codes can be expressed
   in the "Reason-Phrase" in the Status-Line header, and detailed
   information about XMPP error conditions can be expressed in the
   &lt;text/&gt; child of the &lt;error/&gt; element.  Although the semantics of

   these constructs are specified in a slightly different way, it is
   reasonable for a gateway to map these constructs to each other if
   they are found in a SIP response or XMPP error stanza.

     Table 2: Mapping of XMPP Error Conditions to SIP Response Codes

   (1)  If the error relates to a "full JID" (localpart@domainpart/
        resourcepart), the SIP 405 response code is RECOMMENDED.  If the
        error relates to a "bare JID" (localpart@domainpart), the SIP
        501 response code is RECOMMENDED.

   (2)  If the error relates to a "full JID" (localpart@domainpart/
        resourcepart), the SIP response code from the 4xx series is
        RECOMMENDED.  If the error relates to a "bare JID"
        (localpart@domainpart), the SIP response code from the 6xx
        series is RECOMMENDED.

   (3)  If the &lt;gone/&gt; element includes XML character data specifying
        the new address, the error MUST be mapped to SIP 301; if not, it
        MUST be mapped to SIP 410.

   (4)  The XMPP &lt;remote-server-not-found/&gt; error can mean that the
        remote server either (a) does not exist or (b) cannot be
        resolved.  SIP has two different response codes here: 404 to
        cover (a) and 408 to cover (b).

   (5)  The XMPP &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error condition is widely used
        to inform the requesting entity that the intended recipient does
        not support the relevant feature, to signal that a server cannot
        perform the requested service either generally or in relation to
        a particular user, and to avoid disclosing whether a given
        account exists at all.  This is quite different from the
        semantics of the SIP 503 Service Unavailable response code,
        which is used to signal that communication with a server is
        impossible (e.g., even if the XMPP &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error
        condition is returned in relation to a specific user, the SIP
        503 response code will be interpreted as applying to all future
        requests to this server, not just requests for the specific
        user).  Therefore, mapping the XMPP &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error
        condition to the SIP 503 Service Unavailable response code is



<span class="grey">Saint-Andre, et al.          Standards Track                   [Page 16]</span></pre>

        NOT RECOMMENDED.  Although no precise mapping is available, the
        SIP 403 Forbidden and 405 Method Not Allowed response codes are
        closest in meaning to the XMPP &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error
        condition.

   The mapping of SIP response codes to XMPP error conditions SHOULD be
   as described in the following table.  If a gateway encounters a SIP
   response code that is not listed below, it SHOULD map a 3xx-series
   code to &lt;redirect/&gt;, a 4xx-series code to &lt;bad-request/&gt;, a 5xx-
   series code to &lt;internal-server-error&gt;, and a 6xx-series code to
   &lt;recipient-unavailable/&gt;.

     Table 3: Mapping of SIP Response Codes to XMPP Error Conditions

   (1)  When mapping SIP 301 to XMPP &lt;gone/&gt;, the &lt;gone/&gt; element MUST
        include XML character data specifying the new address.  When
        mapping SIP 410 to XMPP &lt;gone/&gt;, the &lt;gone/&gt; element MUST NOT
        include XML character data specifying a new address.

   (2)  The XMPP &lt;payment-required/&gt; error condition was removed in
        [<a href="./rfc6120" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"'>RFC6120</a>].  Therefore, a mapping to XMPP &lt;bad-request/&gt; is
        suggested instead.

   (3)  Depending on the scenario, other possible translations for
        SIP 403 are &lt;not-allowed/&gt; and &lt;policy-violation/&gt;.

   (4)  Depending on the scenario, another possible translation for
        SIP 404 is &lt;remote-server-not-found/&gt;.

   (5)  Depending on the scenario, another possible translation for
        SIP 408 is &lt;remote-server-not-found/&gt;.

   (6)  Codes 430 and 439 are defined in [<a href="./rfc5626" title='"Managing Client- Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5626</a>].

   (7)  Code 440 is defined in [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>].

   (8)  Code 489 is defined in [<a href="./rfc6665" title='"SIP-Specific Event Notification"'>RFC6665</a>].

   (9)  Regarding the semantic mismatch between XMPP
        &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; and SIP code 503, see note (5) in
        <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a> of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" id="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Detailed security considerations for SIP and XMPP are given in
   [<a href="./rfc3261" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and [<a href="./rfc6120" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"'>RFC6120</a>], respectively.

   To protect information sent between SIP and XMPP systems, deployed
   gateways SHOULD use Transport Layer Security (TLS) [<a href="./rfc5246" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>] when
   communicating over TCP and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   [<a href="./rfc6347" title='"Datagram Transport Layer Security Version 1.2"'>RFC6347</a>] when communicating over UDP.

   As specified in <a href="./rfc3261#section-26.4.4">SectionÂ 26.4.4 of [RFC3261]</a> and updated by [<a href="./rfc5630" title='"The Use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5630</a>],
   a To header or a Request-URI containing a Session Initiation Protocol
   Secure (SIPS) URI is used to indicate that all hops in a
   communication path need to be protected using TLS.  Because XMPP
   lacks a way to signal that all hops need to be protected, if the To
   header or Request-URI of a SIP message is a SIPS URI then the SIP-to-
   XMPP gateway MUST NOT translate the SIP message into an XMPP stanza
   and MUST NOT route it to the destination XMPP server (there might be
   exceptions to such a policy, such as explicit agreement among two
   operators to enforce per-hop security, but currently they are quite
   rare).

   A gateway between SIP and XMPP (in either direction) effectively acts
   as a SIP back-to-back user agent ("B2BUA").  The amplification
   vulnerability described in [<a href="./rfc5393" title='"Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"'>RFC5393</a>] can manifest itself with B2BUAs
   (see also [<a href="#ref-B2BUA-LOOP-DETECT">B2BUA-LOOP-DETECT</a>]), and a gateway SHOULD implement the
   loop-detection methods defined in that specification to help mitigate
   the possibility of amplification attacks.  Note that although it
   would be possible to signal the Max-Forwards and Max-Breadth SIP
   headers over XMPP using the Stanza Headers and Internet Metadata
   (SHIM) extension [<a href="#ref-XEP-0131" title='"Stanza Headers and Internet Metadata"'>XEP-0131</a>], that extension is not widely
   implemented; therefore, defenses against excessive looping and
   amplification attacks when messages pass back and forth through SIP
   and XMPP networks are out of scope for this document.  However, it

   ought to be addressed in the future, and implementations are strongly
   encouraged to incorporate appropriate countermeasures wherever
   possible.

   The ability to use a wide range of Unicode characters [<a href="#ref-UNICODE" title='"The Unicode Standard, Version 6.3"'>UNICODE</a>] can
   lead to security issues, especially the possibility of user confusion
   over identifiers containing visually similar characters (also called
   "confusable characters" or "confusables").  The PRECIS framework
   specification [<a href="#ref-PRECIS" title='"PRECIS Framework: Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols"'>PRECIS</a>] describes some of these security issues, and
   additional guidance can be found in [<a href="#ref-UTS39" title='"Unicode Technical Standard #39: Unicode Security Mechanisms"'>UTS39</a>].
