Abstract

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support the SEED
   encryption algorithm as a bulk cipher algorithm.

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
   protocol [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] to support the SEED encryption algorithm as a bulk
   cipher algorithm.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.1.%20%20SEED"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" id="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  SEED</span>

   SEED is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was developed by Korea
   Information Security Agency (KISA) and a group of experts, beginning
   in 1998.  The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the key
   length is also 128-bit.  SEED has the 16-round Feistel structure.  A
   128-bit input is divided into two 64-bit blocks and the right 64-bit
   block is an input to the round function with a 64-bit subkey
   generated from the key scheduling.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc4162">RFC 4162</a>               SEED Cipher Suites to TLS             August 2005</span>


   SEED is easily implemented in various software and hardware because
   it is designed to increase the efficiency of memory storage and the
   simplicity of generating keys without degrading the security of the
   algorithm.  In particular, it can be effectively adopted in a
   computing environment that has a restricted resources such as mobile
   devices, smart cards, and so on.

   SEED is a national industrial association standard [<a href="#ref-TTASSEED" title='"128-bit Symmetric Block Cipher (SEED)"'>TTASSEED</a>] and is
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial
   services operated on wired &amp; wireless PKI.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [<a href="#ref-SEED-ALG" title='"The SEED Encryption Algorithm"'>SEED-ALG</a>].  The SEED homepage,
   <a href="http://www.kisa.or.kr/seed/seed_eng.html">http://www.kisa.or.kr/seed/seed_eng.html</a>, contains a wealth of
   information about SEED, including detailed specification, evaluation
   report, test vectors, and so on.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
   as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Proposed%20Cipher%20Suites"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Proposed Cipher Suites</span>

   The new cipher suites proposed here have the following definitions:

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00, 0x96};
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00, 0x97};
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00, 0x98};
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x99};
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x9A};
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x9B};

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Cipher%20Suite%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Cipher Suite Definitions</span>

   All the cipher suites described here use SEED in cipher block
   chaining (CBC) mode as a bulk cipher algorithm.  SEED is a 128-bit
   block cipher with 128-bit key size.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.2.%20%20Hash"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" id="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Hash</span>

   All the cipher suites described here use SHA-1 [<a href="#ref-SHA-1" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>SHA-1</a>] in an HMAC
   construction as described in section 5 of [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>].

   The cipher suites defined here differ in the type of certificate and
   key exchange method.  They use the following options:

      CipherSuite                         Key Exchange Algorithm

      TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA                    RSA
      TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA                 DH_DSS
      TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA                 DH_RSA
      TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA                DHE_DSS
      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA                DHE_RSA
      TLS_DH_anon_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA                DH_anon

   For the meanings of the terms RSA, DH_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA,
   and DH_anon, please refer to sections <a href="#section-7.4.2">7.4.2</a> and <a href="#section-7.4.3">7.4.3</a> of [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   It is not believed that the new cipher suites are less secure than
   the corresponding older ones.  No security problem has been found on
   SEED.  SEED is robust against known attacks, including differential
   cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, and related key attacks, etc.
   SEED has gone through wide public scrutinizing procedures.
   Especially, it has been evaluated and also considered
   cryptographically secure by trustworthy organizations such as ISO/IEC
   JTC 1/SC 27 and Japan CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and Evaluation
   Committees) [<a href="#ref-ISOSEED" title="&quot;National Body contributions on NP 18033 'Encryption Algorithms' in Response to SC 27 N2563 (ATT.3 Korea Contribution)&quot;">ISOSEED</a>] [<a href="#ref-CRYPTREC" title='"SEED Evaluation Report"'>CRYPTREC</a>].  SEED has been submitted to several
   other standardization bodies such as ISO (ISO/IEC 18033-3) and IETF
   S/MIME Mail Security [<a href="#ref-SEED-SMIME" title='"Use of the SEED Encryption Algorithm in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>SEED-SMIME</a>]; and it is under consideration.
   For further security considerations, the reader is encouraged to read
   [<a href="#ref-SEED-EVAL" title='"Self Evaluation Report"'>SEED-EVAL</a>].

   For other security considerations, please refer to the security of
   the corresponding older cipher suites described in [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-AES-TLS" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>AES-TLS</a>].
