Abstract

   This document describes a file format suitable for describing
   directory information or modifications made to directory information.
   The file format, known as LDIF, for LDAP Data Interchange Format, is
   typically used to import and export directory information between
   LDAP-based directory servers, or to describe a set of changes which
   are to be applied to a directory.

Background and Intended Usage

   There are a number of situations where a common interchange format is
   desirable.  For example, one might wish to export a copy of the
   contents of a directory server to a file, move that file to a
   different machine, and import the contents into a second directory
   server.

   Additionally, by using a well-defined interchange format, development
   of data import tools from legacy systems is facilitated.  A fairly
   simple set of tools written in awk or perl can, for example, convert
   a database of personnel information into an LDIF file. This file can
   then be imported into a directory server, regardless of the internal
   database representation the target directory server uses.

   The LDIF format was originally developed and used in the University
   of Michigan LDAP implementation.  The first use of LDIF was in
   describing directory entries.  Later, the format was expanded to
   allow representation of changes to directory entries.

   Relationship to the application/directory MIME content-type:

   The application/directory MIME content-type [<a href="#ref-1" title='"A MIME Content-Type for Directory Information"'>1</a>] is a general
   framework and format for conveying directory information, and is
   independent of any particular directory service.  The LDIF format is
   a simpler format which is perhaps easier to create, and may also be
   used, as noted, to describe a set of changes to be applied to a
   directory.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "MAY", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT"
   used in this document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Key Words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>7</a>].

Definition of the LDAP Data Interchange Format

   The LDIF format is used to convey directory information, or a
   description of a set of changes made to directory entries.  An LDIF
   file consists of a series of records separated by line separators.  A
   record consists of a sequence of lines describing a directory entry,
   or a sequence of lines describing a set of changes to a directory
   entry.  An LDIF file specifies a set of directory entries, or a set
   of changes to be applied to directory entries, but not both.

   There is a one-to-one correlation between LDAP operations that modify
   the directory (add, delete, modify, and modrdn), and the types of
   changerecords described below ("add", "delete", "modify", and
   "modrdn" or "moddn").  This correspondence is intentional, and
   permits a straightforward translation from LDIF changerecords to
   protocol operations.

Formal Syntax Definition of LDIF

   The following definition uses the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   specified in <a href="./rfc2234">RFC 2234</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>2</a>].

   Notes on LDIF Syntax

      1)  For the LDIF format described in this document, the version
          number MUST be "1". If the version number is absent,
          implementations MAY choose to interpret the contents as an
          older LDIF file format, supported by the University of
          Michigan ldap-3.3 implementation [<a href="#ref-8">8</a>].



<span class="grey">Good                        Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-6"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2849">RFC 2849</a>              LDAP Data Interchange Format             June 2000</span>


      2)  Any non-empty line, including comment lines, in an LDIF file
          MAY be folded by inserting a line separator (SEP) and a SPACE.
          Folding MUST NOT occur before the first character of the line.
          In other words, folding a line into two lines, the first of
          which is empty, is not permitted. Any line that begins with a
          single space MUST be treated as a continuation of the previous
          (non-empty) line. When joining folded lines, exactly one space
          character at the beginning of each continued line must be
          discarded. Implementations SHOULD NOT fold lines in the middle
          of a multi-byte UTF-8 character.

      3)  Any line that begins with a pound-sign ("#", ASCII 35) is a
          comment line, and MUST be ignored when parsing an LDIF file.

      4)  Any dn or rdn that contains characters other than those
          defined as "SAFE-UTF8-CHAR", or begins with a character other
          than those defined as "SAFE-INIT-UTF8-CHAR", above, MUST be
          base-64 encoded.  Other values MAY be base-64 encoded.  Any
          value that contains characters other than those defined as
          "SAFE-CHAR", or begins with a character other than those
          defined as "SAFE-INIT-CHAR", above, MUST be base-64 encoded.
          Other values MAY be base-64 encoded.

      5)  When a zero-length attribute value is to be included directly
          in an LDIF file, it MUST be represented as
          AttributeDescription ":" FILL SEP.  For example, "seeAlso:"
          followed by a newline represents a zero-length "seeAlso"
          attribute value.  It is also permissible for the value
          referred to by a URL to be of zero length.

      6) When a URL is specified in an attrval-spec, the following
          conventions apply:

         a) Implementations SHOULD support the file:// URL format.  The
            contents of the referenced file are to be included verbatim
            in the interpreted output of the LDIF file.
         b) Implementations MAY support other URL formats.  The
            semantics associated with each supported URL will be
            documented in an associated Applicability Statement.

      7)  Distinguished names, relative distinguished names, and
          attribute values of DirectoryString syntax MUST be valid UTF-8
          strings.  Implementations that read LDIF MAY interpret files
          in which these entities are stored in some other character set
          encoding, but implementations MUST NOT generate LDIF content
          which does not contain valid UTF-8 data.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2849">RFC 2849</a>              LDAP Data Interchange Format             June 2000</span>


      8)  Values or distinguished names that end with SPACE SHOULD be
          base-64 encoded.

      9)  When controls are included in an LDIF file, implementations
          MAY choose to ignore some or all of them. This may be
          necessary if the changes described in the LDIF file are being
          sent on an LDAPv2 connection (LDAPv2 does not support
          controls), or the particular controls are not supported by the
          remote server. If the criticality of a control is "true", then
          the implementation MUST either include the control, or MUST
          NOT send the operation to a remote server.

      10) When an attrval-spec, distinguishedName, or rdn is base64-
          encoded, the encoding rules specified in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>5</a>] are used with the
          following exceptions:  a) The requirement that base64 output
          streams must be represented as lines of no more than 76
          characters is removed. Lines in LDIF files may only be folded
          according to the folding rules described in note 2, above.  b)
          Base64 strings in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>5</a>] may contain characters other than those
          defined in BASE64-CHAR, and are ignored. LDIF does not permit
          any extraneous characters, other than those used for line
          folding.

Security Considerations

   Given typical directory applications, an LDIF file is likely to
   contain sensitive personal data.  Appropriate measures should be
   taken to protect the privacy of those persons whose data is contained
   in an LDIF file.

   Since ":&lt;" directives can cause external content to be included when
   processing an LDIF file, one should be cautious of accepting LDIF
   files from external sources.  A "trojan" LDIF file could name a file
   with sensitive contents and cause it to be included in a directory
   entry, which a hostile entity could read via LDAP.

   LDIF does not provide any method for carrying authentication
   information with an LDIF file.  Users of LDIF files must take care to
   verify the integrity of an LDIF file received from an external
   source.

Acknowledgments

   The LDAP Interchange Format was developed as part of the University
   of Michigan LDAP reference implementation, and was developed by Tim
   Howes, Mark Smith, and Gordon Good.  It is based in part upon work
   supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.  NCR-
   9416667.

   Members of the IETF LDAP Extensions Working group provided many
   helpful suggestions. In particular, Hallvard B. Furuseth of the
   University of Oslo made many significant contributions to this
   document, including a thorough review and rewrite of the BNF.
