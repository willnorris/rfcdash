   Attached is a copy of a revision to <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> of BBN Report No.
   1822; the revised version of the Appendix is our first attempt to
   make the list of sites attached to the ARPA Network prospective
   rather than retrospective.  We are adopting this approach because of
   the large number of sites scheduled for attachment in the near
   future, and because many Hosts apparently require a site's address to
   be in some local table before their NCPs will permit communication
   with the site.  Therefore, we urge such Hosts to add the new sites to
   their lists of addresses as soon as possible.  Also, please note the
   address change which will be made at BBN on exactly September first.

   Incidentally, it seems to us that it is irrational for an NCP to
   discard otherwise valid messages, simply because the sender's address
   doesn't appear in a local table.  Similarly, it seems almost as
   irrational for an NCP to prevent a local user from trying to
   communicate with a remote site, the address of which is known to the
   user but not stored in the NCP's tables.

APPENDIX A

IMP AND HOST SITE IDENTIFICATION

   Bit 9-16 of the leader of most Host-to-IMP or IMP-to-Host messages
   define a network address related to the message (these bits are not
   meaningful for message types 1, 2, and 4).  In a Host-to-IMP message
   the network address identifies a particular Host to which the message
   should be delivered.  In an IMP-to-Host message the network address
   identifies the Host from which the message originated.

   A network address consists of six bits (bits 11-16 of the leader)
   which specify an IMP number, preceded by two bits (bits 9-10 of the
   leader) which specify the Host number of a particular Host connected
   to that IMP.  The table below gives the decimal values of IMP number,
   Host number, and network address for each Host currently connected to
   the ARPA Network or scheduled for connection in the near future.
   Scheduled installation dates are also shown for Hosts not currently
   connected; these dates, however, are subject to change without
   notice.

   Note 1: Prior to September 1, 1971 the BBN PDP-1O (A) will be Host
   number 0 (network address 5) and the BBN DDP-516 will be Host number
   1 (network address 69).  The address change is to be made during the
   day on 9/1/71.
