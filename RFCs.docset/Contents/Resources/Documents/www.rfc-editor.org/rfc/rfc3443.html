Abstract

   This document describes Time To Live (TTL) processing in hierarchical
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks and is motivated by
   the need to formalize a TTL-transparent mode of operation for an MPLS
   label-switched path.  It updates <a href="./rfc3032">RFC 3032</a>, "MPLS Label Stack
   Encoding".  TTL processing in both Pipe and Uniform Model
   hierarchical tunnels are specified with examples for both "push" and
   "pop" cases.  The document also complements <a href="./rfc3270">RFC 3270</a>, "MPLS Support
   of Differentiated Services" and ties together the terminology
   introduced in that document with TTL processing in hierarchical MPLS
   networks.

   This document describes Time To Live (TTL) processing in hierarchical
   MPLS networks.  We believe that this document adds details that have

   In particular, a new mode of operation (referred to as the Pipe
   Model) is introduced to support the practice of configuring MPLS LSPs
   such that packets transiting the LSP see the tunnel as a single hop
   regardless of the number of intermediary label switch routers (LSR).
   The Pipe Model for TTL is currently being used in multiple networks
   and is provided as an option configurable by the network operator by
   several vendors.

   This document formalizes the TTL processing in MPLS networks and ties
   it with the terminology introduced in [<a href="#ref-MPLS-DS" title='"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services"'>MPLS-DS</a>].

   a) [<a href="#ref-MPLS-ENCAPS" title='"MPLS Label Stack Encoding"'>MPLS-ENCAPS</a>] only covers the Uniform Model and does NOT address
      the Pipe Model or the Short Pipe Model.  This document addresses
      these two models and for completeness will also address the
      Uniform Model.

   b) [<a href="#ref-MPLS-ENCAPS" title='"MPLS Label Stack Encoding"'>MPLS-ENCAPS</a>] does not cover hierarchical LSPs.  This document
      addresses this issue.

   c) [<a href="#ref-MPLS-ENCAPS" title='"MPLS Label Stack Encoding"'>MPLS-ENCAPS</a>] does not define TTL processing in the presence of
      Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP).  This document addresses this
      issue.

   As defined in [<a href="#ref-MPLS-ENCAPS" title='"MPLS Label Stack Encoding"'>MPLS-ENCAPS</a>], MPLS packets use a MPLS shim header that
   indicates the following information about a packet:

   a) MPLS Label (20 bits)
   b) TTL (8 bits)
   c) Bottom of stack (1 bit)
   d) Experimental bits (3 bits)

   The experimental bits were later redefined in [<a href="#ref-MPLS-DS" title='"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services"'>MPLS-DS</a>] to indicate
   the scheduling and shaping behavior that could be associated with an
   MPLS packet.

   [<a id="ref-MPLS-DS">MPLS-DS</a>] also defined two models for MPLS tunnel operation: Pipe and
   Uniform Models.  In the Pipe Model, a MPLS network acts like a
   circuit when MPLS packets traverse the network such that only the LSP
   ingress and egress points are visible to nodes that are outside the
   tunnel.  A Short variation of the Pipe Model is also defined in
   [<a href="#ref-MPLS-DS" title='"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services"'>MPLS-DS</a>] to differentiate between different egress forwarding and
   QoS treatments.  On the other hand, the Uniform Model makes all the

   nodes that a LSP traverses visible to nodes outside the tunnel.  We
   will extend the Pipe and Uniform Models to include TTL processing in
   the following sections.  Furthermore, TTL processing, when performing
   PHP, is also described in this document.  For a detailed description
   of Pipe and Uniform Models, please see [<a href="#ref-MPLS-DS" title='"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services"'>MPLS-DS</a>].

   TTL processing in MPLS networks can be broken down into two logical
   blocks: (i) the incoming TTL determination to take into account any
   tunnel egress due to MPLS Pop operations; (ii) packet processing of
   (possibly) exposed packets and outgoing TTLs.

   We also note here that signaling the LSP type (Pipe, Short Pipe or
   Uniform Model) is out of the scope of this document, and that is also
   not addressed in the current versions of the label distribution
   protocols, e.g. LDP [<a href="#ref-MPLS-LDP" title='"LDP Specification"'>MPLS-LDP</a>] and RSVP-TE [<a href="#ref-MPLS-RSVP" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>MPLS-RSVP</a>].  Currently,
   the LSP type is configured by the network operator manually by means
   of either a command line or network management interface.

   iTTL: The TTL value to use as the incoming TTL.  No checks are
   performed on the iTTL.

   oTTL: This is the TTL value used as the outgoing TTL value (see
   <a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a> for exception).  It is always (iTTL - 1) unless otherwise
   stated.

   oTTL Check: Check if oTTL is greater than 0.  If the oTTL Check is
   false, then the packet is not forwarded.  Note that the oTTL check is
   performed only if any outgoing TTL (either IP or MPLS) is set to oTTL
   (see <a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a> for exception).

   of the 3 models  (Uniform, Short Pipe and Pipe) in the
   presence/absence of PHP (where applicable).

   tunneled packet, as opposed to the encapsulating packet.

   Since the label has already been popped by the LSP's penultimate

   tunneled packet has been decremented by two, with or without PHP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.4.%20Incoming%20TTL%20%28iTTL%29%20determination"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4">3.4</a>. Incoming TTL (iTTL) determination</span>

   If the incoming packet is an IP packet, then the iTTL is the TTL
   value of the incoming IP packet.

   If the incoming packet is an MPLS packet and we are performing a
   Push/Swap/PHP, then the iTTL is the TTL of the topmost incoming
   label.

   If the incoming packet is an MPLS packet and we are performing a Pop
   (tunnel termination), the iTTL is based on the tunnel type (Pipe or
   Uniform) of the LSP that was popped.  If the popped label belonged to
   a Pipe Model LSP, then the iTTL is the value of the TTL field of the
   header, exposed after the label was popped (note that for the purpose
   of this document, the exposed header may be either an IP header or an
   MPLS label).  If the popped label belonged to a Uniform Model LSP,
   then the iTTL is equal to the TTL of the popped label.  If multiple
   Pop operations are performed sequentially, then the procedure given
   above is repeated with one exception: the iTTL computed during the
   previous Pop is used as the TTL of subsequent labels being popped;
   i.e. the TTL contained in the subsequent label is essentially ignored
   and replaced with the iTTL computed during the previous pop.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.5.%20Outgoing%20TTL%20Determination%20and%20Packet%20Processing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" id="section-3.5">3.5</a>. Outgoing TTL Determination and Packet Processing</span>

   After the iTTL computation is performed, the oTTL check is performed.
   If the oTTL check succeeds, then the outgoing TTL of the
   (labeled/unlabeled) packet is calculated and packet headers are
   updated as defined below.

   If the packet was routed as an IP packet, the TTL value of the IP
   packet is set to oTTL (iTTL - 1).  The TTL value(s) for any pushed
   label(s) is determined as described in <a href="#section-3.6">section 3.6</a>.

   For packets that are routed as MPLS, we have four cases:

   1) Swap-only: The routed label is swapped with another label and the
      TTL field of the outgoing label is set to oTTL.

   2) Swap followed by a Push: The swapped operation is performed as
      described in (1).  The TTL value(s) of any pushed label(s) is
      determined as described in <a href="#section-3.6">section 3.6</a>.

   3) Penultimate Hop Pop (PHP): The routed label is popped.  The oTTL
      check should be performed irrespective of whether the oTTL is used
      to update the TTL field of the outgoing header.  If the PHPed
      label belonged to a Short Pipe Model LSP, then the TTL field of
      the PHP exposed header is neither checked nor updated.  If the

      PHPed label was a Uniform Model LSP, then the TTL field of the PHP
      exposed header is set to the oTTL.  The TTL value(s) of additional
      labels are determined as described in <a href="#section-3.6">section 3.6</a>

   4) Pop: The pop operation happens before routing and hence it is not
      considered here.

   For each pushed Uniform Model label, the TTL is copied from the
   label/IP-packet immediately underneath it.

   For each pushed Pipe Model or Short Pipe Model label, the TTL field
   is set to a value configured by the network operator.  In most
   implementations, this value is set to 255 by default.

   1) Although iTTL can be decremented by a value larger than 1 while it
      is being updated or oTTL is being determined, this feature should
      be only used for compensating for network nodes that are not
      capable of decrementing TTL values.

   2) Whenever iTTL is decremented, the implementer must make sure that
      the value does not become negative.

   3) In the Short Pipe Model with PHP enabled, the TTL of the tunneled
      packet is unchanged after the PHP operation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20Conclusion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>. Conclusion</span>

   This Internet Document describes how the TTL field can be processed
   in an MPLS network.  We clarified the various methods that are
   applied in the presence of hierarchical tunnels and completed the
   integration of Pipe and Uniform Models with TTL processing.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   This document does not add any new security issues other than the
   ones defined in [<a href="#ref-MPLS-ENCAPS" title='"MPLS Label Stack Encoding"'>MPLS-ENCAPS</a>, <a href="#ref-MPLS-DS" title='"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services"'>MPLS-DS</a>].  In particular, the document
   does not define a new protocol or expand an existing one and does not
   introduce security problems into the existing protocols.  The authors
   believe that clarification of TTL handling in MPLS networks benefits
   service providers and their customers since troubleshooting is
   simplified.
