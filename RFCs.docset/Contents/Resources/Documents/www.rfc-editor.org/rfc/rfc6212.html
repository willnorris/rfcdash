<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   [<a id="ref-AUTHRES">AUTHRES</a>] defined a new header field for electronic mail messages
   that presents the results of a message authentication effort in a
   machine-readable format.  In the interim, a proposal for rudimentary
   domain-level reputation assessment, called Vouch By Reference, [<a href="#ref-VBR" title='"Vouch By Reference"'>VBR</a>]
   was published and is now beginning to see popular use.

   This memo thus registers an additional reporting property allowing a
   VBR result to be relayed as an annotation in a message header.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20%20Keywords"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  Keywords</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORDS</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Discussion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Discussion</span>

   Vouch By Reference [<a href="#ref-VBR" title='"Vouch By Reference"'>VBR</a>] introduced a mechanism by which a message
   receiver can query a "vouching" service to determine whether or not a
   trusted third party is willing to state that mail from a particular
   source can be considered legitimate.  When this assessment is done at
   an inbound border mail gateway, it would be useful to relay the
   result of that assessment to internal mail entities such as filters
   or user agents.

   Reactions to the information contained in an Authentication-Results
   header field that contains VBR (or any) results are not specified
   here, as they are entirely a matter of local policy at the receiver.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4.%20%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" id="section-4">4</a>.  Definition</span>

   This memo adds to the "Email Authentication Methods" registry,
   created by IANA upon publication of [<a href="#ref-AUTHRES" title='"Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status"'>AUTHRES</a>], the following:

   o  The method "vbr"; and

   o  Associated with that method, the properties (reporting items)
      "header.md" and "header.mv".

   If "header.md" is present, its value MUST be the DNS domain name
   about which a VBR query was made.  If "header.mv" is present, its
   value MUST be the DNS domain name that was queried as the potential
   voucher for the "header.md" domain.

   If the VBR query was made based on the content of a "VBR-Info" header
   field present on an incoming message, "header.md" is typically taken
   from the "md" tag of the "VBR-Info" header field, and "header.mv" is
   typically one of the values of the "mv" tag in the "VBR-Info" header
   field on that message.  However, [<a href="#ref-VBR" title='"Vouch By Reference"'>VBR</a>] permits a different mechanism
   for selection of the subject domain and/or list of vouchers, ignoring
   those present in any "VBR-Info" header field the message might have
   included.  A server could even conduct a VBR query when no "VBR-Info"
   field was present, based on locally configured policy options.  Where
   such mechanisms are applied, the verifying server MAY generate an
   Authentication-Results field to relay the results of the VBR query.

   This memo also adds to the "Email Authentication Result Names"
   registry the following result codes and definitions:

   none:  No valid VBR-Info header was found in the message, or a domain
      name to be queried could not be determined.

   pass:  A VBR query was completed, and the vouching service queried
      gave a positive response.

   fail:  A VBR query was completed, and the vouching service queried
      did not give a positive response, or the message contained
      multiple VBR-Info header fields with different "mc" values
      (see [<a href="#ref-VBR" title='"Vouch By Reference"'>VBR</a>]).

   temperror:  A VBR query was attempted but could not be completed due
      to some error that is likely transient in nature, such as a
      temporary DNS error.  A later attempt may produce a final result.

   Example 1: Header Field Reporting Results from a VBR Query

   Here we see an example of a message that was signed using DomainKeys
   Identified Mail (DKIM) and that also included a VBR-Info header
   field.  On receipt, it is found that the "md=" field in the latter
   and the "d=" field in the former matched, and also that the DKIM
   signature verified, so a VBR query was performed.  The vouching
   service, voucher.example.org, indicated that the sender can be
   trusted, so a "pass" result is included in the Authentication-Results
   field affixed prior to delivery.
