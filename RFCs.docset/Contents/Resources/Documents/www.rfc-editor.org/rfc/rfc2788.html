Introduction

   A networked application is a realization of some well-defined service
   on one or more host computers that is accessible via some network,
   uses some network for its internal operations, or both.

   There are a wide range of networked applications for which it is
   appropriate to provide SNMP monitoring of their network usage.  This
   includes applications using both TCP/IP and OSI networking.  This
   document defines a MIB which contains the elements common to the
   monitoring of any network service application.  This information
   includes a table of all monitorable network service applications, a
   count of the associations (connections) to each application, and
   basic information about the parameters and status of each
   application-related association.

   This MIB may be used on its own for any application, and for most
   simple applications this will suffice.  This MIB is also designed to
   serve as a building block which can be used in conjunction with
   application-specific monitoring and management.  Two examples of this
   are MIBs defining additional variables for monitoring a Message
   Transfer Agent (MTA) service or a Directory Service Agent (DSA)
   service. It is expected that further MIBs of this nature will be
   specified.

   This MIB does not attempt to provide facilities for management of the
   host or hosts the network service application runs on, nor does it
   provide facilities for monitoring applications that provide something
   other than a network service.  Host resource and general application
   monitoring is handled by either the Host Resources MIB [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Host Resources MIB"'>1</a>] or the
   application MIB [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Definitions of System-Level Managed Objects for Applications"'>2</a>].

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in <a href="./rfc2571">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>3</a>].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
       16, <a href="./rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>4</a>], STD 16, <a href="./rfc1212">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>5</a>] and <a href="./rfc1215">RFC 1215</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>6</a>]. The
       second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, <a href="./rfc2578">RFC 2578</a>
       [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>7</a>], STD 58, <a href="./rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>8</a>] and STD 58, <a href="./rfc2580">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>9</a>].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>10</a>]. A second version of the SNMP
       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="./rfc1901">RFC 1901</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>11</a>] and
       <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>12</a>].  The third version of the message protocol is
       called SNMPv3 and described in <a href="./rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>12</a>], <a href="./rfc2572">RFC 2572</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>13</a>] and
       <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>14</a>].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, <a href="./rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>10</a>]. A second set of protocol
       operations and associated PDU formats is described in <a href="./rfc1905">RFC 1905</a>
       [<a href="#ref-15" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>15</a>].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in <a href="./rfc2573">RFC 2573</a> [<a href="#ref-16" title='"SNMPv3 Applications"'>16</a>] and
       the view-based access control mechanism described in <a href="./rfc2575">RFC 2575</a>
       [<a href="#ref-17" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>17</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   Much effort has been expended in developing tools to manage lower
   layer network facilities.  However, relatively little work has been
   done on managing application layer entities.  It is neither efficient
   nor reasonable to manage all aspects of application layer entities
   using only lower layer information. Moreover, the difficulty of
   managing application entities in this way increases dramatically as
   application entities become more complex.

   This leads to a substantial need to monitor applications which
   provide network services, particularly distributed components such as
   MTAs and DSAs, by monitoring specific aspects of the application
   itself.  Reasons to monitor such components include but are not
   limited to measuring load, detecting broken connectivity, isolating
   system failures, and locating congestion.

   In order to manage network service applications effectively two
   requirements must be met:

   (1) It must be possible to monitor a large number of components
       (typical for a large organization).





<span class="grey">Freed &amp; Kille               Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2788">RFC 2788</a>            Network Services Monitoring MIB           March 2000</span>


   (2) Application monitoring must be integrated into general network
       management.

   This specification defines simple read-only access; this is
   sufficient to determine up/down status and provide an indication of a
   broad class of operational problems.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.1.%20%20General%20Relationship%20to%20Other%20MIBs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  General Relationship to Other MIBs</span>

   This MIB is intended to only provide facilities common to the
   monitoring of any network service application.  It does not provide
   all the facilities necessary to monitor any specific application.
   Each specific type of network service application is expected to have
   a MIB of its own that makes use of these common facilities.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.2.%20%20Restriction%20of%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" id="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Restriction of Scope</span>

   The framework provided here is very minimal; there is a lot more that
   could be done. For example:

   (1) General network service application configuration monitoring and
       control.

   (2) Detailed examination and modification of individual entries in
       service-specific request queues.

   (3) Probing to determine the status of a specific request (e.g., the
       location of a mail message with a specific message-id).

   (4) Requesting that certain actions be performed (e.g., forcing an
       immediate connection and transfer of pending messages to some
       specific system).

   All these capabilities are both impressive and useful.  However,
   these capabilities would require provisions for strict security
   checking.  These capabilities would also mandate a much more complex
   design, with many characteristics likely to be fairly
   implementation-specific.  As a result such facilities are likely to
   be both contentious and difficult to implement.

   This document religiously keeps things simple and focuses on the
   basic monitoring aspect of managing applications providing network
   services.  The goal here is to provide a framework which is simple,
   useful, and widely implementable.

   This MIB attempts to provide information about the operational
   aspects of an application. Further information about the actual
   configuration of a given application may be kept in other places; the
   applDirectoryName or applURL may be used to point to places where
   such information is kept.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3.%20%20Application%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a>.  Application Objects</span>

   This MIB defines a set of general purpose attributes which would be
   appropriate for a range of applications that provide network
   services.  Both OSI and non-OSI services can be accommodated.
   Additional tables defined in extensions to this MIB provide
   attributes specific to specific network services.

   A table is defined which will have one row for each operational
   network service application on the system.  The only static
   information held on the application is its name.  All other static
   information should be obtained from various directory services.  The
   applDirectoryName is an external key, which allows an SNMP MIB entry
   to be cleanly related to the X.500 Directory.  In SNMP terms, the
   applications are grouped in a table called applTable, which is
   indexed by an integer key applIndex.

   The type of the application will be determined by one or both of:

    (1)   Additional MIB variables specific to the applications.

    (2)   An association to the application of a specific protocol.

   This revision corrects a few minor technical errors in the
   construction of the network services MIB in <a href="./rfc2248">RFC 2248</a> [<a href="#ref-22" title='"Network Services Monitoring MIB"'>22</a>]. In
   addition, the applName, applVersion, and applDescription fields have
   been changed from DisplayStrings to SnmpAdminStrings. The reference
   to <a href="./rfc1779">RFC 1779</a> has also been updated to <a href="./rfc2253">RFC 2253</a>, which in turn adds the
   ability for distinguished names to be in the UTF-8 character set.

   This document is a product of the Mail and Directory Management
   (MADMAN) Working Group.  It is based on an earlier MIB designed by S.
   Kille, T.  Lenggenhager, D. Partain, and W. Yeong.  The Electronic
   Mail Association's TSC committee was instrumental in providing
   feedback on and suggesting enhancements to <a href="./rfc1565">RFC 1565</a> [<a href="#ref-23" title='"Network Services Monitoring MIB"'>23</a>] that have
   led to the present document.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.







<span class="grey">Freed &amp; Kille               Standards Track                    [Page 20]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-21"></span>

   However, this MIB does provide passive information about the
   existence, type, and configuration of applications on a given host
   that could potentially indicate some sort of vulnerability. Finally,
   the information MIB provides about network usage could be used to
   analyze network traffic patterns.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="./rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>14</a>] and the View-based
   Access Control Model <a href="./rfc2575">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="#ref-17" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>17</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
