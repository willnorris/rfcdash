Abstract

   This memo discusses and defines terms associated with performance
   benchmarking tests and the results of these tests in the context of
   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based switching devices supporting
   ABR (Available Bit Rate).  The terms defined in this memo will be
   used in addition to terms defined in RFCs 1242, 2285, and 2544 and
   2761.  This memo is a product of the Benchmarking Methodology Working
   Group (BMWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document provides terminology for benchmarking ATM based
   switching devices supporting ABR.  It extends terminology already
   defined for benchmarking network interconnect devices in RFC's 1242,
   2285, and 2544 and 2761.  Although some of the definitions in this
   memo may be applicable to a broader group of network interconnect
   devices, the primary focus of the terminology in this memo is on ATM
   ABR.

   This memo contains two major sections: Background and Definitions.
   The background section provides the reader with an overview of the
   technology and IETF formalisms.  The definitions section is split
   into two sub-sections.  The formal definitions sub-section is
   provided as a courtesy to the reader.  The measurement definitions
   sub-section contains performance metrics with inherent units.

   This document assumes that necessary services are available and
   active.  For example, IP connectivity requires SSCOP connectivity
   between signaling entities.  Further, it is assumed that the SUT has

   the ability to configure ATM addresses (via hard coded addresses,
   ILMI or PNNI neighbor discovery), has the ability to run SSCOP, and
   has the ability to perform signaled call setups (via UNI or PNNI
   signaling).  Finally, this document presents only the terminology
   associated with benchmarking IP performance over ATM; therefore, it
   does not represent a total compilation of ATM test terminology.

   The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking
   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents.  The
   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms.
   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect
   the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.

   <a href="rfc1242.html">RFC 1242</a>, "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect
   Devices", should be consulted before attempting to make use of this
   document.  <a href="rfc2544.html">RFC 2544</a>, "Benchmarking Methodology for Network
   Interconnect Devices", contains discussions of a number of terms
   relevant to the benchmarking of switching devices and should be
   consulted.  <a href="rfc2285.html">RFC 2285</a>, "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching
   Devices", contains a number of terms pertaining to traffic
   distributions and datagram interarrival.  <a href="rfc2761.html">RFC 2761</a>, "Terminology for
   ATM Benchmarking", contains a number terms pertaining to traffic
   management [TM4.0, TM4.1].  Many of the metrics defined in <a href="rfc2761.html">RFC 2761</a>
   (e.g., CDV, CER, CLR, CMR, and CTD) also apply to ABR performance
   benchmarking.  These metrics will not be redefined in this document.
   For the sake of clarity and continuity, this RFC adopts the template
   for definitions set out in <a href="rfc1242.html#section-2">Section 2 of RFC 1242</a>.

II. Definitions

   The definitions presented in this section have been divided into two
   groups.  The first group is formal definitions, which are required in
   the definitions of the performance metrics but are not themselves
   strictly metrics.  These definitions are subsumed from other work
   done in other working groups both inside and outside the IETF.  They
   are provided as a courtesy to the reader.

   Discussion: A brief discussion of the term, its application and any
   restrictions on measurement procedures.

   Specification: The working group and document in which the terms are
   specified and are listed in the references section.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20Related%20Definitions."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>. Related Definitions.</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.1.%20Allowed%20Cell%20Rate%20%28ACR%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2.1" name="section-1.2.1">1.2.1</a>. Allowed Cell Rate (ACR)</span>

   Definition: An ABR service parameter, ACR is the current rate
   (cells/second) at which a source is allowed to send.

   Discussion: For ABR traffic, ACR constitutes the actual data
   throughput for a particular VC.  The time change of this value
   effects TCP round trip time calculations, which in turn effects TCP
   throughput.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.2.%20ACR%20Decrease%20Time%20Factor%20%28ADTF%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2.2" name="section-1.2.2">1.2.2</a>. ACR Decrease Time Factor (ADTF)</span>

   Definition: This is the time permitted between sending RM-cells
   before the rate is decreased to ICR (Initial Cell Rate). The time
   units are .01 to 10.23 seconds with a granularity of 10 ms.

   Discussion: For ABR traffic, ADTF constitutes the time rate of the
   ACR.  This value effects TCP round trip time calculations, which in
   turn effects TCP throughput.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.3.%20Additive%20Increase%20Rate%20%28AIR%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2.3" name="section-1.2.3">1.2.3</a>. Additive Increase Rate (AIR)</span>

   Definition: An ABR service parameter, AIR controls the rate at which
   the cell transmission rate increases.  It is signaled as AIRF, where

       AIRF = AIR*Nrm/PCR.

   Discussion: For ABR traffic, AIR effects the time rate of change of
   the ACR.  This value effects TCP round trip time calculations, which
   in turn effects TCP throughput.

   Definition: Refer to AIR.

   Definition: ABR is an ATM layer service category for which the
   limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network
   may change subsequent to connection establishment.  A flow control
   mechanism is specified which supports several types of feedback to
   control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer
   characteristics.

   Discussion: It is expected that an end-system that adapts its traffic
   in accordance with the feedback will experience a low cell loss ratio
   and obtain a fair share of the available bandwidth according to a
   network specific allocation policy.  Cell delay variation is not
   controlled in this service, although admitted cells are not delayed
   unnecessarily.

   Specification: AF-TM4.1

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.6.%20Available%20Bit%20Rate%20%28ABR%29%20Compliance%20%28Conformance%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2.6" name="section-1.2.6">1.2.6</a>. Available Bit Rate (ABR) Compliance (Conformance)</span>

   Definition: ABR connection conformance refers to the behavior
   specified for ABR destination and switches, but allows for delays
   between the source and the UNI [UNI3.1, UNI4.0], which may perturb
   the traffic flow.

   Discussion: The cells on an ABR connection applies to CLP=0 cells,
   which are tested upon arrival.  At the arrival point, each cell is
   identified as conforming or non-conforming.  The minimal conformance
   definition for ABR is GCRA((1/PCR),t1), where PCR is defined for
   CLP=0 flow.

   Specification: AF-TM4.1

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.7.%20BN"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2.7" name="section-1.2.7">1.2.7</a>. BN</span>

   Definition: The BN bit in the RM-cell indicated whether the RM-cell
   is a BECN cell or not.

   Discussion: If BN=0, the RM cells were generated by the source.  If

   occurring in the RM-cell header will cause RM-cell loss at the ATM
   layer. Note further that multiple errors in a payload will only be
   counted as one cell payload error.

     RM-CER = RM-Cells with payload errors / Total RM-Cells Transmitted.

   Discussion: The measurement is taken over a time interval and is
   desirable to be measured on an in-service circuit. RM-CER effects the
   time required to notify the source of a change in the condition of
   the network. This in turn effects TCP round trip time calculations.
   Large values of RM-CER will adversely effect TCP throughput and cause
   SAR timeout.

   Measurement Units: dimensionless.

   Definition: The ratio of lost RM-cells in a transmission in relation
   to the total RM-cells sent in a transmission associated with a given
   traffic load, orientation and distribution, as well as an integration
   period.

      RM-CLR = Lost RM-Cells / Total RM-Cells Transmitted.

   Discussion: The objective is to minimize RM-CLR.  It is expressed as
   an order of magnitude, having a range of 10^-1 to 10^-15 and
   unspecified.

   RM-CLR effects the time required to notify the source of a change in
   the condition of the network.  This in turn effects TCP round trip
   time calculations.  Large values of RM-CLR will adversely effect TCP
   throughput and cause SAR timeout.

   Measurement Units: dimensionless.

   Definition: The ratio of RM-cells received at an endpoint that were
   not originally transmitted by the source end in relation to the total
   number of RM-cells properly transmitted associated with a given
   traffic load, orientation and distribution, as well as an integration
   period.

      RM-CMR = Misinserted RM-Cells / Total RM-Cells Transmitted.

   Definition: The ratio of RM-cells received at an endpoint which
   contain an invalid CRC in relation to the total number of RM-cells
   properly transmitted associated with a given traffic load,
   orientation and distribution, as well as an integration period.

   Discussion: RM-CRC errors cause ATM RM-cells to be lost.

   RM-CRC effects the time required to notify the source of a change in
   the condition of the network.  This in turn effects TCP round trip
   time calculations.  Large values of RM-CRC will adversely effect TCP
   throughput and cause SAR timeout.

   Definition: The elapsed time between a RM-cell exit event at the
   measurement point 1 (e.g., at the source UNI) and the corresponding
   RM-cell entry event at a measurement point 2 (e.g., the destination
   UNI) for a particular connection.

   Discussion: The RM-cell transfer delay between two measurement points
   is the sum of the total inter-ATM node transmission delay and the
   total ATM node processing delay.  This number is a constant and
   should not adversely effect performance.

   Measurement units: seconds

   Definition: The ratio of severely errored cell blocks in a
   transmission in relation to the total cell blocks sent in a
   transmission associated with a given traffic load, orientation and
   distribution, as well as an integration period.

      SECBR = Severely Errored Cell Blocks/Total Transmitted Cell Blocks

   Discussion: SECBR may cause the SUT to drop cells that may contain a
   portion of an IP datagram.  This may cause IP and TCP packet loss.
