Abstract

   Recent proposals have extended the scope of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) to encompass point-to-
   multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.

   The requirement for a simple and efficient mechanism that can be used
   to detect data-plane failures in point-to-point (P2P) MPLS LSPs has
   been recognized and has led to the development of techniques for
   fault detection and isolation commonly referred to as "LSP ping".

   The scope of this document is fault detection and isolation for P2MP
   MPLS LSPs.  This documents does not replace any of the mechanisms of
   LSP ping, but clarifies their applicability to MPLS P2MP LSPs, and
   extends the techniques and mechanisms of LSP ping to the MPLS P2MP
   environment.

   Simple and efficient mechanisms that can be used to detect data-plane
   failures in point-to-point (P2P) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   Label Switched Paths (LSP) are described in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>].  The
   techniques involve information carried in MPLS "echo request" and
   "echo reply" messages, and mechanisms for transporting them.  The
   echo request and reply messages provide sufficient information to
   check correct operation of the data plane, as well as a mechanism to
   verify the data plane against the control plane, and thereby localize
   faults.  The use of reliable channels for echo reply messages as
   described in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] enables more robust fault isolation.  This
   collection of mechanisms is commonly referred to as "LSP ping".

   The requirements for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS traffic
   engineered (TE) LSPs are stated in [<a href="rfc4461.html" title='"Signaling Requirements for Point-to- Multipoint Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4461</a>].  [<a href="rfc4875.html" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to- Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>] specifies a
   signaling solution for establishing P2MP MPLS TE LSPs.

   The requirements for P2MP extensions to the Label Distribution
   Protocol (LDP) are stated in [<a href="rfc6348.html" title='"Requirements for Point-to-Multipoint Extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol"'>RFC6348</a>].  [<a href="rfc6388.html" title='"Label Distribution Protocol Extensions for Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6388</a>] specifies
   extensions to LDP for P2MP MPLS.

   P2MP MPLS LSPs are at least as vulnerable to data-plane faults or to
   discrepancies between the control and data planes as their P2P
   counterparts.  Therefore, mechanisms are needed to detect such data
   plane faults in P2MP MPLS LSPs as described in [<a href="rfc4687.html" title='"Operations and Management (OAM) Requirements for Point- to-Multipoint MPLS Networks"'>RFC4687</a>].

   This document extends the techniques described in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] such that
   they may be applied to P2MP MPLS LSPs.  This document stresses the
   reuse of existing LSP ping mechanisms used for P2P LSPs, and applies
   them to P2MP MPLS LSPs in order to simplify implementation and
   network operation.

   An important consideration for designing LSP ping for P2MP MPLS LSPs
   is that every attempt is made to use or extend existing mechanisms
   rather than invent new mechanisms.

   As for P2P LSPs, a critical requirement is that the echo request
   messages follow the same data path that normal MPLS packets traverse.
   However, as can be seen, this notion needs to be extended for P2MP
   MPLS LSPs, as in this case an MPLS packet is replicated so that it
   arrives at each egress (or leaf) of the P2MP tree.

   MPLS echo requests are meant primarily to validate the data plane,
   and they can then be used to validate data-plane state against the
   control plane.  They may also be used to bootstrap other Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) procedures such as [<a href="rfc5884.html" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC5884</a>].
   As pointed out in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>], mechanisms to check the liveness,
   function, and consistency of the control plane are valuable, but such
   mechanisms are not a feature of LSP ping and are not covered in this
   document.

   As is described in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>], to avoid potential denial-of-service
   attacks, it is RECOMMENDED to regulate the LSP ping traffic passed to
   the control plane.  A rate limiter should be applied to the incoming
   LSP ping traffic.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Basic%20Motivations%20for%20LSP%20Ping"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Basic Motivations for LSP Ping</span>

   The motivations listed in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] are reproduced here for
   completeness.

      When an LSP fails to deliver user traffic, the failure cannot
      always be detected by the MPLS control plane.  There is a need to
      provide a tool that enables users to detect such traffic "black
      holes" or misrouting within a reasonable period of time.  A
      mechanism to isolate faults is also required.

      [<a id="ref-RFC4379" name="ref-RFC4379">RFC4379</a>] describes a mechanism that accomplishes these goals.
      This mechanism is modeled after the ping/traceroute paradigm: ping
      (ICMP echo request [<a href="rfc792.html" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol"'>RFC792</a>]) is used for connectivity checks, and
      traceroute is used for hop-by-hop fault localization as well as
      path tracing.  [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] specifies a "ping mode" and a
      "traceroute" mode for testing MPLS LSPs.

      The basic idea as expressed in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] is to test that the
      packets that belong to a particular Forwarding Equivalence Class
      (FEC) actually end their MPLS path on an LSR that is an egress for
      that FEC.  [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] achieves this test by sending a packet
      (called an "MPLS echo request") along the same data path as other
      packets belonging to this FEC.  An MPLS echo request also carries
      information about the FEC whose MPLS path is being verified.  This
      echo request is forwarded just like any other packet belonging to
      that FEC.  In "ping" mode (basic connectivity check), the packet
      should reach the end of the path, at which point it is sent to the
      control plane of the egress LSR, which then verifies that it is
      indeed an egress for the FEC.  In "traceroute" mode (fault
      isolation), the packet is sent to the control plane of each
      transit LSR, which performs various checks that it is indeed a
      transit LSR for this path; this LSR also returns further
      information that helps to check the control plane against the data
      plane, i.e., that forwarding matches what the routing protocols
      determined as the path.

      One way these tools can be used is to periodically ping a FEC to
      ensure connectivity.  If the ping fails, one can then initiate a
      traceroute to determine where the fault lies.  One can also

      periodically traceroute FECs to verify that forwarding matches the
      control plane; however, this places a greater burden on transit
      LSRs and should be used with caution.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Motivations%20for%20LSP%20Ping%20for%20P2MP%20LSPs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Motivations for LSP Ping for P2MP LSPs</span>

   As stated in [<a href="rfc4687.html" title='"Operations and Management (OAM) Requirements for Point- to-Multipoint MPLS Networks"'>RFC4687</a>], MPLS has been extended to encompass P2MP
   LSPs.  As with P2P MPLS LSPs, the requirement to detect, handle, and
   diagnose control- and data-plane defects is critical.  For operators
   deploying services based on P2MP MPLS LSPs, the detection and
   specification of how to handle those defects is important because
   such defects may affect the fundamentals of an MPLS network, but also
   because they may impact service-level-specification commitments for
   customers of their network.

   P2MP LDP [<a href="rfc6388.html" title='"Label Distribution Protocol Extensions for Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6388</a>] uses LDP to establish multicast LSPs.  These LSPs
   distribute data from a single source to one or more destinations
   across the network according to the next hops indicated by the
   routing protocols.  Each LSP is identified by an MPLS multicast FEC.

   P2MP MPLS TE LSPs [<a href="rfc4875.html" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to- Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>] may be viewed as MPLS tunnels with a
   single ingress and multiple egresses.  The tunnels, built on P2MP
   LSPs, are explicitly routed through the network.  There is no concept
   or applicability of a FEC in the context of a P2MP MPLS TE LSP.

   MPLS packets inserted at the ingress of a P2MP LSP are delivered
   equally (barring faults) to all egresses.  In consequence, the basic
   idea of LSP ping for P2MP MPLS LSPs may be expressed as an intention
   to test that packets that enter (at the ingress) a particular P2MP
   LSP actually end their MPLS path on the LSRs that are the (intended)
   egresses for that LSP.  The idea may be extended to check selectively
   that such packets reach specific egresses.

   The technique in this document makes this test by sending an LSP ping
   echo request message along the same data path as the MPLS packets.
   An echo request also carries the identification of the P2MP MPLS LSP
   (multicast LSP or P2MP TE LSP) that it is testing.  The echo request
   is forwarded just as any other packet using that LSP, and so is
   replicated at branch points of the LSP and should be delivered to all
   egresses.

   In "ping" mode (basic connectivity check), the echo request should
   reach the end of the path, at which point it is sent to the control
   plane of the egress LSRs, which verify that they are indeed an egress
   (leaf) of the P2MP LSP.  An echo reply message is sent by an egress
   to the ingress to confirm the successful receipt (or announce the
   erroneous arrival) of the echo request.




<span class="grey">Saxena, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6425.html">RFC 6425</a>            P2MP MPLS Extensions to LSP PING       November 2011</span>


   In "traceroute" mode (fault isolation), the echo request is sent to
   the control plane at each transit LSR, and the control plane checks
   that it is indeed a transit LSR for this P2MP MPLS LSP.  The transit
   LSR returns information about the outgoing paths.  This information
   can be used by ingress LSRs to build topology or by downstream LSRs
   to do extra label verification.

   P2MP MPLS LSPs may have many egresses, and it is not necessarily the
   intention of the initiator of the ping or traceroute operation to
   collect information about the connectivity or path to all egresses.
   Indeed, in the event of pinging all egresses of a large P2MP MPLS
   LSP, it might be expected that a large number of echo replies would
   arrive at the ingress independently but at approximately the same
   time.  Under some circumstances this might cause congestion at or
   around the ingress LSR.  The procedures described in this document
   provide two mechanisms to control echo replies.

   The first procedure allows the responders to randomly delay (or
   jitter) their replies so that the chances of swamping the ingress are
   reduced.  The second procedure allows the initiator to limit the
   scope of an LSP ping echo request (ping or traceroute mode) to one
   specific intended egress.

   LSP ping can be used to periodically ping a P2MP MPLS LSP to ensure
   connectivity to any or all of the egresses.  If the ping fails, the
   operator or an automated process can then initiate a traceroute to
   determine where the fault is located within the network.  A
   traceroute may also be used periodically to verify that data-plane
   forwarding matches the control-plane state; however, this places an
   increased burden on transit LSRs and should be used infrequently and
   with caution.

   The basic structure of the LSP ping packet remains the same as
   described in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>].  Some new TLVs and sub-TLVs are required to
   support the new functionality.  They are described in the following
   sections.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4379" name="ref-RFC4379">RFC4379</a>] defines how an MPLS TE LSP under test may be identified in
   an echo request.  A Target FEC Stack TLV is used to carry either an
   RSVP IPv4 Session or an RSVP IPv6 Session sub-TLV.

   In order to identify the P2MP MPLS TE LSP under test, the echo
   request message MUST carry a Target FEC Stack TLV, and this MUST
   carry exactly one of two new sub-TLVs: either an RSVP P2MP IPv4
   Session sub-TLV or an RSVP P2MP IPv6 Session sub-TLV.  These sub-TLVs
   carry fields from the RSVP-TE P2MP SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE
   objects [<a href="rfc4875.html" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to- Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>] and so provide sufficient information to uniquely
   identify the LSP.

   The new sub-TLVs are assigned Sub-Type identifiers as follows, and
   are described in the following sections.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4379" name="ref-RFC4379">RFC4379</a>] defines how a P2P LDP LSP under test may be identified in
   an echo request.  A Target FEC Stack TLV is used to carry one or more
   sub-TLVs (for example, an IPv4 Prefix FEC sub-TLV) that identify the
   LSP.

   In order to identify a multicast LDP LSP under test, the echo request
   message MUST carry a Target FEC Stack TLV, and this MUST carry
   exactly one of two new sub-TLVs: either a Multicast P2MP LDP FEC
   Stack sub-TLV or a Multicast MP2MP LDP FEC Stack sub-TLV.  These sub-
   TLVs use fields from the multicast LDP messages [<a href="rfc6388.html" title='"Label Distribution Protocol Extensions for Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6388</a>] and so
   provide sufficient information to uniquely identify the LSP.

   The new sub-TLVs are assigned sub-type identifiers as follows and are
   described in the following section.

      Two-octet quantity containing a value from ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS
      in [<a href="#ref-IANA-AF">IANA-AF</a>] that encodes the address family for the Root LSR
      Address.

   Address Length

      Length of the Root LSR Address in octets.

   Root LSR Address

      Address of the LSR at the root of the P2MP LSP encoded according
      to the Address Family field.

   Opaque Length

      The length of the opaque value, in octets.  Depending on the
      length of the Root LSR Address, this field may not be aligned to a
      word boundary.

   The mechanisms defined in this document can be extended to include
   Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Multicast LSPs.  In an MP2MP LSP
   tree, any leaf node can be treated like a head node of a P2MP tree.
   In other words, for MPLS OAM purposes, the MP2MP tree can be treated
   like a collection of P2MP trees, with each MP2MP leaf node acting
   like a P2MP head-end node.  When a leaf node is acting like a P2MP
   head-end node, the remaining leaf nodes act like egress or bud nodes.

      Sub-TLVs:

         Zero, one, or more sub-TLVs as defined below.

         If no sub-TLVs are present, the TLV MUST be processed as if it
         were absent.  If more than one sub-TLV is present, the first
         TLV MUST be processed as described in this document, and
         subsequent sub-TLVs SHOULD be ignored.  Interpretation of
         additional sub-TLVs may be defined in future documents.

   The P2MP Responder Identifier TLV only has meaning on an echo request
   message.  If present on an echo reply message, it MUST be ignored.

   Four sub-TLVs are defined for inclusion in the P2MP Responder
   Identifier TLV carried on the echo request message.  These are:

   Sub-Type #   Length   Value Field

           4       16    IPv6 Node Address P2MP Responder

   The content of these sub-TLVs are defined in the following sections.
   Also defined is the intended behavior of the responding node upon
   receiving any of these sub-TLVs.

   A node that receives an echo request with this sub-TLV present MUST
   respond if the node lies on the path to the address in the sub-TLV
   and MUST NOT respond if it does not lie on the path to the address in
   the sub-TLV.  For this to be possible, the address in the sub-TLV
   must be known to the nodes that lie upstream in the LSP.  This can be
   the case if RSVP-TE is used to signal the P2MP LSP, in which case
   this address will be the address used in the Destination Address

   field of the S2L_SUB_LSP object, when corresponding egress or bud
   node is signaled.  Thus, the IPv4 or IPv6 Egress Address P2MP
   Responder sub-TLV MAY be used in an echo request carrying RSVP P2MP
   Session sub-TLV.

   However, in Multicast LDP, there is no way for upstream LSRs to know
   the identity of the downstream leaf nodes.  Hence, these TLVs cannot
   be used to perform traceroute to a single node when Multicast LDP FEC
   is used, and the IPv4 or IPv6 Egress Address P2MP Responder sub-TLV
   SHOULD NOT be used with an echo request carrying a Multicast LDP FEC
   Stack sub-TLV.  If a node receives these TLVs in an echo request
   carrying Multicast LDP, then it will not respond since it is unaware
   of whether it lies on the path to the address in the sub-TLV.

         This field specifies the upper bound of the jitter period that
         should be applied by a responding node to determine how long to
         wait before sending an echo reply.  A responding node MUST wait
         a random amount of time between zero milliseconds and the value
         specified in this field.

         Jitter time is specified in milliseconds.

   The Echo Jitter TLV only has meaning on an echo request message.  If
   present on an echo reply message, it MUST be ignored.

   The T (Respond Only If TTL Expired) flag MUST be set only in the echo
   request packet by the sender.  This flag MUST NOT be set in the echo
   reply packet.  If this flag is set in an echo reply packet, then it
   MUST be ignored.

   If the T flag is set to 0, then the receiving node MUST process the
   incoming echo request.

   If the T flag is set to 1 and the TTL of the incoming MPLS label is
   equal to 1, then the receiving node MUST process the incoming echo
   request.

   If the T flag is set to 1 and the TTL of the incoming MPLS label is
   more than 1, then the receiving node MUST drop the incoming echo
   request and MUST NOT send any echo reply to the sender.

   If the T flag is set to 1 and there are no incoming MPLS labels in
   the echo request packet, then a bud node with PHP configured MAY
   choose to not respond to this echo request.  All other nodes MUST
   ignore this bit and respond as per regular processing.

   The Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV is described in [<a href="rfc6424.html" title='"Mechanism for Performing LSP-Ping over MPLS Tunnels"'>RFC6424</a>].  A
   transit, branch or bud node can use the Downstream Detailed Mapping
   TLV to return multiple Return Codes for different downstream paths.
   This functionality can not be achieved via the Downstream Mapping
   TLV.  As per <a href="rfc6424.html#section-3.4">Section 3.4 of [RFC6424]</a>, the Downstream Mapping TLV as
   described in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] is being deprecated.

   Therefore, for P2MP, a node MUST support the Downstream Detailed
   Mapping TLV.  The Downstream Mapping TLV [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] is not appropriate
   for P2MP traceroute functionality and MUST NOT be included in an Echo
   Request message.  When responding to an RSVP IPv4/IPv6 P2MP Session
   FEC type or a Multicast P2MP/MP2MP LDP FEC type, a node MUST ignore
   any Downstream Mapping TLV it receives in the echo request and MUST
   continue processing as if the Downstream Mapping TLV is not present.

   The details of the Return Codes to be used in the Downstream Detailed
   Mapping TLV are provided in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   This section describes how LSP ping is applied to P2MP MPLS LSPs.  As
   mentioned previously, an important design consideration has been to
   extend the existing LSP ping mechanism in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] rather than
   invent new mechanisms.

   As specified in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>], MPLS LSPs can be tested via a "ping" mode
   or a "traceroute" mode.  The ping mode is also known as "connectivity
   verification" and traceroute mode is also known as "fault isolation".
   Further details can be obtained from [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>].

   This section specifies processing of echo requests for both ping and
   traceroute mode at various nodes (ingress, transit, etc.) of the P2MP
   LSP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Initiating%20LSR%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Initiating LSR Operations</span>

   The LSR initiating the echo request will follow the procedures in
   [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>].  The echo request will contain a Target FEC Stack TLV.  To
   identify the P2MP LSP under test, this TLV will contain one of the
   new sub-TLVs defined in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.  Additionally, there may be
   other optional TLVs present.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.1.%20%20Limiting%20Responses%20to%20Echo%20Requests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1" name="section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Limiting Responses to Echo Requests</span>

   As described in <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>, it may be desirable to restrict the
   operation of P2MP ping or traceroute to a single egress.  Since echo
   requests are forwarded through the data plane without interception by
   the control plane, there is no facility to limit the propagation of
   echo requests, and they will automatically be forwarded to all
   reachable egresses.

   However, a single egress may be identified by the inclusion of a P2MP
   Responder Identifier TLV.  The details of this TLV and its sub-TLVs
   are in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.  There are two main types of sub-TLVs in the P2MP
   Responder Identifier TLV: Node Address sub-TLV and Egress Address
   sub-TLV.

   These sub-TLVs limit the replies either to the specified LSR only or
   to any LSR on the path to the specified LSR.  The former capability
   is generally useful for ping mode, while the latter is more suited to
   traceroute mode.  An initiating LSR may indicate that it wishes all
   egresses to respond to an echo request by omitting the P2MP Responder
   Identifier TLV.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.2.%20%20Jittered%20Responses%20to%20Echo%20Requests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.2" name="section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  Jittered Responses to Echo Requests</span>

   The initiating LSR MAY request that the responding LSRs introduce a
   random delay (or jitter) before sending the reply.  The randomness of
   the delay allows the replies from multiple egresses to be spread over
   a time period.  Thus, this technique is particularly relevant when
   the entire P2MP LSP is being pinged or traced since it helps prevent
   the initiating (or nearby) LSRs from being swamped by replies, or
   from discarding replies due to rate limits that have been applied.



<span class="grey">Saxena, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 16]</span></pre>

   It is desirable for the initiating LSR to be able to control the
   bounds of the jitter.  If the tree size is small, only a small amount
   of jitter is required, but if the tree is large, greater jitter is
   needed.

   The initiating LSR can supply the desired value of the jitter in the
   Echo Jitter TLV as defined in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.  If this TLV is present,
   the responding LSR MUST delay sending a reply for a random amount of
   time between zero milliseconds and the value indicated in the TLV.
   If the TLV is absent, the responding egress SHOULD NOT introduce any
   additional delay in responding to the echo request, but MAY delay
   according to local policy.

   LSP ping MUST NOT be used to attempt to measure the round-trip time
   for data delivery.  This is because the P2MP LSPs are unidirectional,
   and the echo reply is often sent back through the control plane.  The
   timestamp fields in the echo request and echo reply packets MAY be
   used to deduce some information about delivery times, for example the
   variance in delivery times.

   The use of echo jittering does not change the processes for gaining
   information, but note that the responding node MUST set the value in
   the Timestamp Received fields before applying any delay.

   Echo reply jittering SHOULD be used for P2MP LSPs, although it MAY be
   omitted for simple P2MP LSPs or when the Node Address P2MP Responder
   sub-TLVs are used.  If the Echo Jitter TLV is present in an echo
   request for any other type of LSPs, the responding egress MAY apply
   the jitter behavior as described here.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Responding%20LSR%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Responding LSR Operations</span>

   Usually the echo request packet will reach the egress and bud nodes.
   In case of TTL Expiry, i.e., traceroute mode, the echo request packet
   may stop at branch or transit nodes.  In both scenarios, the echo
   request will be passed on to the control plane for reply processing.

   The operations at the receiving node are an extension to the existing
   processing as specified in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>].  As described in that document,
   a responding LSR SHOULD rate-limit the receipt of echo request
   messages.  After rate-limiting, the responding LSR must verify the
   general sanity of the packet.  If the packet is malformed or certain
   TLVs are not understood, the [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] procedures must be followed
   for echo reply.  Similarly, the Reply Mode field determines if the
   reply is required or not (and the mechanism to send it back).

   For P2MP LSP ping and traceroute, i.e., if the echo request is
   carrying an RSVP P2MP FEC or a Multicast LDP FEC, the responding LSR
   MUST determine whether it is part of the P2MP LSP in question by
   checking with the control plane.

      -  If the node is not part of the P2MP LSP, it MUST respond
         according to [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>] processing rules.

      -  If the node is part of the P2MP LSP, the node must check
         whether or not the echo request is directed to it.

         -  If a P2MP Responder Identifier TLV is present, then the node
            must follow the procedures defined in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> to
            determine whether or not it should respond to the request.
            The presence of a P2MP Responder Identifier TLV or a
            Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV might affect the Return
            Code.  This is discussed in more detail later.

         -  If the P2MP Responder Identifier TLV is not present (or, in
            the error case, is present, but does not contain any sub-
            TLVs), then the node MUST respond according to [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>]
            processing rules.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.1.%20%20Echo%20Reply%20Reporting"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1" name="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Echo Reply Reporting</span>

   Echo reply messages carry Return Codes and Subcodes to indicate the
   result of the LSP ping (when the ping mode is being used) as
   described in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>].

   When the responding node reports that it is an egress, it is clear
   that the echo reply applies only to that reporting node.  Similarly,
   when a node reports that it does not form part of the LSP described
   by the FEC, then it is clear that the echo reply applies only to that
   reporting node.  However, an echo reply message that reports an error
   from a transit node may apply to multiple egress nodes (i.e., leaves)
   downstream of the reporting node.  In the case of the ping mode of
   operation, it is not possible to correlate the reporting node to the
   affected egresses unless the topology of the P2MP tree is already
   known, and it may be necessary to use the traceroute mode of
   operation to further diagnose the LSP.

   Note that a transit node may discover an error, but it may also
   determine that while it does lie on the path of the LSP under test,
   it does not lie on the path to the specific egress being tested.  In
   this case, the node SHOULD NOT generate an echo reply unless there is
   a specific error condition that needs to be communicated.

   The following sections describe the expected values of Return Codes
   for various nodes in a P2MP LSP.  It is assumed that the sanity and
   other checks have been performed and an echo reply is being sent
   back.  As mentioned in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>, the Return Code might change
   based on the presence of a Responder Identifier TLV or Downstream
   Detailed Mapping TLV.

   The presence of a Responder Identifier TLV does not influence the
   choice of the Return Code.  For a success response, the Return Code
   MAY be set to value 8 ('Label switched at stack-depth &lt;RSC&gt;').  The
   notation &lt;RSC&gt; refers to the Return Subcode as defined in <a href="rfc4379.html#section-3.1">Section</a>
   <a href="rfc4379.html#section-3.1">3.1. of [RFC4379]</a>.  For error conditions, use appropriate values
   defined in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>].

   The presence of a Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV will influence the
   choice of Return Code.  As per [<a href="rfc6424.html" title='"Mechanism for Performing LSP-Ping over MPLS Tunnels"'>RFC6424</a>], the Return Code in the echo
   reply header MAY be set to 'See DDM TLV for Return Code and Return
   Subcode' as defined in [<a href="rfc6424.html" title='"Mechanism for Performing LSP-Ping over MPLS Tunnels"'>RFC6424</a>].  The Return Code for each
   Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV will depend on the downstream path as
   described in [<a href="rfc6424.html" title='"Mechanism for Performing LSP-Ping over MPLS Tunnels"'>RFC6424</a>].

   There will be a Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV for each downstream
   path being reported in the echo reply.  Hence, for transit nodes,
   there will be only one such TLV, and for branch nodes, there will be
   more than one.  If there is an Egress Address Responder sub-TLV, then
   the branch node will include only one Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV
   corresponding to the downstream path required to reach the address
   specified in the Egress Address sub-TLV.

   The presence of a Responder Identifier TLV does not influence the
   choice of the Return Code.  For a success response, the Return Code
   MAY be set to value 3 ('Replying router is an egress for the FEC at
   stack-depth &lt;RSC&gt;').  For error conditions, use appropriate values
   defined in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>].

   The presence of the Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV does not
   influence the choice of Return Code.  Egress nodes do not put in any
   Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV in the echo reply [<a href="rfc6424.html" title='"Mechanism for Performing LSP-Ping over MPLS Tunnels"'>RFC6424</a>].

   The case of bud nodes is more complex than other types of nodes.  The
   node might behave as either an egress node or a transit node, or a
   combination of an egress and branch node.  This behavior is

   determined by the presence of any Responder Identifier TLV and the
   type of sub-TLV in it.  Similarly, the Downstream Detailed Mapping
   TLV can influence the Return Code values.

   To determine the behavior of the bud node, use the following rules.
   The intent of these rules is to figure out if the echo request is
   meant for all nodes, or just this node, or for another node reachable
   through this node or for a different section of the tree.  In the
   first case, the node will behave like a combination of egress and
   branch node; in the second case, the node will behave like pure
   egress node; in the third case, the node will behave like a transit
   node; and in the last case, no reply will be sent back.

   Node behavior rules:

      -  If the Responder Identifier TLV is not present, then the node
         will behave as a combination of egress and branch node.

      -  If the Responder Identifier TLV containing a Node Address sub-
         TLV is present, and:

         -  If the address specified in the sub-TLV matches to an
            address in the node, then the node will behave like a
            combination of egress and branch node.

         -  If the address specified in the sub-TLV does not match any
            address in the node, then no reply will be sent.

      -  If the Responder Identifier TLV containing an Egress Address
        sub-TLV is present, and:

         -  If the address specified in the sub-TLV matches to an
            address in the node, then the node will behave like an
            egress node only.

         -  If the node lies on the path to the address specified in the
            sub-TLV, then the node will behave like a transit node.

         -  If the node does not lie on the path to the address
            specified in the sub-TLV, then no reply will be sent.

   Once the node behavior has been determined, the possible values for
   Return Codes are as follows:

      -  If the node is behaving as an egress node only, then for a
         success response, the Return Code MAY be set to value 3
         ('Replying router is an egress for the FEC at stack-depth
         &lt;RSC&gt;').  For error conditions, use appropriate values defined

   As specified in [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>], the traceroute mode operates by sending a
   series of echo requests with sequentially increasing TTL values.  For
   regular P2P targets, this processing stops when a valid reply is
   received from the intended egress or when some errored return code is
   received.



<span class="grey">Saxena, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 21]</span></pre>

   For P2MP targets, there may not be an easy way to figure out the end
   of the traceroute processing, as there are multiple egress nodes.
   Receiving a valid reply from an egress will not signal the end of
   processing.

   For P2MP TE LSP, the initiating LSR has a priori knowledge about the
   number of egress nodes and their addresses.  Hence, it is possible to
   continue processing until a valid reply has been received from each
   end point, provided that the replies can be matched correctly to the
   egress nodes.

   However, for Multicast LDP LSP, the initiating LSR might not always
   know about all of the egress nodes.  Hence, there might not be a
   definitive way to estimate the end of processing for traceroute.

   Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that traceroute operations provide for a
   configurable upper limit on TTL values.  Hence, the user can choose
   the depth to which the tree will be probed.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.2.%20%20Multiple%20Responses%20from%20Bud%20and%20Egress%20Nodes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.2" name="section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a>.  Multiple Responses from Bud and Egress Nodes</span>

   The P2MP traceroute may continue even after it has received a valid
   reply from a bud or egress node, as there may be more nodes at deeper
   levels.  Hence, for subsequent TTL values, a bud or egress node that
   has previously replied would continue to get new echo requests.
   Since each echo request is handled independently from previous
   requests, these bud and egress nodes will keep on responding to the
   traceroute echo requests.  This can cause an extra processing burden
   for the initiating LSR and these bud or egress LSRs.

   To prevent a bud or egress node from sending multiple replies in the
   same traceroute operation, a new "Respond Only If TTL Expired" flag
   is being introduced.  This flag is described in <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

   It is RECOMMENDED that this flag be used for P2MP traceroute mode
   only.  By using this flag, extraneous replies from bud and egress
   nodes can be reduced.  If PHP is being used in the P2MP tree, then
   bud and egress nodes will not get any labels with the echo request
   packet.  Hence, this mechanism will not be effective for PHP
   scenarios.

   There are multiple reasons for which an ingress node may not receive
   a reply to its echo request.  For example, the transit node has
   failed or the transit node does not support LSP ping.

   When no reply to an echo request is received by the ingress, then (as
   per [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>]) the subsequent echo request with a larger TTL SHOULD
   be sent in order to trace further toward the egress, although the
   ingress MAY halt the procedure at this point.  The time that an
   ingress waits before sending the subsequent echo request is an
   implementation choice.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.4.%20%20Use%20of%20Downstream%20Detailed%20Mapping%20TLV%20in%20Echo%20Requests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.4" name="section-4.3.4">4.3.4</a>.  Use of Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV in Echo Requests</span>

   As described in <a href="rfc4379.html#section-4.6">Section 4.6 of [RFC4379]</a>, an initiating LSR, during
   traceroute, SHOULD copy the Downstream Mapping(s) into its next echo
   request(s).  However, for P2MP LSPs, the initiating LSR will receive
   multiple sets of Downstream Detailed Mapping TLVs from different
   nodes.  It is not practical to copy all of them into the next echo
   request.  Hence, this behavior is being modified for P2MP LSPs.  If
   the echo request is destined for more than one node, then the
   Downstream IP Address field of the Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV
   MUST be set to the ALLROUTERS multicast address, and the Address Type
   field MUST be set to either IPv4 Unnumbered or IPv6 Unnumbered
   depending on the Target FEC Stack TLV.

   If an Egress Address Responder sub-TLV is being used, then the
   traceroute is limited to only one egress.  Therefore this traceroute
   is effectively behaving like a P2P traceroute.  In this scenario, as
   per <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>, the echo replies from intermediate nodes will
   contain only one Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV corresponding to the
   downstream path required to reach the address specified in the Egress
   Address sub-TLV.  For this case, the echo request packet MAY reuse a
   received Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV.  This will allow interface
   validation to be performed as per [<a href="rfc4379.html" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>RFC4379</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.5.%20%20Cross-Over%20Node%20Processing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.5" name="section-4.3.5">4.3.5</a>.  Cross-Over Node Processing</span>

   A cross-over node will require slightly different processing for
   traceroute mode.  The following definition of cross-over is taken
   from [<a href="rfc4875.html" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to- Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>].

      The term "cross-over" refers to the case of an ingress or transit
      node that creates a branch of a P2MP LSP, a cross-over branch,
      that intersects the P2MP LSP at another node farther down the
      tree.  It is unlike re-merge in that, at the intersecting node,
      the cross-over branch has a different outgoing interface as well
      as a different incoming interface.

   During traceroute, a cross-over node will receive the echo requests
   via each of its input interfaces.  Therefore, the Downstream Detailed
   Mapping TLV in the echo reply MUST carry information only about the
   outgoing interface corresponding to the input interface.



<span class="grey">Saxena, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 23]</span></pre>

   If this restriction is applied, the cross-over node will not
   duplicate the outgoing interface information in each of the echo
   request it receives via the different input interfaces.  This will
   reflect the actual packet replication in the data plane.

   If a node for a P2MP LSP does not support MPLS LSP ping, then no
   reply will be sent, causing an incorrect result on the initiating
   LSR.  There is no protection for this situation, and operators may
   wish to ensure that all nodes for P2MP LSPs are all equally capable
   of supporting this function.

   If the non-compliant node is an egress, then the traceroute mode can
   be used to verify the LSP nearly all the way to the egress, leaving
   the final hop to be verified manually.

   If the non-compliant node is a branch or transit node, then it should
   not impact ping mode.  However the node will not respond during
   traceroute mode.

   The procedures in this document provide OAM functions for P2MP MPLS
   LSPs and may be used to enable bootstrapping of other OAM procedures.

   In order to be fully operational, several considerations apply.

      -  Scaling concerns dictate that only cautious use of LSP ping
         should be made.  In particular, sending an LSP ping to all
         egresses of a P2MP MPLS LSP could result in congestion at or
         near the ingress when the replies arrive.

         Further, incautious use of timers to generate LSP ping echo
         requests either in ping mode or especially in traceroute may
         lead to significant degradation of network performance.

      -  Management interfaces should allow an operator full control
         over the operation of LSP ping.  In particular, such interfaces
         should provide the ability to limit the scope of an LSP ping
         echo request for a P2MP MPLS LSP to a single egress.

         Such interfaces should also provide the ability to disable all
         active LSP ping operations, to provide a quick escape if the
         network becomes congested.

      -  A MIB module is required for the control and management of LSP
         ping operations, and to enable the reported information to be
