Abstract

   This document defines signature policies for electronic signatures. A
   signature policy is a set of rules for the creation and validation of
   an electronic signature, under which the validity of signature can be
   determined.  A given legal/contractual context may recognize a
   particular signature policy as meeting its requirements.

   A signature policy has a globally unique reference, which is bound to
   an electronic signature by the signer as part of the signature
   calculation.

   The signature policy needs to be available in human readable form so
   that it can be assessed to meet the requirements of the legal and
   contractual context in which it is being applied.

   To allow for the automatic processing of an electronic signature
   another part of the signature policy specifies the electronic rules
   for the creation and validation of the electronic signature in a
   computer processable form.  In the current document the format of the
   signature policy is defined using ASN.1.

   The contents of this document is based on the signature policy
   defined in ETSI TS 101 733 V.1.2.2 (2000-12) Copyright (C).

   used with electronic signatures for various types of transactions,
   including business transactions (e.g., purchase requisition,
   contract, and invoice applications).  Electronic signatures can be
   used for any transaction between an individual and a company, between
   two companies, between an individual and a governmental body, etc.
   This document is independent of any environment.  It can be applied
   to any environment e.g., smart cards, GSM SIM cards, special programs
   for electronic signatures etc.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
   as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Major%20Parties"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Major Parties</span>

   The document uses the following terms:

      *  the Signature Policy Issuer;
      *  the Signer;
      *  the Verifier;
      *  the Arbitrator;
      *  Trusted Service Providers (TSP);

   The Signature Policy Issuer (which is a Trusted Service Provider
   (TSP)) issues signatures policies that define the technical and
   procedural requirements for electronic signature creation, and
   validation/ verification, in order to meet a particular business
   need.

   The Signer is the entity that creates the electronic signature.  When
   the signer digitally signs over an signature policy identifier, it
   represents a commitment on behalf of the signing entity that the data
   being signed is signed under the rules defined by the signature
   policy.

   The Verifier is the entity that validates the electronic signature,
   it may be a single entity or multiple entities.  The verifier MUST
   validate the electronic signature under the rules defined by the
   electronic signature policy for the signature to be valid.

   An arbitrator, is an entity which arbitrates disputes between a
   signer and a verifier.  It acts as verifier when it verifies the
   electronic signature after it has been previously validated.

   The Trusted Service Providers (TSPs) are one or more entities that
   help to build trust relationships between the signer and verifier.
   Use of TSP specific services MAY be mandated by signature policy.
   TSP supporting services include: user certificates, cross-
   certificates, time-stamping tokens,CRLs, ARLs, OCSP responses.

   A Trusted Service Providers (TSPs) MAY be a Signature Policy Issuer,
   as Such, the TSP MUST define the technical and procedural
   requirements for electronic signature creation and validation, in
   order to meet a particular business need.

   The following other TSPs are used to support the functions defined in
   this document:

      *  Certification Authorities;
      *  Registration Authorities;
      *  Repository Authorities (e.g., a Directory);
      *  Time-Stamping Authorities;
      *  One-line Certificate Status Protocol responders;
      *  Attribute Authorities.

   Certification Authorities provide users with public key certificates.

   Registration Authorities allows the registration of entities before a
   CA generates certificates.

   Repository Authorities publish CRLs issued by CAs, , cross-
   certificates (i.e., CA certificates) issued by CAs, signature
   policies issued by Signature Policy Issuers and optionally public key
   certificates (i.e., leaf certificates) issued by CAs.

   Time-Stamping Authorities attest that some data was formed before a
   given trusted time.

   One-line Certificate Status Protocol responders (OSCP responders)
   provide information about the status (i.e., revoked, not revoked,
   unknown) of a particular certificate.

   Attributes Authorities provide users with attributes linked to public
   key certificates

   An Arbitrator is an entity that arbitrates disputes between a signer
   and a verifier.

   A signature policy specification includes general information about
   the policy, the validation policy rules and other signature policy
   information.

   This document mandates that:

      *  an electronic signature must be processed by the signer and
         verifier in accordance with the signature policy referenced by
         the signer;
      *  the signature policy referenced by the signer must be
         identifiable by an Object Identifier;
      *  there must exist a specification of the signature policy;
      *  for a given signature policy there must be one definitive form
         of the specification which has a unique binary encoding;
      *  a hash of the definitive specification, using an agreed
         algorithm, must be provided by the signer and checked by the
         verifier.

   This document defines but does not mandate the form of the signature
   policy specification.  The signature policy may be specified either:

      *  in a free form document for human interpretation; or
      *  in a structured form using an agreed syntax and encoding.

   This document defines an ASN.1 based syntax that may be used to
   define a structured signature policy.  Future versions of this
   document may include structured a signature policy specification
   using XML.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1%20%20Overall%20ASN.1%20Structure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>  Overall ASN.1 Structure</span>

   The overall structure of a signature policy defined using ASN.1 is
   given in this section.  Use of this ASN.1 structure is optional.

   This ASN.1 syntax is encoded using the Distinguished Encoding Rules
   (DER).

   In this structure the policy information is preceded by an identifier
   for the hashing algorithm used to protect the signature policy and
   followed by the hash value which must be re-calculated and checked
   whenever the signature policy is passed between the issuer and
   signer/verifier.

   The hash is calculated without the outer type and length fields.

   The fieldofApplication is a description of the expected application
   of this policy.

   The signature validation policy rules are fully processable to allow
   the validation of electronic signatures issued under that form of
   signature policy.  They are described in the rest of this section.

   The signPolExtensions is a generic way to extend the definition of
   any sub-component of a signature policy.

   The signature validation policy defines for the signer which data
   elements must be present in the electronic signature he provides and
   for the verifier which data elements must be present under that
   signature policy for an electronic signature to be potentially valid.

   The signature validation policy is described as follows:

   The SigningCertTrustCondition, TimestampTrustCondition and
   AttributeTrustCondition (defined in subsequent sub-sections) make use
   of two ASN1 structures which are defined below: CertificateTrustTrees
   and CertRevReq.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.6.1%20%20Certificate%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6.1" name="section-3.6.1">3.6.1</a>  Certificate Requirements</span>

   The certificateTrustTrees identifies a set of self signed
   certificates for the trust points used to start (or end) certificate
   path processing and the initial conditions for certificate path
   validation as defined <a href="rfc2459.html">RFC 2459</a> [7] <a href="#section-4">section 4</a>.  This ASN1 structure is
   used to define policy for validating the signing certificate, the
   TSA's certificate and attribute certificates.

CertificateTrustTrees ::=   SEQUENCE OF CertificateTrustPoint

CertificateTrustPoint ::= SEQUENCE {
        trustpoint                              Certificate,
                               -- self-signed certificate
        pathLenConstraint       [0] PathLenConstraint   OPTIONAL,

                                -- If not present "any policy"
        nameConstraints         [2] NameConstraints     OPTIONAL,
        policyConstraints       [3] PolicyConstraints   OPTIONAL }


   The trustPoint field gives the self signed certificate for the CA
   that is used as the trust point for the start of certificate path
   processing.

   The pathLenConstraint field gives the maximum number of CA
   certificates that may be in a certification path following the
   trustpoint.  A value of zero indicates that only the given trustpoint
   certificate and an end-entity certificate may be used.  If present,
   the pathLenConstraint field must be greater than or equal to zero.
   Where pathLenConstraint is not present, there is no limit to the
   allowed length of the certification path.

   PathLenConstraint    ::=   INTEGER (0..MAX)

   The acceptablePolicySet field identifies the initial set of
   certificate policies, any of which are acceptable under the signature
   policy.  AcceptablePolicySet ::= SEQUENCE OF CertPolicyId

   CertPolicyId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   The nameConstraints field indicates a name space within which all
   subject names in subsequent certificates in a certification path must
   be located.  Restrictions may apply to the subject distinguished name
   or subject alternative names.  Restrictions apply only when the
   specified name form is present.  If no name of the type is in the
   certificate, the certificate is acceptable.

   Restrictions are defined in terms of permitted or excluded name
   subtrees.  Any name matching a restriction in the excludedSubtrees
   field is invalid regardless of information appearing in the
   permittedSubtrees.

NameConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
          permittedSubtrees       [0]     GeneralSubtrees OPTIONAL,
          excludedSubtrees        [1]     GeneralSubtrees OPTIONAL }

     GeneralSubtrees ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralSubtree

     GeneralSubtree ::= SEQUENCE {
          base                    GeneralName,
          minimum         [0]     BaseDistance DEFAULT 0,
          maximum         [1]     BaseDistance OPTIONAL }

     BaseDistance ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)

   The policyConstraints extension constrains path processing in two
   ways. It can be used to prohibit policy mapping or require that each
   certificate in a path contain an acceptable policy identifier.

   The policyConstraints field, if present specifies requirement for
   explicit indication of the certificate policy and/or the constraints
   on policy mapping.

        requireExplicitPolicy           [0] SkipCerts OPTIONAL,
        inhibitPolicyMapping            [1] SkipCerts OPTIONAL }

SkipCerts ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)

   If the inhibitPolicyMapping field is present, the value indicates the
   number of additional certificates that may appear in the path
   (including the trustpoint's self certificate) before policy mapping
   is no longer permitted.  For example, a value of one indicates that
   policy mapping may be processed in certificates issued by the subject
   of this certificate, but not in additional certificates in the path.

   If the requireExplicitPolicy field is present, subsequent
   certificates must include an acceptable policy identifier.  The value
   of requireExplicitPolicy indicates the number of additional
   certificates that may appear in the path (including the trustpoint's
   self certificate) before an explicit policy is required.  An
   acceptable policy identifier is the identifier of a policy required
   by the user of the certification path or the identifier of a policy
   which has been declared equivalent through policy mapping.

   The RevocRequirements field specifies minimum requirements for
   revocation information, obtained through CRLs and/or OCSP responses,
   to be used in checking the revocation status of certificates.  This
   ASN1 structure is used to define policy for validating the signing
   certificate, the TSA's certificate and attribute certificates.

   An authority certificate is certificate issued to an authority (e.g.,
   either to a certification authority or to an attribute authority
   (AA)).

   A Time-Stamping Authority (TSA) is a trusted third party that creates
   time-stamp tokens in order to indicate that a datum existed at a
   particular point in time.  See [<a href="#ref-TSP" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)"'>TSP</a>].

   The TimeStampTrustCondition field identifies trust conditions for
   certificate path processing used to authenticate the timstamping
   authority and constraints on the name of the time-stamping authority.
   This applies to the time-stamp that must be present in every ES-T.

        deltaMinutes    INTEGER,
        deltaHours      INTEGER,
        deltaDays       INTEGER }

   If ttsCertificateTrustTrees is not present then the same rule as
   defined in certificateTrustCondition applies to certification of the
   time-stamping authorities public key.

   The tstrRevReq specifies minimum requirements for revocation
   information, obtained through CRLs and/or OCSP responses, to be used
   in checking the revocation status of the time-stamp that must be
   present in the ES-T.

   If ttsNameConstraints is not present then there are no additional
   naming constraints on the trusted time-stamping authority other than
   those implied by the ttsCertificateTrustTrees.

   The cautionPeriod field specifies a caution period after the signing
   time that it is mandated the verifier must wait to get high assurance
   of the validity of the signer's key and that any relevant revocation
   has been notified.  The revocation status information forming the ES
   with Complete validation data must not be collected and used to
   validate the electronic signature until after this caution period.

   If the attributeTrustCondition field is not present then any
   certified attributes may not considered to be valid under this
   validation policy.  The AttributeTrustCondition field is defined as
   follows:

AttributeTrustCondition ::= SEQUENCE {
      attributeMandated            BOOLEAN,

      attributeConstraints        [2] AttributeConstraints   OPTIONAL }

   If attributeMandated is true then an attribute, certified within the
   following constraints, must be present.  If false, then the signature
   is still valid if no attribute is specified.

   The howCertAttribute field specifies whether attributes uncertified
   attributes "claimed" by the signer, or certified attributes (i.e.,
   Attribute Certificates) or either using the signer attributes
   attribute defined in [<a href="#ref-ES-FORMATS" title='"Electronic Signature Formats for Long Term Electronic Signatures"'>ES-FORMATS</a>] <a href="#section-3.12.3">section 3.12.3</a>.

        certifiedAttribtes     (1),
        either                 (2) }

   The attrCertificateTrustTrees specifies certificate path conditions
   for any attribute certificate.  If not present the same rules apply
   as in certificateTrustCondition.

   The attrRevReq specifies minimum requirements for revocation
   information, obtained through CRLs and/or OCSP responses, to be used
   in checking the revocation status of Attribute Certificates, if any
   are present.

   If the attributeConstraints field is not present then there are no
   constraints on the attributes that may be validated under this
   policy. The attributeConstraints field is defined as follows:

Annex B (informative):

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.1%20%20Signature%20Policy%20and%20Signature%20Validation%20Policy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.1" name="appendix-B.1">B.1</a>  Signature Policy and Signature Validation Policy</span>

   The definition of electronic signature mentions: "a commitment has
   been explicitly endorsed under a "Signature Policy", at a given time,
   by a signer under an identifier, e.g., a name or a pseudonym, and
   optionally a role."

   Electronic signatures are commonly applied within the context of a
   legal or contractual framework.  This establishes the requirements on
   the electronic signatures and any special semantics (e.g., agreement,
   intent).  These requirements may be defined in very general abstract
   terms or in terms of detailed rules.  The specific semantics
   associated with an electronic signature implied by a legal or
   contractual framework are outside the scope of this document.

   If the signature policy is recognized, within the legal/contractual
   context, as providing commitment, then the signer explicitly agrees
   with terms and conditions which are implicitly or explicitly part of
   the signed data.

   When two independent parties want to evaluate an electronic
   signature, it is fundamental that they get the same result.  It is
   therefore important that the conditions agreed by the signer at the
   time of signing are indicated to the verifier and any arbitrator.  An
   aspect that enables this to be known by all parties is the signature
   policy. The technical implications of the signature policy on the
   electronic signature with all the validation data are called the
   "Signature Validation Policy".  The signature validation policy
   specifies the rules used to validate the signature.

   This document does not mandate the form and encoding of the
   specification of the signature policy.  However, for a given
   signature policy there must be one definitive form that has a unique
   binary encoded value.

   This document includes, as an option, a formal structure for
   signature validation policy based on the use of Abstract Syntax
   Notation 1 (ASN.1).

   Given the specification of the signature policy and its hash value an
   implementation of a verification process must obey the rules defined
   in the specification.

   This document places no restriction on how it should be implemented.
   Provide the implementation conforms to the conformance requirements
   as define in <a href="#section-5">section 5</a> implementation options include:

   A validation process that supports a specific signature policy as
   identified by the signature policy OID.  Such an implementation
   should conform to a human readable description provided all the
   processing rules of the signature policy are clearly defined.
   However, if additional policies need to be supported, then such an
   implementation would need to be customized for each additional
   policy.  This type of implementation may be simpler to implement
   initially, but can be difficult to enhance to support numerous
   additional signature policies.

   A validation process that is dynamically programmable and able to
   adapt its validation rules in accordance with a description of the
   signature policy provided in a computer-processable language.  This
   present document defines such a policy using an ASN.1 structure (see
   6.1).  This type of implementation could support multiple signature
   policies without being modified every time, provided all the
   validation rules specified as part of the signature policy are known
   by the implementation.  (i.e., only requires modification if there
   are additional rules specified).

   The precise content of a signature policy is not mandated by the
   current document.  However, a signature policy must be sufficiently
   definitive to avoid any ambiguity as to its implementation
   requirements.  It must be absolutely clear under which conditions an
   electronic signature should be accepted.  For this reason, it should
   contain the following information:

   *  General information about the signature policy which includes:
      -  a unique identifier of the policy;
      -  the name of the issuer of the policy;
      -  the date the policy was issued;
      -  the field of application of the policy.

   *  The signature verification policy which includes:
      -  the signing period,
      -  a list of recognized commitment types;
      -  rules for Use of Certification Authorities;
      -  rules for Use of Revocation Status Information;
      -  rules for Use of Roles;
      -  rules for use of Time-Stamping and Timing;
      -  signature verification data to be provided by the
         signer/collected by verifier;
      -  any constraints on signature algorithms and key lengths.
   *  Other signature policy rules required to meet the objectives of
      the signature.

   Variations of the validation policy rules may apply to different
   commitment types.

   When data is signed the signer indicates the signature policy
   applicable to that electronic signature by including an object
   identifier for the signature policy with the signature.  The signer
   and verifier must apply the rules specified by the identified policy.
   In addition to the identifier of the signature policy the signer must
   include the hash of the signature policy, so it can be verified that
   the policy selected by the signer is the identical to the one being
   used the verifier.

   A signature policy may be qualified by additional information.  This
   can includes:

      *  A URL where a copy of the Signature Policy may be obtained;
      *  A user notice that should be displayed when the signature is
         verified;

   If no signature policy is identified then the signature may be
   assumed to have been generated/verified without any policy
   constraints, and hence may be given no specific legal or contractual
   significance through the context of a signature policy.

   A "Signature Policy" will be identifiable by an OID (Object
   Identifier) and verifiable using a hash of the signature policy.

   General information should be recorded about the signature policy
   along with the definition of the rules which form the signature
   policy as described in subsequent subsections.  This should include:

      *  Policy Object Identifier: The "Signature Policy" will be
         identifiable by an OID (Object Identifier) whose last component
         (i.e., right most) is an integer that is specific to a
         particular version issued on the given date.
      *  Date of issue: When the "Signature Policy" was issued.
      *  Signature Policy Issuer name: An identifier for the body
         responsible for issuing the Signature Policy.  This may be used
         by the signer or verifying in deciding if a policy is to be
         trusted, in which case the signer/verifier must authenticate
         the origin of the signature policy as coming from the
         identified issuer.
      *  Signing period: The start time and date, optionally with an end
         time and date, for the period over which the signature policy
         may be used to generate electronic signatures.

      *  Field of application: This defines in general terms the general
         legal/contract/application contexts in which the signature
         policy is to be used and the specific purposes for which the
         electronic signature is to be applied.

   The signature validation policy may recognize one or more types of
   commitment as being supported by electronic signatures produced under
   the security policy.  If an electronic signature does not contain a
   recognized commitment type then the semantics of the electronic
   signature is dependent on the data being signed and the context in
   which it is being used.

   Only recognized commitment types are allowed in an electronic
   signature.

   The definition of a commitment type includes:

      *  the object identifier for the commitment;
      *  the contractual/legal/application context in which the
         signature may be used (e.g., submission of messages);
      *  a description of the support provided within the terms of the
         context (e.g., proof that the identified source submitted the
         message if the signature is created when message submission is
         initiated).

   The definition of a commitment type can be registered:

      *  as part of the validation policy;
      *  as part of the application/contract/legal environment;
      *  as part of generic register of definitions.

   The legal/contractual context will determine the rules applied to the
   signature, as defined by the signature policy and its recognized
   commitment types, make it fit for purpose intended.

   The certificate validation process of the verifier, and hence the
   certificates that may be used by the signer for a valid electronic
   signature, may be constrained by the combination of the trust point
   and certificate path constraints in the signature validation policy.

   The signature validation policy defines the certification authority
   trust points that are to be used for signature verification.  Several
   trust points may be specified under one signature policy.  Specific
   trust points may be specified for a particular type of commitment
   defined under the signature policy.  For a signature to be valid a
   certification path must exists between the Certification Authority
   that has granted the certificate selected by the signer (i.e., the
   used user-certificate) and one of the trust point of the "Signature
   Validation Policy".

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.5.2%20%20Certification%20Path"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.5.2" name="appendix-B.5.2">B.5.2</a>  Certification Path</span>

   There may be constraints on the use of certificates issued by one or
   more CA(s) in the certificate chain and trust points.  The two prime
   constraints are certificate policy constraints and naming
   constraints:

      *  Certificate policy constraints limit the certification chain
         between the user certificate and the certificate of the trusted
         point to a given set of certificate policies, or equivalents
         identified through certificate policy mapping.
      *  The naming constraints limit the forms of names that the CA is
         allowed to certify.

   Name constraints are particularly important when a "Signature policy"
   identifies more than one trust point.  In this case, a certificate of
   a particular trusted point may only be used to verify signatures from
   users with names permitted under the name constraint.

   Certificate Authorities may be organized in a tree structure, this
   tree structure may represent the trust relationship between various
   CA(s) and the users CA.  Alternatively, a mesh relationship may exist
   where a combination of tree and peer cross-certificates may be used.
   The requirement of the certificate path in this document is that it
   provides the trust relationship between all the CAs and the signers
   user certificate.  The starting point from a verification point of
   view, is the "trust point".  A trust point is usually a CA that
   publishes self-certified certificates, is the starting point from
   which the verifier verifies the certificate chain.  Naming
   constraints may apply from the trust point, in which case they apply
   throughout the set of certificates that make up the certificate path
   down to the signer's user certificate.

   Policy constraints can be easier to process but to be effective
   require the presence of a certificate policy identifier in the
   certificates used in a certification path.

   Certificate path processing, thus generally starts with one of the
   trust point from the signature policy and ends with the user
   certificate.  The certificate path processing procedures defined in
   <a href="rfc2459.html#section-6">RFC 2459 section 6</a> identifies the following initial parameters that
   are selected by the verifier in certificate path processing:

      *  acceptable certificate policies;
      *  naming constraints in terms of constrained and excluded naming
         subtree;
      *  requirements for explicit certificate policy indication and
         whether certificate policy mapping are allowed;
      *  restrictions on the certificate path length.

   The signature validation policy identifies constraints on these
   parameters.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.6%20%20Revocation%20Rules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.6" name="appendix-B.6">B.6</a>  Revocation Rules</span>

   The signature policy should defines rules specifying requirements for
   the use of certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and/or on-line
   certificate status check service to check the validity of a
   certificate. These rules specify the mandated minimum checks that
   must be carried out.

   It is expected that in many cases either check may be selected with
   CRLs checks being carried out for certificate status that are
   unavailable from OCSP servers.  The verifier may take into account
   information in the certificate in deciding how best to check the
   revocation status (e.g., a certificate extension field about
   authority information access or a CRL distribution point) provided
   that it does not conflict with the signature policy revocation rules.

   Roles can be supported as claimed roles or as certified roles using
   Attribute Certificates.

   When signature under a role is mandated by the signature policy, then
   either Attribute Certificates may be used or the signer may provide a
   claimed role attribute.  The acceptable attribute types or values may
   be dependent on the type of commitment.  For example, a user may have
   several roles that allow the user to sign data that imply commitments
   based on one or more of his roles.

   When a signature under a certified role is mandated by the signature
   policy, Attribute Authorities are used and need to be validated as
   part of the overall validation of the electronic signature.  The
   trust points for Attribute Authorities do not need to be the same as
   the trust points to evaluate a certificate from the CA of the signer.
   Thus the trust point for verifying roles need not be the same as
   trust point used to validate the certificate path of the user's key.

   Naming and certification policy constraints may apply to the AA in
   similar circumstance to when they apply to CA.  Constraints on the AA
   and CA need not be exactly the same.

   AA(s) may be used when a signer is creating a signature on behalf of
   an organization, they can be particularly useful when the signature
   represents an organizational role.  AA(s) may or may not be the same
   authority as CA(s).

   Thus, the Signature Policy identifies trust points that can be used
   for Attribute Authorities, either by reference to the same trust
   points as used for Certification Authorities, or by an independent
   list.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.7.3%20%20Certification%20Path%20for%20Certified%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.7.3" name="appendix-B.7.3">B.7.3</a>  Certification Path for Certified Attributes</span>

   Attribute Authorities may be organized in a tree structure in similar
   way to CA where the AAs are the leafs of such a tree.  Naming and
   other constraints may be required on attribute certificate paths in a
   similar manner to other electronic signature certificate paths.

   Thus, the Signature Policy identify constraints on the following
   parameters used as input to the certificate path processing:

      *  acceptable certificate policies, including requirements for
         explicit certificate policy indication and whether certificate
         policy mapping is allowed;
      *  naming constraints in terms of constrained and excluded naming
         subtrees;
      *  restrictions on the certificate path length.

   The following rules should be used when specifying, constraints on
   the certificate paths for time-stamping authorities, constraints on
   the time-stamping authority names and general timing constraints.

   Signature keys from time-stamping authorities will need to be
   supported by a certification path.  The certification path used for
   time-stamping authorities requires a trustpoint and possibly path
   constraints in the same way that the certificate path for the
   signer's key.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.8.2%20%20Time-Stamping%20Authority%20Names"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.8.2" name="appendix-B.8.2">B.8.2</a>  Time-Stamping Authority Names</span>

   Restrictions may need to be placed by the validation policy on the
   named entities that may act a time-stamping authorities.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.8.3%20%20Timing%20Constraints%20-%20Caution%20Period"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.8.3" name="appendix-B.8.3">B.8.3</a>  Timing Constraints - Caution Period</span>

   Before an electronic signature may really be valid, the verifier has
   to be sure that the holder of the private key was really the only one
   in possession of key at the time of signing.  However, there is an
   inevitable delay between a compromise or loss of key being noted, and
   a report of revocation being distributed.  To allow greater
   confidence in the validity of a signature, a "cautionary period" may
   be identified before a signature may be said to be valid with high
   confidence.  A verifier may revalidate a signature after this
   cautionary signature, or wait for this period before validating a
   signature.

   The validation policy may specify such a cautionary period.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.8.4%20%20Timing%20Constraints%20-%20Time-Stamp%20Delay"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.8.4" name="appendix-B.8.4">B.8.4</a>  Timing Constraints - Time-Stamp Delay</span>

   There will be some delay between the time that a signature is created
   and the time the signer's digital signature is time-stamped.
   However, the longer this elapsed period the greater the risk of the
   signature being invalidated due to compromise or deliberate
   revocation of its private signing key by the signer.  Thus the
   signature policy should specify a maximum acceptable delay between
   the signing time as claimed by the signer and the time included
   within the time-stamp.

   By specifying the requirements on the signer and verifier the
   responsibilities of the two parties can be clearly defined to
   establish all the necessary information.

   These verification data rules should include:

      *  requirements on the signer to provide given signed attributes;
      *  requirements on the verifier to obtain additional certificates,
         CRLs, results of on line certificate status checks and to use
         time-stamps (if no already provided by the signer).

   The signature validation policy may identify a set of signing
   algorithms (hashing, public key, combinations) and minimum key
   lengths that may be used:

      *  by the signer in creating the signature;
      *  in end entity public key Certificates;
      *  CA Certificates;
      *  attribute Certificates;
      *  by the time-stamping authority.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.11%20%20Other%20Signature%20Policy%20Rules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.11" name="appendix-B.11">B.11</a>  Other Signature Policy Rules</span>

   The signature policy may specify additional policy rules, for example
   rules that relate to the environment used by the signer.  These
   additional rules may be defined in computer processable and/or human
   readable form.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.12%20%20Signature%20Policy%20Protection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.12" name="appendix-B.12">B.12</a>  Signature Policy Protection</span>

   When signer or verifier obtains a copy of the Signature Policy from
   an issuer, the source should be authenticated (for example by using
   electronic signatures).  When the signer references a signature
   policy the Object Identifier (OID) of the policy, the hash value and
   the hash algorithm OID of that policy must be included in the
   Electronic Signature.

   It is a mandatory requirement of this present document that the
   signature policy value computes to one, and only one hash value using
   the specified hash algorithm.  This means that there must be a single
   binary value of the encoded form of the signature policy for the
   unique hash value to be calculated.  For example, there may exist a
   particular file type, length and format on which the hash value is
   calculated which is fixed and definitive for a particular signature
   policy.

   The hash value may be obtained by:

      the signer performing his own computation of the hash over the
      signature policy using his preferred hash algorithm permitted by
      the signature policy, and the definitive binary encoded form.

      the signer, having verified the source of the policy, may use both
      the hash algorithm and the hash value included in the computer
      processable form of the policy (see <a href="#section-6.1">section 6.1</a>).
