<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Overview</span>

   This document describes five types of SNMP applications:

       -  Applications which initiate SNMP Get, GetNext, GetBulk, and/or
          Set requests, called 'command generators.'

       -  Applications which respond to SNMP Get, GetNext, GetBulk,
          and/or Set requests, called 'command responders.'

       -  Applications which generate notifications, called
          'notification originators.'

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2273.html">RFC 2273</a>                  SNMPv3 Applications               January 1998</span>


       -  Applications which receive notifications, called 'notification
          receivers.'

       -  Applications which forward SNMP Get, GetNext, GetBulk, and/or
          Set requests or notifications, called 'proxy forwarder.'

   Note that there are no restrictions on which types of applications
   may be associated with a particular SNMP engine.  For example, a
   single SNMP engine may, in fact, be associated with both command
   generator and command responder applications.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Command%20Generator%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Command Generator Applications</span>

   A command generator application initiates SNMP Get, GetNext, GetBulk,
   and/or Set requests, as well as processing the response to a request
   which it generated.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20Command%20Responder%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Command Responder Applications</span>

   A command responder application receives SNMP Get, GetNext, GetBulk,
   and/or Set requests destined for the local system as indicated by the
   fact that the contextEngineID in the received request is equal to
   that of the local engine through which the request was received.  The
   command responder application will perform the appropriate protocol
   operation, using access control, and will generate a response message
   to be sent to the request's originator.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Notification%20Originator%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Notification Originator Applications</span>

   A notification originator application conceptually monitors a system
   for particular events or conditions, and generates Trap and/or Inform
   messages based on these events or conditions.  A notification
   originator must have a mechanism for determining where to send
   messages, and what SNMP version and security parameters to use when
   sending messages.  A mechanism and MIB module for this purpose is
   provided in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4.%20%20Notification%20Receiver%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" name="section-1.4">1.4</a>.  Notification Receiver Applications</span>

   A notification receiver application listens for notification
   messages, and generates response messages when a message containing
   an Inform PDU is received.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.5.%20%20Proxy%20Forwarder%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.5" name="section-1.5">1.5</a>.  Proxy Forwarder Applications</span>

   A proxy forwarder application forwards SNMP messages.  Note that
   implementation of a proxy forwarder application is optional.  The

   implementations that do not include a proxy forwarder application.

   The term "proxy" has historically been used very loosely, with
   multiple different meanings.  These different meanings include (among
   others):

(1)  the forwarding of SNMP requests to other SNMP entities without
     regard for what managed object types are being accessed; for
     example, in order to forward an SNMP request from one transport
     domain to another, or to translate SNMP requests of one version
     into SNMP requests of another version;

(2)  the translation of SNMP requests into operations of some non-SNMP
     management protocol; and

(3)  support for aggregated managed objects where the value of one
     managed object instance depends upon the values of multiple other
     (remote) items of management information.

   Each of these scenarios can be advantageous; for example, support for
   aggregation of management information can significantly reduce the
   bandwidth requirements of large-scale management activities.
   However, using a single term to cover multiple different scenarios
   causes confusion.

   To avoid such confusion, this document uses the term "proxy" with a
   much more tightly defined meaning.  The term "proxy" is used in this
   document to refer to a proxy forwarder application which forwards
   either SNMP requests, notifications, and responses without regard for
   what managed objects are contained within requests or notifications.
   This definition is most closely related to the first definition
   above.  Note, however, that in the SNMP architecture [<a href="rfc2271.html">RFC2271</a>], a
   proxy forwarder is actually an application, and need not be
   associated with what is traditionally thought of as an SNMP agent.

   Specifically, the distinction between a traditional SNMP agent and a
   proxy forwarder application is simple:

       -  a proxy forwarder application forwards requests and/or
          notifications to other SNMP engines according to the context,
          and irrespective of the specific managed object types being
          accessed, and forwards the response to such previously
          forwarded messages back to the SNMP engine from which the
          original message was received;

       -  in contrast, the command responder application that is part of
          what is traditionally thought of as an SNMP agent, and which
          processes SNMP requests according to the (names of the)

          individual managed object types and instances being accessed,
          is NOT a proxy forwarder application from the perspective of
          this document.

   Thus, when a proxy forwarder application forwards a request or
   notification for a particular contextEngineID / contextName pair, not
   only is the information on how to forward the request specifically
   associated with that context, but the proxy forwarder application has
   no need of a detailed definition of a MIB view (since the proxy
   forwarder application forwards the request irrespective of the
   managed object types).

   In contrast, a command responder application must have the detailed
   definition of the MIB view, and even if it needs to issue requests to
   other entities, via SNMP or otherwise, that need is dependent on the
   individual managed object instances being accessed (i.e., not only on
   the context).

   Note that it is a design goal of a proxy forwarder application to act
   as an intermediary between the endpoints of a transaction.  In
   particular, when forwarding Inform requests, the associated response
   is forwarded when it is received from the target to which the Inform
   request was forwarded, rather than generating a response immediately
   when an Inform request is received.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Management%20Targets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Management Targets</span>

   Some types of applications (notification generators and proxy
   forwarders in particular) require a mechanism for determining where
   and how to send generated messages.  This document provides a
   mechanism and MIB module for this purpose.  The set of information
   that describes where and how to send a message is called a
   'Management Target', and consists of two kinds of information:

       -  Destination information, consisting of a transport domain and
          a transport address.  This is also termed a transport
          endpoint.

       -  SNMP parameters, consisting of message processing model,
          security model, security level, and security name information.

   The SNMP-TARGET-MIB module described later in this document contains
   one table for each of these types of information.  There can be a
   many-to-many relationship in the MIB between these two types of
   information.  That is, there may be multiple transport endpoints
   associated with a particular set of SNMP parameters, or a particular
   transport endpoint may be associated with several sets of SNMP
   parameters.

   The following sections describe the procedures followed by each type
   of application when generating messages for transmission or when
   processing received messages.  Applications communicate with the
   Dispatcher using the abstract service interfaces defined in [<a href="rfc2271.html">RFC2271</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Command%20Generator%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Command Generator Applications</span>

   A command generator initiates an SNMP request by calling the
   Dispatcher using the following abstract service interface:

       statusInformation =              -- sendPduHandle if success
                                        -- errorIndication if failure
         sendPdu(
         IN   transportDomain           -- transport domain to be used
         IN   transportAddress          -- destination network address
         IN   messageProcessingModel    -- typically, SNMP version
         IN   securityModel             -- Security Model to use
         IN   securityName              -- on behalf of this principal
         IN   securityLevel             -- Level of Security requested
         IN   contextEngineID           -- data from/at this entity
         IN   contextName               -- data from/in this context
         IN   pduVersion                -- the version of the PDU
         IN   PDU                       -- SNMP Protocol Data Unit
         IN   expectResponse            -- TRUE or FALSE
              )

   Where:

       -  The transportDomain is that of the destination of the message.

       -  The transportAddress is that of the destination of the
          message.

       -  The messageProcessingModel indicates which Message Processing
          Model the application wishes to use.

       -  The securityModel is the security model that the application
          wishes to use.

       -  The securityName is the security model independent name for
          the principal on whose behalf the application wishes the
          message is to be generated.

       -  The securityLevel is the security level that the application
          wishes to use.

       -  The contextEngineID is provided by the command generator if it
          wishes to explicitly specify the location of the management
          information it is requesting.

       -  The contextName is provided by the command generator if it
          wishes to explicitly specify the local context name for the
          management information it is requesting.

       -  The pduVersion indicates the version of the PDU to be sent.

       -  The PDU is a value constructed by the command generator
          containing the management operation that the command generator
          wishes to perform.

       -  The expectResponse argument indicates that a response is
          expected.

   The result of the sendPdu interface indicates whether the PDU was
   successfully sent.  If it was successfully sent, the returned value
   will be a sendPduHandle.  The command generator should store the
   sendPduHandle so that it can correlate a response to the original
   request.

   The Dispatcher is responsible for delivering the response to a
   particular request to the correct command generator application.  The
   abstract service interface used is:

       processResponsePdu(              -- process Response PDU
         IN   messageProcessingModel    -- typically, SNMP version
         IN   securityModel             -- Security Model in use
         IN   securityName              -- on behalf of this principal
         IN   securityLevel             -- Level of Security
         IN   contextEngineID           -- data from/at this SNMP entity
         IN   contextName               -- data from/in this context
         IN   pduVersion                -- the version of the PDU
         IN   PDU                       -- SNMP Protocol Data Unit
         IN   statusInformation         -- success or errorIndication
         IN   sendPduHandle             -- handle from sendPDU
              )

   Where:

       -  The messageProcessingModel is the value from the received
          response.

       -  The securityModel is the value from the received response.

       -  The securityName is the value from the received response.

       -  The securityLevel is the value from the received response.

       -  The contextEngineID is the value from the received response.

       -  The contextName is the value from the received response.

       -  The pduVersion indicates the version of the PDU in the
          received response.

       -  The PDU is the value from the received response.

       -  The statusInformation indicates success or failure in
          receiving the response.

       -  The sendPduHandle is the value returned by the sendPdu call
          which generated the original request to which this is a
          response.

   The procedure when a command generator receives a message is as
   follows:

(1)  If the received values of messageProcessingModel, securityModel,
     securityName, contextEngineID, contextName, and pduVersion are not
     all equal to the values used in the original request, the response
     is discarded.

(2)  The operation type, request-id, error-status, error-index, and
     variable-bindings are extracted from the PDU and saved.  If the
     request-id is not equal to the value used in the original request,
     the response is discarded.

(3)  At this point, it is up to the application to take an appropriate
     action.  The specific action is implementation dependent.  If the
     statusInformation indicates that the request failed, an appropriate
     action might be to attempt to transmit the request again, or to
     notify the person operating the application that a failure
     occurred.

   Before a command responder application can process messages, it must
   first associate itself with an SNMP engine.  The abstract service
   interface used for this purpose is:

       statusInformation =        -- success or errorIndication
         registerContextEngineID(
         IN   contextEngineID     -- take responsibility for this one
         IN   pduType             -- the pduType(s) to be registered
              )

   Where:

       -  The statusInformation indicates success or failure of the
          registration attempt.

       -  The contextEngineID is equal to the snmpEngineID of the SNMP
          engine with which the command responder is registering.

       -  The pduType indicates a Get, GetNext, GetBulk, or Set pdu.

   Note that if another command responder application is already
   registered with an SNMP engine, any further attempts to register with
   the same contextEngineID and pduType will be denied.  This implies
   that separate command responder applications could register
   separately for the various pdu types.  However, in practice this is
   undesirable, and only a single command responder application should
   be registered with an SNMP engine at any given time.

   A command responder application can disassociate with an SNMP engine
   using the following abstract service interface:

       unregisterContextEngineID(
         IN   contextEngineID     -- give up responsibility for this one
         IN   pduType             -- the pduType(s) to be unregistered
              )

   Where:

       -  The contextEngineID is equal to the snmpEngineID of the SNMP
          engine with which the command responder is cancelling the
          registration.

       -  The pduType indicates a Get, GetNext, GetBulk, or Set pdu.

   Once the command responder has registered with the SNMP engine, it
   waits to receive SNMP messages.  The abstract service interface used
   for receiving messages is:

   processPdu(                     -- process Request/Notification PDU
     IN   messageProcessingModel   -- typically, SNMP version

       -  The messageProcessingModel indicates which Message Processing
          Model received and processed the message.

       -  The securityModel is the value from the received message.

       -  The pduVersion indicates the version of the PDU in the
          received message.

       -  The PDU is the value from the received message.

       -  The maxSizeResponseScopedPDU is the maximum allowable size of
          a ScopedPDU containing a Response PDU (based on the maximum
          message size that the originator of the message can accept).

       -  The stateReference is a value which references cached
          information about each received request message.  This value
          must be returned to the Dispatcher in order to generate a
          response.

   The procedure when a message is received is as follows.

(1)  The operation type is determined from the ASN.1 tag value
     associated with the PDU parameter.  The operation type should
     always be one of the types previously registered by the
     application.

(2)  The request-id is extracted from the PDU and saved.

     max-repetitions values are extracted from the PDU and saved.

     operation type.  To determine whether a particular object instance
     is within the relevant MIB view, the following abstract service
     interface is called:

           isAccessAllowed(
           IN   securityModel     -- Security Model in use

           IN   variableName      -- OID for the managed object
                )

     Where:

       -  The securityModel is the value from the received message.

       -  The securityName is the value from the received message.

       -  The securityLevel is the value from the received message.

       -  The viewType indicates whether the PDU type is a read or write
          operation.

       -  The contextName is the value from the received message.

       -  The variableName is the object instance of the variable for
          which access rights are to be checked.

     Normally, the result of the management operation will be a new PDU
     value, and processing will continue in step (6) below.  However, at
     any time during the processing of the management operation:

       -  If the isAccessAllowed ASI returns a noSuchView,

       -  The PDU is the result generated in step (5) above.  If no
          result PDU was generated, the PDU is an undefined value.

       -  The maxSizeResponseScopedPDU is a local value indicating the
          maximum size of a ScopedPDU that the application can accept.

       -  The stateReference is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The statusInformation either contains an indication that no

          contains an indication that an error occurred along with the
          OID and counter value of the appropriate error counter object.

   Note that a command responder application should always call the
   returnResponsePdu abstract service interface, even in the event of an
   error such as a resource allocation error.  In the event of such an
   error, the PDU value passed to returnResponsePdu should contain
   appropriate values for errorStatus and errorIndex.

   A notification originator application generates SNMP notification
   messages.  A notification message may, for example, contain an
   SNMPv2-Trap PDU or an Inform PDU.  However, a particular
   implementation is not required to be capable of generating both types
   of messages.

   Notification originator applications require a mechanism for
   identifying the management targets to which notifications should be
   sent.  The particular mechanism used is implementation dependent.
   However, if an implementation makes the configuration of management
   targets SNMP manageable, it MUST use the SNMP-TARGET-MIB module
   described in this document.

   When a notification originator wishes to generate a notification, it
   must first determine in which context the information to be conveyed
   in the notification exists, i.e., it must determine the
   contextEngineID and contextName.  It must then determine the set of

   management targets to which the notification should be sent.  The
   application must also determine, for each management target, whether
   the notification message should contain an SNMPv2-Trap PDU or Inform
   PDU, and if it is to contain an Inform PDU, the number of retries and
   retransmission algorithm.

   The mechanism by which a notification originator determines this
   information is implementation dependent.  Once the application has
   determined this information, the following procedure is performed for
   each management target:

(1)  Any appropriate filtering mechanisms are applied to determine
     whether the notification should be sent to the management target.
     If such filtering mechanisms determine that the notification should
     not be sent, processing continues with the next management target.
     Otherwise,

(2)  The appropriate set of variable-bindings is retrieved from local
     MIB instrumentation within the relevant MIB view.  The relevant MIB
     view is determined by the securityLevel, securityModel,
     contextName, and securityName of the management target.  To
     determine whether a particular object instance is within the
     relevant MIB view, the isAccessAllowed abstract service interface
     is used, in the same manner as described in the preceding section.
     If the statusInformation returned by isAccessAllowed does not
     indicate accessAllowed, the notification is not sent to the
     management target.

(3)  A PDU is constructed using a locally unique request-id value, an
     operation type of SNMPv2-Trap or Inform, an error-status and
     error-index value of 0, and the variable-bindings supplied
     previously in step (2).

(4)  If the notification contains an SNMPv2-Trap PDU, the Dispatcher is
     called using the following abstract service interface:

         statusInformation =              -- sendPduHandle if success
                                          -- errorIndication if failure
           sendPdu(
           IN   transportDomain           -- transport domain to be used
           IN   transportAddress          -- destination network address

      b)   The application caches information about the management
          target.

      c)  If a response is received within an appropriate time interval
          from the transport endpoint of the management target, the
          notification is considered acknowledged and the cached
          information is deleted.  Otherwise,

   Notification receiver applications receive SNMP Notification messages
   from the Dispatcher.  Before any messages can be received, the
   notification receiver must register with the Dispatcher using the
   registerContextEngineID abstract service interface.  The parameters
   used are:

       -  The contextEngineID is an undefined 'wildcard' value.
          Notifications are delivered to a registered notification
          receiver regardless of the contextEngineID contained in the
          notification message.

       -  The pduType indicates the type of notifications that the
          application wishes to receive (for example, SNMPv2-Trap PDUs
          or Inform PDUs).

   Once the notification receiver has registered with the Dispatcher,
   messages are received using the processPdu abstract service
   interface.  Parameters are:

       -  The messageProcessingModel indicates which Message Processing
          Model received and processed the message.

       -  The securityModel is the value from the received message.

       -  The securityName is the value from the received message.

       -  The securityLevel is the value from the received message.

       -  The contextEngineID is the value from the received message.

       -  The contextName is the value from the received message.

       -  The pduVersion indicates the version of the PDU in the
          received message.

       -  The PDU is the value from the received message.

       -  The maxSizeResponseScopedPDU is the maximum allowable size of
          a ScopedPDU containing a Response PDU (based on the maximum
          message size that the originator of the message can accept).

       -  If the message contains an SNMPv2-Trap PDU, the stateReference
          is undefined and unused.  Otherwise, the stateReference is a
          value which references cached information about the
          notification.  This value must be returned to the Dispatcher
          in order to generate a response.

   When an SNMPv2-Trap PDU is delivered to a notification receiver
   application, it first extracts the SNMP operation type, request-id,
   error-status, error-index, and variable-bindings from the PDU.  After
   this, processing depends on the particular implementation.

   When an Inform PDU is received, the notification receiver application
   follows the following procedure:

(1)  The SNMPv2 operation type, request-id, error-status, error-index,
     and variable-bindings are extracted from the PDU.

(2)  A Response PDU is constructed using the extracted request-id and
     variable-bindings, and with error-status and error-index both set
     to 0.

(3)  The Dispatcher is called to generate a response message using the
     returnResponsePdu abstract service interface.  Parameters are:

       -  The messageProcessingModel is the value from the processPdu
          call.

       -  The securityModel is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The securityName is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The securityLevel is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The contextEngineID is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The contextName is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The pduVersion indicates the version of the PDU to be
          returned.

   A proxy forwarder application deals with forwarding SNMP messages.
   There are four basic types of messages which a proxy forwarder
   application may need to forward.  These are grouped according to the
   PDU type contained in a message, or according to whether a report
   indication is contained in the message.  The four basic types of
   messages are:

       -  Those containing PDU types which were generated by a command
          generator application (for example, Get, GetNext, GetBulk, and
          Set PDU types).  These deal with requesting or modifying
          information located within a particular context.

       -  Those containing PDU types which were generated by a
          notification originator application (for example, SNMPv2-Trap
          and Inform PDU types).  These deal with notifications
          concerning information located within a particular context.

       -  Those containing a Response PDU type.  Forwarding of Response
          PDUs always occurs as a result of receiving a response to a
          previously forwarded message.

       -  Those containing a report indication.  Forwarding of report
          indications always occurs as a result of receiving a report
          indication for a previously forwarded message.

   For the first type, the proxy forwarder's role is to deliver a
   request for management information to an SNMP engine which is
   "closer" or "downstream in the path" to the SNMP engine which has
   access to that information, and to deliver the response containing
   the information back to the SNMP engine from which the request was
   received.  The context information in a request is used to determine
   which SNMP engine has access to the requested information, and this
   is used to determine where and how to forward the request.






<span class="grey">Levi, et. al.               Standards Track                    [Page 18]</span></pre>

   For the second type, the proxy forwarder's role is to determine which
   SNMP engines should receive notifications about management
   information from a particular location.  The context information in a
   notification message determines the location to which the information
   contained in the notification applies.  This is used to determine
   which SNMP engines should receive notification about this
   information.

   For the third type, the proxy forwarder's role is to determine which
   previously forwarded request or notification (if any) the response
   matches, and to forward the response back to the initiator of the
   request or notification.

   For the fourth type, the proxy forwarder's role is to determine which
   previously forwarded request or notification (if any) the report
   indication matches, and to forward the report indication back to the
   initiator of the request or notification.

   When forwarding messages, a proxy forwarder application must perform
   a translation of incoming management target information into outgoing
   management target information.  How this translation is performed is
   implementation specific.  In many cases, this will be driven by a
   preconfigured translation table.  If a proxy forwarder application
   makes the contents of this table SNMP manageable, it MUST use the
   SNMP-PROXY-MIB module defined in this document.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.1.%20%20Request%20Forwarding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5.1" name="section-3.5.1">3.5.1</a>.  Request Forwarding</span>

   There are two phases for request forwarding.  First, the incoming
   request needs to be passed through the proxy application.  Then, the
   resulting response needs to be passed back.  These phases are
   described in the following two sections.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.1.1.%20%20Processing%20an%20Incoming%20Request"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5.1.1" name="section-3.5.1.1">3.5.1.1</a>.  Processing an Incoming Request</span>

   A proxy forwarder application that wishes to forward request messages
   must first register with the Dispatcher using the
   registerContextEngineID abstract service interface.  The proxy
   forwarder must register each contextEngineID for which it wishes to
   forward messages, as well as for each pduType.  Note that as the
   configuration of a proxy forwarder is changed, the particular
   contextEngineID values for which it is forwarding may change.  The
   proxy forwarder should call the registerContextEngineID and
   unregisterContextEngineID abstract service interfaces as needed to
   reflect its current configuration.

   A proxy forwarder application should never attempt to register a
   value of contextEngineID which is equal to the snmpEngineID of the
   SNMP engine to which the proxy forwarder is associated.

   Once the proxy forwarder has registered for the appropriate
   contextEngineId values, it can start processing messages.  The
   following procedure is used:

(1)  A message is received using the processPdu abstract service
     interface.  The incoming management target information received
     from the processPdu interface is translated into outgoing
     management target information.  Note that this translation may vary
     for different values of contextEngineID and/or contextName.  The
     translation should result in a single management target.

(2)  If appropriate outgoing management target information cannot be
     found, the proxy forwarder increments the snmpProxyDrops counter
     [<a href="rfc1907.html">RFC1907</a>], and then calls the Dispatcher using the
     returnResponsePdu abstract service interface.  Parameters are:

       -  The messageProcessingModel is the value from the processPdu
          call.

       -  The securityModel is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The securityName is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The securityLevel is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The contextEngineID is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The contextName is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The pduVersion is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The PDU is an undefined value.

       -  The maxSizeResponseScopedPDU is a local value indicating the
          maximum size of a ScopedPDU that the application can accept.

       -  The stateReference is the value from the processPdu call.

       -  The statusInformation indicates that an error occurred and
          includes the OID and value of the snmpProxyDrops object.

     Processing of the message stops at this point.  Otherwise,

(3)  A new PDU is constructed.  A unique value of request-id should be
     used in the new PDU (this value will enable a subsequent response
     message to be correlated with this request).  The remainder of the
     new PDU is identical to the received PDU, unless the incoming SNMP
     version is SNMPv2 or SNMPv3 and the outgoing SNMP version is
     SNMPv1, in which case the proxy forwarder must apply the
     translation rules as documented in [<a href="rfc1908.html">RFC1908</a>].

(4)  The proxy forwarder calls the Dispatcher to generate the forwarded
     message, using the sendPdu abstract service interface.  The
     parameters are:

       -  The transportDomain is that of the outgoing management target.

       -  The transportAddress is that of the outgoing management
          target.

       -  The messageProcessingModel is that of the outgoing management

       -  The securityLevel is that of the outgoing management target.

       -  The contextEngineID is the value originally received.

       -  The contextName is the value originally received.

       -  The pduVersion is the version of the PDU to be sent.

       -  The PDU is the value constructed in step (3) above.

       -  The expectResponse argument indicates that a response is
          expected.  If the sendPdu call is unsuccessful, the proxy
          forwarder performs the steps described in (2) above.

       -  The request-id from the received PDU.

       -  the contextEngineID,

(6)  Processing of the request stops until a response to the forwarded
     request is received, or until an appropriate time interval has

   A proxy forwarder follows the following procedure when an incoming
   response is received:

(1)  The incoming response is received using the processResponsePdu
     interface.  The proxy forwarder uses the received parameters to
     locate an entry in its cache of pending forwarded requests.  This
     is done by matching the received parameters with the cached values
     of sendPduHandle, contextEngineID, contextName, outgoing management
     target information, and the request-id contained in the received
     PDU (the proxy forwarder must extract the request-id for this
     purpose).  If an appropriate cache entry cannot be found,
     processing of the response is halted.  Otherwise:

(2)  The cache information is extracted, and removed from the cache.

(3)  A new Response PDU is constructed, using the request-id value from
     the original forwarded request (as extracted from the cache).  All
     other values are identical to those in the received Response PDU.

(4)  If the incoming SNMP version is SNMPv1 and the outgoing SNMP
     version is SNMPv2 or SNMPv3, the proxy forwarder must apply the
     translation rules documented in [<a href="rfc1908.html">RFC1908</a>].

(5)  The proxy forwarder calls the Dispatcher using the
     returnResponsePdu abstract service interface.  Parameters are:

   A proxy forwarder follows the following procedure when an incoming
   report indication is received:

(1)  The incoming report indication is received using the
     processResponsePdu interface.  The proxy forwarder uses the
     received parameters to locate an entry in its cache of pending
     forwarded requests.  This is done by matching the received
     parameters with the cached values of sendPduHandle.  If an
     appropriate cache entry cannot be found, processing of the report
     indication is halted.  Otherwise:

(2)  The cache information is extracted, and removed from the cache.

(3)  If the original incoming management target information indicates
     SNMPv1, processing of the report indication is halted.

   A proxy forwarder receives notifications in the same manner as a
   notification receiver application, using the processPdu abstract
   service interface.  The following procedure is used when a
   notification is received:

(1)  The incoming management target information received from the
     processPdu interface is translated into outgoing management target
     information.  Note that this translation may vary for different
     values of contextEngineId and/or contextName.  The translation may
     result in multiple management targets.

(2)  If appropriate outgoing management target information cannot be
     found and the notification was a Trap, processing of the
     notification is halted.  If appropriate outgoing management target
     information cannot be found and the notification was an Inform, the
     proxy forwarder increments the snmpProxyDrops object, and calls the
     Dispatcher using the returnResponsePdu abstract service interface.

     The parameters are:

       -  The messageProcessingModel is the received value.

       -  The securityModel is the received value.

       -  The securityName is the received value.

       -  The securityLevel is the received value.

       -  The contextEngineID is the received value.

       -  The contextName is the received value.

       -  The pduVersion is the received value.

       -  The PDU is an undefined and unused value.

       -  The maxSizeResponseScopedPDU is a local value indicating the
          maximum size of a ScopedPDU that the application can accept.

       -  The stateReference is the received value.

       -  The statusInformation indicates that an error occurred and
          that a Report message should be generated.

     Processing of the message stops at this point.  Otherwise,

(3)  The proxy forwarder generates a notification using the procedures
     described in the preceding section on Notification Originators,
     with the following exceptions:

       -  The contextEngineID and contextName values from the original
          received notification are used.

       -  The outgoing management targets previously determined are
          used.

       -  No filtering mechanisms are applied.

       -  The variable-bindings from the original received notification
          are used, rather than retrieving variable-bindings from local
          MIB instrumentation.  In particular, no access-control is
          applied to these variable-bindings.

       -  If for any of the outgoing management targets, the incoming
          SNMP version is SNMPv1 and the outgoing SNMP version is SNMPv2
          or SNMPv3, the proxy forwarder must apply the translation
          rules as documented in [<a href="rfc1908.html">RFC1908</a>].

       -  If for any of the outgoing management targets, the incoming
          SNMP version is SNMPv2 or SNMPv3, and the outgoing SNMP
          version is SNMPv1, this outgoing management target is not used
          when generating the forwarded notifications.

(4)  If the original received notification contains an SNMPv2-Trap PDU,
     processing of the notification is now completed.  Otherwise, the
     original received notification must contain an Inform PDU, and
     processing continues.

(5)  If the forwarded notifications included any Inform PDUs, processing
     continues when the procedures described in the section for
     Notification Originators determine that either:

       -  None of the generated notifications containing Inform PDUs
          have been successfully acknowledged within the longest of the
          time intervals, in which case processing of the original
          notification is halted, or,

       -  At least one of the generated notifications containing Inform
          PDUs is successfully acknowledged, in which case a response to
          the original received notification containing an Inform PDU is
          generated as described in the following steps.

(6)  A Response PDU is constructed, using the values of request-id and
     variable-bindings from the original received Inform PDU, and
     error-status and error-index values of 0.

(7)  The Dispatcher is called using the returnResponsePdu abstract
     service interface.  Parameters are:

   There are three separate MIB modules described in this document, the
   management target MIB, the notification MIB, and the proxy MIB.  The
   following sections describe the structure of these three MIB modules.

   The use of these MIBs by particular types of applications is
   described later in this document:

       -  The use of the management target MIB and the notification MIB
          in notification originator applications is described in
          <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>.

       -  The use of the notification MIB for filtering notifications in
          notification originator applications is described in <a href="#section-7">section</a>
          <a href="#section-7">7</a>.

       -  The use of the management target MIB and the proxy MIB in
          proxy forwarding applications is described in <a href="#section-8">section 8</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20The%20Management%20Target%20MIB%20Module"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  The Management Target MIB Module</span>

   The SNMP-TARGET-MIB module contains objects for defining management
   targets.  It consists of two tables and conformance/compliance
   statements.

   The first table, the snmpTargetAddrTable, contains information about
   transport domains and addresses.  It also contains an object,
   snmpTargetAddrTagList, which provides a mechanism for grouping
   entries.




<span class="grey">Levi, et. al.               Standards Track                    [Page 27]</span></pre>

   The second table, the snmpTargetParamsTable, contains information
   about SNMP version and security information to be used when sending
   messages to particular transport domains and addresses.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.1.%20%20Tag%20Lists"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1" name="section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Tag Lists</span>

   The snmpTargetAddrTagList object is used for grouping entries in the
   snmpTargetAddrTable.  The value of this object contains a list of tag
   values which are used to select target addresses to be used for a
   particular operation.

   A tag value, which may also be used in MIB objects other than
   snmpTargetAddrTagList, is an arbitrary string of octets, but may not
   contain a delimiter character.  Delimiter characters are defined to
   be one of the following characters:

       -  An ASCII space character (0x20).

       -  An ASCII TAB character (0x09).

       -  An ASCII carriage return (CR) character (0x0D).

       -  An ASCII line feed (LF) character (0x0B).

   In addition, a tag value may not have a zero length.  Generally, a
   particular MIB object may contain either

       -  a single tag value, in which case the value of the MIB object
          may not contain a delimiter character, or:

       -  a MIB object may contain a list of tag values, separated by
          single delimiter characters.

   For a list of tag values, these constraints imply certain
   restrictions on the value of a MIB object:

       -  There cannot be a leading or trailing delimiter character.

       -  There cannot be multiple adjacent delimiter charaters.

       DESCRIPTION
           "An octet string containing a tag value.
            Tag values are preferably in human-readable form.

            To facilitate internationalization, this information
            is represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character
            set, encoded as an octet string using the UTF-8
            character encoding scheme described in <a href="rfc2044.html">RFC 2044</a>.

            Since additional code points are added by amendments
            to the 10646 standard from time to time,
            implementations must be prepared to encounter any code
            point from 0x00000000 to 0x7fffffff.

            The use of control codes should be avoided, and certain

            Note that when this TC is used for an object that
            is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then a
            SIZE restriction must be specified so that the number
            sub-identifiers for any object instance do not exceed
            the limit of 128, as defined by [<a href="rfc1905.html">RFC1905</a>].

            An object of this type contains a single tag value
            which is used to select a set of entries in a table.
            A tag value is an arbitrary string of octets, but
            may not contain a delimiter character.  Delimiter
            characters are defined to be one of the following:

                -  An ASCII space character (0x20).

                -  An ASCII TAB character (0x09).

                -  An ASCII carriage return (CR) character (0x0D).

                -  An ASCII line feed (LF) character (0x0B).

            Delimiter characters are used to separate tag values
            in a tag list.  An object of this type may only
            contain a single tag value, and so delimiter
            characters are not allowed in a value of this type.

            Some examples of valid tag values are:

                - 'acme'

                - 'router'

                - 'host'

            The use of a tag value to select table entries is
            application and MIB specific."

            Since additional code points are added by amendments
            to the 10646 standard from time to time,
            implementations must be prepared to encounter any code
            point from 0x00000000 to 0x7fffffff.

            The use of control codes should be avoided, except as
            described below.

            For code points not directly supported by user
            interface hardware or software, an alternative means
            of entry and display, such as hexadecimal, may be
            provided.

            For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII, the UTF-8
            representation is identical to the US-ASCII encoding.

            An object of this type contains a list of tag values
            which are used to select a set of entries in a table.

            A tag value is an arbitrary string of octets, but
            may not contain a delimiter character.  Delimiter
            characters are defined to be one of the following:

                -  An ASCII space character (0x20).

                -  An ASCII TAB character (0x09).

                -  An ASCII carriage return (CR) character (0x0D).

                -  An ASCII line feed (LF) character (0x0B).

            Delimiter characters are used to separate tag values
            in a tag list.  Only a single delimiter character may
            occur between two tag values.  A tag value may not
            have a zero length.  These constraints imply certain
            restrictions on the contents of this object:

                - There cannot be a leading or trailing delimiter
                  character.

                - There cannot be multiple adjacent delimiter
                  characters.

            Some examples of valid tag lists are:

                - An empty string

                - 'acme router'

                - 'host managerStation'

            Note that although a tag value may not have a length of
            zero, an empty string is still valid.  This indicates
            an empty list (i.e. there are no tag values in the list).

            The use of the tag list to select table entries is
            application and MIB specific.  Typically, an application
            will provide one or more tag values, and any entry
            which contains some combination of these tag values
            will be selected."

            The procedure for modifying the snmpTargetAddrTagList

                    retrieved value, and the value of

            corresponding instance of the snmpTargetParamsRowStatus
            column is 'notReady'.

            In particular, a newly created row cannot be made
            active until the corresponding
            snmpTargetParamsMPModel,
            snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel,

            and snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel have all been set.

   The SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB module contains objects for the remote
   configuration of the parameters used by an SNMP entity for the
   generation of notifications.  It consists of three tables and
   conformance/compliance statements.  The first table, the
   snmpNotifyTable, contains entries which select which entries in the
   snmpTargetAddrTable should be used for generating notifications, and
   the type of notifications to be generated.

   The second table sparsely augments the snmpTargetAddrTable with an
   object which is used to associate a set of filters with a particular
   management target.

   The third table defines filters which are used to limit the number of
   notifications which are generated using particular management
   targets.

           "The bit mask which, in combination with the corresponding
            instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, defines a family of
            subtrees which are included in or excluded from the
            filter profile.

            Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
            sub-identifier of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, with the
            most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
            string value (extended if necessary, see below)
            corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
            the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
            octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
            sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

            Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
            the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
            determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER matches this
            family of filter subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
            exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
            i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

            Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
            is contained in a family of filter subtrees if, for
            each sub-identifier of the value of
            snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, either:

              the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
              sub-identifier of the value of
              snmpNotifyFilterSubtree.

            there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
            corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree,

   This section describes the mechanisms used by a notification
   originator application when using the MIB module described in this
   document to determine the set of management targets to be used when
   generating a notification.

   A notification originator uses the snmpNotifyTable to find the
   management targets to be used for generating notifications.  Each
   active entry in this table identifies zero or more entries in the
   snmpTargetAddrTable.  Any entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable whose
   snmpTargetAddrTagList object contains a tag value which is equal to a
   value of snmpNotifyTag is selected by the snmpNotifyEntry which
   contains that instance of snmpNotifyTag.  Note that a particular
   snmpTargetAddrEntry may be selected by multiple entries in the
   snmpNotifyTable, resulting in multiple notifications being generated
   using that snmpTargetAddrEntry.

   Each snmpTargetAddrEntry contains a pointer to the
   snmpTargetParamsTable (snmpTargetAddrParams).  This pointer selects a
   set of SNMP parameters to be used for generating notifications.  If
   the selected entry in the snmpTargetParamsTable does not exist, the
   management target is not used to generate notifications.

   The decision as to whether a notification should contain an SNMPv2-
   Trap or Inform PDU is determined by the value of the snmpNotifyType
   object.  If the value of this object is trap(1), the notification
   should contain an SNMPv2-Trap PDU.  If the value of this object is
   inform(2), then the notification should contain an Inform PDU, and
   the timeout time and number of retries for the Inform are the value
   of snmpTargetAddrTimeout and snmpTargetAddrRetryCount.  Note that the
   exception to these rules is when the snmpTargetParamsMPModel object
   indicates SNMPv1.  In this case, the notification is sent as a Trap
   if the value of snmpNotifyTargetType is either trap(1) or inform(2).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Notification%20Filtering"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Notification Filtering</span>

   This section describes the mechanisms used by a notification
   originator application when using the MIB module described in this
   document to filter generation of notifications.

   A notification originator uses the snmpNotifyFilterTable to filter
   notifications.  A notification filter profile may be associated with
   a particular entry in the snmpTargetParamsTable.  The associated
   filter profile is identified by an entry in the
   snmpNotifyFilterProfileTable whose index is equal to the index of the
   entry in the snmpTargetParamsTable.  If no such entry exists in the
   snmpNotifyFilterProfileTable, no filtering is performed for that
   management target.

   If such an entry does exist, the value of snmpNotifyFilterProfileName
   of the entry is compared with the corresponding portion of the index
   of all active entries in the snmpNotifyFilterTable.  All such entries
   for which this comparison results in an exact match are used for
   filtering a notification generated using the associated
   snmpTargetParamsEntry.  If no such entries exist, no filtering is
   performed, and a notification may be sent to the management target.

   Otherwise, if matching entries do exist, a notification may be sent
   if the NOTIFICATION-TYPE OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the notification (this
   is the value of the element of the variable bindings whose name is
   snmpTrapOID.0, i.e., the second variable binding), and all of the
   object instances to be included in the variable-bindings of the
   notification, are not specifically excluded by the matching entries.





<span class="grey">Levi, et. al.               Standards Track                    [Page 60]</span></pre>

   Each set of snmpNotifyFilterTable entries is divided into two
   collections of filter subtrees:  the included filter subtrees, and
   the excluded filter subtrees.  The snmpNotifyFilterType object
   defines the collection to which each matching entry belongs.

   To determine whether a particular notification name or object
   instance is excluded by the set of matching entries, compare the
   notification name's or object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each
   of the matching entries.  If none match, then the notification name
   or object instance is considered excluded, and the notification
   should not be sent to this management target.  If one or more match,
   then the notification name or object instance is included or
   excluded, according to the value of snmpNotifyFilterType in the entry
   whose value of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree has the most sub-identifiers.
   If multiple entries match and have the same number of sub-
   identifiers, then the lexicographically greatest instance of
   snmpNotifyFilterType among those which match determines the inclusion
   or exclusion.

   A notification name's or object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X
   matches an entry in the snmpNotifyFilterTable when the number of
   sub-identifiers in X is at least as many as in the value of
   snmpNotifyFilterSubtree for the entry, and each sub-identifier in the
   value of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree matches its corresponding sub-
   identifier in X.  Two sub-identifiers match either if the
   corresponding bit of snmpNotifyFilterMask is zero (the 'wild card'
   value), or if the two sub-identifiers are equal.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Management%20Target%20Translation%20in%20Proxy%20Forwarder%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Management Target Translation in Proxy Forwarder Applications</span>

   This section describes the mechanisms used by a proxy forwarder
   application when using the MIB module described in this document to
   translate incoming management target information into outgoing
   management target information for the purpose of forwarding messages.
   There are actually two mechanisms a proxy forwarder may use, one for
   forwarding request messages, and one for forwarding notification
   messages.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.%20%20Management%20Target%20Translation%20for%20Request%20Forwarding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Management Target Translation for Request Forwarding</span>

   When forwarding request messages, the proxy forwarder will select a
   single entry in the snmpProxyTable.  To select this entry, it will
   perform the following comparisons:

       -  The snmpProxyType must be read(1) if the request is a Get,
          GetNext, or GetBulk request.  The snmpProxyType must be
          write(2) if the request is a Set request.

       -  The contextEngineId must equal the snmpProxyContextEngineID
          object.

       -  If the snmpProxyContextName object is supported, it must equal
          the contextName.

       -  The snmpProxyTargetParamsIn object identifies an entry in the
          snmpTargetParamsTable.  The messageProcessingModel,
          securityLevel, security model, and securityName must match the
          values of snmpTargetParamsMPModel,
          snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel, snmpTargetParamsSecurityName,
          and snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel of the identified entry in
          the snmpTargetParamsTable.

   There may be multiple entries in the snmpProxyTable for which these
   comparisons succeed.  The entry whose snmpProxyName has the
   lexicographically smallest value and for which the comparisons
   succeed will be selected by the proxy forwarder.

   The outgoing management target information is identified by the value
   of the snmpProxySingleTargetOut object of the selected entry.  This
   object identifies an entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable.  The
   identified entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable also contains a reference
   to the snmpTargetParamsTable (snmpTargetAddrParams).  If either the
   identified entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable does not exist, or the
   identified entry in the snmpTargetParamsTable does not exist, then
   this snmpProxyEntry does not identify valid forwarding information,
   and the proxy forwarder should attempt to identify another row.

   If there is no entry in the snmpProxyTable for which all of the
   conditions above may be met, then there is no appropriate forwarding
   information, and the proxy forwarder should take appropriate actions.

   Otherwise, The snmpTargetAddrTDomain, snmpTargetAddrTAddress,
   snmpTargetAddrTimeout, and snmpTargetRetryCount of the identified
   snmpTargetAddrEntry, and the snmpTargetParamsMPModel,
   snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel, snmpTargetParamsSecurityName, and
   snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel of the identified snmpTargetParamsEntry
   are used as the destination management target.

   When forwarding notification messages, the proxy forwarder will
   select multiple entries in the snmpProxyTable.  To select these
   entries, it will perform the following comparisons:

       -  The snmpProxyType must be trap(3) if the notification is a
          Trap.  The snmpProxyType must be inform(4) if the request is
          an Inform.

       -  The contextEngineId must equal the snmpProxyContextEngineID
          object.

       -  If the snmpProxyContextName object is supported, it must equal
          the contextName.

       -  The snmpProxyTargetParamsIn object identifies an entry in the
          snmpTargetParamsTable.  The messageProcessingModel,
          securityLevel, security model, and securityName must match the
          values of snmpTargetParamsMPModel,
          snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel, snmpTargetParamsSecurityName,
          and snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel of the identified entry in
          the snmpTargetParamsTable.

   All entries for which these conditions are met are selected.  The
   snmpProxyMultipleTargetOut object of each such entry is used to
   select a set of entries in the snmpTargetAddrTable.  Any
   snmpTargetAddrEntry whose snmpTargetAddrTagList object contains a tag
   value equal to the value of snmpProxyMultipleTargetOut, and whose
   snmpTargetAddrParams object references an existing entry in the
   snmpTargetParamsTable, is selected as a destination for the forwarded
   notification.

   The document is based on recommendations of the IETF Security and
   Administrative Framework Evolution for SNMP Advisory Team. Members of
   that Advisory Team were:

      David Harrington (Cabletron Systems Inc.)
      Jeff Johnson (Cisco Systems)
      David Levi (SNMP Research Inc.)
      John Linn (Openvision)
      Russ Mundy (Trusted Information Systems) chair

   As recommended by the Advisory Team and the SNMPv3 Working Group
   Charter, the design incorporates as much as practical from previous
   RFCs and drafts. As a result, special thanks are due to the authors
   of previous designs known as SNMPv2u and SNMPv2*:

   The SNMP applications described in this document typically have
   direct access to MIB instrumentation.  Thus, it is very important
   that these applications be strict in their application of access
   control as described in this document.

   In addition, there may be some types of notification generator
   applications which, rather than accessing MIB instrumentation using
   access control, will obtain MIB information through other means (such
   as from a command line).  The implementors and users of such
   applications must be responsible for not divulging MIB information
   that normally would be inaccessible due to access control.

APPENDIX A - Trap Configuration Example

   This section describes an example configuration for a Notification
   Generator application which implements the snmpNotifyBasicCompliance
   level.  The example configuration specifies that the Notification
   Generator should send notifications to 3 separate managers, using
   authentication and no privacy for the first 2 managers, and using
   both authentication and privacy for the third manager.

   The configuration consists of three rows in the snmpTargetAddrTable,
   and two rows in the snmpTargetTable.

          snmpTargetAddrName         SnmpAdminString,
          snmpTargetAddrTDomain      TDomain,
          snmpTargetAddrTAddress     TAddress,
          snmpTargetAddrTimeout      TimeInterval,

          snmpTargetAddrParams       SnmpAdminString,
          snmpTargetAddrStorageType  StorageType,
          snmpTargetAddrRowStatus    RowStatus

        * snmpTargetAddrName        = "addr1"
          snmpTargetAddrTDomain     = snmpUDPDomain
          snmpTargetAddrTAddress    = 128.1.2.3:162
          snmpTargetAddrTagList     = "group1"
          snmpTargetAddrParams      = "AuthNoPriv joe"
          snmpTargetAddrStorageType = readOnly(5)
          snmpTargetAddrRowStatus   = active(1)

        * snmpTargetAddrName        = "addr2"
          snmpTargetAddrTDomain     = snmpUDPDomain
          snmpTargetAddrTAddress    = 128.2.4.6:162
          snmpTargetAddrTagList     = "group1"
          snmpTargetAddrParams      = "AuthNoPriv-joe"
          snmpTargetAddrStorageType = readOnly(5)
          snmpTargetAddrRowStatus   = active(1)

        * snmpTargetAddrName        = "addr3"
          snmpTargetAddrTDomain     = snmpUDPDomain
          snmpTargetAddrTAddress    = 128.1.2.3:162
          snmpTargetAddrTagList     = "group2"

          snmpTargetAddrStorageType = readOnly(5)
          snmpTargetAddrRowStatus   = active(1)

        * snmpTargetParamsName                   = "AuthNoPriv-joe"
          snmpTargetParamsMPModel                = 3

          snmpNotifyStorageType  = readOnly(5)
          snmpNotifyRowStatus    = active(1)

   These entries define two groups of management targets.  The first
   group contains two management targets:

                                first target      second target
                                ------------      -------------
       messageProcessingModel   SNMPv3            SNMPv3
                securityModel   3 (USM)           3 (USM)
                 securityName   "joe"             "joe"
                securityLevel   authNoPriv(2)     authNoPriv(2)
              transportDomain   snmpUDPDomain     snmpUDPDomain
             transportAddress   128.1.2.3:162     128.2.4.6:162

   And the second group contains a single management target:

       messageProcessingModel   SNMPv3
                securityLevel   authPriv(3)
                securityModel   3 (USM)
