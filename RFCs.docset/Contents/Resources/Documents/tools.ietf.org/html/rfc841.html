      Applicability.  This  message  format standard applies to Federal
      departments  and  agencies  in  their  acquisition  and  use   of
      computer-based  message  systems (CBMS) and services in networked
      systems,   except   for   certain    single-processor    systems.
      Specifically,  the  standard  does not apply to a CBMS if it is a
      stand-alone system which is not  interconnected  with  any  other
      CBMS:  nevertheless, conformance with the standard is recommended
      under these circumstances particularly if there is a  possibility
      that  use  of another central processing unit, or interconnection
      with another system, will be required in the future.  Where a new
      CBMS node is incorporated into an existing network, the  standard
      applies  at  the  interface  between  CBMS's.  In  this instance,
      previously existing nodes may  accommodate  the  standard  either
      through  retrofit  or  by  the use of a translator.  In addition,
      networks  that  are  established  strictly  for  the  purpose  of
      supporting  research  in  computer  science or communications are
      exempt from complying with this standard.
      
      Subcommittee TC97/SC16  of  the  International  Organization  for
      Standardization   (ISO)  has  developed  a  reference  model  for
      describing communications between "open" systems.  (ISO/TC97/SC16
      DIS7498) This model is known as the ISO Reference Model for  Open
      Systems   Interconnection   (OSI).    It  divides  communications
      protocols   into   seven   layers,    ranging    from    physical
      interconnection   at   the  lowest  layer  to  data  exchange  by
      applications programs at the top.
      
      The NBS message format deals with data  used  by  an  application
      within  a  system; it is not a protocol.  Messages defined by the

      NBS   message   format   would   be  manipulated  by  a  layer  7
      (Application) protocol.
      
      A message as referenced by the NBS message format is  a  unit  of
      communication from an originator to a recipient, exclusive of any
      message  heading  or  control information (often referred to as a
      message envelope).  An originator  and  recipient  are  typically
      people  but  may  be  roles  or  processes.   A role identifies a
      function within an organization as opposed to an  individual  who
      performs  that  function.  A process refers to a computer process
      that might originate or receive a message.
      
      Special Information. Certain characteristics distinguish  a  CBMS
      from  other  systems  for  sending  messages.    Originators  and
      recipients  may  be  terminal  users   or   processes   (discrete
      software).    A  system  in  which  the  originator  addresses  a
      particular terminal device rather than a particular recipient  is
      not  considered to be a CBMS.  The recipient's system need not be
      available when the originator sends a message.  The  message  can
      be  stored  in the originator's system or at an intermediate node
      in the network until the recipient's  system  becomes  available.
      In  addition,  a  CBMS  offers  both message creation and message
      processing facilities as part of the system.  A CBMS offers  text
      editing  facilities  to  assist  the user in the preparation of a
      message.   The  recipient  CBMS  stores  the  message  until  the
      recipient  chooses  to  read  it.    Message systems which do not
      provide these minimum functions are not considered CBMS's.
      
      The intent of the message format standard is to  allow  users  of
      different computer based message systems to send messages to each
      other.    The  standard  does  not  make  demands  on the message
      transfer system except that it transports messages transparently.
      The standard makes some simple demands on the  CBMS.    The  CBMS
      must  recognize  fields  within  the  message,  process fields in
      predetermined ways, create messages  in  the  correct  form,  and
      recognize  and  create  data  elements of messages in the correct
      format.  The standard does not dictate or constrain the  services
      that  the  CBMS  provides for users, or the way that messages are
      stored, represented, manipulated, or presented to the user by the
      CBMS.
      
      The standard does constrain the format  of  the  message  at  the
      interface  between  systems.   This guarantees that, whatever the
      source of the message, it arrives at the receiving system in  the
      standard   format.      The  message  format  standard  separates
      information into fields so that the CBMS can locate  and  operate
      on  that  information.   The message is converted from the format
      used within the originator's CBMS  to  the  standard  format  (if
      different)  on  leaving  the  originator's  CBMS.  The message is
      converted from the standard format to the format used within  the
      recipient's CBMS (if different) on entering the recipient's CBMS.

                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
      
      
      
      
           The  message  format  specification addresses the problem of
      exchanging  messages  between  different  computer-based  message
      systems  (CBMSs).    This interchange problem can be addressed on
      several  levels.    One  level  specifies  the  physical   inter-
      connections,  another  specifies  how information travels between
      CBMSs, another specifies  form  and  meaning  of  messages  being
      interchanged.    The  highest  level  specifies  operations  on a
      message.  Each of these levels would be covered  by  a  different
      standard.
      
           This  message format specification addresses only the issues
      of form and meaning of messages at the points in time  when  they
      are  sent  from  one  CBMS and received by another.  Messages are
      composed of fields, containing different classes of  information.
      These  fields  contain  information about the message originator,
      message recipient, subject matter, precedence and  security,  and
      references  to  previous  messages,  as  well  as the text of the
      message.  Standard formats (syntax) for messages provide a  basis
      for  the  contents  of  messages  generated  by  one  CBMS  to be
      processed by another CBMS.  Standard meanings (semantics) for the
      components of a message facilitate standard interpretation  of  a
      message,  so  that  everyone receiving a message gets the meaning
      intended by its sender.
      
           Each CBMS that implements this message format  specification
      will  be  compatible  with  any  other  CBMS  that implements the
      specification, provided that the use of optional fields and  data
      elements  is  negotiated  in  advance.    This  ensures  that the
      contents of a message posted by one  CBMS  can  be  received  and
      interpreted by a different CBMS.
      
           This  message  format  specification has been developed as a
      result of examining CBMSs currently  in  use  in  commercial  and
      research  environments.    Three major design perspectives helped
      shape the message format specification.
      
      
        o  Viability.    The  message  format  specification   uses
           concepts  that  already work.  It has been designed with
           implementation concerns in mind.
      
        o  Compatibility.    The   message   format   specification
           contains concepts from existing CBMSs.  For this reason,
           many CBMS would already contain functions and components
           similar  to  those  required  to  implement  the message
           format specification.
      
      
      
      
                                      5</pre>
      <hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">                                                Executive Summary
      
        o  Extensibility.      This  message  format  specification
           defines a broad range of message content components  and
           requires  only an elementary subset of them.  This means
           that even a very simple CBMS can implement  the  message
           format  specification.  The message format specification
           contains a rich  set  of  optional  components  and,  in
           addition,  mechanisms  for  user  extensions  and future
           extensions to the message format specification.
      
      
           The  message  format  specification  defines  the  form  and
      meaning  of  message  contents  and their components as they pass
      from one CBMS to another through a message transfer system.   The
      message   format  specification  does  not  address  any  of  the
      following major issues.
      
      
        o  Functions or services provided to a user by a CBMS.
                For  example,  the  message  format   specification
                assumes  that  every CBMS allows a user to send and
                receive messages.  It does not specify any  of  the
                details of how a send function or a message-reading
                function  might  work or how it might appear to the
                user.  That is, the  message  format  specification
                neither limits nor mandates functions.
      
        o  Storage or format of message contents in a CBMS.
                The  message  format specification defines the form
                and contents of messages when they are  transferred
                between  systems.   A CBMS may or may not choose to
                use the same format for internal storage.
      
        o  Message transfer system protocols.
                The message format specification does  not  specify
                how  a  message  travels  between  CBMSs.   It does
                specify the form of its contents as it  leaves  and
                arrives,  assuming  only  that the message is moved
                transparently by the transfer system.
      
        o  Message envelopes.
                While a message is traveling between CBMSs,  it  is
                enclosed  in a message envelope.  Message envelopes
                contain all the information about a message that  a
                message transfer system needs to know.  The message
                format  specification does not define the format or
                content of a message envelope.
      
        o  How message originators and recipients are identified.
                The message format specification does not provide a
                representation scheme for the names or addresses of
                message originators  and  recipients  as  they  are
                known to a CBMS.

           A  computer-based message system (CBMS) allows communication
      between "entities" (usually people) using computers.    Computers
      serve  both  to mediate the actual communications between systems
      and to provide users with facilities for creating and reading the
      messages.
      
           CBMSs have  been  developing  for  over  ten  years.    More
      recently,  CBMSs  have  been one of the bases in industry for the
      introduction of office automation.  A growing number  of  organi-
      zations  use  either  their own or a commercially available CBMS.
      The design and complexity of these systems  vary  widely.    This
      message  format  specification  provides  a basis for interaction
      between different CBMSs by defining the format of messages passed
      between them.

           The method of presenting the material in this  specification
      is  to  combine  the technical specification with tutorial infor-
      mation.  This approach has been taken to place the  specification
      in context and improve its readability.

      are designed  for  ease  of  reference  and  should  be  read  in
      conjunction   with   the  body  of  the  report  for  a  complete
      understanding of the message format  presented  in  the  specifi-

           Section  2  presents  a simple model of operation of a CBMS.
      <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> discusses the components of messages and their  meaning
      (semantics),    including    discussions   of   the   recommended
      relationship between message components and CBMS user  functions.
      (See  Section  3.2.)    Section  4  presents  details of the form

           This  specification provides the capability of extending the

      and  vendor-defined  data  elements.    Any  vendor who uses this
      capability to provide services which are  essentially  equivalent
      to  those already designated as required, basic, or optional does

        o  Which fields complying CBMSs must be able to process.
      
        o  How  messages,  fields, and the data contained in fields
           are represented.

           In  order  to provide a framework for presenting the message
      format specification, this section describes a simple  functional
      model for a CBMS.  The model provides a high-level description of
      both  user  facilities  and  system architecture.  Discussions of
      messages, message originators, and message  recipients  serve  to
      further clarify the nature of a CBMS.
      
           A  CBMS permits the transfer of a message from an originator
      to a recipient.  "Originator" and "recipient" are used  in  their
      normal  English  senses.    (See <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>.)  A message (in its
      most abstract definition) is simply a unit of communication  from
      an  originator  to a recipient.  A CBMS offers several classes of
      functions to its users:
      
      
        o  Message Creation:  The  facilities  used  by  a  message
           originator  to  create messages and specify to whom they
           are to be sent.
      
        o  Message Transfer: The facilities used to convey  a  mes-
           sage to its recipient(s).
      
        o  Recipient  Processing:  The facilities used by a message
           recipient to process messages that have arrived.
      
      
           These classes of functions are presented in more  detail  in

           CBMSs  differ  from  other  office automation/communications
      systems in a number of ways.
      
      
        o  Unlike other types of  electronic  communications,  CBMS
           messages  are  sent  to  particular  individuals, not to
           stations or telephone sets.  If a recipient moves  to  a
           different  location, messages sent to that recipient are
           delivered to the recipient at the new location.
      
        o  Transmission of CBMS  messages  is  asynchronous.    The
           recipient's  system  need not be available when the mes-
           sage leaves the originator's  system.    That  is,  CBMS
           message transfer facilities are store-and-forward.
      
        o  CBMS  messages can contain a wide variety of data.  They
           are not constrained to any single kind of communication.
           CBMS messages are often simple  memoranda  but  are  not
           restricted to text.  A CBMS message may contain any kind
      
      
      
      
                                     10</pre>
      <hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">                                                        <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>
      
           of  data  that  an originator wishes to send to a recip-
           ient.  By contrast, Teletex  systems  and  communicating
           word  processors  handle  the  transfer  of  final  form
           documents; compatible communicating word processors  can
           exchange  documents in editable form; Telex and TWX deal
           in unformatted text.
      
        o  CBMSs offer message creation facilities as an  important
           part  of  the  system.  CBMSs assist users in the prepa-
           ration of messages by  having  text  editing  facilities
           available  and allowing users to include data stored on-
           line in messages.  Some CBMSs also  interface  to  other
           office  automation  facilities,  such  as formatters and
           spelling correctors.  This is not true of Telex, TWX, or
           similar services.
      
        o  CBMSs offer recipient processing facilities as an impor-
           tant part of the system.  This is not true of most other
           forms of electronic communications.  For example,  Telex
           and TWX systems simply print messages on paper when they
           are  received,  without  retaining a copy in the system.
           (Teletex systems are similar to Telex systems, but  some
           can  retain  a  copy  of the document in local storage.)
           Communicating  word  processors   might   notify   their
           operators  that  a  document  has  been  received and is
           stored on-line, but they offer  little  in  the  way  of
           other recipient processing facilities.  Most CBMSs offer
           at least the following recipient processing facilities:
      
      
             .  The  ability  to retain a copy of a message on-line
                after it has been read.
      
             .  The ability to examine or  delete  stored  messages
                individually.
      
             .  The ability to organize messages using some form of
                electronic "file folder."
      
             .  The  ability  to  determine  if a message is recent
                (has arrived since the last time the recipient used
                the CBMS) or unseen (has never been examined by the
                recipient).
      
             .  The  ability  to  summarize  stored  messages.    A
                summary   usually   includes  information  such  as
                whether the message is recent or  unseen,  when  it
                was  received,  its length, who it is from, and its
                subject.
      
             .  The ability to retrieve a stored message based upon

                one  or  more of its attributves (for example, when
                the message was received, whether  or  not  it  has
                been  seen  or deleted, and the values contained in
                its fields).
      
             .  A forward facility that allows users to include all
                or part of a message in a new outgoing message.
      
             .  A reply facility that allows users to  answer  mes-
                sages  without having to enter a new list of recip-
                ients.

           CBMS facilities for message creation, transfer,  and  recip-
      ient  processing  are  reflected  in  a  logical  model of a CBMS
      developed by IFIP Working Group 6.5.  (An  essentially  identical
      model  is  being  used  by  CCITT  Study  Group  VII, Question 5,
      regarding  Message  Handling  Systems [<a href="#ref-CCIT-82">CCIT-82</a>].)     The   model
      consists  of  a  Message  Transfer  System  and  a number of User
      Agents.  (See Figure 1.)

      FIG. 1.  LOGICAL MODEL OF A COMPUTER-BASED MESSAGE SYSTEM
      
      
           A User Agent (UA) is a functional entity that acts on behalf
      of a user, assisting with creating and  processing  messages  and
      communicating with the Message Transfer System.
      
           The Message Transfer System(MTS) is an entity that accepts a
      
      
      
      
                                     12</pre>
      <hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">                                                      <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>
      
      message from its originator's User Agent and ultimately passes it
      to  each  of  its  recipients' User Agents.  The Message Transfer
      System may perform routing and storage functions  (among  others)
      in order to accomplish its task.
      
           Transferring  a  message  from an originator's User Agent to
      the Message Transfer System is called Posting;  the  originator's
      User  Agent  and  Message  Transfer  System  engage  in a Posting
      Protocol in order to accomplish Posting.  Transferring a  message
      from  the  Message Transfer System to a recipient's User Agent is
      called Delivery; the recipient's User Agent and Message  Transfer
      System  engage  in  a  Delivery  Protocol  in order to accomplish
      Delivery.
      
           The point at which responsibility for a  message  is  trans-
      ferred  is called a Slot.  The Posting Slot is the point at which
      responsibility for a message passes  from  an  originator's  User
      Agent  to  the  Message Transfer System; the Delivery Slot is the
      point at which responsibility  for  a  message  passes  from  the
      Message Transfer System to a recipient's User Agent.
      
           The  model  divides  messages  into  two  parts, the message
      content and the message envelope.  The  message  content  is  the
      information  that the originator wishes to send to the recipient;
      this message format specification deals solely with  the  message
      content.    The  message envelope consists of all the information
      necessary for the Message Transfer System to  do  its  job;  this
      message   format  specification  does  not  specify  the  message
      envelope.  Some of the data appearing  on  the  message  envelope
      could  be  redundant with some data found in the message content.
      The Message Transfer  System  is  not  expected  to  examine  the
      message content unless it is told to do so by the originator's or
      recipient's User Agent.
      
           This  message format specification places no restrictions on
      the Message Transfer System itself, except that  it  be  able  to
      transfer  messages  between originating and receiving UAs without
      reading or altering the contents  of  messages  unless  otherwise
      instructed by the UAs.  In addition, this message format specifi-
      cation  does  not dictate the form or nature of any protocol used
      by the Message Transfer System.   Finally,  this  message  format
      specification does not specify the content or form of the message
      envelope.   That is, the message format specification defines the
      format for the contents of messages, not the manner in which they
      are transmitted.
      
           Many of today's commercially available CBMSs incorporate all
      of the facilities  represented  in  the  logical  model.    Their
      architectures  may  reflect  the economies that can be taken when
      implementing systems  that  are  self-contained.    For  example,
      stand-alone  systems  that  store  messages  in  a single central

      database  require  no  Message Transfer System; an implementation
      may integrate software for User Agent and Message Transfer System
      functions, doing away with Posting or Delivery Protocols.

           Subcommittee TC97/SC16 of the International Organization for
      Standardization  (ISO)  has  developed  a  reference  model   for
      describing communications between "open" systems [<a href="#ref-ISOD-82">ISOD-82</a>].  This
      model  is  known  as  the  ISO  Reference  Model for Open Systems
      Interconnection (OSI).  It divides communications protocols  into
      seven layers, ranging from physical interconnection at the lowest
      layer to data exchange by application programs at the top.
      
           This message format specification deals with data used by an
      application  within  a  system.    Thus, the message format being
      specified here is not a protocol.  Since it is not a protocol, it
      lies outside of the model for open systems interconnection.  User
      Agents are application layer entities (layer 7), however, and the
      protocols used by a message transfer system are above the session
      layer (layer 5).
      
      
      
      <span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3%20%20Messages%20and%20Fields"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>  Messages and Fields</span>
      
      
           A message is a unit of communication from an originator to a
      recipient.  A message consists of a series of  components  called
      fields.   Fields can be described according to their meaning in a
      message (semantics) and according to the format required for them
      in a message (syntax).
      
           Semantically, a field is just a component of a message;  the
      meanings  of particular fields are defined by this message format
      specification.  Syntactically, a field is a unit  of  data  whose
      form is defined by this message format specification.  Additional
      fields can be defined by users or vendors as long as they conform
      to  the  syntactic  and  semantic  rules that this message format
      specification defines for additional fields.
      
           (A note on terminology: A  message  consists  of  components
      called  fields.  The words "message" and "field" are used both in
      the informal sense  of  the  previous  sentence  and  in  a  more
      restricted  sense  as names of particular syntactic elements.  As
      syntactic  element  names,   Message   and   Field   are   always
      capitalized.)

           Some  CBMS functions are based on the contents of particular
      fields; other functions (such as the ability to read  a  message)
      may  have  little  to do with the fields themselves.  <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>
      discusses some of  the  specific  functions  that  a  CBMS  might
      provide  to  users  and  the  fields that must be used to support
      those functions.

           This message format specification refers to  message  origi-
      nators  and recipients.  These terms were defined functionally in
      Figure 1.  When the message format specification  refers  to  the
      identity  of  a  message  originator or recipient, it means "that
      information which uniquely identifies the message  originator  or
      recipient  within  the  domain of the given message system."  The
      syntax and semantics of message addressing  are  not  within  the
      scope of the message format specification.
      
           Originators  and  recipients can be people, roles, processes
      or groups.
      
           People.  People as originators and recipients  are  specific
      individuals.
      
           Roles.    Roles  identify  functions within organizations as
      opposed to the  specific  individuals  who  perform  them.    For
      example,  consider  a  newspaper  that  produces both morning and
      evening editions and therefore operates with more than one shift.
      Someone wishing to contact the city desk would send a message  to
      the  city  desk  role rather than trying to determine exactly who
      was assigned to the city desk at a specific time.    (Of  course,
      messages  can usually be sent to the individuals directly whether
      or not they are actually performing a role at the time.)
      
           Processes.  A process in a computer could serve as either an
      originator or a recipient for messages.  A computer system  might
      originate  a  message  to  notify a recipient about the status of
      some task.  For example, an archive utility  could  notify  users
      about  files  that  have been archived; a distributed file system
      could notify a user that a remote file has been  deposited  on  a
      local file system.  Messages could be used by computer systems to
      warn  about  some  impending  condition  or  even  to monitor the
      performance of the computer itself.  Some computer processes  may
      also  be  message  recipients,  taking  action based upon message
      contents.
      
           In addition, some CBMSs allow messages to be sent to groups.
      A group is a predefined list of  message  recipients.    Using  a

      group   name  as  a  recipient  permits  message  originators  to
      designate a potentially large number of recipients using a single
      recipient identifier.  This makes using the CBMS more  convenient
      and accurate.

           This  section discusses two major topics, message processing
      functions and message field meanings.  <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> describes  the
      six  functional  groups of message fields.  The functional groups
      are Origination, Dates, Recipients,  Cross-referencing,  Message-
      handling, and Message-contents.  They are explained more fully in
      <a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a>, along with detailed discussion of the semantics of
      all  the  fields in each functional group.  <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> describes
      message processing functions whose  operation  is  based  on  the
      meanings of particular message fields.

           The  definition  of  a  message  is  discussed  generally in
      Sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-2">2</a>.  Semantically valid messages must  contain  one
      From  field,  one  To field, and one Posted-Date field.  They may
      contain, in addition, any number of other  fields,  depending  on
      the  processing  and  functions  supplied  by  the originating or

      supplied by CBMSs.)

           Message  receiving programs are required to interpret fields
      according to the semantics described in  the  remainder  of  this
      section.  The message fields defined in this document are grouped
      into the following functional categories.
      
      
        o  Originator  fields  indicate who or what participated in
           the creation of the message and where replies should  be
           directed.  (See <a href="#section-3.1.3">Section 3.1.3</a>.)
      
        o  Date fields record when events take place, for a variety
           of events, such as message creation or expiration.  (See
           <a href="#section-3.1.5">Section 3.1.5</a>.)
      
        o  Recipient  fields  indicate  who  or what is intended to
           receive a message.  (See <a href="#section-3.1.4">Section 3.1.4</a>.)
      
        o  Cross-reference fields label a message or refer to other
           messages.  (See <a href="#section-3.1.6">Section 3.1.6</a>.)
      
        o  Message-handling fields record the  type  of  service  a

           message's  sender requested of a message transfer system
           or indicate how the message should  be  treated  by  its
           recipients.  (See <a href="#section-3.1.7">Section 3.1.7</a>.)
      
        o  Message-content   fields   either  contain  the  primary
           content of a message, or index the message, or summarize
           the message.  (See <a href="#section-3.1.8">Section 3.1.8</a>.)
      
        o  Extension fields provide mechanisms  for  extending  the
           message format specification.  (See <a href="#section-3.1.9">Section 3.1.9</a>.)

           For purposes of determining whether a CBMS complies with the
      semantic  requirements of this message format specification, mes-
      sage fields have been divided into three categories:
      
      
      REQUIRED  These fields must be present in all messages  and  must
                be  processed  by message receiving programs as defined
                by the message format specification.
      
      BASIC     These fields need not be present in  all  messages  but
                when  they do appear, they must be processed by message
                receiving programs as defined  by  the  message  format
                specification.
      
      OPTIONAL  These  fields  need  not be present in all messages and
                may be ignored by  message  receiving  programs.    The
                exact  meaning  of  "ignored"  is  not specified by the
                message format specification.   However,  a  CBMS  must
                recognize  the existence of an optional field (that is,
                optional fields should not cause errors) and  must  not
                process the field in a manner contrary to the semantics
                defined  for  that field by the message format specifi-
                cation.  It is left to the discretion of a  recipient's
                CBMS  what  action is to be taken when an instance of a
                locally unimplemented optional field is detected.
      
      
           (Syntactic compliance is defined in <a href="#section-4.1.2">Section 4.1.2</a>.)

           A message originator may be  a  person,  role,  or  process.
      Originator fields identify a message's author, who is responsible
      for   the   message,   who   or  what  sent  it,  and  where  any
      replies should be directed.  (See <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>.)

      From                     (REQUIRED)
      
                This  field  contains the identity of the originator(s)
                taking formal responsibility for  this  message.    The
                contents  of  the  From field is to be used for replies
                when no Reply-to field appears in a message.
      
      Reply-To                 (BASIC)
      
                This field identifies any recipients of replies to  the
                message.
      
      Author                   (OPTIONAL)
      
                This  field  identifies the individual(s) who wrote the
                primary contents of the message.   Use  of  the  Author
                field  is  discouraged  when the contents of the Author
                field and the From field would be completely redundant.
      
      Sender                   (OPTIONAL)
      
                This field identifies the agent who sent  the  message.
                It is used either when the sender is not the originator
                responsible  for the message or to indicate who among a
                group  of  originators  responsible  for  the   message
                actually   sent  it.    Use  of  the  Sender  field  is
                discouraged when the contents of the Sender  field  and
                From  field  would be completely redundant.  The sender
                field may specify  only  one  originator  identity  and
                appear only once in a message.

           Message  recipients  may  be  people,  roles,  processes, or
      groups.  (See <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>).  Recipient  fields  identify  who  or
      what is to receive the message.
      
      To                       (REQUIRED)
      
                This  field  identifies  the  primary  recipients  of a
                message.
      
      Bcc                      (OPTIONAL)
      
                This  field  identifies  additional  recipients  of   a
                message  (a  "blind carbon copies" list).  The contents
                of this field are not to be included in copies  of  the
                message  sent  to the primary and secondary recipients.

      Cc                       (BASIC)
      
                This field identifies secondary recipients of a message
                (a "carbon copies" list).
      
      Circulate-Next           (OPTIONAL)
      
                This field is used in conjunction with the Circulate-To
                field.    (See  Section  3.2.6.1.)    It identifies all
                recipients in a circulation list who have not  received
                the message.
      
      Circulate-To             (OPTIONAL)
      
                This   field  identifies  recipients  of  a  circulated
                message.   (See  Section  3.2.6.1.)    It  is  used  in
                conjunction with the Circulate-Next field.

           Date  fields  for two kinds of uses are provided.  Dates can
      be associated with some event in the history  of  a  message  and
      dates  can  delimit  the span of time during which the message is
      meaningful (its life span).
      
      Posted-Date              (REQUIRED)
      
                This field contains the  posting  date,  which  is  the
                point  in  time  when  the  message  passes through the
                posting slot into a message transfer system.  Only  one
                Posted-Date field is permitted in a message.
      
      Date                     (OPTIONAL)
      
                This   field   contains   a  date  that  the  message's
                originator wishes to associate with  a  message.    The
                Date field is to the Posted-Date field as the date on a
                letter is to the postmark added by the post office.
      
      End-Date                 (OPTIONAL)
      
                This  field  contains the date on which a message loses
                effect.  (See also <a href="#section-3.2.5">Section 3.2.5</a>.)
      
      Received-Date            (OPTIONAL)
      
                This field is also called Delivery date.    This  field
                may  be  added  to a message by the recipient's message
                receiving program.  It indicates when the message  left

                This  field  contains the date on which a message takes
                effect.  (See also <a href="#section-3.2.5">Section 3.2.5</a>.)
      
      Warning-Date             (OPTIONAL)
      
                This field is used either alone or in conjunction  with
                an  End-Date  field.    It  contains one or more dates.
                These dates could  be  used  by  a  message  processing
                program  as  warnings of an impending end-date or other
                event.  (See also <a href="#section-3.2.5">Section 3.2.5</a>.)

           Cross-reference fields can be used to identify a message and
      to provide cross-references to  other  messages.    (See  <a href="#section-3.2.4">Section
      3.2.4</a>.)
      
      In-Reply-To              (OPTIONAL)
      
                This  field designates previous correspondence to which
                this message is a reply.  The usual  contents  of  this
                field  would be the contents of the Message-ID field of
                the message(s) being replied to.
      
      Message-ID               (OPTIONAL)
      
                This field contains a unique identifier for a  message.
                This  identifier is intended for machine generation and
                processing.   Further  definition  appears  in  <a href="#section-3.2.4.1">Section</a>
                <a href="#section-3.2.4.1">3.2.4.1</a>.    Only one Message-ID field is permitted in a
                message.
      
      Obsoletes                (OPTIONAL)
      
                This field identifies one or more  messages  that  this
                one replaces.
      
      Originator-Serial-Number (OPTIONAL)
      
                This field contains one or more serial numbers assigned
                by  the  message's  originator.  Messages with multiple
                recipients  should  have  the   same   value   in   the
                Originator-Serial-Number field.

      References               (OPTIONAL)
      
                This  field  identifies  other correspondence that this
                message  references.    If  the  other   correspondence
                contains  a  Message-ID  field,  the  contents  of  the
                References field must be the message identifier.

           Message-handling fields describe aspects of how a message is
      to be handled or categorized.
      
      Precedence               (OPTIONAL)
      
                This  field  indicates  the  precedence  at  which  the
                message  was posted.  Ordinarily, message precedence or
                priority is a service request  to  a  message  transfer
                system.    A  message  originator, however, can include
                precedence information in a message.   One  example  of
                precedence  categories  are  those  used  by  the  U.S.
                Military: "ROUTINE,"  "PRIORITY,"  "IMMEDIATE,"  "FLASH
                OVERRIDE,"  and "EMERGENCY COMMAND PRECEDENCE."
      
      Message-Class            (OPTIONAL)
      
                This  field  indicates  the  purpose of a message.  For
                example, it might contain values  indicating  that  the
                                                             1
                message is a memorandum or a data-base entry.
      
      Reissue-Type             (OPTIONAL)
      
                This   field   is  used  in  conjunction  with  message
                encapsulating  (see  Section  3.2.2)  to  differentiate
                between messages being assigned or redistributed.
      
      Received-From            (OPTIONAL)
      
                This  field  contains  a  record  of  a  message's path
                through   a   message    transfer    system.        The
                recipient's  message receiving program could store here
                any information about the  transfer  that  it  obtained
                from a message transfer system.

         The message format specification is not intended to be used as
      a  specification  for  exchanging  data-base  records.  Messages,
      however, sometimes contain data from or for a database.

           A  CBMS  provides three basic classes of functions: creating
      messages, transmitting messages to  their  recipient,  and  post-
      receipt  processing.    Although the message format specification
      does not define the number or nature of user functions in  CBMSs,
      the  meanings  for  the  fields  clearly  assume certain kinds of
      functions.  For example, fields specifying recipients of  replies
      to messages assume some kind of reply function; fields specifying
      message life span assume some kind of date processing functions.
      
           This  section  provides  more  detail on the processing that
      might be done by these kinds of functions, discussing the message
      fields that would be used and how  they  would  be  used.    (See
      summary in Table 1.)

           Messages  can  be  created  either  by reissuing an existing
      message to a new recipient (see <a href="#section-3.2.2">Section 3.2.2</a>) or by  creating  a
      new  message.    The  process of message creation might mean that
      some fields of a new message are filled in from the  contents  of
      some  other  message.  Reply functions (<a href="#section-3.2.3">Section 3.2.3</a>) provide an
      example of this.

           Different  individuals could be involved in different phases
      of originating a message: creating it, taking responsibility  for
      it,  and  explicitly  interacting  with  a CBMS to send it to its
      recipient.  One or more individuals may create  a  message  (that
      is,  write, but not necessarily enter it into the CBMS); they are
      said to be the message's authors, identified by the Author field.
      One or more individuals may take responsibility for its  contents
      and  the  decision  to  post  it; they are identified by the From
      field.  One individual explicitly posts  a  given  message;  this
      person  is  called the message's sender (identified by the Sender
      field).
      
           The sender and author(s) are often, but not always,  respon-
      sible  for the message.  A common case in which the sender is not
      responsible for the message is when a secretary enters and  posts
      messages  for someone else.  An example of a situation in which a
      message's author is not responsible for  the  message  itself  is
      when  an  administrative assistant prepares a report that is sent
      under a manager's signature.
      
           The use of the Cc field is  identical  to  current  business
      practice.  This field contains the formal secondary recipients of
      the message.
      
           Messages  containing  Bcc  fields  are  treated specially by
      CBMSs.  The contents of this field are not included in copies  of
      the  message sent to the recipients other than the originator who
      are not included in the Bcc field itself.  Some  systems  include
      the  contents  of  the  Bcc  field only in the originator's copy;
      others include all or part of the Bcc field in the copies sent to
      the recipients indicated in the Bcc field.    This  specification
      does not indicate exactly how the Bcc field is to be treated.
      
      
      <span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.2%20%20Message%20reissuing%20and%20forwarding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.2" name="section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>  Message reissuing and forwarding</span>
      
      
           Reissuing and forwarding both serve the general user goal of
      passing  a  message on to a new set of recipients.  Forwarding is
      the term used for an informal mechanism, which CBMSs implement by
      copying some or all of the original message into the contents  of
      a  field  in  the  new message.  Reissuing is the term used for a
      formal mechanism to ensure that the message being passed on never
      loses its integrity as a previously  sent  message.    CBMSs  use
      reissuing  to implement several different functions, depending on
      the purposes being served:
      
      
        o  Redistribution.  Making others aware of the complete and
           unaltered contents of the message.
      
      
      
      
      
                                     25</pre>
      <hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">                                                    <a href="#section-3.2.2">Section 3.2.2</a>
      
        o  Assignment.  Delegating the responsibility for a message
           to somebody else.
      
      
      These purposes are exemplified in Figure 2.
      
           When  a  CBMS examines a forwarded message, it cannot always
      distinguish  the  old  message  from  what  was  added  when  the
      forwarding  took  place.   In addition, the forwarded information
      might no longer have the form of a  message.    This  is  usually
      because  the format of the message has been changed (for example,
      to pure unformatted text).  (See Figure 2 for an example of how a
      CBMS might forward a message.)  In contrast, a  reissued  message
      can  always  be  separated  from  its enclosing message and never
      loses its identity as a correctly formed message.
      
           This  specification  provides  the  Reissue-Type  field  for
      supporting  reissuing.  Forwarding, since it is an informal means
      of  serving  the  purpose  of  passing  on  information,  has  no
      supporting fields in the specification.
      
           This  specification  provides  for  reissuing of messages by
      encapsulating.  This method embeds the  entire  original  message
      inside  a  new  message.  Encapsulating adds structure around the
      
             2
      message .  This allows any part of it to be easily extracted.
      
           This  procedure for passing on previously sent messages is a
      matter of organizational policy  and  has  authentication  as  an
      associated  issue.   Each organization must decide if the CBMS it
      acquires should support reissuing or simply supply forwarding.

           Redistribution is a CBMS function for sending  the  original
      contents  of a message intact and unchanged to new recipients.  A
      redistributed message is identical to the original  message  with
      the  exception  of  added  information  about the reissuing.  For
      reissuing with this purpose, the Reissue-Type field contains  the
      ASCII  string  "Redistribution."    The original message has been
      included directly in a new message.  (See Figure 2.)
      
      
      _______________
      
        2
         A message can contain another message, and  that  message  can
      contain another message, and so on to any depth of encapsulating.
      This can occur by reissuing a message repeatedly.

           Assignment is the process of designating responsibility.  In
      some  organizations, formal message traffic is distributed to one
      or more parts of the organization (called offices)  where  it  is
      directed  to  the  appropriate  individuals  or other offices for
      final disposition.  Assignment is done  by  reissuing  a  message
      with   the   Reissue-Type   field  containing  the  ASCII  string
      "Assigned."  A  message  which  contains  this  field  is  to  be
      interpreted as meaning that the addressees in the "To" field have
      had  the  reissued message assigned to them for some action.  Any
      addressee in the "Cc" field has  had  the  message  assigned  for
      information.    The "From" field records who assigned the message
      and  the  "Posted-Date"  field  records  when  the  message   was
      assigned.
      
      
      <span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.3%20%20Reply%20generation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.3" name="section-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>  Reply generation</span>
      
      
           Reply  generation  involves creating a new message in direct
      reply to some other message by drawing on the contents of  fields
      in  the  other  message  to fill fields in the new message.  Many
      CBMSs provide reply facilities that determine the intended recip-
      ients of a reply.
      
           A Reply-To field is defined by this message format  specifi-
      cation.    When  a  message  contains  a Reply-To field, the CBMS
      should send replies to the recipients designated in the  Reply-To
      field  instead of to the recipients designated in the From field.
      This statement applies to original messages only, not to reissued
      messages.     The   message   format   specification   makes   no
      recommendations concerning replies to reissued messages.
      
           Reply-To has several possible applications:
      
      
        o  The  individual(s) responsible for the message might not
           have regular access to a  CBMS  and  would  indicate  an
           alternate recipient, for example, a secretary.
      
        o  The people responsible for receiving responses might not
           be  the  people  who  were  responsible for creating the
           message.
      
        o  Discussion and conference groups could use this  feature
           to  ensure  correct  distribution  of  any submission by
           having the conference group  itself  designated  in  the
           Reply-To field.

           When  the  message  does  not  contain a Reply-To field, the
      recipient should reply to the originators enumerated in the  From
      field.   The sender and authors should not be added automatically
      to the list of those receiving the reply.
      
           Replies could also be sent to the other  recipients  of  the
      original  message.    Vendors might offer additional reply facil-
      ities, depending on their view of users' organizational  require-
      ments.

           A  CBMS  message  may  include  designator(s) which identify
      other message(s).  The designators are used to refer  to  related
      messages so that all information in a chain of correspondence can
      be  determined  by  a CBMS user.  The designator used to identify
      and cross-reference messages can take either of two forms, unique
      identifiers or serial numbers.
      
      
      <span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.4.1%20%20Unique%20identifiers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.4.1" name="section-3.2.4.1">3.2.4.1</a>  Unique identifiers</span>
      
           Unique identifiers are machine-generated  and  are  intended
      primarily  for  processing  by  computers.    While they could be
      examined by a human user, unique identifiers are not  necessarily
      useful or convenient for people.
      
           Unique  identifiers  occur  in  several  contexts.  They are
      often used  to  identify  the  contents  of  idual  messages
      unambiguously.    When unique identifiers are used this way, they
      are called message identifiers.  Different versions of a  message
      receive  new message identifiers; an example of this is reissuing
      a message with comments.
      
           When a CBMS generates a message identifier, it must be  able
      to  guarantee  that  it  is unique, both within the domain of the
      individual CBMS and globally, across all connected CBMSs.   CBMSs
      could  generate  globally unique identifiers in several ways, all
      of which require prior  agreement  on  behalf  of  the  connected
      CBMSs.    One  method  is  to assign each connected CBMS a unique
      code.  A CBMS then generates unique identifiers by using its code
      as a prefix to some other value  that  it  can  guarantee  to  be
      unique  within its domain.  (This second value could be a counter
      or a timestamp/user-id combination.)
      
           A CBMS can provide functions for tracing  chains  of  corre-
      spondence  by  using  unique  identifiers.    The  message format
      specification defines fields for which  a  CBMS  provides  unique
      identifiers   as   values.    They  are  Message-ID,  References,
      Obsoletes, and In-Reply-To.  (See <a href="#section-3.1.6">Section 3.1.6</a>.)

           Serial  numbers  are  for  users to maintain a personal num-
      bering system for messages.  The numbers  are  composed  of  both
      letters  and  digits so that users could maintain several sets of
      sequences concurrently (for example, A1, A2, A3...  and  B1,  B2,
      B3...).
      
           Serial  numbers  are  assigned  at  a  defined  point in the
      history of a message.  Serial numbers are not unique identifiers;
      they differ from unique identifiers in that they are  not  neces-
      sarily generated or processed by a CBMS.  They are designed to be
      entered and read by CBMS users.  They can be as simple or complex
      as  the user requires.  Serial numbers are intended to be used to
      designate messages about a specific topic, or  messages  a  given
      user  has  sent.    Serial numbers are intended to be a permanent
      part of the message, just as unique identifiers are.
      
           A CBMS can provide functions  allowing  originators  to  add
      serial  numbers  to  messages.    Originator-Serial-Number is the
      field provided for an originator to add  a  serial  number  to  a
      message before sending it.

           Messages  have life spans, usually delimited by the creation
      date and the time when the last copy of the message is destroyed.
      Messages could be meaningless before a certain time or irrelevant
      after a certain time.   For  example,  a  reminder  to  attend  a
      meeting  on  5  June  loses  most  of  its  value on the sixth; a
      reminder to attend that same meeting may be of little  use  on  5
      May (although not for the same reason).
      
           A CBMS can define a message's life span explicitly using the
      Start-Date  and  End-Date  fields.   A third field, Warning-Date,
      when used in conjunction with the End-Date, may be used to signal
      the approach of the End-Date.  Warning-Date may also stand  alone
      and be used by a periodic warning (alarm clock) mechanism.
      
           A  CBMS  could  use  these fields to help users manage their
      message stores.  For example, a message whose start date has  not
      yet  passed  could  be bypassed by a retrieval command unless the
      user requested such messages explicitly.  A CBMS  could  use  the
      end  date  to  help  with  message  store  housekeeping either by
      archiving or deleting the expired messages  automatically  or  by
      asking the user for some action to be taken on them.  The warning
      date  could  be  used  to  remind  the  user  automatically of an
      impending end date, such as a meeting reminder.

           Recipients  have  a  wide variety of needs for examining and
      processing a message,  ranging  from  automatic  output  on  some
      specified  device  to  the execution of a program embedded in the
      message  itself.    Because  many  of  these  needs  are   highly
      specialized,  and  support  for them not widely implemented, this
      message format specification does not constrain the requests  for
      processing that may be included in a message.
      
           The  message  format  specification  does provide two fields
      that permit an originator to request circulation list  processing
      from the recipient.  These fields are Circulate-To and Circulate-
      Next.
      
      
      <span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.6.1%20%20Message%20circulation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.6.1" name="section-3.2.6.1">3.2.6.1</a>  Message circulation</span>
      
           Message  circulation  involves serial distribution of a mes-
      sage to its recipients, based on a distribution list that is part
      of the message.  The message is  delivered  first  to  the  first
      recipient  on  the distribution list.  This recipient, or someone
      the recipient delegates, sends  the  message  on  to  the  second
      recipient  on  the list, perhaps after commenting on or adding to
      the  message.    This  continues  until  all  recipients  on  the
      distribution list have received the message.
      
           This  message  format  specification  provides two fields to
      support message circulation.  The Circulate-To field contains the
      complete distribution list, indicating the  full  set  of  recip-
      ients,  and  the  Circulate-Next field indicates which recipients
      have not seen the message.   See  Figure  3  for  an  example  of
      message circulation using these two fields.

           Most  message  fields may occur more than once in a message;
      the  exceptions  are  the  Posted-Date,  Sender,  and  Message-ID
      fields, which may occur once, at most.  What this means is that a
      received  message  may  contain  any  number  of  instances  of a
      particular field (such as the "To" field).  If a message contains
      more than one instance of a particular field, that field  "occurs
      multiply"  and  that  message  has "multiple occurrences" of that
      field.
      
           A particular instance of a message field is  not  superseded
      by later instances of the same field.  The To field is an example
      of this.

           A  message  originator wishes to circulate a message to
           recipients A, B  and  C. The  originator  includes  the
           following fields in the message:
      
                     To:              A
                     Circulate-To:    A, B, C
                     Circulate-Next:  B, C
      
      
           When  recipient  A  or  someone  A delegates causes the
           message to be further circulated, the message  is  sent
           to  the  first address in the Circulate-Next field, and
           that name is removed from that field:
      
                     To:              B
                     Circulate-To:    A, B, C
                     Circulate-Next:  C
      
      
           B now sends the message on to its final recipient:
      
                     To:              C
                     Circulate-To:    A, B, C

           Multiple occurrences of a field are not  necessarily  equiv-
      alent  to  a single field containing the concatenated contents of
      the several instances of the given field.  For example, with  the
      Text field, concatenating the contents of several instances might
      lose  important  distinctions  between  the  contents.   A single
      message could be used to send three different documents, each one
      in a different Text field.  However, putting the three  documents
      into  a  single  Text  field would make it much more difficult to
      extract any individual document.
      
           Encapsulated  messages  are  exceptions  to   the   multiple
      occurrences  rule.   For example, the To field in an encapsulated
      message is not a multiple occurrence  of  the  To  field  in  the
      enclosing message.
      
           The fields found in a single message may occur in any order.
      The  order  in  which they occur does not necessarily reflect the

           This section begins with an introduction to the concepts and

           This  specification  defines syntactic requirements for mes-
      sages when they are  passed  from  one  CBMS  to  another.    The
      specification is designed to meet the following goals.
      
      
        o  Provide a concise, flexible representation scheme.
      
        o  Simplify message parsing.
      
        o  Support non-textual components in messages (for example,
                                         3
           facsimile, graphics, or speech ).

           Messages   have   two  classes  of  components,  fields  and
      messages.  A field corresponds to one of the semantic  components
      defined  in  this  message  format  specification.   A message is
      simply another message.
      
           The type of a field in a message determines both its meaning
      and the form for its contents.  (See <a href="#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a>.)
      
           Fields in a  message  are  composed  of  syntactic  elements
      called  data  elements.    A  Message  data  element  is  used to
      represent messages; a Field data element  is  used  to  represent
      fields.    (The  term  "field"  is  simply  a semantic construct,
      distinct  from  "Field  Data  Element,"  which  is  a   syntactic

         While  this message format specification is not intended to be
      used as a basis for the interchange of all facsimile information,
      it does  recognize  that  CBMS  messages  may  contain  facsimile
      components.

      construct.)    Many  of the fields defined in this message format
      specification are restricted to containing only one kind of  data
      element.  (See <a href="#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a>.)
      
           Each  field defined in this message format specification has
      been assigned  a  unique  numeric  identifier  that  is  used  in
      conjunction  with  the  Field data element.  Separate identifiers
      are provided for vendor-defined  fields  and  for  extending  the
      identifier  encoding  space.    A  list of fields and identifiers
      appears in <a href="#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a> and in <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.
      
           Throughout the  message  format  specification,  fields  are
      referred  to  by  label name rather than by their numeric identi-
      fiers.  Field labels are names like "Sender," "Warning-Date,"  or
      "Circulate-To."    The  field labels chosen for the specification
      are names  that  are  in  common  use  in  current  CBMSs.    The
      specification  does  not require a CBMS to use these field labels
      in displaying fields to the user.

           For the purpose of determining compliance  with  the  syntax
      defined in this specification, data elements are divided into two
      groups:
      
      
      BASIC     All   message  receiving  systems  must  process  these
                syntactic elements, interpreting their values according
                to the message format specification.
      
      OPTIONAL  Message  receiving  systems  need  not  process   these
                syntactic elements in order to be in compliance.
      
      
           In   addition,   complying   CBMSs  must  meet  requirements
      regarding their ability to process the  components  found  inside
      data  elements.    These  requirements  are  discussed in <a href="#section-4.2.2">Section
      4.2.2</a>.
      
           This message format specification  classifies  data  element
      types  as  either  primitives  or  constructors.   Primitive data
      elements,  such  as  ASCII-String,  are  basic  building  blocks.
      Constructor  data  elements, such as Message or Sequence, contain
      one or  more  primitive  or  constructor  data  elements.    Some
      constructors, such as Sequence, may be composed of any other data
      element.    Some,  such as Message, may contain only certain data
      elements. Two data elements, Extension and Vendor-Defined, may be
      classified as either primitives or constructors, depending on how
      they  are  used  to  extend  this  specification.    The  general
      syntactic form for data elements is discussed in <a href="#section-4.3.1">section 4.3.1</a>.

           A   primitive   data   element  contains  a  basic  item  of
      information; it is not composed  of  other  data  elements.    In
      current  CBMSs,  the most commonly used primitive data element is
                                                 4
      ASCII-String, a series of ASCII characters.  Other primitive data
      elements are Integer,  2's  complement  integers;  Bit-String,  a
      series of bits; and Boolean, either True or False.
      
           One primitive data element, End-Of-Constructor, is used only
      as  a structural element within constructor data elements and has
      no meaning by itself.  End-of-Constructor is used to  provide  an
      end  marker  for  constructor  data  elements that do not have an
      explicit length; any other use is not valid syntactically.

           The Data  Element  Contents  of  constructor  data  elements
      contain  one  or  more data elements.  The most general form of a
      constructor is a Sequence or a Set, since both Sequences and Sets
      may contain any data element.  Other constructors are specialized
      forms of sequences.
      
           A Message data element is a constructor.    It  may  contain
      only  Field  data  elements,  other  Message  data  elements,  or
      encrypted or data compressed forms of these elements.    A  Field
      data  element  can  contain  any data element.  It also indicates
      which specific field is being represented.  The contents of  some
      fields  are  restricted to a single type of data element, such as
      ASCII-String or Date.

           Any data element may have associated  with  it  a  Property-
      List, which contains properties such as a Printing-Name or one or
      more  Comments.    Comment  A mechanism to support vendor-defined

         An  ASCII-String  is  not limited to ASCII characters however.
      The  ASCII  code  table  can  be  extended  through  standardized
      techniques as described in FIPS Pub 35, Code Extension Techniques

           Printing-Names  are  used  to  provide  labels  that  can be
      displayed  along  with  their  respective  data  elements.    For
      example, a message originator may use a Printing-Name property to
      request that the To field of a message be labeled "Distribution:"
      when it is printed by its recipients.

           The  Comment  property  is  used  to  allow  comments  to be

      could add the comment "This looks good" to the Text field without
      either altering the body itself  or  adding  a  separate  comment
      field.

           This  section  provides  an  overview  of  the  notation and
      terminology  used  to  represent  the  syntactic  elements  (data
      elements) defined in this message format specification.
      
           All  data  elements consist of a series of components.  Each
      of the components is composed of a series of 8-bit groups  called
      octets.    In  this document, the bits are numbered starting from
      the low-order bit.  That is, the low-order (or least significant)
      bit is called "bit 0" and the high-order  (or  most  significant)
      bit is called "bit 7."
      
           Five different components may appear in a data element.
      
      
        o  Identifier  octet  (identifying  particular type of data
           element)
      
      
      
                                     37</pre>
      <hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">                                                      <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>
      
        o  Length  Code  (specifying  number  of octets that appear
           following it in a data element)
      
        o  Qualifier (supplying additional identifying information)
      
        o  Property-List component (a  Property-List  data  element
           containing Property data elements)
      
        o  Data  Element  Contents  (containing  actual data of the
           data element)
      
      
      These components always appear in this order.  Not all components
      are present in all data elements, but  the  components  that  are
      present maintain this relative order.
      
      
      <span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.1%20%20Identifier%20Octets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1" name="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>  Identifier Octets</span>
      
      
           The  identifier  octet  is  a numeric code containing infor-
      mation that identifies a data element.  It is  always  the  first
      component  in  a  data  element.  The Identifier octet contains a
      one-bit flag, indicating whether or not the data element contains
      a Property-List, and a  7-bit  unique  identifier  for  the  data
      element.  The value of the data element identifier also indicates
      whether the data element has a Qualifier.
      
           The  most significant bit (Bit 7) of the identifier octet is
      set to 1  if  there  are  properties  associated  with  the  data
      element;  it  is  set  to  0  if  there  are  none.   This bit is
      independent of the remaining seven bits in the identifier  octet,
      which  are  called  the  identifier, and provide unique identifi-
      cation  for  data  elements.    The  associated  properties   are
      specified in a Property-List component.
      
           The  second  most  significant bit (Bit 6) of the identifier
      octet  (the  most  significant  bit  of  the  identifier  itself)
      signifies  whether  or  not the data element has a Qualifier.  If
      the bit is set to 1, then the data element has a Qualifier; if it
      is a 0, the data element does not have a Qualifier.    The  seven
      bits of the identifier uniquely identify the data element.
      
           Table  2  shows  the  settings of the high-order bits of the
      identifier  octet  and  their  associated  meaning.    Figure   4
      demonstrates the bit-level structure of the identifier octet.  In
      this figure, bit 7 is indiciated with P to show its special use.

           The Length Code and the Qualifier are both usually one octet
      in  length.    They use an encoding scheme that permits extending
      the component to the size necessary to represent  the  length  of
      the data element or the value of the Qualifier component.
      
           The  most  significant  bit  of the Length Code or Qualifier
      components determines whether it is  one  or  several  octets  in
      length.  When the most significant bit is 0, the component is one

      octet  in  length.  When the most significant bit is 1, the other
      seven bits of the first octet encode the number of octets in  the
      rest of the component.  The actual value begins in the next octet
      and is interpreted as an unsigned integer.
      
           A  single  octet  is  sufficient  for  most  Length Code and
      Qualifier components.  For those cases where  the  value  of  the
      Length  Code  or  the  Qualifier  must be greater than 127, extra
      octets can be added, up to a maximum of 127  octets.    Figure  5
      shows  the encoding scheme, as well as an example of a value less
      than 127 and one greater than 127.

           In  order  to comply with this message format specification,
      CBMSs must be able to determine the value of any length  code  or
      qualifier  that  is  expressed  in  three  octets  or less.  (The

      <span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2%20%20-1%29."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>  -1).  </span>  This message format specification places no limitation
      on the value of a length code or qualifier generated  by  a  CBMS
      (except  for  the  absolute  limitation inherent in the represen-
      tation scheme).  However, the use of length codes and  qualifiers
                                                                  32
      with  larger  values  (particularly  values  in  excess of 2  -1)
      should be avoided unless it is known that  the  receiving  system
      can handle them.
      
           Both  Length  Codes and Qualifiers have a special convention
      for dealing with special situations.  Length  Codes  can  specify
      that  a  data  element  has indeterminate length; a Qualifier can
      specify that a data element is  implementation  defined.    These
      cases are explained further in the next two sections.
      
      
      <span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.2.1%20%20Length%20Codes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.2.1" name="section-4.2.2.1">4.2.2.1</a>  Length Codes</span>
      
           The length code component immediately follows the identifier
      octet.    It  is  present in every data element.  The Length Code
      indicates the number of octets following it  in  a  data  element
      (that  is,  excluding  the  identifier  octet and the length code
      itself).  Length Codes appear in one  of  three  formats:  short,
      long, and indefinite.
      
           A short Length Code is one octet long.  Its most significant
      bit  (Bit  7) is set to 0 and its value is in the range 0 through
      127.
      
           A long Length Code is at least two octets long.   The  first
      octet  always has its most significant bit (Bit 7) set to 1.  The
      other seven bits of this  octet  contain  the  number  of  octets
      making  up  the rest of the Length Code, and these octets contain
      
        1016
      (2     - 1) (that is, 127 octets to represent the value).
      
           An  indefinite  Length  Code  is  one  octet long.  Its most
      significant bit (Bit 7) is set to 1 and its other bits are all 0.
      (See Figure 6.)  An indefinite Length Code  may  appear  only  as
      part  of  a  constructor  data  element;  it  may  not occur in a

      primitive  data  element .    A  constructor data element with an
      indefinite length code has an End-Of-Constructor data element  as
      the  last data element in its Data Element Contents.  (The length
      of such a constructor data element is unrestricted,  although  it
      must  contain at least one data element -- the End-of-Constructor
      that terminates it -- in its Data Element Contents.)

           If present,the Qualifier component immediately  follows  the
      code  component.   It is used to provide information essential to
      the interpretation of the data element contents  that  is  beyond
      that  encoded  in  the  identifier  octet  or  length  code.  For
      example, the identifier octet could contain the code for a field,
      and the Qualifier component would specify what kind of field.
      
           The Qualifier component appears in only a few data elements.

      In the Bit-String data element, it indicates the number of unused
      bits  in  the  final  octet of the Data Element Contents.  In the
      Field and Property data elements, it  indicates  which  field  or
      property  the  data  element  represents.   In the Compressed and

      encryption algorithm has been used.  In the Message data element,
      it indicates the type of message.
      
           The  length  of  the  Qualifier  component  depends  on  the
      encoding of the Qualifier.  (See Figure 7.)  A short Qualifier is
      one octet long.  Its most significant bit is 0 and its  value  is
      in  the  range  0  through 127.  A long Qualifier is at least two
      octets in length.  The most significant bit is always 1  and  the
      other  7  bits  indicate the number of octets in the value of the
      Qualifier.

      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      
      
           This message format specification allows implementations  to
      define  their  own values for Qualifiers.  A vendor-defined Qual-
      ifier is any long Qualifier in which the first octet in the value
      is 0.    The  value  used  to  identify  this  Qualifier  is  not
      guaranteed  to  be  unique  and  the  same  value  may be used by
      different implementations to define different Qualifiers.

           A  Property  is  an attribute being associated with, but not
      essential  to  the  interpretation  of,  a  data  element.    The
      properties currently defined by this message format specification
      are  Printing-Name  and  Comment.  A Property-List component of a
      data element is represented by a Property-List data element  that
      in turn contains Property data elements.
      
           A data element contains at most one Property-List.  The most
      significant  bit  in  the  identifier  octet  of the data element
      indicates whether a Property-List is present.

           The Data Element Contents component of a data element is the
      actual data or information represented by a data element.    (The
      other  components  provide  the information necessary to identify
      and interpret the Data Element Contents.)
      
           In a primitive data element, the Data Element Contents is  a
      series  of  octets  interpreted according to the identifier octet
      and any qualifier.
      
           In a constructor data element, the Data Element Contents  is
      a  series  of data elements.  When the Length Code component of a
      constructor data element is "indefinite," the last  data  element
      in the constructor's Data Element Contents is End-of-Constructor.
      
           The  length  of the Data Element Contents (in octets) is the
      difference between the value of the Length Code and  the  sum  of
      the following:
      
      
        o  the  length  of  the Qualifier component (depends on the
           data element)
      
        o  the length of the Property-List component.

           This  section  presents  the  general syntactic form for all
      data elements defined by this message  format  specification  and
      the detailed syntax for each data element.  The data elements are
      presented  by  syntactic  class: primitive data elements (<a href="#section-4.3.1.1">Section
      4.3.1.1</a>), constructors (<a href="#section-4.3.1.2">Section 4.3.1.2</a>), and data elements which
      can be either (<a href="#section-4.3.1.3">Section 4.3.1.3</a>).
      
           For convenience, the following terminology is used  in  this
      section.
      
      
                  Term            Meaning

              Element         any Data Element
      
      
           The  syntax  of  each  Element is presented in graphic form.
      The following conventions apply in the diagrams.  A single  octet
      is represented as follows.
      
      
          +--------+
          |        |
          +--------+

           Each  Element  has  up to five components:  an Identifier, a
      Length Code, a Qualifier, a Property-List, and the  Data  Element
      Contents.
      
               In the diagrams, the contents of the identifier octet is

      shown  as  a "P" followed by an identifier represented in binary.
      (See Figure 4.)
      
      A length code is always represented in the following manner:
      
      
          +---//---+
          |Lxxxxxxx|
          +---//---+
      
      
      A qualifier is always represented in the following manner:
      
      
          +---//---+
          |Qxxxxxxx|
          +---//---+
      
      
      A Property-List (if  present)  always  immediately  precedes  any
      occurrence of Data Element Contents.
      
      The  Data  Element  Contents  appears  in  diagrams as one of the
      following:
      
      
        o  "element(s)", which may be any data element(s)
      
        o  "anything," which is undefined and  may  be  any  combi-
           nation of bits
      
        o  a specific data element
      
        o  the  interpretation to be applied to the bits within the
           octets that constitute the element  (such  as  ASCII  or
           Integer)
      
      
           Two  data  elements have been reserved for special purposes.
      The Extension data  element  is  provided  to  allow  for  future
      expansion of the possible data elements.  The Vendor-Defined data
      element  allows  CBMS  vendors to define their own data elements.
      Vendor-Defined data elements are not  guaranteed  to  be  unique,
      since  two  implementations  could define different data elements
      using the same identifier.  Vendor-Defined data  elements  should
      be used and interpreted by prior agreement.
      
           In  the  following  sections, each element is presented with
      its name, compliance  classification  (BASIC  or  OPTIONAL),  its
      identifier   (both   in   hexadecimal  and  in  octal),  a  brief
      description of its use, and a graphic representation.  Each  data
      element description has the following form.

                   This  data  element  contains  a  series  of   ASCII
                characters [<a href="#ref-NatB-80">NatB-80</a>], each character right-justified in
                one  octet.    For  7-bit  ASCII  characters,  the most
                significant bit of each octet must be 0.
      
           Note: The ASCII code  table  can  be  extended  through
                standardized  techniques [<a href="#ref-NatB-75">NatB-75</a>]  to  introduce addi-

                This  data  element contains a series of bits.  It uses
                the Qualifier data  element  component  to  record  the
                number  of  bits  of  padding (as an eight bit unsigned
                integer) needed to fill the final  octet  of  the  Data
                Element  Contents  to  an  even  octet boundary.  These
                padding bits have no meaning and occur in the low order
                bits of the final octet.   The  valid  values  for  the
                Qualifier  component  are  0  through 7.  The number of
                bits in the Data Element Contents  is  calculated  from
                the following formula.

           The Data Element Contents of a particular field in a message
      must  contain  at  least  one  data  element.   The types of data
      elements that can appear in the Data Element Contents of a  field
      are restricted according to what kind of field it is.  <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>
      (the  master  reference  appendix  for fields) defines which data
      elements are valid as the Contents for each of the fields.
      
           Some fields have  a  Data  Element  Contents  that  contains
      "originators"  or  "recipients."   No data element represents the
      identities of originators or recipients (because that encoding is
      not within the  scope  of  this  message  format  specification.)
      These  descriptions  simply  list  "originators" or "recipients",
      implying no restrictions on how the identifiers  for  originators
      or recipients are represented.

                            SUMMARY OF APPENDIXES
      
      
      
      
      Appendix A  Defines  the  fields  in  the message format specifi-
                  cation.  This alphabetical appendix is for  reference
                  use   by   implementors.      It   contains  semantic
                  definitions of fields from  Section  3.1.    It  also
                  defines  Field  Identifier values and specifies which
                  data elements are valid as the Contents for  each  of
                  the fields.
      
      Appendix B  Defines  the  data  elements  in  the  message format
                  specification.  This alphabetically ordered  appendix
                  is  for  reference  use  by implementors.  It consol-
                  idates information from <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.
      
      Appendix C  Provides a reference table listing the data  elements
                  in numerical order by their identifier octets.
      
      Appendix D  Provides a reference table summarizing the components
                  of messages according to whether they are required or
                  optional for CBMSs implementing the specification.
      
      Appendix E  Provides  a  reference  table  organizing the message
                  components according to the functional class  of  the
                  components.
      
      Appendix F  Provides   an  overview  of  the  syntactic  elements
                  defined by this message format specification.
      
      Appendix G  Summarizes syntactic elements  according  to  whether
                  they are required or optional for a CBMS implementing
                  the message format specification.
      
      Appendix H  Examples  of  each syntactic element displaying their
                  syntax and describing their associated semantics.

                  FIELDS -- IMPLEMENTORS' MASTER REFERENCE
      
      
      
      
           This  appendix  defines  all  of  the  fields in the message
      format specification for  reference  use  by  implementors.    It
      contains  semantics  definitions  of fields from <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.  It
      also defines Field Identifier values and which data elements  are
      valid  as  the  Contents  for  each  of  the  fields.   The field
      definitions appear alphabetically.
      
           Each field in the list has the following form:

                Ordinarily, message precedence or priority is a service
                request  to  a  message  transfer  system.    A message
                originator, however, can include precedence information
                in a message.  This field indicates the  precedence  at
                which  the  message  was  posted.    One  example  of a

                This data element contains a series of bits.   It  uses
                the  Qualifier  data  element  component  to record the
                number  of  bits  of  padding  (as  an  8-bit  unsigned
                integer)  needed  to  fill  the final octet of the Data
                Element Contents to an  even  octet  boundary.    These
                padding bits have no meaning and occur in the low order
                bits  of  the  final  octet.   The valid values for the
                Qualifier component are 0 through 7.    The  number  of
                bits  in  the  Data Element Contents is calculated from
                the following formula.

                                 APPENDIX F
                       SUMMARY OF DATA ELEMENT SYNTAX
      
      
      
      
           This  appendix summarizes data element syntax by diagramming
      the components of data elements.  Detailed presentation  of  data
      element syntax appears in <a href="#section-4.3.1">Section 4.3.1</a>.
      
           In  these  diagrams,  required  components of a data element
      appear as follows.  (The double border signifies "required.")
      
      
                +========+        +===//===+
                |        |        |        |
                +========+        +===//===+
                always one        one or more
                octet long        octets long
      
      
           Optional components of  data  elements  are  represented  as
      follows.  (The single border signifies "not required.")
      
      
                +--------+        +---//---+
                |        |        |        |
                +--------+        +---//---+
                always one        one or more
                octet long        octets long
      
      
           The  first  octet in a data element is the identifier octet.
      In diagrams of data elements, all eight bits  of  the  identifier
      octet  are  always  shown.  Bits with fixed values show the fixed
      values as 1s and 0s.  Bits with variable values are shown as  x's
      and y's.
      
           The  first  bit  in  an  identifier octet is the P-bit.  Its
      value indicates whether a data element contains a property  list.
      (A  P-bit  value of 1 indicates the presence of a property list.)
      The remaining seven bits contain the rest of the identifier.
      
           Other octets in  a  data  element  belong  to  one  of  four
      classes:    Length  Code, Qualifier, Property-List, and Contents.
      In diagrams of syntax the data  element  components  are  labeled
      according to their class.

                +========+===//===+---//---+---//---+---//---+
      
      
      The  value  of the Length component is the total number of octets
      following the length code octet in the data element.

               SUMMARY OF DATA ELEMENTS BY COMPLIANCE CATEGORY
      
      
      
      
           Compliance  categories  for syntactic elements are basic and
      optional.  Every CBMS is required to recognize and process  basic
      elements.    A  CBMS is not required to process optional elements
      although many are strongly recommended by the semantics.
      
           This appendix  summarizes  data  elements  by  listing  them
      according to their compliance category.

                                  EXAMPLES
      
      
      
      
           This  appendix presents at least one example for each of the
      data elements defined in this message format specification.    In
      these examples, identifier octets are represented in binary form.
      All  other  numbers  are presented in hexadecimal.  ASCII strings
      are shown as characters rather  than  their  numerical  represen-
      tation.    Although  this  message  format specification does not
      define the syntax of names and addresses, message originators and
      recipients are identified by their names.  This  does  not  imply
      anything  about  how naming and addressing can or should be done;
      it is simply a convenient way to identify message originators and
      recipients in these examples.

      extend this specification.  These data  elements  can  be  either
      primitives or constructors, depending on the extension.
           Extension  data  element  containing  a  length  code  and 3
      octets.  The octet immediately following the  length  code  iden-
      tifies it as Extension Data Element 7.  The Data Element Contents
      is  the final two octets.  The interpretation of the Data Element
      Contents would be defined in an extension or  successor  to  this
      message  format  specification.    [Note: this is an example. Any
      actual extension data element 7 (if it were ever used)  would  be
      completely different from anything done here.]:

           This  example is provided to illustrate the encoding of non-
      FIPS format messages in the FIPS format.  It is the intent of the
      standard to deal with computer based message  systems  which  are
      primarily  intended for person-to-person use.  This example deals
      with the definition and use of vendor-defined  fields  to  extend
      the  use  of  the  standard to station-to-station messaging.  The
      context is a military message using the military standard  JANAP-
