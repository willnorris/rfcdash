Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   A management system contains:  several (potentially many) nodes, each
   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to
   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a
   management protocol, used to convey management information between
   the agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are
   carried out under an administrative framework which defines
   authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy policies.

   Management stations execute management applications which monitor and
   control managed elements.  Managed elements are devices such as
   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and
   controlled via access to their management information.

   Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
   residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined
   in MIB modules.  These modules are written using an adapted subset of
   OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-1" title="(December">1</a>].  It is the purpose of
   this document, the Structure of Management Information (SMI), to
   define that adapted subset, and to assign a set of associated
   administrative values.

   The SMI is divided into three parts:  module definitions, object
   definitions, and, notification definitions.

(1)  Module definitions are used when describing information modules.
     An ASN.1 macro, MODULE-IDENTITY, is used to concisely convey the
     semantics of an information module.

(2)  Object definitions are used when describing managed objects.  An
     ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-TYPE, is used to concisely convey the syntax
     and semantics of a managed object.

(3)  Notification definitions are used when describing unsolicited
     transmissions of management information.  An ASN.1 macro,
     NOTIFICATION-TYPE, is used to concisely convey the syntax and
     semantics of a notification.

   For the purpose of exposition, the original Internet-standard Network
   Management Framework, as described in RFCs 1155 (STD 16), 1157 (STD
   15), and 1212 (STD 16), is termed the SNMP version 1 framework
   (SNMPv1).  The current framework is termed the SNMP version 2
   framework (SNMPv2).

   An "information module" is an ASN.1 module defining information
   relating to network management.

   The SMI describes how to use a subset of ASN.1 to define an
   information module.  Further, additional restrictions are placed on
   "standard" information modules.  It is strongly recommended that
   "enterprise-specific" information modules also adhere to these
   restrictions.

   Typically, there are three kinds of information modules:

(1)  MIB modules, which contain definitions of inter-related managed
     objects, make use of the OBJECT-TYPE and NOTIFICATION-TYPE macros;

(2)  compliance statements for MIB modules, which make use of the
     MODULE-COMPLIANCE and OBJECT-GROUP macros [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>]; and,

(3)  capability statements for agent implementations which make use of
     the AGENT-CAPABILITIES macros [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].

   This classification scheme does not imply a rigid taxonomy.  For
   example, a "standard" information module will normally include
   definitions of managed objects and a compliance statement.
   Similarly, an "enterprise-specific" information module might include
   definitions of managed objects and a capability statement.  Of
   course, a "standard" information module may not contain capability
   statements.

   The constructs of ASN.1 allowed in SNMPv2 information modules
   include: the IMPORTS clause, value definitions for OBJECT
   IDENTIFIERs, type definitions for SEQUENCEs (with restrictions),
   ASN.1 type assignments of the restricted ASN.1 types allowed in
   SNMPv2, and instances of ASN.1 macros defined in this document and in
   other documents [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>, <a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>] of the SNMPv2 framework.  Additional ASN.1
   macros may not be defined in SNMPv2 information modules.

   The names of all standard information modules must be unique (but
   different versions of the same information module should have the
   same name).  Developers of enterprise information modules are
   encouraged to choose names for their information modules that will
   have a low probability of colliding with standard or other enterprise

   information modules. An information module may not use the ASN.1
   construct of placing an object identifier value between the module
   name and the "DEFINITIONS" keyword.

   All information modules start with exactly one invocation of the
   MODULE-IDENTITY macro, which provides contact information as well as
   revision history to distinguish between versions of the same
   information module.  This invocation must appear immediately after
   any IMPORTs statements.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Macro%20Invocation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Macro Invocation</span>

   Within an information module, each macro invocation appears as:

     &lt;descriptor&gt; &lt;macro&gt; &lt;clauses&gt; ::= &lt;value&gt;

   where &lt;descriptor&gt; corresponds to an ASN.1 identifier, &lt;macro&gt; names
   the macro being invoked, and &lt;clauses&gt; and &lt;value&gt; depend on the
   definition of the macro.  (Note that this definition of a descriptor
   applies to all macros defined in this memo and in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].)

   For the purposes of this specification, an ASN.1 identifier consists
   of one or more letters or digits, and its initial character must be a
   lower-case letter.  (Note that hyphens are not allowed by this
   specification, even though hyphen is allowed by [<a href="#ref-1" title="(December">1</a>].  This
   restriction enables arithmetic expressions in languages which use the
   minus sign to reference these descriptors without ambiguity.)

   For all descriptors appearing in an information module, the
   descriptor shall be unique and mnemonic, and shall not exceed 64
   characters in length.  (However, descriptors longer than 32
   characters are not recommended.)  This promotes a common language for
   humans to use when discussing the information module and also
   facilitates simple table mappings for user-interfaces.

   The set of descriptors defined in all "standard" information modules
   shall be unique.

   Finally, by convention, if the descriptor refers to an object with a
   SYNTAX clause value of either Counter32 or Counter64, then the
   descriptor used for the object should denote plurality.

   Some clauses in a macro invocation may take a textual value (e.g.,
   the DESCRIPTION clause).  Note that, in order to conform to the ASN.1
   syntax, the entire value of these clauses must be enclosed in double
   quotation marks, and therefore cannot itself contain double quotation

   To reference an external object, the IMPORTS statement must be used
   to identify both the descriptor and the module in which the
   descriptor is defined, where the module is identified by its ASN.1
   module name.

   Note that when symbols from "enterprise-specific" information modules
   are referenced  (e.g., a descriptor), there is the possibility of
   collision.  As such, if different objects with the same descriptor
   are IMPORTed, then this ambiguity is resolved by prefixing the
   descriptor with the name of the information module and a dot ("."),
   i.e.,

     "module.descriptor"

   (All descriptors must be unique within any information module.)

   Of course, this notation can be used even when there is no collision
   when IMPORTing symbols.

   Finally, the IMPORTS statement may not be used to import an ASN.1
   named type which corresponds to either the SEQUENCE or SEQUENCE OF
   type.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Exporting%20Symbols"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Exporting Symbols</span>

   The ASN.1 EXPORTS statement is not allowed in SNMPv2 information
   modules.  All items defined in an information module are
   automatically exported.

   Comments in ASN.1 commence with a pair of adjacent hyphens and end
   with the next pair of adjacent hyphens or at the end of the line,
   whichever occurs first.

   An OBJECT IDENTIFIER value is an ordered list of non-negative
   numbers.  For the SNMPv2 framework, each number in the list is
   referred to as a sub-identifier, there are at most 128 sub-
   identifiers in a value, and each sub-identifier has a maximum value
   of 2^32-1 (4294967295 decimal).  All OBJECT IDENTIFIER values have at
   least two sub-identifiers, where the value of the first sub-
   identifier is one of the following well-known names:

   The root of the subtree administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) for the Internet is:

     internet       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso 3 6 1 }

   That is, the Internet subtree of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs starts with the
   prefix:

     1.3.6.1.

   Several branches underneath this subtree are used for network
   management:

     mgmt           OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 2 }
     experimental   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 3 }
     private        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 4 }
     enterprises    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { private 1 }

   However, the SMI does not prohibit the definition of objects in other
   portions of the object tree.

   The mgmt(2) subtree is used to identify "standard" objects.

   The experimental(3) subtree is used to identify objects being
   designed by working groups of the IETF.  If an information module
   produced by a working group becomes a "standard" information module,
   then at the very beginning of its entry onto the Internet standards
   track, the objects are moved under the mgmt(2) subtree.

   The private(4) subtree is used to identify objects defined
   unilaterally.  The enterprises(1) subtree beneath private is used,
   among other things, to permit providers of networking subsystems to
   register models of their products.

   The MODULE-IDENTITY macro is used to provide contact and revision
   history for each information module.  It must appear exactly once in
   every information module.  It should be noted that the expansion of
   the MODULE-IDENTITY macro is something which conceptually happens
   during implementation and not during run-time.

   Note that reference in an IMPORTS clause or in clauses of SNMPv2
   macros to an information module is NOT through the use of the
   'descriptor' of a MODULE-IDENTITY macro; rather, an information
   module is referenced through specifying its module name.

   The OBJECT-IDENTITY macro is used to define information about an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER assignment.  All administrative OBJECT IDENTIFIER
   assignments which define a type identification value (see
   AutonomousType, a textual convention defined in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>]) should be
   defined via the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro.  It should be noted that the
   expansion of the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro is something which
   conceptually happens during implementation and not during run-time.

   The STATUS clause, which must be present, indicates whether this
   definition is current or historic.

   The values "current", and "obsolete" are self-explanatory.  The
   "deprecated" value indicates that the definition is obsolete, but
   that an implementor may wish to support it to foster interoperability
   with older implementations.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1902.html">RFC 1902</a>                     SMI for SNMPv2                 January 1996</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Mapping%20of%20the%20OBJECT-TYPE%20macro"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Mapping of the OBJECT-TYPE macro</span>

   The OBJECT-TYPE macro is used to define a type of managed object.  It
   should be noted that the expansion of the OBJECT-TYPE macro is
   something which conceptually happens during implementation and not
   during run-time.

   For leaf objects which are not columnar objects (i.e., not contained
   within a conceptual table), instances of the object are identified by
   appending a sub-identifier of zero to the name of that object.
   Otherwise, the INDEX clause of the conceptual row object superior to
   a columnar object defines instance identification information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.%20%20Mapping%20of%20the%20SYNTAX%20clause"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Mapping of the SYNTAX clause</span>

   The SYNTAX clause, which must be present, defines the abstract data
   structure corresponding to that object.  The data structure must be
   one of the following: a base type, the BITS construct, or a textual
   convention.  (SEQUENCE OF and SEQUENCE are also possible for
   conceptual tables, see <a href="#section-7.1.12">section 7.1.12</a>).  The base types are those
   defined in the ObjectSyntax CHOICE.  A textual convention is a
   newly-defined type defined as a sub-type of a base type [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>].

   A extended subset of the full capabilities of ASN.1 sub-typing is
   allowed, as appropriate to the underingly ASN.1 type.  Any such
   restriction on size, range, enumerations or repertoire specified in
   this clause represents the maximal level of support which makes
   "protocol sense".  Restrictions on sub-typing are specified in detail
   in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> and <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a> of this memo.

   The semantics of ObjectSyntax are now described.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.1.%20%20Integer32%20and%20INTEGER"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.1" name="section-7.1.1">7.1.1</a>.  Integer32 and INTEGER</span>

   The Integer32 type represents integer-valued information between
   -2^31 and 2^31-1 inclusive (-2147483648 to 2147483647 decimal).  This
   type is indistinguishable from the INTEGER type.  Both the INTEGER
   and Integer32 types may be sub-typed to be more constrained than the
   Integer32 type.

   The INTEGER type may also be used to represent integer-valued
   information as named-number enumerations.  In this case, only those
   named-numbers so enumerated may be present as a value.  Note that
   although it is recommended that enumerated values start at 1 and be
   numbered contiguously, any valid value for Integer32 is allowed for
   an enumerated value and, further, enumerated values needn't be
   contiguously assigned.

   Finally, a label for a named-number enumeration must consist of one
   or more letters or digits (no hyphens), up to a maximum of 64
   characters, and the initial character must be a lower-case letter.
   (However, labels longer than 32 characters are not recommended.)

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.2.%20%20OCTET%20STRING"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.2" name="section-7.1.2">7.1.2</a>.  OCTET STRING</span>

   The OCTET STRING type represents arbitrary binary or textual data.
   Although there is no SMI-specified size limitation for this type, MIB
   designers should realize that there may be implementation and
   interoperability limitations for sizes in excess of 255 octets.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.3.%20%20OBJECT%20IDENTIFIER"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.3" name="section-7.1.3">7.1.3</a>.  OBJECT IDENTIFIER</span>

   The OBJECT IDENTIFIER type represents administratively assigned
   names.  Any instance of this type may have at most 128 sub-
   identifiers.  Further, each sub-identifier must not exceed the value
   2^32-1 (4294967295 decimal).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.4.%20%20The%20BITS%20construct"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.4" name="section-7.1.4">7.1.4</a>.  The BITS construct</span>

   The BITS construct represents an enumeration of named bits.  This
   collection is assigned non-negative, contiguous values, starting at
   zero.  Only those named-bits so enumerated may be present in a value.
   (Thus, enumerations must be assigned to consecutive bits; however,
   see <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> for refinements of an object with this syntax.)

   Although there is no SMI-specified limitation on the number of
   enumerations (and therefore on the length of a value), MIB designers
   should realize that there may be implementation and interoperability
   limitations for sizes in excess of 128 bits.

   Finally, a label for a named-number enumeration must consist of one
   or more letters or digits (no hyphens), up to a maximum of 64
   characters, and the initial character must be a lower-case letter.
   (However, labels longer than 32 characters are not recommended.)

   The IpAddress type represents a 32-bit internet address.  It is
   represented as an OCTET STRING of length 4, in network byte-order.

   Note that the IpAddress type is a tagged type for historical reasons.
   Network addresses should be represented using an invocation of the
   TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>].

   The Counter32 type represents a non-negative integer which
   monotonically increases until it reaches a maximum value of 2^32-1
   (4294967295 decimal), when it wraps around and starts increasing
   again from zero.

   Counters have no defined "initial" value, and thus, a single value of
   a Counter has (in general) no information content.  Discontinuities
   in the monotonically increasing value normally occur at re-
   initialization of the management system, and at other times as
   specified in the description of an object-type using this ASN.1 type.
   If such other times can occur, for example, the creation of an object
   instance at times other than re-initialization, then a corresponding
   object should be defined with a SYNTAX clause value of TimeStamp (a
   textual convention defined in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>]) indicating the time of the last
   discontinuity.

   The value of the MAX-ACCESS clause for objects with a SYNTAX clause
   value of Counter32 is either "read-only" or "accessible-for-notify".

   A DEFVAL clause is not allowed for objects with a SYNTAX clause value
   of Counter32.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.7.%20%20Gauge32"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.7" name="section-7.1.7">7.1.7</a>.  Gauge32</span>

   The Gauge32 type represents a non-negative integer, which may
   increase or decrease, but shall never exceed a maximum value.  The
   maximum value can not be greater than 2^32-1 (4294967295 decimal).
   The value of a Gauge has its maximum value whenever the information
   being modeled is greater or equal to that maximum value; if the
   information being modeled subsequently decreases below the maximum
   value, the Gauge also decreases.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.8.%20%20TimeTicks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.8" name="section-7.1.8">7.1.8</a>.  TimeTicks</span>

   The TimeTicks type represents a non-negative integer which represents
   the time, modulo 2^32 (4294967296 decimal), in hundredths of a second
   between two epochs.  When objects are defined which use this ASN.1
   type, the description of the object identifies both of the reference
   epochs.

   For example, [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>] defines the TimeStamp textual convention which is
   based on the TimeTicks type.  With a TimeStamp, the first reference
   epoch is defined as the time when sysUpTime [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>5</a>] was zero, and the
   second reference epoch is defined as the current value of sysUpTime.

   The TimeTicks type may not be sub-typed.

   The Opaque type is provided solely for backward-compatibility, and
   shall not be used for newly-defined object types.

   The Opaque type supports the capability to pass arbitrary ASN.1
   syntax.  A value is encoded using the ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules [<a href="#ref-4" title="(December">4</a>]
   into a string of octets.  This, in turn, is encoded as an OCTET
   STRING, in effect "double-wrapping" the original ASN.1 value.

   Note that a conforming implementation need only be able to accept and
   recognize opaquely-encoded data.  It need not be able to unwrap the
   data and then interpret its contents.

   A requirement on "standard" MIB modules is that no object may have a
   SYNTAX clause value of Opaque.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.10.%20%20Counter64"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.10" name="section-7.1.10">7.1.10</a>.  Counter64</span>

   The Counter64 type represents a non-negative integer which
   monotonically increases until it reaches a maximum value of 2^64-1
   (18446744073709551615 decimal), when it wraps around and starts
   increasing again from zero.

   Counters have no defined "initial" value, and thus, a single value of
   a Counter has (in general) no information content.  Discontinuities
   in the monotonically increasing value normally occur at re-
   initialization of the management system, and at other times as
   specified in the description of an object-type using this ASN.1 type.
   If such other times can occur, for example, the creation of an object
   instance at times other than re-initialization, then a corresponding
   object should be defined with a SYNTAX clause value of TimeStamp (a
   textual convention defined in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>]) indicating the time of the last
   discontinuity.

   The value of the MAX-ACCESS clause for objects with a SYNTAX clause
   value of Counter64 is either "read-only" or "accessible-for-notify".

   A requirement on "standard" MIB modules is that the Counter64 type
   may be used only if the information being modeled would wrap in less
   than one hour if the Counter32 type was used instead.

   A DEFVAL clause is not allowed for objects with a SYNTAX clause value
   of Counter64.

   The Unsigned32 type represents integer-valued information between 0
   and 2^32-1 inclusive (0 to 4294967295 decimal).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.12.%20%20Conceptual%20Tables"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.12" name="section-7.1.12">7.1.12</a>.  Conceptual Tables</span>

   Management operations apply exclusively to scalar objects.  However,
   it is sometimes convenient for developers of management applications
   to impose an imaginary, tabular structure on an ordered collection of
   objects within the MIB.  Each such conceptual table contains zero or
   more rows, and each row may contain one or more scalar objects,
   termed columnar objects.  This conceptualization is formalized by
   using the OBJECT-TYPE macro to define both an object which
   corresponds to a table and an object which corresponds to a row in
   that table.  A conceptual table has SYNTAX of the form:

     SEQUENCE OF &lt;EntryType&gt;

   where &lt;EntryType&gt; refers to the SEQUENCE type of its subordinate
   conceptual row.  A conceptual row has SYNTAX of the form:

     &lt;EntryType&gt;

   where &lt;EntryType&gt; is a SEQUENCE type defined as follows:

     &lt;EntryType&gt; ::= SEQUENCE { &lt;type1&gt;, ... , &lt;typeN&gt; }

   where there is one &lt;type&gt; for each subordinate object, and each
   &lt;type&gt; is of the form:

     &lt;descriptor&gt; &lt;syntax&gt;

   where &lt;descriptor&gt; is the descriptor naming a subordinate object, and
   &lt;syntax&gt; has the value of that subordinate object's SYNTAX clause,
   normally omitting the sub-typing information.  Further, these ASN.1
   types are always present (the DEFAULT and OPTIONAL clauses are
   disallowed in the SEQUENCE definition).  The MAX-ACCESS clause for
   conceptual tables and rows is "not-accessible".

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.12.1.%20%20Creation%20and%20Deletion%20of%20Conceptual%20Rows"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.12.1" name="section-7.1.12.1">7.1.12.1</a>.  Creation and Deletion of Conceptual Rows</span>

   For newly-defined conceptual rows which allow the creation of new
   object instances and/or the deletion of existing object instances,
   there should be one columnar object with a SYNTAX clause value of
   RowStatus (a textual convention defined in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>]) and a MAX-ACCESS
   clause value of read-create.  By convention, this is termed the
   status column for the conceptual row.

   The MAX-ACCESS clause, which must be present, defines whether it
   makes "protocol sense" to read, write and/or create an instance of
   the object, or to include its value in a notification.  This is the
   maximal level of access for the object.  (This maximal level of
   access is independent of any administrative authorization policy.)

   The value "read-write" indicates that read and write access make
   "protocol sense", but create does not.  The value "read-create"
   indicates that read, write and create access make "protocol sense".
   The value "not-accessible" indicates an auxiliary object (see <a href="#section-7.7">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-7.7">7.7</a>).  The value "accessible-for-notify" indicates an object which is
   accessible only via a notification (e.g., snmpTrapOID [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>5</a>]).

   These values are ordered, from least to greatest:  "not-accessible",
   "accessible-for-notify", "read-only", "read-write", "read-create".

   If any columnar object in a conceptual row has "read-create" as its
   maximal level of access, then no other columnar object of the same
   conceptual row may have a maximal access of "read-write".  (Note that
   "read-create" is a superset of "read-write".)

   The REFERENCE clause, which need not be present, contains a textual
   cross-reference to an object defined in some other information
   module.  This is useful when de-osifying a MIB module produced by
   some other organization.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.7.%20%20Mapping%20of%20the%20INDEX%20clause"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.7" name="section-7.7">7.7</a>.  Mapping of the INDEX clause</span>

   The INDEX clause, which must be present if that object corresponds to
   a conceptual row (unless an AUGMENTS clause is present instead), and
   must be absent otherwise, defines instance identification information
   for the columnar objects subordinate to that object.

   The instance identification information in an INDEX clause must
   specify object(s) such that value(s) of those object(s) will
   unambiguously distinguish a conceptual row.  The syntax of those
   objects indicate how to form the instance-identifier:

(1)  integer-valued:  a single sub-identifier taking the integer value
     (this works only for non-negative integers);

(2)  string-valued, fixed-length strings (or variable-length preceded by
     the IMPLIED keyword):  `n' sub-identifiers, where `n' is the length
     of the string (each octet of the string is encoded in a separate
     sub-identifier);

(3)  string-valued, variable-length strings (not preceded by the IMPLIED
     keyword):  `n+1' sub-identifiers, where `n' is the length of the
     string (the first sub-identifier is `n' itself, following this,
     each octet of the string is encoded in a separate sub-identifier);

(4)  object identifier-valued (when preceded by the IMPLIED keyword):
     `n' sub-identifiers, where `n' is the number of sub-identifiers in
     the value (each sub-identifier of the value is copied into a
     separate sub-identifier);

(5)  object identifier-valued (when not preceded by the IMPLIED
     keyword):  `n+1' sub-identifiers, where `n' is the number of sub-
     identifiers in the value (the first sub-identifier is `n' itself,
     following this, each sub-identifier in the value is copied);

(6)  IpAddress-valued:  4 sub-identifiers, in the familiar a.b.c.d
     notation.

   Note that the IMPLIED keyword can only be present for an object
   having a variable-length syntax (e.g., variable-length strings or
   object identifier-valued objects), Further, the IMPLIED keyword can

   only be associated with the last object in the INDEX clause.
   Finally, the IMPLIED keyword may not be used on a variable-length
   string object if that string might have a value of zero-length.

   Instances identified by use of integer-valued objects should be
   numbered starting from one (i.e., not from zero).  The use of zero as
   a value for an integer-valued index object should be avoided, except
   in special cases.

   Objects which are both specified in the INDEX clause of a conceptual
   row and also columnar objects of the same conceptual row are termed
   auxiliary objects.  The MAX-ACCESS clause for auxiliary objects is
   "not-accessible", except in the following circumstances:

(1)  within a MIB module originally written to conform to the SNMPv1
     framework, and later converted to conform to the SNMPv2 framework;
     or

(2)  a conceptual row must contain at least one columnar object which is
     not an auxiliary object.  In the event that all of a conceptual
     row's columnar objects are also specified in its INDEX clause, then
     one of them must be accessible, i.e., have a MAX-ACCESS clause of
     "read-only". (Note that this situation does not arise for a
     conceptual row allowing create access, since such a row will have a
     status column which will not be an auxiliary object.)

   Note that objects specified in a conceptual row's INDEX clause need
   not be columnar objects of that conceptual row.  In this situation,
   the DESCRIPTION clause of the conceptual row must include a textual
   explanation of how the objects which are included in the INDEX clause
   but not columnar objects of that conceptual row, are used in uniquely
   identifying instances of the conceptual row's columnar objects.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.8.%20%20Mapping%20of%20the%20AUGMENTS%20clause"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.8" name="section-7.8">7.8</a>.  Mapping of the AUGMENTS clause</span>

   The AUGMENTS clause, which must not be present unless the object
   corresponds to a conceptual row, is an alternative to the INDEX
   clause.  Every object corresponding to a conceptual row has either an
   INDEX clause or an AUGMENTS clause.

   If an object corresponding to a conceptual row has an INDEX clause,
   that row is termed a base conceptual row; alternatively, if the
   object has an AUGMENTS clause, the row is said to be a conceptual row
   augmentation, where the AUGMENTS clause names the object
   corresponding to the base conceptual row which is augmented by this
   conceptual row augmentation.  (Thus, a conceptual row augmentation
   cannot itself be augmented.) Instances of subordinate columnar
   objects of a conceptual row augmentation are identified according to

   the INDEX clause of the base conceptual row corresponding to the
   object named in the AUGMENTS clause.  Further, instances of
   subordinate columnar objects of a conceptual row augmentation exist
   according to the same semantics as instances of subordinate columnar
   objects of the base conceptual row being augmented.  As such, note
   that creation of a base conceptual row implies the correspondent
   creation of any conceptual row augmentations.

   For example, a MIB designer might wish to define additional columns
   in an "enterprise-specific" MIB which logically extend a conceptual
   row in a "standard" MIB.  The "standard" MIB definition of the
   conceptual row would include the INDEX clause and the "enterprise-
   specific" MIB would contain the definition of a conceptual row using
   the AUGMENTS clause.  On the other hand, it would be incorrect to use
   the AUGMENTS clause for the relationship between <a href="rfc1573.html">RFC 1573</a>'s ifTable
   and the many media-specific MIBs which extend it for specific media
   (e.g., the dot3Table in <a href="rfc1650.html">RFC 1650</a>), since not all interfaces are of
   the same media.

   Note that a base conceptual row may be augmented by multiple
   conceptual row augmentations.

   When defining instance identification information for a conceptual
   table:

(1)  If there is a one-to-one correspondence between the conceptual rows
     of this table and an existing table, then the AUGMENTS clause
     should be used.

(2)  Otherwise, if there is a sparse relationship between the conceptual
     rows of this table and an existing table, then an INDEX clause
     should be used which is identical to that in the existing table.
     For example, the relationship between <a href="rfc1573.html">RFC 1573</a>'s ifTable and a
     media-specific MIB which extends the ifTable for a specific media
     (e.g., the dot3Table in <a href="rfc1650.html">RFC 1650</a>), is a sparse relationship.

(3)  Otherwise, if no existing objects have the required syntax and
     semantics, then auxiliary objects should be defined within the
     conceptual row for the new table, and those objects should be used
     within the INDEX clause for the conceptual row.

   The DEFVAL clause, which need not be present, defines an acceptable
   default value which may be used at the discretion of a SNMPv2 entity
   acting in an agent role when an object instance is created.



<span class="grey">SNMPv2 Working Group        Standards Track                    [Page 24]</span></pre>

   During conceptual row creation, if an instance of a columnar object
   is not present as one of the operands in the correspondent management
   protocol set operation, then the value of the DEFVAL clause, if
   present, indicates an acceptable default value that a SNMPv2 entity
   acting in an agent role might use.

   The value of the DEFVAL clause must, of course, correspond to the
   SYNTAX clause for the object.  If the value is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
   then it must be expressed as a single ASN.1 identifier, and not as a
   collection of sub-identifiers.

   Note that if an operand to the management protocol set operation is
   an instance of a read-only object, then the error `notWritable' [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>6</a>]
   will be returned.  As such, the DEFVAL clause can be used to provide
   an acceptable default value that a SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent
   role might use.

   By way of example, consider the following possible DEFVAL clauses:

     ObjectSyntax       DEFVAL clause
     ----------------   ------------
     Integer32          DEFVAL { 1 }
                        -- same for Gauge32, TimeTicks, Unsigned32
     INTEGER            DEFVAL { valid } -- enumerated value
     OCTET STRING       DEFVAL { 'ffffffffffff'H }
     OBJECT IDENTIFIER  DEFVAL { sysDescr }
     BITS               DEFVAL { { primary, secondary } }
                        -- enumerated values that are set
     IpAddress          DEFVAL { 'c0210415'H } -- 192.33.4.21

   Object types with SYNTAX of Counter32 and Counter64 may not have
   DEFVAL clauses, since they do not have defined initial values.
   However, it is recommended that they be initialized to zero.

   The value of an invocation of the OBJECT-TYPE macro is the name of
   the object, which is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively
   assigned name.

   When an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is assigned to an object:

(1)  If the object corresponds to a conceptual table, then only a single
     assignment, that for a conceptual row, is present immediately
     beneath that object.  The administratively assigned name for the
     conceptual row object is derived by appending a sub-identifier of
     "1" to the administratively assigned name for the conceptual table.

(2)  If the object corresponds to a conceptual row, then at least one
     assignment, one for each column in the conceptual row, is present
     beneath that object.  The administratively assigned name for each
     column is derived by appending a unique, positive sub-identifier to
     the administratively assigned name for the conceptual row.

(3)  Otherwise, no other OBJECT IDENTIFIERs which are subordinate to the
     object may be assigned.

   Note that the final sub-identifier of any administratively assigned
   name for an object shall be positive.  A zero-valued  final sub-
   identifier is reserved for future use.

   Further note that although conceptual tables and rows are given
   administratively assigned names, these conceptual objects may not be
   manipulated in aggregate form by the management protocol.

   The NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro is used to define the information

   The OBJECTS clause, which need not be present, defines the ordered

   The STATUS clause, which must be present, indicates whether this
   definition is current or historic.

   The values "current", and "obsolete" are self-explanatory.  The
   "deprecated" value indicates that the definition is obsolete, but
   that an implementor may wish to support the notification to foster
   interoperability with older implementations.

   the objects mentioned in the OBJECTS clause should be contained
   within notifications of this type.

   As experience is gained with a published information module, it may
   be desirable to revise that information module.

   To begin, the invocation of the MODULE-IDENTITY macro should be
   updated to include information about the revision.  Usually, this
   consists of updating the LAST-UPDATED clause and adding a pair of
   REVISION and DESCRIPTION clauses.  However, other existing clauses in
   the invocation may be updated.

   There has been an increasing amount of work recently on taking MIBs
   defined by other organizations (e.g., the IEEE) and de-osifying them
   for use with the Internet-standard network management framework.  The
   steps to achieve this are straight-forward, though tedious.  Of
   course, it is helpful to already be experienced in writing MIB
   modules for use with the Internet-standard network management
   framework.

   The first step is to construct a skeletal MIB module, as shown
   earlier in <a href="#section-5.8">Section 5.8</a>.  The next step is to categorize the objects
   into groups.  Optional objects are not permitted.  Thus, when a MIB
   module is created, optional objects must be placed in a additional
   groups, which, if implemented, all objects in the group must be
   implemented.  For the first pass, it is wisest to simply ignore any
   optional objects in the original MIB:  experience shows it is better
   to define a core MIB module first, containing only essential objects;
   later, if experience demands, other objects can be added.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.1.%20%20Managed%20Object%20Mapping"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.1" name="section-11.1">11.1</a>.  Managed Object Mapping</span>

   Next for each managed object class, determine whether there can exist
   multiple instances of that managed object class.  If not, then for
   each of its attributes, use the OBJECT-TYPE macro to make an
   equivalent definition.

   Otherwise, if multiple instances of the managed object class can
   exist, then define a conceptual table having conceptual rows each
   containing a columnar object for each of the managed object class's
   attributes.  If the managed object class is contained within the
   containment tree of another managed object class, then the assignment
   of an object is normally required for each of the "distinguished
   attributes" of the containing managed object class.  If they do not
   already exist within the MIB module, then they can be added via the
   definition of additional columnar objects in the conceptual row
   corresponding to the contained managed object class.

   In defining a conceptual row, it is useful to consider the
   optimization of network management operations which will act upon its
   columnar objects.  In particular, it is wisest to avoid defining more
   columnar objects within a conceptual row, than can fit in a single
   PDU.  As a rule of thumb, a conceptual row should contain no more
   than approximately 20 objects.  Similarly, or as a way to abide by
   the "20 object guideline", columnar objects should be grouped into
   tables according to the expected grouping of network management
   operations upon them.  As such, the content of conceptual rows should
   reflect typical access scenarios, e.g., they should be organized

   along functional lines such as one row for statistics and another row
   for parameters, or along usage lines such as commonly-needed objects
   versus rarely-needed objects.

   On the other hand, the definition of conceptual rows where the number
   of columnar objects used as indexes outnumbers the number used to
   hold information, should also be avoided.  In particular, the
   splitting of a managed object class's attributes into many conceptual
   tables should not be used as a way to obtain the same degree of
   flexibility/complexity as is often found in MIBs with a myriad of
   optionals.

   When mapping to the SYNTAX clause of the OBJECT-TYPE macro:

(1)  An object with BOOLEAN syntax becomes a TruthValue [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>].

(2)  An object with INTEGER syntax becomes an Integer32.

(3)  An object with ENUMERATED syntax becomes an INTEGER with
     enumerations, taking any of the values given which can be
     represented with an Integer32.

(4)  An object with BIT STRING syntax having enumerations becomes a BITS
     construct.

(5)  An object with BIT STRING syntax but no enumerations becomes an
     OCTET STRING.

(6)  An object with a character string syntax becomes either an OCTET
     STRING, or a DisplayString [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>], depending on the repertoire of the
     character string.

(7)  A non-tabular object with a complex syntax, such as REAL or
     EXTERNAL, must be decomposed, usually into an OCTET STRING (if
     sensible).  As a rule, any object with a complicated syntax should
     be avoided.

(8)  Tabular objects must be decomposed into rows of columnar objects.

   If the description of this managed object defines a unit-basis, then
   mapping to this clause is straight-forward.

   Actions are modeled as read-write objects, in which writing a

   Usually the Integer32 syntax is used with a distinguished value
   provided for each action that the object provides access to.  In
   addition, there is usually one other distinguished value, which is
   the one returned when the object is read.

         &lt;range&gt; is further restricted as follows:
             - any &lt;value&gt; used in a SIZE clause must be non-negative.
             - when a pair of values is specified, the first value
               must be less than the second value.
             - when multiple ranges are specified, the ranges may
               not overlap but may touch. For example, (1..4 | 4..9)
               is invalid, and (1..4 | 5..9) is valid.
             - the ranges must be a subset of the maximum range of the
               base type.

Some examples of legal sub-typing:

         Integer32 (-20..100)
         Integer32 (0..100 | 300..500)
         Integer32 (300..500 | 0..100)
         Integer32 (0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10)
         OCTET STRING (SIZE(0..100))
         OCTET STRING (SIZE(0..100 | 300..500))
         OCTET STRING (SIZE(0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10))

Some examples of illegal sub-typing:

     Integer32 (150..100)         -- first greater than second
     Integer32 (0..100 | 50..500) -- ranges overlap
     Integer32 (0 | 2 | 0 )       -- value duplicated
     Integer32 (MIN..-1 | 1..MAX) -- MIN and MAX not allowed
     Integer32 ((SIZE (0..34))    -- must not use SIZE
     OCTET STRING (0..100)        -- must use SIZE
     OCTET STRING (SIZE(-10..100)) -- negative SIZE

   Sub-typing of Textual Conventions (see [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>3</a>]) is allowed but must be
   valid.  In particular, each range specified for the textual
   convention must be a subset of a range specified for the base type.
   For example,

     Tc1 ::= INTEGER (1..10 | 11..20)
     Tc2 ::= Tc1 (2..10 | 12..15)       -- is valid
     Tc3 ::= Tc1 (4..8)                 -- is valid
     Tc4 ::= Tc1 (8..12)                -- is invalid
