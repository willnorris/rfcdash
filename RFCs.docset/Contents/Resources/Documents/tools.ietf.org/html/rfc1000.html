THE ORIGINS OF RFCS - by Stephen D. Crocker

   The DDN community now includes hundreds of nodes and thousands of
   users, but once it was all a gleam in Larry Roberts' eye.  While much
   of the development proceeded according to a grand plan, the design of
   the protocols and the creation of the RFCs was largely accidental.

   The procurement of the ARPANET was initiated in the summer of 1968 --
   Remember Vietnam, flower children, etc?  There had been prior
   experiments at various ARPA sites to link together computer systems,
   but this was the first version to explore packet-switching on a grand
   scale.  ("ARPA" didn't become "DARPA" until 1972.)  Unlike most of
   the ARPA/IPTO procurements of the day, this was a competitive
   procurement. The contract called for four IMPs to be delivered to
   UCLA, SRI, UCSB and The University of Utah.  These sites were running
   a Sigma 7 with the SEX operating system, an SDS 940 with the Genie
   operating system, an IBM 360/75 with OS/MVT (or perhaps OS/MFT), and
   a DEC PDP-10 with the Tenex operating system.  Options existed for
   additional nodes if the first experiments were successful.  BBN won
   the procurement in December 1968, but that gets ahead of this story.

   Part of the reason for selecting these four sites was these were
   existing ARPA computer science research contractors.  The precise
   usage of the ARPANET was not spelled out in advance, and the research
   community could be counted on to take some initiative.  To stimulate
   this process, a meeting was called during the summer with
   representatives from the selected sites, chaired by Elmer Shapiro

   from SRI.  If memory serves me correctly, Jeff Rulifson came from
   SRI, Ron Stoughton from UCSB, Steve Carr from Utah and I came from
   UCLA. (Apologies to anyone I've left out; records are inaccessible or
   lost at this point.)  At this point we knew only that the network was
   coming, but the precise details weren't known.

   That first meeting was seminal.  We had lots of questions -- how IMPs
   and hosts would be connected, what hosts would say to each other, and
   what applications would be supported.  No one had any answers, but
   the prospects seemed exciting.  We found ourselves imagining all
   kinds of possibilities -- interactive graphics, cooperating
   processes, automatic data base query, electronic mail -- but no one
   knew where to begin.  We weren't sure whether there was really room
   to think hard about these problems; surely someone from the east
   would be along by and by to bring the word.  But we did come to one
   conclusion: We ought to meet again.  Over the next several months, we
   managed to parlay that idea into a series of exchange meetings at
   each of our sites, thereby setting the most important precedent in
   protocol design.

   The first few meetings were quite tenuous.  We had no official
   charter.  Most of us were graduate students and we expected that a
   professional crew would show up eventually to take over the problems
   we were dealing with.  Without clear definition of what the host-IMP
   interface would look like, or even what functions the IMP would
   provide, we focused on exotic ideas.  We envisioned the possibility
   of application specific protocols, with code downloaded to user
   sites, and we took a crack at designing a language to support this.
   The first version was known as DEL, for "Decode-Encode Language" and
   a later version was called NIL, for "Network Interchange Language."
   When the IMP contract was finally let and BBN provided some definite
   information on the host-IMP interface, all attention shifted to
   low-level matters and the ambitious ideas for automatic downloading
   of code evaporated.  It was several years before ideas like remote
   procedure calls and typed objects reappeared.

   In February of 1969 we met for the first time with BBN.  I don't
   think any of us were prepared for that meeting.  The BBN folks, led
   by Frank Heart, Bob Kahn, Severo Ornstein and Will Crowther, found
   themselves talking to a crew of graduate students they hadn't
   anticipated.  And we found ourselves talking to people whose first
   concern was how to get bits to flow quickly and reliably but hadn't
   -- of course -- spent any time considering the thirty or forty layers
   of protocol above the link level.  And while BBN didn't take over the
   protocol design process, we kept expecting that an official protocol
   design team would announce itself.

   A month later, after a particularly delightful meeting in Utah, it
   became clear to us that we had better start writing down our


<span class="grey">Reynolds &amp; Postel                                               [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1000.html">RFC 1000</a> - Request for Comments Reference Guide              August 1987</span>


   discussions.  We had accumulated a few notes on the design of DEL and
   other matters, and we decided to put them together in a set of notes.
   I remember having great fear that we would offend whomever the
   official protocol designers were, and I spent a sleepless night
   composing humble words for our notes.  The basic ground rules were
   that anyone could say anything and that nothing was official.  And to
   emphasize the point, I labeled the notes "Request for Comments."  I
   never dreamed these notes would distributed through the very medium
   we were discussing in these notes.  Talk about Sorcerer's Apprentice!

   Over the spring and summer of 1969 we grappled with the detailed
   problems of protocol design.  Although we had a vision of the vast
   potential for intercomputer communication, designing usable protocols
   was another matter.  A custom hardware interface and custom intrusion
   into the operating system was going to be required for anything we
   designed, and we anticipated serious difficulty at each of the sites.
   We looked for existing abstractions to use.  It would have been
   convenient if we could have made the network simply look like a tape
   drive to each host, but we knew that wouldn't do.

   It was clear we needed to support remote login for interactive use --
   later known as Telnet -- and we needed to move files from machine to
   machine.  We also knew that we needed a more fundamental point of
   view for building a larger array of protocols.  Unfortunately,
   operating systems of that era tended to view themselves as the center
   of the universe; symmetric cooperation did not fit into the concepts
   currently available within these operating systems.  And time was
   pressing: The first IMP was due to be delivered to UCLA September 1,
   1969, and the rest were scheduled at monthly intervals.

   At UCLA we scrambled to build a host-IMP interface.  SDS, the builder
   of the Sigma 7, wanted many months and many dollars to do the job.
   Mike Wingfield, another grad student at UCLA, stepped in and offered
   to get interface built in six weeks for a few thousand dollars.  He
   had a gorgeous, fully instrumented interface working in five and one
   half weeks.  I was in charge of the software, and we were naturally
   running a bit late.  September 1 was Labor Day, so I knew I had a
   couple of extra days to debug the software.  Moreover, I had heard
   BBN was having some timing troubles with the software, so I had some
   hope they'd miss the ship date.  And I figured that first some
   Honeywell people would install the hardware -- IMPs were built out of
   Honeywell 516s in those days -- and then BBN people would come in a
   few days later to shake down the software.  An easy couple of weeks
   of grace.

   BBN fixed their timing trouble, air shipped the IMP, and it arrived
   on our loading dock on Saturday, August 30.  They arrived with the
   IMP, wheeled it into our computer room, plugged it in and the



<span class="grey">Reynolds &amp; Postel                                               [Page 3]</span></pre>

   software restarted from where it had been when the plug was pulled in
   Cambridge.  Still Saturday, August 30.  Panic time at UCLA.

   The second IMP was delivered to SRI at the beginning of October, and
   ARPA's interest was intense.  Larry Roberts and Barry Wessler came by
   for a visit on November 21, and we actually managed to demonstrate a
   Telnet-like connection to SRI.

   With the pressure to get something working and the general confusion
   as to how to achieve the high generality we all aspired to, we punted
   and defined the first set of protocols to include only Telnet and FTP
   functions.  In particular, only asymmetric, user-server relationships
   were supported.  In December 1969, we met with Larry Roberts in Utah,
   and suffered our first direct experience with "redirection".  Larry
   made it abundantly clear that our first step was not big enough, and
   we went back to the drawing board.  Over the next few months we
   designed a symmetric host-host protocol, and we defined an abstract
   implementation of the protocol known as the Network Control Program.
   ("NCP" later came to be used as the name for the protocol, but it
   originally meant the program within the operating system that managed
   connections.  The protocol itself was known blandly only as the
   host-host protocol.)  Along with the basic host-host protocol, we
   also envisioned a hierarchy of protocols, with Telnet, FTP and some
   splinter protocols as the first examples.  If we had only consulted
   the ancient mystics, we would have seen immediately that seven layers
   were required.

   The initial experiment had been declared an immediate success and the
   network continued to grow.  More and more people started coming to
   meetings, and the Network Working Group began to take shape.  Working
   Group meetings started to have 50 and 100 people in attendance
   instead of the half dozen we had had in 1968 and early 1969.  We held
   one meeting in conjunction with the Spring Joint Computer Conference
   in Atlantic City in 1971.  In October 1971 we all convened at MIT for
   a major protocol "fly-off".  Representatives from each site were on
   hand, and everyone tried to log in to everyone else's site.  With the
   exception of one site that was completely down, the matrix was almost
   completely filled in, and we had reached a major milestone in
   connectivity.

   The rapid growth of the network and the working group also led to a
   large pile of RFCs.  When the 100th RFC was in sight, Peggy Karp took
   on the task of indexing them.  That seemed like a large task then,
   and we could have hardly anticipated seeing more than a 1000 RFCs
   several years later.

   Where will it end?  The network has the exceeded all estimates of its

      A summary of the Request for Comments Documents from <a href="rfc900.html">RFC 900</a>-999.

   998     Lambert      Mar 87      NETBLT:  A Bulk Data Transfer
                                    Protocol

      This document is a description of and a specification for the
      NETBLT protocol.  It is a revision of the specification published
      in <a href="rfc969.html">RFC-969</a>.  NETBLT (NETwork BLock Transfer) is a transport level
      protocol intended for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of
      data between computers.  It provides a transfer that is reliable
      and flow controlled, and is designed to provide maximum throughput
      over a wide variety of networks.  Although NETBLT currently runs
      on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), it should be able to operate
      on top of any datagram protocol similar in function to IP.

      This document is published for discussion and comment, and does

      to provide distributed services in an environment subject to
      non-malicious crash failures.

      Here, we argue that the form of "best effort" reliability provided
      by host groups may not address the requirements of those
      researchers who are building fault tolerant software.  Our basic
      premise is that reliable handling of failures, recoveries, and
      dynamic process migration are important aspects of programming in
      distributed environments, and that communication support that
      provides unpredictable behavior in the presence of such events
      places an unacceptable burden of complexity on higher level
      application software.  This complexity does not arise when using
      the fault-tolerant process group alternative.

      authentication procedures, as the initial phase of an effort to
      provide privacy enhancement services for electronic mail transfer
      in the Internet.  It is intended that the procedures defined here
      be compatible with a wide range of key management approaches,
      including both conventional (symmetric) and public-key
      (asymmetric) approaches for encryption of data encrypting keys.

      Use of conventional cryptography for message text encryption
      and/or authentication is anticipated.

      Privacy enhancement services (confidentiality, authentication, and
      message integrity assurance) are offered through the use of
      end-to- end cryptography between originator and recipient User
      Agent processes, with no special processing requirements imposed
      on the Message Transfer System at endpoints or at intermediate
      relay sites. This approach allows privacy enhancement facilities
      to be incorporated on a site-by-site or user-by-user basis without
      impact on other Internet entities.  Interoperability among
      heterogeneous components and mail transport facilities is
      supported.

   985     Mills        May 86      Requirements for Internet Gateways

      This RFC summarizes the requirements for gateways to be used on
      networks supporting the DARPA Internet protocols.  While it
      applies specifically to the National Science Foundation research
      programs, the requirements are stated in a general context and are
      believed applicable throughout the Internet community.  The
      purpose of this document is to present guidance for vendors
      offering products that might be used or adapted for use in an
      Internet application.  It enumerates the protocols required and
      gives references to RFCs and other documents describing the

      This document is a preliminary discussion of the design of a
      personal-computer-based distributed mail system.  Pcmail is a
      distributed mail system that provides mail service to an arbitrary
      number of users, each of which owns one or more personal computers
      (PCs).  The system is divided into two halves.  The first consists
      of a single entity called the "repository".  The repository is a
      storage center for incoming mail.  Mail for a Pcmail user can
      arrive externally from the Internet or internally from other
      repository users.  The repository also maintains a stable copy of
      each user's mail state.  The repository is therefore typically a
      computer with a large amount of disk storage. It is published for
      discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.  As
      the proposal may change, implementation of this document is not
      advised.

      This memo describes a proposed protocol standard for the
      ARPA-Internet community.  The CCITT and the ISO have defined
      various session, presentation, and application recommendations
      which have been adopted by the international community and
      numerous vendors.  To the largest extent possible, it is desirable
      to offer these higher level services directly to the
      ARPA-Internet, without disrupting existing facilities.  This
      permits users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications
      which previously were not available in the ARPA-Internet.  The
      intention is that hosts within the ARPA-Internet that choose to
      implement ISO TSAP services on top of the TCP be expected to adopt
      and implement this standard.  Suggestions for improvement are
      encouraged.

      This document introduces wiretap algorithms, a class of
      experimental, multiple routing algorithms that compute
      quasi-optimum routes for stations sharing a packet-radio broadcast
      channel.  The primary route (a minimum-distance path), and
      additional paths ordered by distance, which serve as alternate
      routes should the primary route fail, are computed.  This
      prototype is presented as an example of a class of routing
      algorithms and data-base management techniques that may find wider
      application in the Internet community.  Discussions and
      suggestions for improvements are welcomed.

      number of deficiencies in the old End-to-End Protocol, to improve
      its performance and overall throughput, and to better equip the
      Packet Switch Node (also known as the IMP) to support its current
      and anticipated host population.

      stream-based transmission of news among the ARPA-Internet
      community.  NNTP is designed so that news articles are stored in a

      This RFC is a comparison of several data representation standards
      that are currently in use.  The standards discussed are the CCITT
      X.409 recommendation, the NBS Computer Based Message System (CBMS)
      standard, DARPA Multimedia Mail system, the Courier remote
      procedure call protocol, and the SUN Remote Procedure Call
      package.  No proposals in this document are intended as standards
      for the ARPA-Internet at this time.  Rather, it is hoped that a
      general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate approach to a
      data representation standard, leading eventually to the adoption
      of an ARPA-Internet standard.

   970     Nagle        Dec 85      On Packet Switches With Infinite
                                    Storage

      The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular
      problem in the ARPA-Internet and possible methods of solution.
      Most prior work on congestion in datagram systems focuses on
      buffer management.  In this memo, the case of a packet switch with
      infinite storage is considered.  Such a packet switch can never
      run out of buffers.  It can, however, still become congested.  The
      meaning of congestion in an infinite-storage system is explored.
      An unexpected result is found that shows a datagram network with
      infinite storage, first-in-first-out queuing, at least two packet
      switches, and a finite packet lifetime will, under overload, drop
      all packets.  By attacking the problem of congestion for the

      This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in
      the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and
      suggestions for improvements.  One of the services frequently
      neglected in computer network design is a high-quality,
      time-of-day clock capable of generating accurate timestamps with
      small errors compared to one-way network delays.  Such a service
      would be useful for tracing the progress of complex transactions,
      synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring network performance
      and isolating problems.  In this memo, one such clock service
      design will be described and its performance assessed.  This
      design has been incorporated as an integral part of the network
      routing and control protocols of the Distributed Computer Network
      (DCnet) architecture.

      This RFC discussed clock synchronization algorithms for the
      ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
      for improvements.  The recent interest within the Internet
      community in determining accurate time from a set of mutually
      suspicious network clocks has been prompted by several occasions
      in which errors were found in usually reliable, accurate clock
      servers after thunderstorms which disrupted their power supply.
      To these sources of error should be added those due to
      malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator mistakes,
      as well as random errors in the mechanism used to set and
      synchronize clocks.  This report suggests a stochastic model and
      algorithms for computing a good estimator from time-offset samples
      measured between clocks connected via network links.  Included in
      this report are descriptions of certain experiments which give an
      indication of the effectiveness of the algorithms.

      The DoD Internet Protocol Suite includes two alternative transport

   951     Croft        Sep 85      Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)

      This RFC describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which
      allows a diskless client machine to discover its own IP address,
      the address of a server host, and the name of a file to be loaded
      into memory and executed.  The bootstrap operation can be thought
      of as consisting of TWO PHASES.  This RFC describes the first
      phase, which could be labeled `address determination and bootfile
      selection'.  After this address and filename information is
      obtained, control passes to the second phase of the bootstrap
      where a file transfer occurs.  The file transfer will typically
      use the TFTP protocol, since it is intended that both phases
      reside in PROM on the client.  However BOOTP could also work with
      other protocols such as SFTP or FTP.  This RFC suggests a proposed
      protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion
      and suggestions for improvements.

      In 1982 CMU designed and implemented a terminal location database
      and modified existing network software to handle a 64-bit number
      called the Terminal Location Number (or TTYLOC).  It now seems

   940     GADS         Apr 85      Toward an Internet Standard Scheme
                                    for Subnetting

      Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected to
      the Internet via a gateway.  The details of the internal
      connectivity are of little interest to the rest of the Internet.
      One way of organizing these local complexes of links is to use the
      same strategy as the Internet uses to organize networks, that is,
      to declare each link to be an entity (like a network) and to
      interconnect the links with devices that perform routing functions
      (like gateways).  This general scheme is called subnetting, the
      individual links are called subnets, and the connecting devices
      are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).  This RFC
      discusses standardizing the protocol used in subnetted
      environments in the ARPA-Internet.  Distribution of this memo is

                                    Scheme

      There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use of
      a single Internet network number to refer to a collection of
      physical networks under common administration which are reachable
      from the rest of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes
      allow a simplified view of an otherwise complicated topology from
      hosts and gateways outside of this collection.  They allow the
      complexity of the number and  type of these networks, and routing
      to them, to be localized.  Additions and changes in configuration
      thus cause no detectable change, and no interruption of service,
      due to slow propagation of routing and other information outside
      of the local environment.  These schemes also simplify the
      administration of the network, as changes do not require
      allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed.
      This proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been
      in use at the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984.

   935     Robinson     Jan 85      Reliable Link Layer Protocols

      This RFC discusses protocols proposed recently in RFCs 914 and
      916, and suggests a proposed protocol that could meet the same
      needs addressed in those memos.  The stated need is reliable
      communication between two programs over a full-duplex,
      point-to-point communication link, and in particular the RFCs
      address the need for such communication over an asynchronous link
      at relatively low speeds. The suggested protocol uses the methods
      of existing national and international data link layer standards.

      community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
      improvements.

   934     Rose         Jan 85      Proposed Standard for Message
                                    Encapsulation

      This memo concerns itself with message forwarding.  Forwarding can
      be thought of as encapsulating one or more messages inside

      another. Although this is useful for transfer of past
      correspondence to new recipients, without a decapsulation process
      (which this memo terms "bursting"), the forwarded messages are of
      little use to the recipients because they can not be distributed,
      forwarded, replied-to, or otherwise processed as separate
      individual messages. In order to burst a message it is necessary
      to know how the component messages were encapsulated in the draft.
      At present there is no unambiguous standard for interest group
      digests.  This RFC proposes a proposed protocol for the
      ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
      for improvements.

   933     Silverman    Jan 85      Output Marking Telnet Option

      This proposed option would allow a Server-Telnet to send a banner
      to a User-Telnet so that this banner would be displayed on the
      workstation screen independently of the application software
      running in the Server-Telnet.

   932     Clark        Jan 85      A Subnetwork Addressing Scheme

      This RFC proposes an alternative addressing scheme for subnets
      which, in most cases, requires no modification to host software
      whatsoever.  The drawbacks of this scheme are that the total
      number of subnets in any one network are limited, and that
      modification is required to all gateways.

      improvements.  This is the second draft of this proposal
      (superseding <a href="rfc912.html">RFC 912</a>) and incorporates a more formal description
      of the syntax for the request and response dialog, as well as a
      change to specify the type of user identification returned.

      This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA-Internet community.
      Hosts on the ARPA-Internet that exchange terminal type information
      within the Telnet protocol are expected to adopt and implement
      this standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  This
      standard supersedes <a href="rfc884.html">RFC 884</a>.  The only change is to specify that
      the TERMINAL-TYPE IS sub-negotiation should be sent only in
      response to the TERMINAL-TYPE SEND sub-negotiation.

                                    Standard H-FP

      The broad outline of the Host-Front End Protocol introduced here
      and described in <a href="rfc929.html">RFC 929</a> is the result of the deliberations of a
      number of experienced H-FP designers, who sat as a committee of
      the DoD Protocol Standards Technical Panel.  It is the intent of
      the designers that the protocol be subjected to multiple test
      implementations and probable iteration before being agreed upon as
      any sort of "standard".  Therefore, the first order of business is
      to declare that THIS IS A PROPOSAL, NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the
      second order of business is to request that any readers of these
      documents who are able to do test implementations (a) do so and

      The following is the description of a Telnet option designed to
      facilitate double login avoidance.  It is intended primarily for
      TAC connections to target hosts on behalf of TAC users, but it can
      be used between any two consenting hosts.  For example, all hosts
      at one site (e.g., BBN) can use this option to avoid double login
      when TELNETing to one another.

   925     Postel       Oct 84      Multi-LAN Address Resolution

      The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as one
      Internet network has generated some interest and concern.  It is
      inappropriate to give each LAN within a site a distinct
      ARPA-Internet network number.  It is desirable to hide the details
      of the interconnections between the LANs within a site from
      people, gateways, and hosts outside the site.  The question arises
      on how to best do this, and even how to do it at all.  In <a href="rfc917.html">RFC 917</a>,
      Jeffery Mogul makes a case for the use of "explicit subnets" in a
      multi-LAN environment.  The explicit subnet scheme is a call to
      recursively apply the mechanisms the ARPA-Internet uses to manage
      networks to the problem of managing LANs within one network.  In
      this note I urge another approach: the use of "transparent
      subnets" supported by a multi-LAN extension of the Address
      Resolution Protocol.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for
      the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and
      suggestions for improvements.

      local networks that support broadcast, for addressing broadcasts,
      and for how gateways should handle them.

      This memo discusses subnets and proposes procedures for the use of
      subnets, including approaches to solving the problems that arise,
      particularly that of routing.  A subnet of an Internet network is
      a logically visible sub-section of a single Internet network.  For
      administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have
      chosen to divide one Internet network into several subnets,
      instead of acquiring a set of Internet network numbers.  This RFC
      suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and
      requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

      This paper proposes and specifies a protocol which allows two
      programs to reliably communicate over a communication link.  It
      ensures that the data entering one end of the link if received
      arrives at the other end intact and unaltered.  The protocol,
      named RATP, is designed to operate over a full duplex
      point-to-point connection.  It contains some features which tailor
      it to the RS-232 links now in common use.

      This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet
      community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
      improvements.

   915     Elvy         Dec 84      Network Mail Path Service

      The network mail path service fills the current need of people to
      determine mailbox addresses for hosts that are not part of the
      ARPA-Internet but can be reached by one or more relay hosts that
      have Unix to Unix Copy (UUCP) mail, CSNET mail, MAILNET mail,
      BITNET mail, etc.  Anyone can use the service if they have
      TCP/TELENET to one of the hosts with a mail path server.  This RFC
      proposes a new service for the ARPA-Internet community and
      requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

      computers, and possible methods of solution.  None of the proposed
      solutions in this document are intended as standards for the
      ARPA-Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will
      emerge as to the appropriate solution to the problems, leading
      eventually to the adoption of standards.

   913     Lottor       Sep 84      Simple File Transfer Protocol

      This memo describes a proposed Simple File Transfer Protocol
      (SFTP).  It fills the need of people wanting a protocol that is
      more useful than TFTP but easier to implement (and less powerful)
      than FTP.  SFTP supports user access control, file transfers,
      directory listing, directory changing, file renaming, and
      deleting.  Discussion of this proposal is encouraged, and
      suggestions for improvements may be sent to the author.

   912     StJohns      Sep 84      Authentication Service

      This memo describes a proposed authentication protocol for
      verifying the identity of a user of a TCP connection.  Given a TCP
      port number pair, it returns a character string which identifies
      the owner of that connection on the server's system.  Suggested
      uses include automatic identification and verification of a user
      during an FTP session, additional verification of a TAC dial up
      user, and access verification for a generalized network file
      server.

      experiment).  The meeting was held at Bolt Beranek and Newman on
      23-24 July 1984 to discuss recent progress by groups who are
      building multimedia mail systems and to discuss a variety of
      issues related to the further development of multimedia systems.

   907     Storch       Jul 84      Host Access Protocol Specification

      This document specifies the Host Access Protocol (HAP).  Although
      HAP was originally designed as the network-access level protocol
      for the DARPA/DCA sponsored Wideband Packet Satellite Network, it
      is intended that it evolve into a standard interface SATNET and
      TACNET (aka MATNET) as well as the Wideband Network.  HAP is an
      experimental protocol, and will undergo further revision as new
      capabilities are added and/or different satellite networks are
      suported.  Implementations of HAP should be performed in
      coordination with satellite network development and operations
      personnel.

   906     Finlayson    Jun 84      Bootstrap Loading Using TFTP

      It is often convenient to be able to bootstrap a computer system
      from a communications network.  This RFC proposes the use of the
      IP/TFTP protocol for bootstrap loading in this case.

      This RFC specifies a draft standard for the ARPA-Internet
      community.  It describes a resource location protocol for use in
      the ARPA-Internet.  It is most useful on networks employing
      technologies which support some method of broadcast addressing,
      however it may also be used on other types of networks.  For
      maximum benefit, all hosts which provide significant resources or
      services to other hosts on the ARPA-Internet should implement this
      protocol.  Hosts failing to implement the Resource Location
      Protocol risk being ignored by other hosts which are attempting to
      locate resources on the ARPA-Internet.

   850     Horton       Jun 83      Standard for Interchange of USENET
                                    Messages

      This memo is distributed as an RFC only to make this information
      easily accessible to researchers in the ARPA-Internet community.
      It does not specify an Internet standard.  This RFC defines the
      standard format for interchange of Network News articles among
      USENET sites.  It describes the format for articles themselves,
      and gives partial standards for transmission of news.  The news
      transmission is not entirely standardized in order to give a good
      deal of flexibility to the individual hosts to choose transmission
      hardware and software, whether to batch news and so on.

                                    Distribution

      This RFC actually is a request for comments.  The issue dealt with
      is that of a naming registry update procedure, both as exists
      currently and what could exist in the future.  None of the
      proposed solutions are intended as standards at this time; rather
      it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as the
      appropriate solution, leaving eventually to the adoption of
      standards.

                                    Services?

      This RFC lists those hosts which provide any of these "little" TCP
      services:  The list of hosts were taken from the NIC hostname
      table of 24-Feb-83.  The tests were run on February 23 and 24, and
      March 3 and 5 from ISI-VAXA.ARPA.

   847     Westine      Feb 83      Summary of Smallberg Surveys

      This is a summary of the surveys of Telnet, FTP and Mail (SMTP)
      servers conducted by David Smallberg in December 1982, January and
      February 1983 as reported in <a href="rfc832.html">RFC 832</a>-843, 845-846.  This memo
      extracts the number of hosts that accepted the connection to their
      server for each of Telnet, FTP, and SMTP, and compares it to the
      total host in the ARPA-Internet (not counting TACs or ECHOS).

      This RFC is a survey of hosts to identify the implementation
      status of Telnet, FTP, and Mail on TCP.  The list of hosts was
      taken from the NIC hostname table of 18-Feb-83.  The tests were
      run on 22-Feb-83 from ISI-VAXA.ARPA.

                                    February 1983

      This survey determines how many hosts are able to respond to
      Telnet connections from a user at a class C site.  This requires,
      in addition to IP and TCP, participation in gateway routing via
      ICMP and handling of Class C addresses.  The list of hosts was
      taken from <a href="rfc843.html">RFC 843</a>, extracting only those hosts which are listed
      there as accepting Telnet connection.  The tests were run on
      18-Feb-83.

      requires only one buffer for storage equal in size to the final
      datagram being reassembled, which can reassemble a datagram from

      presents a particular set of algorithms which have received
      testing in the field, and which appear to work properly with each
      other.  With more experience, these algorithms may become part of

      This RFC consists of notes from a meeting that was held at
      USC/Information Sciences Institute on 11 January 1982, to discuss
      addressing issues in computer mail. The major conclusion reached
      at the meeting is to extend the "username@hostname" mailbox format
      to "username@host.domain", where the domain itself can be further
      structured.

   804     CCITT        Jan 82      CCITT Draft Recommendation T.4

      This is the CCITT standard for group 3 facsimile encoding.  This
      is useful for data compression of bit map data.

                                    Transcoding

      The first part of this RFC describes in detail the Dacom 450 data
      compression algorithms and is an update and correction to an
      earlier memorandum.  The second part of this RFC describes briefly
      the Dacom 500 data compression algorithm as used by the INTELPOST
      electronic-mail network under development by the US Postal Service
      and several foreign administrators.

   802     Malis        Nov 81      The ARPANET 1822L Host Access
                                    Protocol

      This document proposed two major changes to the current ARPANET
      host access protocol.  The first change will allow hosts to use
      logical addressing (i.e., host addresses that are independent of
      their physical location on the ARPANET) to communicate with each
      other, and the second will allow a host to shorten the amount of
      time that it may be blocked by its IMP after it presents a message
      to the network (currently, the IMP can block further input from a
      host for up to 15 seconds).  See RFCs 852 and 851.

   801     Postel       Nov 81      NCP/TCP Transition Plan

      This RFC discusses the conversion of hosts from NCP to TCP.  And
      making available the principle services:  Telnet, File Transfer,
      and Mail.  These protocols allow all hosts in the ARPA community
      to share a common interprocess communication environment.
