Abstract

   The prevalent use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in Next
   Generation Networks necessitates that SIP networks provide adequate
   control mechanisms to maintain transaction throughput by preventing
   congestion collapse during traffic overloads.  A loss-based solution
   to remedy known vulnerabilities of the SIP 503 (Service Unavailable)
   overload control mechanism has already been proposed.  Using the same
   signaling, this document proposes a rate-based control scheme to
   complement the loss-based control scheme.

   The use of SIP [<a href="rfc3261.html" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] in large-scale Next Generation Networks
   requires that SIP-based networks provide adequate control mechanisms
   for handling traffic growth.  In particular, SIP networks must be
   able to handle traffic overloads gracefully, maintaining transaction
   throughput by preventing congestion collapse.

   A promising SIP-based overload control solution has been proposed in
   [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>].  That solution provides a communication scheme for
   overload control algorithms.  It also includes a default loss-based
   overload control algorithm that makes it possible for a set of
   clients to limit offered load towards an overloaded server.  However,
   such a loss control algorithm is sensitive to variations in load so
   that any increase in load would be directly reflected by the clients
   in the offered load presented to the overloaded servers.  More
   importantly, a loss-based control scheme cannot guarantee an upper
   bound on the load from the clients towards an overloaded server and
   requires frequent updates that may have implications for stability.

   In accordance with the framework defined in [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>], this document
   proposes an alternate overload control scheme: the rate-based
   overload control scheme.  The rate-based control algorithm guarantees
   an upper bound on the rate, constant between server updates, of

   requests sent by clients towards an overloaded server.  The trade-off
   is in terms of algorithmic complexity, since the overloaded server is
   more likely to use a different target (maximum rate) for each client
   than the loss-based approach.

   The proposed rate-based overload control algorithm mitigates
   congestion in SIP networks while adhering to the overload signaling
   scheme in [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>] and presenting a rate-based control scheme as an
   optional alternative to the default loss-based control scheme in
   [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   Unless otherwise specified, all SIP entities described in this
   document are assumed to support this specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Rate-Based%20Algorithm%20Scheme"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Rate-Based Algorithm Scheme</span>

   The server is the one protected by the overload control algorithm
   defined here, and the client is the one that throttles traffic
   towards the server.

   Following the procedures defined in [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>], the server and clients
   signal one another support for rate-based overload control.

   Then, periodically, the server relies on internal measurements (e.g.,
   CPU utilization or queueing delay) to evaluate its overload state and
   estimate a target maximum SIP request rate in number of requests per
   second (as opposed to target percent loss in the case of loss-based
   control).

   When in overload, the server uses the "oc" parameter in the Via
   header field [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>] of SIP responses in order to inform clients of
   its overload state and of the target maximum SIP request rate for
   that client.

   Upon receiving the "oc" parameter with a target maximum SIP request
   rate, each client throttles new SIP requests towards the overloaded
   server.

      overload control per [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>] and by servers to indicate the load
      reduction amount in the loss-based algorithm and the maximum rate,
      in messages per second, for the rate-based algorithm described
      here.

   o  oc-algo: Used by clients in SIP requests to advertise supported
      overload control algorithms and by servers to notify clients of
      the algorithm in effect.  Supported values are loss (default) and
      rate (optional).

   o  oc-validity: Used by servers in SIP responses to indicate an
      interval of time (in milliseconds) that the load reduction should
      be in effect.  A value of 0 is reserved for the server to stop
      overload control.  A non-zero value is required in all other
      cases.

   o  oc-seq: A sequence number associated with the "oc" parameter.

   Consult <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for an illustration of the usage of the "oc"
   parameter in the Via header field.

   Per [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>], new clients indicate supported overload control
   algorithms to servers by inserting "oc" and "oc-algo", with the names
   of the supported algorithms, in the Via header field of SIP requests
   destined to servers.  The inclusion by the client of the token "rate"
   indicates that the client supports a rate-based algorithm.
   Conversely, servers notify clients of the selected overload control
   algorithm through the "oc-algo" parameter in the Via header field of
   SIP responses to clients.  The inclusion by the server of the token
   "rate" in the "oc-algo" parameter indicates that the rate-based
   algorithm has been selected by the server.

   Support of rate-based control MUST be indicated by clients including
   the token "rate" in the "oc-algo" list.  Selection of rate-based
   control MUST be indicated by servers by setting "oc-algo" to the
   token "rate".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.4.%20%20Server%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" name="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Server Operation</span>

   The actual algorithm used by the server to determine its overload
   state and estimate a target maximum SIP request rate is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   However, the server MUST periodically evaluate its overload state and
   estimate a target SIP request rate beyond which it would become
   overloaded.  The server must determine how it will allocate the
   target SIP request rate among its client.  The server may set the
   same rate for every client or may set different rates for different
   clients.

   The maximum rate determined by the server for a client applies to the
   entire stream of SIP requests, even though throttling may only affect
   a particular subset of the requests, since as per [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>] and REQ
   13 of [<a href="rfc5390.html" title='"Requirements for Management of Overload in the Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC5390</a>], request prioritization is a client's responsibility.

   When setting the maximum rate for a particular client, the server may
   need to take into account the workload (e.g., CPU load per request)
   of the distribution of message types from that client.  Furthermore,
   because the client may prioritize the specific types of messages it
   sends while under overload restriction, this distribution of message
   types may be different from the message distribution for that client
   under non-overload conditions (e.g., it could have either higher or
   lower CPU load).

   Note that the "oc" parameter for the rate-based algorithm is an upper
   bound (in messages per second) on the traffic sent by the client to
   the server.  The client may send traffic at a rate significantly
   lower than the upper bound for a variety of reasons.

   In other words, when multiple clients are being controlled by an
   overloaded server, at any given time, some clients may receive
   requests at a rate below their target (maximum) SIP request rate
   while others above that target rate.  But the resulting request rate
   presented to the overloaded server will converge towards the target
   SIP request rate.

   Upon detection of overload and the determination to invoke overload
   controls, the server MUST follow the specifications in [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>] to
   notify its clients of the allocated target SIP request rate and to
   notify them that rate-based control is in effect.

   The server MUST use the "oc" parameter defined in [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>] to send a
   target SIP request rate to each of its clients.

   When a client supports the default loss-based algorithm and not the
   rate-based algorithm, the client would be handled in the same way as
   in <a href="rfc7339.html#section-5.10.2">Section 5.10.2 of [RFC7339]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.%20%20Client%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" name="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Client Operation</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.1.%20%20Default%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5.1" name="section-3.5.1">3.5.1</a>.  Default Algorithm</span>

   In determining whether or not to transmit a specific message, the
   client may use any algorithm that limits the message rate to the "oc"
   parameter in units of messages per second.  For ease of discussion,
   we define T = 1/["oc" parameter] as the target inter-SIP request
   interval.  The algorithm may be strictly deterministic, or it may be
   probabilistic.  It may, or may not, have a tolerance factor to allow
   for short bursts, as long as the long-term rate remains below 1/T.

   The algorithm may have provisions for prioritizing traffic in
   accordance with REQ 13 of [<a href="rfc5390.html" title='"Requirements for Management of Overload in the Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC5390</a>].

   If the algorithm requires other parameters (in addition to "T", which
   is 1/["oc" parameter]), they may be set autonomously by the client,
   or they may be negotiated between client and server independently of
   the SIP-based overload control solution.

   In either case, the coordination is out of the scope of this
   document.  The default algorithms presented here (one with and one
   without provisions for prioritizing traffic) are only examples.

   To throttle new SIP requests at the rate specified by the "oc"
   parameter sent by the server to its clients, the client MAY use the
   proposed default algorithm for rate-based control or any other
   equivalent algorithm that forward messages in conformance with the
   upper bound of 1/T messages per second.

   The default leaky bucket algorithm presented here is based on
   [<a href="#ref-ITU-T-I.371" title='"Traffic control and congestion control in B-ISDN"'>ITU-T-I.371</a>], <a href="#appendix-A.2">Appendix A.2</a>.  The algorithm makes it possible for
   clients to deliver SIP requests at a rate specified by the "oc"
   parameter with the tolerance parameter TAU (preferably configurable).

   Conceptually, the leaky bucket algorithm can be viewed as a finite
   capacity bucket whose real-valued content drains out at a continuous
   rate of 1 unit of content per time unit and whose content increases
   by the increment T for each forwarded SIP request.  T is computed as
   the inverse of the rate specified by the "oc" parameter, namely
   T = 1 / ["oc" parameter].






<span class="grey">Noel &amp; Williams              Standards Track                    [Page 6]</span></pre>

   Note that when the "oc" parameter is 0 with a non-zero "oc-validity",
   then the client should reject 100% of SIP requests destined to the
   overload server.  However, when the "oc-validity" value is 0, the
   client should immediately stop throttling.

   If, at a new SIP request arrival, the content of the bucket is less
   than or equal to the limit value TAU, then the SIP request is
   forwarded to the server; otherwise, the SIP request is rejected.

   Note that the capacity of the bucket (the upper bound of the counter)
   is (T + TAU).

   The tolerance parameter TAU determines how close the long-term
   admitted rate is to an ideal control that would admit all SIP
   requests for arrival rates less than 1/T and then admit SIP requests
   precisely at the rate of 1/T for arrival rates above 1/T.  In
   particular, at mean arrival rates close to 1/T, it determines the
   tolerance to deviation of the inter-arrival time from T (the larger
   TAU, the more tolerance to deviations from the inter-departure
   interval T).

   This deviation from the inter-departure interval influences the
   admitted rate burstiness or the number of consecutive SIP requests
   forwarded to the server (burst size proportional to TAU over the
   difference between 1/T and the arrival rate).

   In situations where clients are configured with some knowledge about
   the server (e.g., operator pre-provisioning), it can be beneficial to
   choose a value of TAU based on how many clients will be sending
   requests to the server.

   Servers with a very large number of clients, each with a relatively
   small arrival rate, will generally benefit from a smaller value for
   TAU in order to limit queuing (and hence response times) at the
   server when subjected to a sudden surge of traffic from all clients.
   Conversely, a server with a relatively small number of clients, each
   with a proportionally larger arrival rate, will benefit from a larger
   value of TAU.

   Once the control has been activated, at the arrival time of the k-th
   new SIP request, ta(k), the content of the bucket is provisionally
   updated to the value

   X' = X - (ta(k) - LCT)

   where X is the value of the leaky bucket counter after arrival of the
   last forwarded SIP request, and LCT is the time at which the last SIP
   request was forwarded.

   If X' is less than or equal to the limit value TAU, then the new SIP
   request is forwarded, the leaky bucket counter X is set to X' (or to
   0 if X' is negative) plus the increment T, and LCT is set to the
   current time ta(k).  If X' is greater than the limit value TAU, then
   the new SIP request is rejected, and the values of X and LCT are
   unchanged.

   When the first response from the server has been received indicating
   control activation (oc-validity&gt;0), LCT is set to the time of
   activation, and the leaky bucket counter is initialized to the
   parameter TAU0 (preferably configurable), which is 0 or larger but
   less than or equal to TAU.

   TAU can assume any positive real number value and is not necessarily
   bounded by T.

   TAU=4*T is a reasonable compromise between burst size and throttled
   rate adaptation at low offered rates.

   Note that specification of a value for TAU and any communication or
   coordination between servers are beyond the scope of this document.

   A reference algorithm is shown below.

   As with the loss-based algorithm in [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>], a client implementing
   the rate-based algorithm also prioritizes messages into two or more
   categories of requests, for example, requests that are candidates for
   reduction and requests that are not subject to reduction (except
   under extenuating circumstances when there aren't any messages in the
   first category that can be reduced).

   Accordingly, the proposed leaky bucket implementation is modified to
   support priority using two thresholds for SIP requests that are
   candidates for reduction.  With two priorities, the proposed leaky
   bucket requires two thresholds: TAU1 and TAU2 (where TAU1 &lt; TAU2):

   o  All new requests would be admitted when the leaky bucket counter
      is at or below TAU1.

   o  Only higher-priority requests would be admitted when the leaky
      bucket counter is between TAU1 and TAU2.

   o  All requests would be rejected when the bucket counter is at or
      above TAU2.

   This can be generalized to n priorities using n thresholds for n&gt;2 in
   the obvious way.

   With a priority scheme that relies on two tolerance parameters (TAU2
   influences the priority traffic, and TAU1 influences the non-priority
   traffic), always set TAU1 &lt; TAU2 (TAU is replaced by TAU1 and TAU2).
   Setting both tolerance parameters to the same value is equivalent to
   having no priority.  TAU1 influences the admitted rate the same way
   as TAU does when no priority is set.  The larger the difference
   between TAU1 and TAU2, the closer the control is to strict priority
   queueing.

   TAU1 and TAU2 can assume any positive real number value and are not
   necessarily bounded by T.

   Reasonable values for TAU0, TAU1, and TAU2 are:

   o  TAU0 = 0,

   o  TAU1 = 1/2 * TAU2, and

   o  TAU2 = 10 * T.

   As the number of client sources of traffic increases or the
   throughput of the server decreases, the maximum rate admitted by each
   client needs to decrease; therefore, the value of T becomes larger.
   Under some circumstances (e.g., if the traffic arises very quickly
   simultaneously at many sources), the occupancies of each bucket can
   become synchronized, resulting in the admissions from each source
   being close in time and batched or having very 'peaky' arrivals at
   the server, which gives rise not only to control instability but also
   to very poor delays and even lost messages.  An appropriate term for
   this is 'resonance' [<a href="#ref-Erramilli" title='"Traffic Synchronization Effects In Teletraffic Systems"'>Erramilli</a>].







<span class="grey">Noel &amp; Williams              Standards Track                   [Page 10]</span></pre>

   If the network topology is such that resonance can occur, then a
   simple way to avoid resonance is to randomize the bucket occupancy at
   two appropriate points -- at the activation of control and whenever
   the bucket empties -- as described below.

   After updating the value of the leaky bucket to X', generate a value
   u as follows:

     if X' &gt; 0, then u = 0

     else if X' &lt;= 0, then let u be set to a random value uniformly
                      distributed between -1/2 and +1/2

   Then, only if the arrival is admitted, increase the bucket by an
   amount T + uT, which will therefore be just T if the bucket hadn't
   emptied or lie between T/2 and 3T/2 if it had.

   This randomization should also be done when control is activated,
   i.e., instead of simply initializing the leaky bucket counter to
   TAU0, initialize it to TAU0 + uT, where u is uniformly distributed as
   above.  Since activation would have been a result of response to a
   request sent by the client, the second term in this expression can be
   interpreted as being the bucket increment following that admission.

   This method has the following characteristics:

   o  If TAU0 is chosen to be equal to TAU and all sources activate
      control at the same time due to an extremely high request rate,
      then the time until the first request admitted by each client
      would be uniformly distributed over [0,T].

   o  The maximum occupancy is TAU + (3/2)T, rather than TAU + T without
      randomization.

   o  For the special case of 'classic gapping' where TAU=0, then the
      minimum time between admissions is uniformly distributed over
      [T/2, 3T/2], and the mean time between admissions is the same,
      i.e., T+1/R where R is the request arrival rate.

   o  As high load randomization rarely occurs, there is no loss of
      precision of the admitted rate, even though the randomized
      'phasing' of the buckets remains.

            ...

   The first message above is sent by P1 to P2.  This message is a SIP
   request; because P1 supports overload control, it inserts the "oc"
   parameter in the topmost Via header field that it created.  P1
   supports two overload control algorithms: loss and rate.

   The second message, a SIP response, shows the topmost Via header
   field amended by P2 according to this specification and sent to P1.
   Because P2 also supports overload control, it chooses the rate-based
   scheme and sends that back to P1 in the "oc-algo" parameter.  It uses
   oc-validity=0 to indicate no overload control.  In this example,
   "oc=0", but "oc" could be any value as "oc" is ignored when
   "oc-validity=0".

   At some later time, P2 starts to experience overload.  It sends the
   following SIP message indicating P1 should send SIP requests at a
   rate no greater than or equal to 150 SIP requests per second and for
   a duration of 1,000 milliseconds.

   field parameters of [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>] as follows:

   algo-list =/ "rate"

   Aside from the resonance concerns discussed in <a href="#section-3.5.3">Section 3.5.3</a>, this
   mechanism does not introduce any security concerns beyond the general
   overload control security issues discussed in [<a href="rfc7339.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control"'>RFC7339</a>].  Methods to
   mitigate the risk of resonance are discussed in <a href="#section-3.5.3">Section 3.5.3</a>.

   IANA has registered the "oc-algo" parameter of the Via header field
   in the "Header Field Parameters and Parameter Values" subregistry of
   the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters" registry.  The
   entry appears as follows:

   Header     Parameter     Predefined     References
   Field      Name          Values
   ___________________________________________________________
