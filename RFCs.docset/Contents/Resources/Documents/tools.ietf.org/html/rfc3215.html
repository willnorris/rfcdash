Abstract

   This document provides state machine tables for ATM (Asynchronous
   Transfer Mode) switch LSRs.  In the current LDP specification, there
   is no state machine specified for processing LDP messages. We think
   that defining a common state machine is very important for
   interoperability between different LDP and CR-LDP implementations.

   We begin in <a href="#section-1">section 1</a> by defining a list of terminologies.  Then in
   <a href="#section-2">section 2</a>, we propose two sets of state machine tables for ATM switch
   LSRs that use downstream-on-demand mode, one method can be used for
   non-vc merge capable ATM LSRs, while the other one can be used for
   the vc-merge capable ATM LSRs.  In <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>, we provides a state
   machine for downstream unsolicited mode ATM LSRs.

   We focus on the LDP state machines and the associated control blocks
   used for establishing and maintaining LSPs.  We do not describe state
   machines for the "LDP controller" that is in charge of LDP session
   initialization, address mapping messages management, routing
   interface, etc. that is defined in the LDP specification.

   Even though the state machines in this document are specific for
   ATM-LSR, they can be easily adapted for other types of LSRs.

   In this document, we provide two sets of state machines: one for the
   ATM LSR that does not have VC-merge capability, and the other for the
   ATM LSR that does have VC-merge capability.

   State machine descriptions are given in terms of control blocks,
   states, events, response actions and state transitions.  Control
   blocks contain the information that is required to support handling
   of events.  A control block may also contain any additional
   information that is required either of any specific implementation or
   in support of other required functions.  In every case, additional
   information required to support the procedures defined in the LDP
   specification [<a href="#ref-4" title='"LDP Specification"'>4</a>] or management objects defined in the LDP MIB [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Definition of Managed Objects for the Multiprotocol Label Switching, Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>3</a>]
   would be stored in a specific LDP implementation - either as part of
   the control block structure or in some other way.

   The state machines cover both independent LSP control and ordered LSP
   control.

   Loop detection and loop prevention messages will be processed as
   specified in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"LDP Specification"'>4</a>].  The impact of loop detection and loop prevention
   messages on state transitions is left for further study.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20An%20LSR%27s%20Behavior%20in%20the%20Case%20of%20a%20Next%20Hop%20Change"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a> An LSR's Behavior in the Case of a Next Hop Change</span>

   When there is a topology change and an LSR detects a new better next
   hop for an LSP, it may behave in 2 different ways:

   1) It tries to do a "local repair".  This means that it extends the
      LSP through the new next hop, releases the old path from this LSR
      forward and then splices into this newly extended LSP.





<span class="grey">Boscher, et al.              Informational                      [Page 4]</span></pre>

   2) If the LSP is created with the "pinned" option (CR-LDP[5]), the
      LSR ignores the new next hop change, and the LSP stays unchanged.
      The LSR may decide to send an LDP-MAPPING containing attributes
      for this New Next Hop (NH) that have changed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20ATM%20Switch%20LSR%20with%20No%20VC-merge%20Capability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>. ATM Switch LSR with No VC-merge Capability</span>

   In an MPLS domain where some ATM LSRs do not have VC-merge
   capability, downstream-on-demand mode is required for these ATM LSRs
   [<a href="#ref-1" title='"MPLS Using LDP and ATM Switching"'>1</a>].  Also, "conservative label retention mode" is required in this
   case [<a href="#ref-1" title='"MPLS Using LDP and ATM Switching"'>1</a>].

   For each LSP, there are 2 kinds of state machines involved:

   1) the LSP Control Block and its state machine that can be used to
      handle normal LSP setup.  It is created when the LSR receives a
      new LDP Request and it is deleted when the LSP of this request is
      torn down.

   2) the Next Hop Trigger Control Block and its state machine that is
      used to handle switching over to a better LSP through a different
      next hop.  It is created when the LSR decides to switch over to a
      better next hop and it is deleted when the LSR finishes switching
      over to the better next hop.  This state machine uses a timer (and
      has corresponding states) to ensure that switch over occurs in a
      timely fashion after a routing transient has had time to
      stabilize.

   For each LSP, an LSP Control Block is defined that may contain the
   following information:

      -  Upstream Label Request ID (assigned by the upstream LSR), that
         is the 'Message Id' in the Label Request Message received from
         the upstream LSR.

      -  Downstream Label Request ID (assigned by this LSR itself), that
         is 'Message Id' in the Label Request Message sent to the
         downstream LSR.

      -  Upstream LDP Identifier

      -  Downstream LDP Identifier

      -  State

      -  FEC

      -  Upstream Label (assigned by this LSR)

      -  Downstream Label (assigned by the downstream LSR)

      -  Trigger Control Block Pointer, (Only used at the ingress LSR of
         a LSP) that points to the control block that triggers setting
         up this LSP or tearing down this LSP.

      -  Next Hop Control Block Pointer, that points to the control
         block that is used for switching over to a better LSP.

   The following index combinations can be used to locate a unique LSP
   Control Block:

      -  Downstream Label and Downstream LDP Identifier, or

      -  Upstream Label and Upstream LDP Identifier, or

      -  Downstream Label Request ID and Downstream LDP Identifier

      -  Upstream Label Request ID and Upstream LDP Identifier

   Here is the relationship between different control blocks, the detail
   definition of Next Hop Trigger Control Block is described in <a href="#section-2.2.6">section</a>
   <a href="#section-2.2.6">2.2.6</a>.

   For example, an LSP that transits through (LSR-A, LSR-B, LSR-C, LSR-
   D):

      LSR-A ----&gt; LSR-B ---&gt; LSR-C ---&gt; LSR-D

   The control blocks in LSR-A are:

                  +-----------------------+
                  | Trigger Control Block |
                  |  (e.g, by config)     |

                  | LSP Control Block     |
                  +-----------------------+

   When LSR-B detects a better next hop to LSR-D through LSR-E,  and  it
   decides to switch over to it, so control blocks in LSR-B are:

   This section describes the various states that are used in the state
   machine for the ATM non VC-merge LSR.

   -- IDLE

   This is the initial LSP state, when the LSP Control Block is created.

   -- RESPONSE_AWAITED

   This state means that the LSR has received and processed an LDP-
   REQUEST from an upstream LSR, or it has received an internal set up
   request.  It has sent a new LDP-REQUEST towards a downstream LSR.
   The LSR is waiting for the LDP-MAPPING from the downstream LSR.

   -- ESTABLISHED

   This state means that the LSR has received the LDP-MAPPING from the
   downstream LSR and the LSP is up and operational.

   -- RELEASE_AWAITED

   This state means that the LSR has sent a LDP-WITHDRAW upstream and is
   waiting for the LDP-RELEASE before freeing up the label resource.

   -- LDP Request

   The LSR receives an LDP-REQUEST from an upstream LSR.

   -- LDP Mapping

   The LSR receives an LDP-MAPPING from a downstream LSR.

   -- LDP Release

   The LSR receives an LDP-RELEASE from an upstream LSR.

   -- LDP Withdraw

   The LSR receives an LDP-WITHDRAW from a downstream LSR.

   -- LDP Upstream Abort

   The LSR receives an LDP-ABORT from an upstream LSR.

   -- LDP Downstream NAK The LSR receives an LDP-NAK (notification) from
   an downstream LSR.

   -- Upstream Lost

   The LSR loses its LDP session with an upstream LDP peer.

   -- Downstream Lost

   The LSR loses its LDP session with a downstream LDP peer.

   -- Internal SetUp

   For some reason, e.g. a configuration request of a traffic
   engineering tunnel, or recognizing a new FEC could trigger an
   Internal SetUp event to set up a new LSP from this node.

   -- Internal Destroy

   The LSR send an Internal Destroy event to tear down an LSP.

   -- Internal Cross-Connect

   The LSR send an Internal Cross-Connect to splice two LSPs into one
   LSP.  This happens when a LSR switches over to a better next hop.

   State:          IDLE

   Event:          LDP Request

   New State:      Depends upon the action routine.

   Actions:

      If this LSR is the LSP Egress or Proxy Egress [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>2</a>]

   Then:
      Choose an upstream label, connect this upstream label to the local
      IP forwarding module, allocate the resources, send the LDP-MAPPING
      upstream with the upstream label, and go to the new state
      `ESTABLISHED'.

   else
      Obtain a next hop (or interface) with the FEC specified in the
      LDP-REQUEST, propagate the LDP-REQUEST, with newly assigned
      Message ID by this LSR, towards the obtained next hop, and go to
      the new state `RESPONSE_AWAITED'.

      If the LSR uses the independent control mode [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>2</a>], choose an
      upstream label, connect this upstream label to the local IP
      forwarding module, go to the ESTABLISHED state and send an LDP-
      MAPPING upstream with the upstream label.

   If unable to process the request for any reason, issue an LDP-NAK to
   the sender with the appropriate error code, go to IDLE and delete the
   LSP Control Block.

   When an LSR detects a better next hop, it may decides to establish a
   new LSP through this next hop.  For example, an LSR is configured as
   "local repair", or the LSR is configured as "global repair" and it is
   the ingress end of a LSP.  It can then create a Next Hop Trigger
   Control Block and use the state machine of Next Hop Trigger Control
   Block to establish a new LSP through the better next hop.

         Request ID and same Upstream LDP Session Identifier.

      a) Extract the LDP Request ID value from the LDP-NAK.

      b) Find an LSP Control Block that has the same Downstream Label
         Request ID and the same Downstream LDP Session Identifier.

      c) If an LSP Control Block is found, pass the event `LDP
         Downstream NAK' to its state machine.

      d) Otherwise, ignore the message.

   A VC-merge capable LSR can map multiple incoming labels (VPI/VCI)
   into one outgoing label.  It is possible that this LSR can only merge
   a limited number of incoming labels into a single outgoing label.  As
   described in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>2</a>], suppose, for example, that due to some hardware
   limitation a node is capable of merging four incoming labels into a
   single outgoing label.  Suppose however, that this particular node
   has six incoming labels arriving at it for a particular FEC.  In this
   case, this node may merge these into two outgoing labels.

   When an upstream LSR has a limited merging capability, it is
   difficult for a downstream LSR to know how many labels should be
   assigned to each FEC.  In this case, downstream-on-demand is
   recommended.

   There are 3 types of control blocks involved: Upstream LSP Control
   Block, Downstream LSP Control Block, and Next Hop Trigger Control
   Block.

   There is one Upstream LSP Control Block for each LDP-REQUEST
   received.

   There is one Downstream LSP Control Block for each unique LDP-REQUEST
   sent to a downstream LSR.  There can be multiple Downstream LSP
   Control Blocks per FEC in an LSR.  This can be the result of an
   upstream LSR asking for a label for an FEC.  This LSR must assign a
   unique upstream label and it can not merge this upstream label into
   an existing downstream label for this FEC.

   There is one Next Hop Trigger Control Block for each FEC for which a
   better next hop has been detected and the LSR has decided to switch
   to this better next hop.  It could be the result of "local repair" or
   "global repair" if the LSR is the ingress LSR of the LSP.

   A Downstream LSP Control Block contains a list of pointers to
   Upstream LSP Control Blocks or the Next Hop Trigger Control Block.
   This means that this LSR has decided to map the multiple labels
   listed in the Upstream LSP Control Blocks and the Next Hop Trigger
   Control Block into a single label listed in the Downstream LSP
   Control Block.

   An Upstream LSP Control Block may contain the following information:

      -  Upstream LDP Session Identifier

      -  State

      -  Upstream Label (assigned by this LSR)

      -  Downstream LSP Control Block pointer

      -  Upstream LDP Request ID (assigned by the upstream LSR in
         downstream-on-demand mode)

      -  Next_Hop_Trigger_Block pointer

   Upstream Label and Upstream LDP Session Identifier can be used to
   locate a unique Upstream LSP Control Block.

   If an LSR is using downstream-on-demand mode, it can use the Upstream
   LDP Request ID and the Upstream LDP Session Identifier to locate a
   unique Upstream LSP Control Block.

   An Next_Hop_Trigger LSP Control Block may contain the following
   information:

      -  Upstream LSP Control Block pointer, that points to the one that
         is needed to switch over to the better next hop

      -  State

      -  Downstream LSP Control Block pointer

   A Downstream LSP Control Block may contain the following information:

      -  FEC

      -  State

      -  Downstream LDP Session Identifier

      -  list of pointers to the Upstream LSP Control Blocks or the
         Trigger_Control_Blocks that are merged at this LSR for this FEC

      -  Downstream Label (assigned by the downstream LSR)

      -  Downstream Label Request ID (assigned by the LSR itself if it
         is using downstream-on-demand mode)

   Downstream Label, Downstream LDP Session Identifier can be used to
   locate a unique Downstream LSP Control Block.

   If an LSR is using downstream-on-demand mode, it can also use the
   Downstream Label Request ID and the Downstream LDP Session Identifier
   to locate a unique Downstream LSP Control Block.

   The following diagram details the relationship between these 2 types
   of control blocks:

   For example, the LSR has decided to merge 3 LDP-REQUESTs of a FEC
   from upstream LSR1, LSR2, LSR3 into one LDP-REQUEST and sent it to a
   downstream LSR4.

   -- IDLE

   This is the initial LSP state.

   -- RESPONSE_AWAITED

   This state means that the LSR has received and processed an LDP-
   REQUEST from an upstream LSR, and has sent a new LDP-REQUEST towards
   a downstream LSR.  The LSR is waiting for the LDP-MAPPING from the
   downstream LSR.

   -- ESTABLISHED

   This state means that the LSR has received the LDP-MAPPING from the
   downstream LSR and the LSP is up and operational.

   -- RELEASE_AWAITED

   This state means that the LSR has sent a LDP-WITHDRAW upstream and is
   waiting for the LDP-RELEASE before freeing up the label resource.

   -- LDP Request

   The LSR receives an LDP-REQUEST from an upstream LSR.

   -- Internal Downstream Mapping

   This event is sent by one Downstream LSP Control Block's state
   machine.  This Downstream LSP Control Block is the merged Downstream
   LSP Control Block of this Upstream LSP Control Block.  The event is
   the result of receiving an LDP-MAPPING by the Downstream LSP Control
   Block's state machine.

   -- LDP Release

   The LSR receives an LDP-RELEASE from an upstream LSR.

   -- Internal Downstream Withdraw

   This event is sent by one Downstream LSP Control Block's state
   machine.  This Downstream LSP Control Block is the merged Downstream
   LSP Control Block of this Upstream LSP Control Block.  The event is
   the result of receiving an LDP-WITHDRAW by the Downstream LSP Control
   Block's state machine.

   -- LDP Upstream Abort

   The LSR receives an LDP-ABORT from an upstream LSR.

   -- Internal Downstream NAK

   This event is sent by one Downstream LSP Control Block's state
   machine.  This Downstream LSP Control Block is the merged Downstream
   LSP Control Block of this Upstream LSP Control Block.  The event is
   the result of receiving an LDP-NAK by the Downstream LSP Control
   Block's state machine, or it detects an error.

   -- Upstream Lost

   The LSR loses the LDP session with its upstream LDP peer.

   -- Internal New NH

   The LSR detects there is better next hop and decides to establish the
   lsp through this better next hop.

   New State:      Depends upon the action routine.

   Actions:

      If this LSR is the LSP Egress or Proxy Egress [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>2</a>],

      Then:
         choose an upstream label, allocate the resources, connect this
         upstream label to the local IP forwarding module, send an LDP-
         MAPPING upstream with the upstream label and go to the state
         `ESTABLISHED'.

      else
         Obtain a next hop (or interface).  Find a Downstream LSP
         Control Block that has the same FEC and the same next hop and
         also is able to merge more input labels.  If not found, create
         a new Downstream LSP Control Block with the state `IDLE'.

         If the state of the Downstream LSP Control Block is
         `ESTABLISHED', choose an upstream label, connect the upstream
         label with the downstream label and send an LDP-MAPPING
         upstream with the upstream label, and go to the state
         `ESTABLISHED'.

         If the state of Downstream LSP Control Block is not
         `ESTABLISHED', set the state of the Upstream LSP Control Block
         to `RESPONSE_AWAITED'.  If the LSR use the independent control
         mode [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>2</a>], choose an upstream label, and send an LDP-MAPPING
         upstream.

         Pass the event `Internal AddUpstream' to the Downstream LSP
         Control Block's state machine.

      If unable to process the request for any reason, issue an LDP-NAK
      to the sender with the appropriate error code, go to IDLE and
      delete the control block.

      a) If this is a duplicate request, discard the message.  A
         duplicate request means that there is a LSP Control Block that
         has the same FEC, Upstream Label Request ID and Upstream LDP
         Session Identifier.

      b) Otherwise, create a new Upstream LSP Control Block.  Then pass
         the event `LDP Request' to this Upstream LSP Control Block's
         state machine.

   -  If an LSR receives an LDP-MAPPING:

      Locate a Downstream LSP Control Block that has the same FEC, the
      same Downstream LDP Session Identifier and the same Downstream
      Label.  If a Downstream LSP Control Block is found, pass the event
      `LDP Mapping' to its state table.  This could mean that the
      attributes of label binding have changed.

      Otherwise, use the Downstream LDP request ID (the 'Label Request
      Message ID' field in the LDP-MAPPING) and Downstream LDP Session
      Identifier to locate the Downstream LSP Control Block and pass the

      Control Block is found, ignore the message.

   -  If an LSR receives an LDP-RELEASE:

      Locate an Upstream LSP Control Block that has the same FEC, the
      same Upstream Label, the same Upstream LDP Session Identifier.  If
      no Upstream LSP Control Block is found, ignore the message.  If an
      Upstream LSP Control Block is found, send the event `LDP Release'
      to its state machine.

      Find a Downstream LSP Control Block that has the same FEC, the
      same Downstream LDP Session Identifier and the same Downstream
      Label.  Pass the event `LDP Withdraw' to its state machines.

      Pass the event `Upstream Lost' to the state machines of all the
      Upstream LSP Control Blocks whose upstream LDP peer is that LSR.

      Pass the event `Downstream Lost' to the state machines of all the
      Downstream LSP Control Blocks whose downstream LDP peer is that
      LSR.

   -  If a next hop of an FEC is changed:

      For all the Upstream LSP Control Blocks that are affected by this
      change, pass the event `Internal New NH' to their state machines.

   -  If an LSR receives an LDP-ABORT from an upstream LSR:

      Use the Upstream LDP Request ID and Upstream LDP Session
      Identifier to locate the Upstream LSP Control Block and pass the
      event `LDP Abort' to its state machine.

   -  If an LSR receives an LDP-NAK from a downstream LSR:

      Use the Downstream LDP Request ID and Downstream Session
      Identifier to locate a Downstream_LSP_control_block and pass the
      event `LDP Downstream NAK' to its state machine.

   The following sections describe the state machines for the ATM-LSR
   that uses downstream unsolicited mode.

   While both independent LSP control and ordered LSP control modes are
   possible, only the ordered mode is taken into account, because the
   independent LSP control mode uses the liberal label retention mode
   and so is considered burning too many ATM resources.

   In downstream unsolicited mode, multiple path is not supported in
   this version and will be For Further Study (FFS).  We suspect with
   multiple next hops and Downstream mode, it is easy to get into a loop
   condition.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1%20Control%20Block"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a> Control Block</span>

   There are 2 types of control blocks involved: Upstream LSP Control
   Block, Downstream LSP Control Block.

   There is a list of Upstream LSP Control Blocks for each FEC in the
   routing table, with each one corresponding to a LDP peer.  A Upstream
   LSP Control Block is created for each FEC when there is a label ready
   to be distributed to that upstream.  It is deleted when the FEC is
   deleted from the FEC table, or the LDP peer disappears, or the
   downstream label is withdrawn.

   There is one Downstream LSP Control Blocks for each FEC in the
   routing table.  It is created when the FEC is inserted into the
   forwarding table and deleted when the FEC is removed from the
   forwarding table.

   An Upstream LSP Control Block may contain the following information:

      -  Upstream LDP Session Identifier

      -  State

      -  Upstream Label (assigned by this LSR)

      -  FEC

   Upstream Label and Upstream LDP Session Identifier, or FEC and
   Upstream LDP Session Identifier can be used to locate a unique
   Upstream LSP Control Block.

   A Downstream LSP Control Block may contain the following information:

      -  FEC

      -  State

      -  Downstream LDP Session Identifier

      -  Downstream Label (assigned by the downstream LSR)

   Downstream Label and Downstream LDP Session Identifier, or FEC and
   Downstream LDP Session Identifier can be used to locate a unique
   Downstream LSP Control Block.

   -- IDLE

   This is the initial LSP state.

   -- ESTABLISHED

   This state means that the LSR has received the LDP-MAPPING from the
   downstream LSR and the LSP is up and operational.

   -- RELEASE_AWAITED

   This state means that the LSR is waiting for the LDP-RELEASE in
   respond to the LDP-WITHDRAW sent by this LSR.

   -- RESOURCES_AWAITED

   This state means that the LSR is waiting for the label resources.

      If there is a next hop for this FEC and there is a
      Downstream_Control_Block for this FEC whose state is
      `ESTABLISHED', create a new Upstream_Control_Block and pass
      `internal Mapping' event to its state machine.

      Locate a Downstream LSP Control Block that has the same FEC, the
      same Downstream LDP Session Identifier and the same Downstream
      Label.  If a Downstream LSP Control Block is found, pass the event
      `LDP Mapping' to its state table.  This could mean that the
      attributes of label binding have changed.

      Otherwise, if there is no matching Downstream LSP Control Block
      found, find a Downstream LSP Control Block of this FEC and its
      next hop is the this downstream peer, pass the event `LDP Mapping'
      to its state machine.

   -  If an LSR receives an LDP-RELEASE:

      Locate an Upstream LSP Control Block that has the same FEC, the
      same Upstream Label, the same Upstream LDP Session Identifier.  If
      no Upstream LSP Control Block is found, ignore the message.  If an
      Upstream LSP Control Block is found, send the event `LDP Release'

   -  If an LSR receives an LDP-WITHDRAW:

      Find a Downstream LSP Control Block that has the same FEC, the
      same Downstream LDP Session Identifier and the same Downstream
      Label.  Pass the event `LDP Withdraw' to its state machines.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   This document is provided as an informational extension of the LDP
   specification [<a href="#ref-4" title='"LDP Specification"'>4</a>].  State machines presented here are intended to
   clarify procedures defined in the LDP specification, but do not
   supplant or override definitions and procedures provided there.

   Implementations of a state machine may be vulnerable to spurious
   events generated by an external source.  In this document, events
   fall in two categories: internal events and external events caused by
   receipt of an LDP message.

   LDP messages may be protected using mechanisms described in the LDP
   specification.  See "Security Considerations" in the LDP
   specification [<a href="#ref-4" title='"LDP Specification"'>4</a>].

   Security considerations relating to generation of spurious internal
   events are not addressed in this document.
