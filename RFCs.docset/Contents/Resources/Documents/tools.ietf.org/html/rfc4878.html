   The IEEE 802.3ah Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) taskforce added new
   management capabilities to Ethernet-like interfaces.  These
   management capabilities were introduced to provide some basic Ordered
   Aggregate (OA) function on Ethernet media.  The defined functionality
   includes discovery, error signaling, loopback, and link monitoring.
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community
   to manage these new Ethernet interface capabilities.

   Ethernet networks have evolved over the past 30 years from simple
   LANs to a variety of other applications, including wide-area
   networks.  To address some of these emerging markets, the IEEE
   802.3ah taskforce defined additional clauses in [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>] for the
   IEEE 802.3 standard [<a href="#ref-802.3-2002" title='"IEEE Standard for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters"'>802.3-2002</a>] to better address Ethernet
   deployments in the public-access network.  Although Ethernet-access
   deployments were the primary motivation for the taskforce activity,
   the results of the taskforce are not strictly limited to that
   application.  Ethernet OAM can be implemented on Ethernet links that
   are not EFM.

   The Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) taskforce was focused on four
   somewhat independent objectives to better address Ethernet access
   deployments: optics, copper, Ethernet passive optical networks
   (Ethernet PON, or EPON), and operations, administration, and
   maintenance (OAM).  The optics sub-taskforce developed new optical
   physical layers that better served the long-reach outside plant
   networks typically found in the access network, including developing
   physical layers that operate up to 20 Km and supporting the
   environmental conditions of access deployments.  The copper sub-
   taskforce developed two new physical layers that run Ethernet
   natively over existing twisted pair wires that have been supporting
   voice services for decades.  The EPON sub-taskforce developed a new
   point-to-multipoint Ethernet physical layer, utilizing Ethernet
   framing natively over a time-division multiple-access (TDMA)
   infrastructure.  The OAM sub-taskforce introduced some basic
   management functionality into an Ethernet link to better monitor and
   maintain Ethernet networks in geographically disparate networks.

   This document defines the management objects necessary to integrate
   Ethernet OAM functionality into the SNMP management framework.

   Ethernet OAM is composed of a core set of functions and a set of
   optional functional groups.  The mandatory functions include
   discovery operations (determining if the other end of the link is OA
   capable and what OAM functions it supports), state machine
   implementation, and some critical event flows.  The optional
   functional groups are for (a) link events, (b) remote loopback, and
   (c) variable retrieval and response.  Each optional functional group
   is controlled by a separate MIB table(s).

   Ethernet OAM is complementary with SNMP management in that it
   provides some basic management functions at layer two, rather than
   using layer three and above as required by SNMP over an IP
   infrastructure.  Ethernet OAM provides single-hop functionality in
   that it works only between two directly connected Ethernet stations.
   SNMP can be used to manage the Ethernet OAM interactions of one
   Ethernet station with another.

   Ethernet OAM has three functional objectives, which are detailed in
   the next three sections.  The definition of a basic Ethernet OA
   protocol data unit is given in <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

   Remote fault indication provides a mechanism for one end of an
   Ethernet link to signal the other end that the receive path is non-
   operational.  Some Ethernet physical layers offer mechanisms to
   signal this condition at the physical layer.  Ethernet OAM added a
   mechanism so that some Ethernet physical layers can operate in
   unidirectional mode, allowing frames to be transmitted in one
   direction even when the other direction is non-operational.
   Traditionally, Ethernet PHYs do not allow frame transmission in one
   direction if the other direction is not operational.  Using this
   mode, Ethernet OAM allows frame-based signaling of remote fault
   conditions while still not allowing higher-layer applications to be
   aware of the unidirectional capability.  This document includes
   mechanisms for capturing that fault information and reflecting such
   information in objects and notifications within the SNMP management
   framework.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Link%20Monitoring"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Link Monitoring</span>

   Ethernet OAM includes event signaling capability so that one end of
   an Ethernet link can indicate the occurrence of certain important
   events to the other end of the link.  This happens via layer two
   protocols.  This document defines methods for incorporating the
   occurrence of these layer two events, both at the local end and far
   end of the link, into the SNMP management framework.

   Ethernet OAM also includes mechanisms for one Ethernet station to
   query another directly connected Ethernet station about the status of
   its Ethernet interface variables and status.  This document does not
   include mechanisms for controlling how one Ethernet endpoint may use
   this functionality to query the status or statistics of a peer
   Ethernet entity.

   Remote loopback is a link state where the peer Ethernet entity echoes
   every received packet (without modifications) back onto the link.
   Remote loopback is intrusive in that the other end of the link is not
   forwarding traffic from higher layers out over the link.  This
   document defines objects controlling loopback operation and reading
   the status of the loopback state.

   An Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame with a
   destination Media Access Control (MAC) address equal to the reserved
   MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>]), a lengthOrType
   field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, and a Slow
   Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for Ethernet
   OAM.

   OAMPDU is used throughout this document as an abbreviation for
   Ethernet OAM protocol data unit.  OAMPDUs are the mechanism by which
   two directly connected Ethernet interfaces exchange OA information.

   The Ethernet OAM MIB objects of this memo focus on the OA
   capabilities introduced in [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>].  The MIB objects are
   partitioned into six different MIB groups.

   The dot3OamTable group manages the primary OAM objects of the
   Ethernet interface.  This group controls the state and status of OA
   as well as the mode in which it operates.

   The dot3OamPeerTable maintains the current information on the status
   and configuration of the peer OAM entity on the Ethernet interface.
   Managed information includes the capabilities and function available
   on the peer OAM entity.

   The dot3OamLoopbackTable manages the loopback function introduced in
   [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>].  This table controls enabling and disabling loopback, as
   well as indicating the loopback status of Ethernet OAM on this
   interface.

   The dot3OamStatsTable maintains statistics on the number and type of
   Ethernet OAM frames being transmitted and received on the Ethernet
   interface.

   The dot3OamEventConfigTable defines the objects for managing the
   event notification capability available in Ethernet OAM.  With
   Ethernet OAM, one device may send notifications to its peer devices
   whenever an important event happens on the local device.  This table
   provides management of which events result in notifications via
   Ethernet OAM notifications and/or via SNMP notifications.

   The dot3OamEventLogTable manages the current status of local and
   remote events detected via Ethernet OAM.  This table is updated
   whenever local events are detected by Ethernet OAM or whenever
   Ethernet OAM Event Notifications are received from the peer OA
   entity.

   There are two notifications defined to report Ethernet OAM events
   (one for threshold crossing events, one for non-threshold crossing
   events).  Both notifications are contained within the same
   conformance group.

        DESCRIPTION
          "The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features
          introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile taskforce (IEEE
          802.3ah).  The functionality presented here is based on IEEE
          802.3ah [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>], released in October, 2004.  [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>] was
          prepared as an addendum to the standing version of IEEE 802.3
          [<a href="#ref-802.3-2002" title='"IEEE Standard for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters"'>802.3-2002</a>].  Since then, [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>] has been
          merged into the base IEEE 802.3 specification in [<a href="#ref-802.3-2005" title='"IEEE Standard for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters"'>802.3-2005</a>].

          In particular, this MIB focuses on the new OAM functions
          introduced in Clause 57 of [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>].  The OAM functionality
          of Clause 57 is controlled by new management attributes
          introduced in Clause 30 of [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>].  The OAM functions are
          not specific to any particular Ethernet physical layer, and
          can be generically applied to any Ethernet interface of
          [<a href="#ref-802.3-2002" title='"IEEE Standard for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters"'>802.3-2002</a>].

          An Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame
          with a destination MAC address equal to the reserved MAC
          address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications - Amendment: Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for Subscriber Access Networks"'>802.3ah</a>]), a
          lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow
          Protocols, and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the
          subtype reserved for Ethernet OAM.  OAMPDU is used throughout
          this document as an abbreviation for Ethernet OAM protocol
          data unit.

          The following reference is used throughout this MIB module:

          the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to
          determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The
          progress of this initialization is controlled by the OA
          sublayer.

          This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this
          interface via the dot3OamAdminState.

          If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs
          with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2).
          Also, if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is
          not up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned.  Note that the object
          ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or
          administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or
          testing(3)).

          The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
          passive mode (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the
          OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OA
          capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode
          devices (dot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively
          trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has
          not yet made that determination.

          The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OA
          entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or
          rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,
          for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is
          unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity
          rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes
          oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed
          by the local device, the state moves to
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states
          fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state
          diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being
          whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering
          or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering
          decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field
          in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of
          30.3.6.1.10).

          If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state
          becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)
          states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the
          difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected

          via the remote flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the
          aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).

          When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote
          OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to
          operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].

          Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work
          completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value
          nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is
          enabled (dot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)), but the interface
          is in half-duplex operation.

          that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate
          monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while
          passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OA
          actions with it.  As an example, an active OAM entity can put
          the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OA
          entity cannot.

          The default value of dot3OamMode is dependent on the type of
          system on which this Ethernet-like interface resides.  The
          default value should be 'active(2)' unless it is known that
          this system should take on a subservient role to the other
          device connected over this interface.

          Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration

          potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the

          multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states,
          as well as by the actions of the local OAM client.  When
          operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the
          status reads noLoopback(1).

          The values initiatingLoopback(2) and terminatingLoopback(4)
          can be read or written.  The other values can only be read -
          they can never be written.  Writing initiatingLoopback causes
          the local OAM entity to start the loopback process with its

          noLoopback(1).  Writing the value initiatingLoopback(2) in any

          the termination of the loopback state.  Writing
          terminatingLoopack(4) in any other state has no effect.

          If the OAM client initiates a loopback and has sent a
          Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local
          parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah,
          57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'.  In this
          case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any

          loopback command request.

          30.3.6.1.14] with its local multiplexer and parser states in
          DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4).  If the remote
          OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as
          indicated by its local parser state, the status is
          localLoopback(5).

          The unknown(6) status indicates that the parser and

        DESCRIPTION
          "A count of the number of frames that were dropped by the OA
          multiplexer.  Since the OAM multiplexer has multiple inputs
          and a single output, there may be cases where frames are
          dropped due to transmit resource contention.  This counter is
          incremented whenever a frame is dropped by the OAM layer.
          Note that any Ethernet frame, not just OAMPDUs, may be dropped
          by the OAM layer.  This can occur when an OAMPDU takes
          precedence over a 'normal' frame resulting in the 'normal'
          frame being dropped.

          When this counter is incremented, no other counters in this
          MIB are incremented.

          Discontinuities of this counter can occur at re-initialization
          of the management system, and at other times as indicated by
          the value of the ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

          Notifications and configure the thresholds to generate the
          standard Ethernet OAM events.  There is one entry in the table
          for every entry in dot3OamTable that supports OAM events
          (where dot3OamFunctionsSupported includes the eventSupport
          bit set).  The values in the table are maintained across
          changes to dot3OamOperStatus.

          The standard threshold crossing events are:
            - Errored Symbol Period Event.  Generated when the number of
              symbol errors exceeds a threshold within a given window
              defined by a number of symbols (for example, 1,000 symbols
              out of 1,000,000 had errors).
            - Errored Frame Period Event.  Generated when the number of
              frame errors exceeds a threshold within a given window
              defined by a number of frames (for example, 10 frames out
              of 1000 had errors).
            - Errored Frame Event.  Generated when the number of frame
              errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined
              by a period of time (for example, 10 frames in 1 second
              had errors).
            - Errored Frame Seconds Summary Event.  Generated when the
              number of errored frame seconds exceeds a threshold within
              a given time period (for example, 10 errored frame seconds
              within the last 100 seconds).  An errored frame second is
              defined as a 1 second interval which had &gt;0 frame errors.
          There are other events (dying gasp, critical events) that are
          not threshold crossing events but which can be
          enabled/disabled via this table.

   The readable objects in this module can provide information about
   network traffic, and therefore may be considered sensitive.  In
   particular, OAM provides mechanisms for reading the IEEE 802.3 Clause
   30 MIB attributes from a link partner via a specialized layer two
   protocol.  Unlike SNMP, IEEE P802.3ah OAM does not include encryption
   or authentication mechanisms.  It should be used in environments
   where either this interface information is not considered sensitive,
   or where the facility terminations are protected.  By default, OAM is
   disabled on Ethernet-like interfaces and is therefore not a risk.

   IEEE 802.3ah OAM is designed to support deployment in access and
   enterprise networks.  In access networks, one end of a link is the
   CO-side, and the other is the CPE-side, and the facilities are often
   protected in wiring cages or closets.  In such deployments, it is
   often the case that the CO-side is protected from access from the
   CPE-side.  Within IEEE P802.3ah OAM, this protection from remote
   access is accomplished by configuring the CPE-side in passive mode
   using the dot3OamMode attribute.  This prevents the CPE from
   accessing functions and information at the CO-side of the connection.
   In enterprise networks, read-only interface information is often
   considered non-sensitive.

   The frequency of OAM PDUs on an Ethernet interface does not adversely
   affect data traffic, as OAM is a slow protocol with very limited
   bandwidth potential, and it is not required for normal link
   operation.  And although there are a number of objects in this module
   with read-write or read-create MAX-ACCESS, they have limited effects
   on user data.

   The loopback capability of OAM can have potentially disruptive
   effects in that the when enabling remote loopback, the remote station
   automatically transmits all received traffic back to the local
   station except for OAM traffic.  This completely disrupts all higher



<span class="grey">Squire                      Standards Track                    [Page 52]</span></pre>

   layer protocols such as bridging, IP, and SNMP.  Therefore an
   attribute (dot3OamLoopbackIgnoreRx) was introduced to control whether
   the local station processes or ignores received loopback commands.

   The administrative state and mode are also read-write objects.
   Disabling OAM can interrupt management activities between peer
   devices, potentially causing serious problems.  Setting the
   dot3OamMode to an undesired value can allow access to Ethernet
   monitoring, events, and functions that may not be acceptable in a
   particular deployment scenario.  In addition to loopback
   functionality, Ethernet interface statistics and events can be
   accessed via the OAM protocol, which may not be desired in some
   circumstances.

   OAM event configuration also contains read-write objects.  These
   objects control whether events are sent, and at what thresholds.
   Note that the frequency of event communication is limited by the
   frequency limits of Slow Protocols on Ethernet interfaces.  Also, the
   information available via OAM events is also available via OA
   Variable Requests.  Access to this information via either OAM events
   or Variable Requests is controlled by the dot3OamAdminState and
   dot3OamMode objects.  As mentioned previously, inadequate protection
   of these variables can result in access to link information and
   functions.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="rfc3410.html#section-8">[RFC3410], section 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
