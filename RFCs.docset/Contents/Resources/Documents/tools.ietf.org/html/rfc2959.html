   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

      o  An overall architecture, described in <a href="rfc2571.html">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].

      o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
         purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
         STD 16, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="rfc1155.html" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>RFC1155</a>], STD 16, <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="rfc1212.html" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>RFC1212</a>] and <a href="rfc1215.html">RFC</a>
         <a href="rfc1215.html">1215</a> [<a href="rfc1215.html" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>RFC1215</a>].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
         in STD 58, <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="rfc2578.html" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="rfc2579.html" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a>
         [<a href="rfc2580.html" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

      o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
         described in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="rfc1157.html" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>].  A second version of
         the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
         track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="rfc1901.html">RFC 1901</a>
         [<a href="rfc1901.html" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>RFC1901</a>] and <a href="rfc1906.html">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="rfc1906.html" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>].  The third version of the
         message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in <a href="rfc1906.html">RFC 1906</a>
         [<a href="rfc1906.html" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>], <a href="rfc2572.html">RFC 2572</a> [<a href="rfc2572.html" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2572</a>] and <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="rfc2574.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2574</a>].

      o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
         first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
         described in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="rfc1157.html" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>].  A second set of
         protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
         <a href="rfc1905.html">RFC 1905</a> [<a href="rfc1905.html" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1905</a>].

      o  A set of fundamental applications described in <a href="rfc2573.html">RFC 2573</a>
         [<a href="rfc2573.html" title='"SNMPv3 Applications"'>RFC2573</a>] and the view-based access control mechanism described
         in <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="rfc2575.html" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in <a href="rfc2570.html">RFC 2570</a> [<a href="rfc2570.html" title='"Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC2570</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable

   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Overview</span>

   An "RTP System" may be a host end-system that runs an application
   program that sends or receives RTP data packets, or it may be an
   intermediate-system that forwards RTP packets.  RTP Control Protocol
   (RTCP) packets are sent by senders and receivers to convey
   information about RTP packet transmission and reception [<a href="rfc1889.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for real-time applications,"'>RFC1889</a>].
   RTP monitors may collect RTCP information on senders and receivers to
   and from an RTP host or intermediate-system.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20Components"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a> Components</span>

   The RTP MIB is structured around "Session," "Receiver" and "Sender"
   conceptual abstractions.

   2.1.1  An "RTP Session" is the "...association of participants
   communicating with RTP.  For each participant, the session is defined
   by a particular pair of destination transport addresses (one network
   address plus a port pair for RTP and RTCP).  The destination
   transport addresses may be common for all participants, as in the
   case of IP multicast, or may be different for each, as in the case of

   <a href="rfc1889.html#section-3">section 3 of [RFC1889]</a>.

   2.1.2 A "Sender" is identified within an RTP session by a 32-bit
   numeric "Synchronization Source," or "SSRC", value and is "...the
   source of a stream of RTP packets" as defined in <a href="rfc1889.html#section-3">section 3 of
   [RFC1889]</a>.  The sender is also a source of RTCP Sender Report packets
   as specified in <a href="rfc1889.html#section-6">section 6 of [RFC1889]</a>.

   2.1.3 A "Receiver" of a "stream of RTP packets" can be a unicast or
   multicast Receiver as described in 2.1.1, above.  An RTP Receiver has
   an SSRC value that is unique to the session.  An RTP Receiver is a
   source of RTCP Receiver Reports as specified in <a href="rfc1889.html#section-6">section 6 of

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2%20Applicability%20of%20the%20MIB%20to%20RTP%20System%20Implementations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a> Applicability of the MIB to RTP System Implementations</span>

   The RTP MIB may be used in two types of RTP implementations, RTP Host
   Systems (end systems) and RTP Monitors, see <a href="rfc1889.html#section-3">section 3 of [RFC1889]</a>.
   Use of the RTP MIB for RTP Translators and Mixers, as defined in
   <a href="rfc1889.html#section-7">section 7 of [RFC1889]</a>, is for further study.

   2.2.1 RTP host Systems are end-systems that may use the RTP MIB to
   collect RTP session and stream data that the host is sending or
   receiving; these data may be used by a network manager to detect and
   diagnose faults that occur over the lifetime of an RTP session as in
   a "help-desk" scenario.

   2.2.2 RTP Monitors of multicast RTP sessions may be third-party or
   may be located in the RTP host.  RTP Monitors may use the RTP MIB to
   collect RTP session and stream statistical data; these data may be
   used by a network manager for capacity planning and other network-
   management purposes.  An RTP Monitor may use the RTP MIB to collect
   data to permit a network manager to detect and diagnose faults in RTP
   sessions or to permit a network manger to configure its operation.

   2.2.3 Many host systems will want to keep track of streams beyond
   what they are sending and receiving.  In a host monitor system, a
   host agent would use RTP data from the host to maintain data about
   streams it is sending and receiving, and RTCP data to collect data
   about other hosts in the session.  For example, an agent for an RTP
   host that is sending a stream would use data from its RTP system to
   maintain the rtpSenderTable, but it may want to maintain a
   rtpRcvrTable for endpoints that are receiving its stream.  To do this
   the RTP agent will collect RTCP data from the receivers of its stream
   to build the rtpRcvrTable.  A host monitor system MUST set the
   rtpSessionMonitor object to 'true(1)', but it does not have to accept
   management operations that create and destroy rows in its
   rtpSessionTable.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3%20%20The%20Structure%20of%20the%20RTP%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>  The Structure of the RTP MIB</span>

   There are six tables in the RTP MIB.  The rtpSessionTable contains
   objects that describe active sessions at the host, or monitor.  The
   rtpSenderTable contains information about senders to the RTP session.
   The rtpRcvrTable contains information about receivers of RTP session
   data.  The rtpSessionInverseTable, rtpSenderInverseTable, and
   rtpRcvrInverseTable contain information to efficiently find indexes
   into the rtpSessionTable, rtpSenderTable, and rtpRcvrTable,
   respectively.

   The reverse lookup tables (rtpSessionInverseTable,
   rtpSenderInverseTable, and rtpRcvrInverseTable) are optional tables
   to help management applications efficiently access conceptual rows in
   other tables.  Implementors of this MIB SHOULD implement these tables
   for multicast RTP sessions when table indexes (rtpSessionIndex of
   rtpSessionTable, rtpSenderSSRC of rtpSenderTable, and the SSRC pair
   in the rtpRcvrTable) are not available from other MIBs.  Otherwise,
   the management application may be forced to perform expensive tree
   walks through large numbers of sessions, senders, or receivers.

   For any particular RTP session, the rtpSessionMonitor object
   indicates whether remote senders or receivers to the RTP session are
   to be monitored.  If rtpSessionMonitor is true(1) then senders and
   receivers to the session MUST be monitored with entries in the
   rtpSenderTable and rtpRcvrTable.  RTP sessions are monitored by the
   RTP agent that updates rtpSenderTable and rtpRcvrTable objects with
   information from RTCP reports from remote senders or remote receivers
   respectively.

   rtpSessionNewIndex is a global object that permits a network-
   management application to obtain a unique index for conceptual row
   creation in the rtpSessionTable.  In this way the SNMP Set operation
   MAY be used to configure a monitor.

        DESCRIPTION
        "The managed objects of RTP systems.  The MIB is
        structured around three types of information.
        1. General information about RTP sessions such
           as the session address.
        2. Information about RTP streams being sent to
           an RTP session by a particular sender.
        3. Information about RTP streams received on an
           RTP session by a particular receiver from a
           particular sender.
         There are two types of RTP Systems, RTP hosts and
         RTP monitors.  As described below, certain objects
         are unique to a particular type of RTP System.   An
         RTP host may also function as an RTP monitor.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   In most cases, MIBs are not themselves security risks; if SNMP
   security is operating as intended, the use of a MIB to view
   information about a system, or to change some parameter at the
   system, is a tool, not a threat.  However, there are a number of
   management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause
   of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support
   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   None of the read-only objects in this MIB reports a password, though
   some SDES [<a href="rfc1889.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for real-time applications,"'>RFC1889</a>] items such as the CNAME [<a href="rfc1889.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for real-time applications,"'>RFC1889</a>], the canonical
   name, may be deemed sensitive depending on the security policies of a
   particular enterprise.  If access to these objects is not limited by
   an appropriate access control policy, these objects can provide an
   attacker with information about a system's configuration and the
   services that that system is providing.  Some enterprises view their
   network and system configurations, as well as information about usage
   and performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to
   restrict SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.  This MIB
   supports read-write operations against rtpSessionNewIndex which has
   the side effect of creating an entry in the rtpSessionTable when it
   is written to.  Five objects in rtpSessionEntry have read-create
   access: rtpSessionDomain, rtpSessionRemAddr, rtpSessionIfIndex,
   rtpSessionRowStatus, and rtpSessionIfAddr identify an RTP session to
   be monitored on a particular interface.  The values of these objects
   are not to be changed once created, and initialization of these
   objects affects only the monitoring of an RTP session and not the
   operation of an RTP session on any host end-system.  Since write
   operations to rtpSessionNewIndex and the five objects in
   rtpSessionEntry affect the operation of the monitor, write access to
   these objects should be subject to the appropriate access control
   policy.

   Confidentiality of RTP and RTCP data packets is defined in <a href="#section-9">section 9</a>
   of the RTP specification [<a href="rfc1889.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for real-time applications,"'>RFC1889</a>].  Encryption may be performed on
   RTP packets, RTCP packets, or both.  Encryption of RTCP packets may
   pose a problem for third-party monitors though "For RTCP, it is
   allowed to split a compound RTCP packet into two lower-layer packets,
   one to be encrypted and one to be sent in the clear.  For example,
   SDES information might be encrypted while reception reports were sent
   in the clear to accommodate third-party monitors [<a href="rfc1889.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for real-time applications,"'>RFC1889</a>]."

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET

   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.  It is
   recommended that the implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the
   User-based Security Model <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="rfc2574.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2574</a>] and the View-based
   Access Control Model <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="rfc2575.html" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>] is recommended.  It is then a
   customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving
   access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   The authors wish to thank Bert Wijnen and the participants from the
   ITU SG-16 management effort for their helpful comments.  Alan Batie
   and Bill Lewis from Intel also contributed greatly to the RTP MIB
   through their review of various drafts of the MIB and their work on
   the implementation of an SNMP RTP Monitor.  Stan Naudus from 3Com and
   John Du from Intel contributed to the original RTP MIB design and
   co-authored the original RTP MIB draft documents; much of their work
   remains in the current RTP MIB.  Bill Fenner provided solid feedback
   that improved the quality of the final document.
