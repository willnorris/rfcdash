Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the third
   version of the Internet-standard Management Framework, termed the
   SNMP version 3 Framework (SNMPv3).  This Framework is derived from
   and builds upon both the original Internet-standard Management
   Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-standard Management
   Framework (SNMPv2).

   The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of
   the Framework over time.

   This document is an introduction to the third version of the
   Internet-standard Management Framework, termed the SNMP version 3
   Management Framework (SNMPv3) and has multiple purposes.

   First, it describes the relationship between the SNMP version 3
   (SNMPv3) specifications and the specifications of the SNMP version 1
   (SNMPv1) Management Framework, the SNMP version 2 (SNMPv2) Management
   Framework, and the Community-based Administrative Framework for
   SNMPv2.

   Second, it provides a roadmap to the multiple documents which contain
   the relevant specifications.

   Third, this document provides a brief easy-to-read summary of the
   contents of each of the relevant specification documents.

   This document is intentionally tutorial in nature and, as such, may
   occasionally be "guilty" of oversimplification.  In the event of a
   conflict or contradiction between this document and the more detailed
   documents for which this document is a roadmap, the specifications in

   the more detailed documents shall prevail.

   Further, the detailed documents attempt to maintain separation
   between the various component modules in order to specify well-
   defined interfaces between them.  This roadmap document, however,
   takes a different approach and attempts to provide an integrated view
   of the various component modules in the interest of readability.

   The third version of the Internet Standard Management Framework (the
   SNMPv3 Framework) is derived from and builds upon both the original
   Internet-standard Management Framework (SNMPv1) and the second
   Internet-standard Management Framework (SNMPv2).

   All versions (SNMPv1, SNMPv2, and SNMPv3) of the Internet Standard
   Management Framework share the same basic structure and components.
   Furthermore, all versions of the specifications of the Internet
   Standard Management Framework follow the same architecture.

   An enterprise deploying the Internet Standard Management Framework
   contains four basic components:

     * several (typically many) managed nodes, each with an SNMP entity
       which provides remote access to management instrumentation
       (traditionally called an agent);

     * at least one SNMP entity with management applications (typically
       called a manager),

     * a management protocol used to convey management information
       between the SNMP entities, and

     * management information.

   The management protocol is used to convey management information
   between SNMP entities such as managers and agents.

   This basic structure is common to all versions of the Internet
   Standard Management Framework; i.e., SNMPv1, SNMPv2, and SNMPv3.

   The specifications of the Internet Standard Management Framework are
   based on a modular architecture.  This framework is more than just a
   protocol for moving data.  It consists of:

     * definitions of management information (the Management
       Information Base, or MIB),

     * a protocol definition, and

     * security and administration.

   Over time, as the Framework has evolved from SNMPv1, through SNMPv2,
   to SNMPv3, the definitions of each of these architectural components
   have become richer and more clearly defined, but the fundamental
   architecture has remained consistent.

   One prime motivator for this modularity was to enable the ongoing
   evolution of the Framework as is documented in <a href="rfc1052.html">RFC 1052</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"IAB Recommendations for the Development of Internet Network Management Standards"'>14</a>].  When
   originally envisioned, this capability was to be used to ease the
   transition from SNMP-based management of internets to management
   based on OSI protocols.  To this end, the framework was architected
   with a protocol-independent data definition language and Management
   Information Base along with a MIB-independent protocol.  This
   separation was designed to allow the SNMP-based protocol to be
   replaced without requiring the management information to be redefined
   or reinstrumented.  History has shown that the selection of this
   architecture was the right decision for the wrong reason -- it turned
   out that this architecture has eased the transition from SNMPv1 to
   SNMPv2 and from SNMPv2 to SNMPv3 rather than easing the transition
   away from management based on the Simple Network Management Protocol.

   The SNMPv3 Framework builds and extends these architectural
   principles by:

     * building on these four basic architectural components, in some
       cases incorporating them from the SNMPv2 Framework by reference,
       and

     * by using these same layering principles in the definition of new
       capabilities in the security and administration portion of the
       architecture.

   Those who are familiar with the architecture of the SNMPv1 Management
   Framework and the SNMPv2 Management Framework will find many familiar
   concepts in the architecture of the SNMPv3 Management Framework.
   However, in some cases, the terminology may be somewhat different.

   The original Internet-standard Network Management Framework (SNMPv1)
   is defined in the following documents:

     * STD 16, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>1</a>] which defines the Structure of Management
       Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and naming
       objects for the purpose of management.

     * STD 16, <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>2</a>] which defines a more concise description
       mechanism for describing and naming management information objects,
       but which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

     * STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>3</a>] which defines the Simple Network Management
       Protocol (SNMP), the protocol used for network access to managed
       objects and event notification. Note this document also defines an
       initial set of event notifications.

   Additionally, two documents are generally considered to be companions
   to these three:

     * STD 17, <a href="rfc1213.html">RFC 1213</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title="K. and M. Rose">13</a>] which contains definitions for the base
       set of management information

     * <a href="rfc1215.html">RFC 1215</a> [<a href="#ref-25" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>25</a>] defines a concise description mechanism for
       defining event notifications, which are called traps in the SNMPv1
       protocol. It also specifies the generic traps from <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> in the
       concise notation.

   These documents describe the four parts of the first version of the
   SNMP Framework.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1%20The%20SNMPv1%20Data%20Definition%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a> The SNMPv1 Data Definition Language</span>

   The first two and the last document describe the SNMPv1 data
   definition language.   Note that due to the initial requirement that
   the SMI be protocol-independent, the first two SMI documents do not
   provide a means for defining event notifications (traps).  Instead,
   the SNMP protocol document defines a few standardized event
   notifications (generic traps) and provides a means for additional
   event notifications to be defined. The last document specifies a
   straight-forward approach towards defining event notifications used
   with the SNMPv1 protocol. At the time that it was written, use of
   traps in the Internet-standard network management framework was
   controversial.  As such, <a href="rfc1215.html">RFC 1215</a> was put forward with the status of
   "Informational", which was never updated because it was believed that
   the second version of the SNMP Framework would replace the first
   version.  Note that the SNMPv1 data definition language is sometimes

   referred to as SMIv1.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2%20Management%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a> Management Information</span>

   The data definition language described in the first two documents was
   first used to define the now-historic MIB-I as specified in <a href="rfc1066.html">RFC 1066</a>
   [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based Internets"'>12</a>], and was subsequently used to define MIB-II as specified in <a href="rfc1213.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc1213.html">1213</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title="K. and M. Rose">13</a>].

   Later, after the publication of MIB-II, a different approach to
   management information definition was taken from the earlier approach
   of having a single committee staffed by generalists work on a single
   document to define the Internet-standard MIB.  Rather, many mini-MIB
   documents were produced in a parallel and distributed fashion by
   groups chartered to produce a specification for a focused portion of
   the Internet-standard MIB and staffed by personnel with expertise in
   those particular areas ranging from various aspects of network
   management, to system management, and application management.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3%20Protocol%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a> Protocol Operations</span>

   The third document, STD 15, describes the SNMPv1 protocol operations
   performed by protocol data units (PDUs) on lists of variable bindings
   and describes the format of SNMPv1 messages. The operators defined by
   SNMPv1 are:  get, get-next, get-response, set-request, and trap.
   Typical layering of SNMP on a connectionless transport service is
   also defined.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.4%20SNMPv1%20Security%20and%20Administration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" name="section-3.4">3.4</a> SNMPv1 Security and Administration</span>

   STD 15 also describes an approach to security and administration.
   Many of these concepts are carried forward and some, particularly
   security, are extended by the SNMPv3 Framework.

   The SNMPv1 Framework describes the encapsulation of SNMPv1 PDUs in
   SNMP messages between SNMP entities and distinguishes between
   application entities and protocol entities.  In SNMPv3, these are
   renamed applications and engines, respectively.

   The SNMPv1 Framework also introduces the concept of an authentication
   service supporting one or more authentication schemes.  In addition
   to authentication, SNMPv3 defines the additional security capability
   referred to as privacy.  (Note: some literature from the security
   community would describe SNMPv3 security capabilities as providing
   data integrity, source authenticity, and confidentiality.)  The
   modular nature of the SNMPv3 Framework permits both changes and
   additions to the security capabilities.




<span class="grey">Case, et al.                 Informational                      [Page 6]</span></pre>

   Finally, the SNMPv1 Framework introduces access control based on a
   concept called an SNMP MIB view.  The SNMPv3 Framework specifies a
   fundamentally similar concept called view-based access control.  With
   this capability, SNMPv3 provides the means for controlling access to
   information on managed devices.

   However, while the SNMPv1 Framework anticipated the definition of
   multiple authentication schemes, it did not define any such schemes
   other than a trivial authentication scheme based on community
   strings.  This was a known fundamental weakness in the SNMPv1
   Framework but it was thought at that time that the definition of
   commercial grade security might be contentious in its design and
   difficult to get approved because "security" means many different
   things to different people.  To that end, and because some users do
   not require strong authentication, the SNMPv1 architected an
   authentication service as a separate block to be defined "later" and
   the SNMPv3 Framework provides an architecture for use within that
   block as well as a definition for its subsystems.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4%20The%20SNMPv2%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a> The SNMPv2 Management Framework</span>

   The SNMPv2 Management Framework is fully described in [4-9] and
   coexistence and transition issues relating to SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 are
   discussed in [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Coexistence between Version 1 and Version 2 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>10</a>].

   SNMPv2 provides several advantages over SNMPv1, including:

     * expanded data types (e.g., 64 bit counter)

     * improved efficiency and performance (get-bulk operator)

     * confirmed event notification (inform operator)

     * richer error handling (errors and exceptions)

     * improved sets, especially row creation and deletion

     * fine tuning of the data definition language

   However, the SNMPv2 Framework, as described in these documents, is
   incomplete in that it does not meet the original design goals of the
   SNMPv2 project.  The unmet goals included provision of security and
   administration delivering so-called "commercial grade" security with

     * authentication:  origin identification, message integrity,
       and some aspects of replay protection;

     * privacy:  confidentiality;

     * authorization and access control; and

     * suitable remote configuration and administration capabilities
       for these features.

   The SNMPv3 Management Framework, as described in this document and
   the companion documents, addresses these significant deficiencies.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5%20The%20SNMPv3%20Working%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a> The SNMPv3 Working Group</span>

   This document, and its companion documents, were produced by the
   SNMPv3 Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
   The SNMPv3 Working Group was chartered to prepare recommendations for
   the next generation of SNMP.  The goal of the Working Group was to
   produce the necessary set of documents that provide a single standard
   for the next generation of core SNMP functions.  The single, most
   critical need in the next generation is a definition of security and
   administration that makes SNMP-based management transactions secure
   in a way which is useful for users who wish to use SNMPv3 to manage
   networks, the systems that make up those networks, and the
   applications which reside on those systems, including manager-to-
   agent, agent-to-manager, and manager-to-manager transactions.

   In the several years prior to the chartering of the Working Group,
   there were a number of activities aimed at incorporating security and
   other improvements to SNMP.  These efforts included:

     * "SNMP Security" circa 1991-1992 [RFC 1351 - <a href="rfc1353.html">RFC 1353</a>],

     * "SMP" circa 1992-1993,

     * "The Party-based SNMPv2" circa 1993-1995 [RFC 1441 - <a href="rfc1452.html">RFC 1452</a>].

   Each of these efforts incorporated commercial grade, industrial
   strength security including authentication, privacy, authorization,
   view-based access control, and administration, including remote
   configuration.

   These efforts fed the development of the SNMPv2 Management Framework
   as described in RFCs 1902 - 1908.  However, the Framework described
   in those RFCs had no standards-based security and administrative
   framework of its own; rather, it was associated with multiple
   security and administrative frameworks, including:

     * "The Community-based SNMPv2" (SNMPv2c) [<a href="rfc1901.html">RFC 1901</a>],

     * "SNMPv2u" [RFCs 1909 - 1910] and




<span class="grey">Case, et al.                 Informational                      [Page 8]</span></pre>

     * "SNMPv2*".

   SNMPv2c had the endorsement of the IETF but no security and
   administration whereas both SNMPv2u and SNMPv2* had security but
   lacked the endorsement of the IETF.

   The SNMPv3 Working Group was chartered to produce a single set of
   specifications for the next generation of SNMP, based upon a
   convergence of the concepts and technical elements of SNMPv2u and
   SNMPv2*, as was suggested by an advisory team which was formed to
   provide a single recommended approach for SNMP evolution.

   In so doing, the Working Group charter defined the following
   objectives:

     * accommodate the wide range of operational environments with
       differing management demands;

     * facilitate the need to transition from previous, multiple
       protocols to SNMPv3;

     * facilitate the ease of setup and maintenance activities.

   In the initial work of the SNMPv3 Working Group, the group focused on
   security and administration, including

     * authentication and privacy,

     * authorization and view-based access control, and

     * standards-based remote configuration of the above.

   The SNMPv3 Working Group did not "reinvent the wheel," but reused the
   SNMPv2 Draft Standard documents, i.e., RFCs 1902 through 1908 for
   those portions of the design that were outside the focused scope.

   Rather, the primary contributors to the SNMPv3 Working Group, and the
   Working Group in general, devoted their considerable efforts to
   addressing the missing link -- security and administration -- and in
   the process made invaluable contributions to the state-of-the-art of
   management.

   They produced a design based on a modular architecture with
   evolutionary capabilities with emphasis on layering.  As a result,
   SNMPv3 can be thought of as SNMPv2 with additional security and
   administration capabilities.

   In doing so, the Working Group achieved the goal of producing a
   single specification which has not only the endorsement of the IETF
   but also has security and administration.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6%20SNMPv3%20Framework%20Module%20Specifications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a> SNMPv3 Framework Module Specifications</span>

   The specification of the SNMPv3 Management Framework is partitioned
   in a modular fashion among several documents.  It is the intention of
   the SNMPv3 Working Group that, with proper care, any or all of the
   individual documents can be revised, upgraded, or replaced as
   requirements change, new understandings are obtained, and new
   technologies become available.

   Whenever feasible, the initial document set which defines the SNMPv3
   Management Framework leverages prior investments defining and
   implementing the SNMPv2 Management Framework by incorporating by
   reference each of the specifications of the SNMPv2 Management
   Framework.

   The SNMPv3 Framework augments those specifications with
   specifications for security and administration for SNMPv3.

   The documents which specify the SNMPv3 Management Framework follow
   the same architecture as those of the prior versions and can be
   organized for expository purposes into four main categories as
   follows:

     * the data definition language,

     * Management Information Base (MIB) modules,

     * protocol operations, and

     * security and administration.

   The first three sets of documents are incorporated from SNMPv2.  The
   fourth set of documents are new to SNMPv3, but, as described
   previously, build on significant prior related works.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1%20Data%20Definition%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a> Data Definition Language</span>

   The specifications of the data definition language includes STD 58,
   <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a>, "Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"
   [<a href="#ref-26" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>26</a>], and related specifications.  These documents are updates of
   RFCs 1902 - 1904 [4-6] which have evolved independently from the
   other parts of the framework and were republished as STD 58, RFCs
   2578 - 2580 [26-28] when promoted from Draft Standard.

   The Structure of Management Information (SMIv2) defines fundamental
   data types, an object model, and the rules for writing and revising
   MIB modules.  Related specifications include STD 58, RFCs 2579, 2580.
   The updated data definition language is sometimes referred to as
   SMIv2.

   STD 58, <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a>, "Textual Conventions for SMIv2" [<a href="#ref-27" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>27</a>], defines an
   initial set of shorthand abbreviations which are available for use
   within all MIB modules for the convenience of human readers and
   writers.

   STD 58, <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a>, "Conformance Statements for SMIv2" [<a href="#ref-28" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>28</a>], defines
   the format for compliance statements which are used for describing
   requirements for agent implementations and capability statements
   which can be used to document the characteristics of particular
   implementations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2%20MIB%20Modules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" name="section-6.2">6.2</a> MIB Modules</span>

   MIB modules usually contain object definitions, may contain
   definitions of event notifications, and sometimes include compliance
   statements specified in terms of appropriate object and event
   notification groups.  As such, MIB modules define the management
   information maintained by the instrumentation in managed nodes, made
   remotely accessible by management agents, conveyed by the management
   protocol, and manipulated by management applications.

   MIB modules are defined according the rules defined in the documents
   which specify the data definition language, principally the SMI as
   supplemented by the related specifications.

   There is a large and growing number of standards-based MIB modules,
   as defined in the periodically updated list of standard protocols
   [STD 1, <a href="rfc2400.html">RFC 2400</a>].  As of this writing, there are nearly 100
   standards-based MIB modules with a total number of defined objects
   approaching 10,000.  In addition, there is an even larger and growing
   number of enterprise-specific MIB modules defined unilaterally by
   various vendors, research groups, consortia, and the like resulting
   in an unknown and virtually uncountable number of defined objects.

   In general, management information defined in any MIB module,
   regardless of the version of the data definition language used, can
   be used with any version of the protocol.  For example, MIB modules
   defined in terms of the SNMPv1 SMI (SMIv1) are compatible with the
   SNMPv3 Management Framework and can be conveyed by the protocols
   specified therein.  Furthermore, MIB modules defined in terms of the
   SNMPv2 SMI (SMIv2) are compatible with SNMPv1 protocol operations and
   can be conveyed by it.  However, there is one noteworthy exception:

   The specifications for the protocol operations and transport mappings
   of the SNMPv3 Framework are incorporated by reference to the two
   SNMPv2 Framework documents.

   The specification for protocol operations is found in <a href="rfc1905.html">RFC 1905</a>,
   "Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMPv2)" [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>7</a>].  The SNMPv3 Framework is designed to allow
   various portions of the architecture to evolve independently.  For
   example, it might be possible for a new specification of protocol
   operations to be defined within the Framework to allow for additional
   protocol operations.

   The specification of transport mappings is found in <a href="rfc1906.html">RFC 1906</a>,
   "Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management

   The following sections provide brief summaries of each document with
   slightly more detail than is provided in the overviews above.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1%20Structure%20of%20Management%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a> Structure of Management Information</span>

   Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
   residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined
   in MIB modules.  These modules are written in the SNMP MIB module
   language, which contains elements of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation
   One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-11" title="(December">11</a>] language.   STD 58, RFCs 2578, 2579, 2580, together
   define the MIB module language, specify the base data types for
   objects, specify a core set of short-hand specifications for data
   types called textual conventions, and specify a few administrative
   assignments of object identifier (OID) values.

   The SMI is divided into three parts:  module definitions, object
   definitions, and notification definitions.

   (1)  Module definitions are used when describing information modules.
        An ASN.1 macro, MODULE-IDENTITY, is used to convey concisely the
        semantics of an information module.

   (2)  Object definitions are used when describing managed objects.  An
        ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-TYPE, is used to convey concisely the syntax
        and semantics of a managed object.

   (3)  Notification definitions are used when describing unsolicited
        transmissions of management information.  An ASN.1 macro,
        NOTIFICATION-TYPE, is used to convey concisely the syntax and
        semantics of a notification.

   STD 58, <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a> specifies the base data types for the MIB module
   language, which include: Integer32, enumerated integers, Unsigned32,
   Gauge32, Counter32,  Counter64, TimeTicks, INTEGER, OCTET STRING,
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, IpAddress, Opaque, and BITS. It also assigns
   values to several object identifiers.  STD 58, <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a> further
   defines the following constructs of the MIB module language:

     * IMPORTS to allow the specification of items that are used
       in a MIB module, but defined in another MIB module.

     * MODULE-IDENTITY to specify for a MIB module a description
       and administrative information such as contact and revision
       history.

     * OBJECT-IDENTITY and OID value assignments to specify a
       an OID value.

     * OBJECT-TYPE to specify the data type, status, and the semantics
       of managed objects.

     * SEQUENCE type assignment to list the columnar objects in
       a table.

     * NOTIFICATION-TYPE construct to specify an event notification.

   When designing a MIB module, it is often useful to specify in a
   short-hand way the semantics for a set of objects with similar
   behavior.  This is done by defining a new data type using a base data
   type specified in the SMI.  Each new type has a different name, and
   specifies a base type with more restrictive semantics.  These newly
   defined types are termed textual conventions, and are used for the
   convenience of humans reading a MIB module and potentially by
   "intelligent" management applications.  It is the purpose of STD 58,
   <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a>, Textual Conventions for SMIv2 [<a href="#ref-27" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>27</a>], to define the
   construct, TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, of the MIB module language used to
   define such new types and to specify an initial set of textual
   conventions available to all MIB modules.

   It may be useful to define the acceptable lower-bounds of
   implementation, along with the actual level of implementation
   achieved.  It is the purpose of STD 58, <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a>, Conformance
   Statements for SMIv2 [<a href="#ref-28" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>28</a>], to define the constructs of the MIB module
   language used for these purposes.  There are two kinds of constructs:

   (1)  Compliance statements are used when describing requirements for
        agents with respect to object and event notification
        definitions.  The MODULE-COMPLIANCE construct is used to convey
        concisely such requirements.

   (2)  Capability statements are used when describing capabilities of
        agents with respect to object and event notification
        definitions.  The AGENT-CAPABILITIES construct is used to convey
        concisely such capabilities.

   Finally, collections of related objects and collections of related
   event notifications are grouped together to form a unit of
   conformance.  The OBJECT-GROUP construct is used to convey concisely
   the objects in and the semantics of an object group. The
   NOTIFICATION-GROUP construct is used to convey concisely the event
   notifications in and the semantics of an event notification group.

   The management protocol provides for the exchange of messages which
   convey management information between the agents and the management
   stations.  The form of these messages is a message "wrapper" which
   encapsulates a Protocol Data Unit (PDU).

   It is the purpose of <a href="rfc1905.html">RFC 1905</a>, Protocol Operations for SNMPv2 [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>7</a>], to

   how SNMP messages maps onto an initial set of transport domains.
   Other mappings may be defined in the future.

   Although several mappings are defined, the mapping onto UDP is the
   preferred mapping.  As such, to provide for the greatest level of
   interoperability, systems which choose to deploy other mappings
   should also provide for proxy service to the UDP mapping.

   It is expected that an SNMPv3 protocol engine MUST support at least
   one Message Processing Model.  An SNMPv3 protocol engine MAY support
   more than one, for example in a multi-lingual system which provides
   simultaneous support of SNMPv3 and SNMPv1 and/or SNMPv2c.

   It is the purpose of <a href="rfc2573.html">RFC 2573</a>, "SNMP Applications" to describe the
   five types of applications which can be associated with an SNMP
   engine.  They are: Command Generators, Command Responders,

   <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a>, the "User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the
   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)" describes the User-based
   Security Model for SNMPv3.  It defines the Elements of Procedure for
   providing SNMP message-level security.

   The document describes the two primary and two secondary threats
   which are defended against by the User-based Security Model.  They
   are:  modification of information, masquerade, message stream
   modification, and disclosure.

   The USM utilizes MD5 [<a href="#ref-21" title='"Message Digest Algorithm MD5"'>21</a>] and the Secure Hash Algorithm [<a href="#ref-22" title="(April">22</a>] as keyed
   hashing algorithms [<a href="#ref-23" title='"HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication"'>23</a>] for digest computation to provide data
   integrity

     * to directly protect against data modification attacks,

     * to indirectly provide data origin authentication, and

     * to defend against masquerade attacks.

   The USM uses loosely synchronized monotonically increasing time
   indicators to defend against certain message stream modification
   attacks.  Automatic clock synchronization mechanisms based on the
   protocol are specified without dependence on third-party time sources
   and concomitant security considerations.

   The USM uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) [<a href="#ref-24" title=" 1977; reaffirmed January">24</a>] in the cipher
   block chaining mode (CBC) if disclosure protection is desired.
   Support for DES in the USM is optional, primarily because export and
   usage restrictions in many countries make it difficult to export and
   use products which include cryptographic technology.

   The document also includes a MIB suitable for remotely monitoring and
   managing the configuration parameters for the USM, including key
   distribution and key management.

   An entity may provide simultaneous support for multiple security
   models as well as multiple authentication and privacy protocols.  All
   of the protocols used by the USM are based on pre-placed keys, i.e.,
   private key mechanisms.  The SNMPv3 architecture permits the use of
   asymmetric mechanisms and protocols (commonly called "public key
   cryptography") but as of this writing, no such SNMPv3 security models
   utilizing public key cryptography have been published.

   The VACM can simultaneously be associated in a single engine
   implementation with multiple Message Processing Models and multiple
   Security Models.

   It is architecturally possible to have multiple, different, Access
