   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing Ethernet-like
   interfaces.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module updates the
   list of managed objects specified in the earlier version of this MIB,
   module, <a href="rfc2665.html">RFC 2665</a> [<a href="rfc2665.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC2665</a>].

   Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the
   IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new
   types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.  This evolution
   may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this
   new functionality.  This document, as with other documents issued by
   this working group, reflects a certain stage in the evolution of
   Ethernet technology.  In the future, this document might be revised,
   or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet
   technology.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirements Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="rfc3410.html#section-7">section 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="rfc3410.html" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface
   to an ethernet-like communications medium.  At present, ethernet-like
   media are identified by the value ethernetCsmacd(6) of the ifType
   object in the Interfaces MIB [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>RFC2863</a>].  Some older implementations
   may return the values iso88023Csmacd(7) or starLan(11) for ifType for
   ethernet-like media.

   The definitions presented here are based on <a href="#section-30">Section 30</a>, "10 Mb/s, 100
   Mb/s 1000 Mb/s and 10 Gb/s Management", and Annex 30A, "GDMO
   Specification for 802.3 managed object classes" of IEEE Std. 802.3,
   2002 Edition [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.3" title='"Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications"'>IEEE802.3</a>], amended by IEEE Std. 802.3ae-2002
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.3ae" title='"Amendment: Media Access Control (MAC) Parameters, Physical Layers, and Management Parameters for 10 Gb/s Operation"'>IEEE802.3ae</a>], as originally interpreted by Frank Kastenholz, then of
   Interlan in [<a href="#ref-KASTEN" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks"'>KASTEN</a>].  Implementors of these MIB objects should note
   that IEEE Std. 802.3 [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.3" title='"Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications"'>IEEE802.3</a>] explicitly describes (in the form of
   Pascal pseudocode) when, where, and how various MAC attributes are
   measured.  The IEEE document also describes the effects of MAC
   actions that may be invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB
   objects defined here.

   To the extent that some of the attributes defined in [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.3" title='"Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications"'>IEEE802.3</a>] are
   represented by previously defined objects in MIB-2 [<a href="rfc1213.html" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>RFC1213</a>] or in
   the Interfaces MIB [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>RFC2863</a>], such attributes are not redundantly
   represented by objects defined in this memo.  Among the attributes
   represented by objects defined in other memos are the number of
   octets transmitted or received on a particular interface, the number
   of frames transmitted or received on a particular interface, the
   promiscuous status of an interface, the MAC address of an interface,
   and multicast information associated with an interface.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Relation%20to%20MIB-2"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Relation to MIB-2</span>

   This section applies only when this MIB is used in conjunction with
   the "old" [<a href="rfc1213.html" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>RFC1213</a>] interface group.

   The relationship between an ethernet-like interface and an interface
   in the context of MIB-2 is one-to-one.  As such, the value of an
   ifIndex object instance can be directly used to identify
   corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.

   For agents which implement the (now deprecated) ifSpecific object, an
   instance of that object that is associated with an ethernet-like
   interface has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

         dot3    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { transmission 7 }

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Relation%20to%20the%20Interfaces%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Relation to the Interfaces MIB</span>

   The Interface MIB [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>RFC2863</a>] requires that any MIB which is an adjunct
   of the Interface MIB clarify specific areas within the Interface MIB.
   These areas were intentionally left vague in the Interface MIB to
   avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of
   certain media-types.

   <a href="rfc2863.html#section-4">Section 4 of [RFC2863]</a> enumerates several areas which a
   media-specific MIB must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in
   a following subsection.  The implementor is referred to [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>RFC2863</a>] in
   order to understand the general intent of these areas.

   Ordinarily, there are no sublayers for an ethernet-like interface.
   However there may be implementation-specific requirements which
   require the use of sublayers.  One example is the use of 802.3 link
   aggregation.  In this case, Annex 30C of [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.3" title='"Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications"'>IEEE802.3</a>] describes the
   layering model and the use of the ifStackTable for representing
   aggregated links.  Another example is the use of the 802.3 WAN
   Interface Sublayer.  In this case, The 802.3 WIS MIB [<a href="rfc3637.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet WAN Interface Sublayer"'>RFC3637</a>]
   describes the layering model and the use of the ifStackTable for
   representing the WAN sublayer.

   This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not
   applicable to this MIB.

   This table contains all IEEE 802.3 addresses, unicast, multicast, and
   broadcast, for which this interface will receive packets and forward
   them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.  The format
   of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for
   ifPhysAddress.

   In the event that the interface is part of a MAC bridge, this table
   does not include unicast addresses which are accepted for possible
   forwarding out some other port.  This table is explicitly not
   intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.4.%20%20ifType"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.4" name="section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  ifType</span>

   This MIB applies to interfaces which have the ifType value
   ethernetCsmacd(6).  It is REQUIRED that all ethernet-like interfaces
   use an ifType of ethernetCsmacd(6) regardless of the speed that the
   interface is running or the link-layer encapsulation in use.  Use of
   the ifType values iso88023Csmacd(7) and starLan(11) are deprecated,
   however some older implementations may return these values.
   Management applications should be prepared to receive these
   deprecated ifType values from older implementations.

   There are three other interface types defined in the IANAifType-MIB
   for Ethernet.  They are fastEther(62), fastEtherFX(69), and
   gigabitEthernet(117).  These interface types were registered by
   individual vendors, not by any IETF working group.  A requirement for
   compliance with this document is that all ethernet-like interfaces
   MUST return ethernetCsmacd(6) for ifType, and MUST NOT return
   fastEther(62), fastEtherFX(69), or gigabitEthernet(117).  However, as
   there are fielded implementations that do return these obsolete
   ifType values, management applications SHOULD be prepared to receive
   them from older implementations.

   Information on the particular flavor of Ethernet that an interface is
   running is available from ifSpeed in the Interfaces MIB, and
   ifMauType in the 802.3 MAU MIB [<a href="rfc3636.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) using SMIv2"'>RFC3636</a>].  Note that implementation
   of the 802.3 MAU MIB [<a href="rfc3636.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) using SMIv2"'>RFC3636</a>] is REQUIRED for all ethernet-like
   interfaces.

   The Interface MIB octet counters, ifInOctets, ifOutOctets,
   ifHCInOctets and ifHCOutOctets, MUST include all octets in valid
   frames sent or received on the interface, including the MAC header
   and FCS, but not the preamble, start of frame delimiter, or extension
   octets.  This corresponds to the definition of frameSize/8 in section

   4.2.7.1 of [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.3" title='"Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications"'>IEEE802.3</a>] (frameSize is defined in bits rather than
   octets, and is defined as 2 x addressSize + lengthOrTypeSize +
   dataSize + crcSize).  They do not include the number of octets in
   collided or failed transmit attempts, since the MAC layer driver
   typically does not have visibility to count these octets.  They also
   do not include octets in received invalid frames, since this
   information is normally not passed to the MAC layer, and since
   non-promiscuous MAC implementations cannot reliably determine whether
   an invalid frame was actually addressed to this station.

   Note that these counters do include octets in valid MAC control
   frames sent or received on the interface, as well as octets in
   otherwise valid received MAC frames that are discarded by the MAC
   layer for some reason (insufficient buffer space, unknown protocol,
   etc.).

   Note that the octet counters in IF-MIB do not exactly match the
   definition of the octet counters in IEEE 802.3.  aOctetsTransmittedOK
   and aOctetsReceivedOK count only the octets in the clientData and Pad
   fields, whereas ifInOctets and ifOutOctets include the entire MAC
   frame, including MAC header and FCS.  However, the IF-MIB counters
   can be derived from the IEEE 802.3 counters as follows:

     ifInOctets = aOctetsReceivedOK + (18 * aFramesReceivedOK)
     ifOutOctets = aOctetsTransmittedOK + (18 * aFramesTransmittedOK)

   Another difference to keep in mind between the IF-MIB counters and
   IEEE 802.3 counters is that in the IEEE 802.3 document, the frame
   counters and octet counters are always incremented together.
   aOctetsTransmittedOK counts the number of octets in frames that were
   counted by aFramesTransmittedOK.  aOctetsReceivedOK counts the number
   of octets in frames that were counted by aFramesReceivedOK.  This is
   not the case with the IF-MIB counters.  The IF-MIB octet counters
   count the number of octets sent to or received from the layer below
   this interface, whereas the packet counters count the number of
   packets sent to or received from the layer above.  Therefore,
   received MAC Control frames, ifInDiscards, and ifInUnknownProtos are
   counted by ifInOctets, but not ifInXcastPkts.  Transmitted MAC
   Control frames are counted by ifOutOctets, but not ifOutXcastPkts.
   ifOutDiscards and ifOutErrors are counted by ifOutXcastPkts, but not
   ifOutOctets.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.6.%20%20ifXxxXcastPkts"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.6" name="section-3.2.6">3.2.6</a>.  ifXxxXcastPkts</span>

   The packet counters in the IF-MIB do not exactly match the definition
   of the frame counters in IEEE 802.3.  aFramesTransmittedOK counts the
   number of frames successfully transmitted on the interface, whereas
   ifOutUcastPkts, ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts count the

   number of transmit requests made from a higher layer, whether or not
   the transmit attempt was successful.  This means that packets counted
   by ifOutErrors or ifOutDiscards are also counted by ifOutXcastPkts,
   but are not counted by aFramesTransmittedOK.  This also means that,
   since MAC Control frames are generated by a sublayer internal to the
   interface layer rather than by a higher layer, they are not counted
   by ifOutXcastPkts, but are counted by aFramesTransmittedOK.  Roughly:

     aFramesTransmittedOK = ifOutUcastPkts + ifOutMulticastPkts +
                            ifOutBroadcastPkts + dot3OutPauseFrames -
                            (ifOutErrors + ifOutDiscards)

   Similarly, aFramesReceivedOK counts the number of frames received
   successfully by the interface, whether or not they are passed to a
   higher layer, whereas ifInUcastPkts, ifInMulticastPkts and
   ifInBroadcastPkts count only the number of packets passed to a higher
   layer.  This means that packets counted by ifInDiscards or
   ifInUnknownProtos are also counted by aFramesReceivedOK, but are not
   counted by ifInXcastPkts.  This also means that, since MAC Control
   frames are consumed by a sublayer internal to the interface layer and
   not passed to a higher layer, they are not counted by ifInXcastPkts,
   but are counted by aFramesReceivedOK.  Roughly:

     aFramesReceivedOK = ifInUcastPkts + ifInMulticastPkts +
                         ifInBroadcastPkts + dot3InPauseFrames +
                         ifInDiscards + ifInUnknownProtos

   This specification chooses to treat MAC control frames as being
   originated and consumed within the interface and not counted by the
   IF-MIB packet counters.  MAC control frames are normally sent as
   multicast packets.  In many network environments, MAC control frames
   can greatly outnumber multicast frames carrying actual data.  If MAC
   control frames were included in the ifInMulticastPkts and
   ifOutMulticastPkts, the count of data-carrying multicast packets
   would tend to be drowned out by the count of MAC control frames,
   rendering those counters considerably less useful.

   To better understand the issues surrounding the mapping of the IF-MIB
   packet and octet counters to an Ethernet interface, it is useful to
   refer to a Case Diagram [<a href="#ref-CASE" title='"Case Diagrams: A First Step to Diagrammed Management Information Bases"'>CASE</a>] for the IF-MIB counters, with
   modifications to show the proper interpretation for the Ethernet
   interface layer.

   The defined standard MTU for ethernet-like interfaces is 1500 octets.
   However, many implementations today support larger packet sizes than
   the IEEE 802.3 standard.  The value of this object MUST reflect the
   actual MTU in use on the interface, whether it matches the standard
   MTU or not.

   This value should reflect the value seen by the MAC client interface.
   When a higher layer protocol, like IP, is running over Ethernet
   framing, this is the MTU that will be seen by that higher layer
   protocol.  However, most ethernet-like interfaces today run multiple
   protocols that use a mix of different framing types.  For example, an
   IEEE 802.2 LLC type 1 client protocol will see an MTU of 1497 octets
   on an interface using the IEEE standard maximum packet size, and a
   protocol running over SNAP will see an MTU of 1492 octets on an
   interface using the IEEE standard maximum packet size.  However,
   since specification mandates using the MTU as seen at the MAC client
   interface, the value of ifMtu would be reported as 1500 octets in
   these cases.

   For ethernet-like interfaces operating at 1000 Megabits per second

   second.  For current ethernet-like interfaces, this will be equal to
   1, 10, 100, or 1,000.  If the interface implements auto-negotiation,
   auto-negotiation is enabled for this interface, and the interface has
   not yet negotiated to an operational speed, these objects SHOULD
   reflect the maximum speed supported by the interface.

   For ethernet-like interfaces operating at greater than 1000 Mb/s,
   ifHighSpeed will represent the current operational speed of the
   interface in millions of bits per second.  Note that for WAN
   implementations, this will be the payload data rate over the WAN
   interface sublayer.  For current implementations, this will be equal
   to 10,000 for LAN implementations of 10 Gb/s, and 9,294 for WAN
   implementations of the 10 Gb/s MAC over an OC-192 PHY.  For these
   speeds, ifSpeed should report a maximum unsigned 32-bit value of
   4,294,967,295 as specified in [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>RFC2863</a>].

   Note that these object MUST NOT indicate a doubled value when
   operating in full-duplex mode.  It MUST indicate the correct line
   speed regardless of the current duplex mode.  The duplex mode of the
   interface may be determined by examining either the
   dot3StatsDuplexStatus object in this MIB module, or the ifMauType
   object in the 802.3 MAU MIB [<a href="rfc3636.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) using SMIv2"'>RFC3636</a>].

   This object contains the IEEE 802.3 address which is placed in the
   source-address field of any Ethernet, Starlan, or IEEE 802.3 frames
   that originate at this interface.  Usually this will be kept in ROM
   on the interface hardware.  Some systems may set this address via
   software.

   In a system where there are several such addresses the designer has a
   tougher choice.  The address chosen should be the one most likely to
   be of use to network management (e.g.  the address placed in ARP
   responses for systems which are primarily IP systems).

   If the designer truly can not chose, use of the factory-provided ROM
   address is suggested.

   If the address can not be determined, an octet string of zero length
   should be returned.

   The address is stored in binary in this object.  The address is
   stored in "canonical" bit order, that is, the Group Bit is positioned
   as the low-order bit of the first octet.  Thus, the first byte of a

   The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for
   applying the interface group objects to ethernet-like media.

     Object                     Guidelines

     ifIndex                    Each ethernet-like interface is
                                represented by an ifEntry.  The
                                dot3StatsTable in this MIB module is
                                indexed by dot3StatsIndex. The interface
                                identified by a particular value of
                                dot3StatsIndex is the same interface as
                                identified by the same value of ifIndex.

     ifDescr                    Refer to [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>RFC2863</a>].

     ifType                     Refer to <a href="#section-3.2.4">section 3.2.4</a>.

     ifSpeed                    Refer to <a href="#section-3.2.8">section 3.2.8</a>.

     ifPhysAddress              Refer to <a href="#section-3.2.9">section 3.2.9</a>.

     ifAdminStatus              Write access is not required.  Support
                                for 'testing' is not required.

     ifOperStatus               The operational state of the interface.
                                Support for 'testing' is not required.
                                The value 'dormant' has no meaning for
                                an ethernet-like interface.

     ifLastChange               Refer to [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>RFC2863</a>].

                                received on this interface, including
                                the MAC header and FCS.  This does
                                include the number of octets in valid

                                interface.  See <a href="#section-3.2.5">section 3.2.5</a>.

   Support for the mauModIfCompl3 compliance statement of the MAU-MIB
   [<a href="rfc3636.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) using SMIv2"'>RFC3636</a>] is REQUIRED for Ethernet-like interfaces.  This MIB is
   needed in order to allow applications to determine the current MAU
   type in use by the interface, and to control autonegotiation and
   duplex mode for the interface.  Implementing this MIB module without
   implementing the MAU-MIB would leave applications with no standard
   way to determine the media type in use, and no standard way to
   control the duplex mode of the interface.

   This document defines an object called dot3StatsEtherChipSet, which
   is used to identify the MAC hardware used to communicate on an
   interface.  Previous versions of this document contained a number of
   OID assignments for some existing Ethernet chipsets.  Maintaining
   that list as part of this document has proven to be problematic, so
   the OID assignments contained in previous versions of this document
   have now been moved to a separate document [<a href="rfc2666.html" title='"Definitions of Object Identifiers for Identifying Ethernet Chip Sets"'>RFC2666</a>].

   The dot3StatsEtherChipSet object has now been deprecated.
   Implementation feedback indicates that this object is much more
   useful in theory than in practice.  The object's utility in debugging
   network problems in the field appears to be limited.  In those cases
   where it may be useful, it is not sufficient, since it identifies
   only the MAC chip, and not the PHY, PMD, or driver.  The
   administrative overhead involved in maintaining a central registry of
   chipset OIDs cannot be justified for an object whose usefulness is
   questionable at best.

           DESCRIPTION "Updated to include support for 10 Gb/sec
                        interfaces.  This resulted in the following
                        revisions:

                        - Updated dot3StatsAlignmentErrors and
                          dot3StatsSymbolErrors DESCRIPTIONs to
                          reflect behaviour at 10 Gb/s
                        - Added dot3StatsRateControlAbility and
                          dot3RateControlStatus for management
                          of the Rate Control function in 10 Gb/s
                          WAN applications
                        - Added 64-bit versions of all counters
                          that are used on high-speed ethernet
                          interfaces
                        - Added object groups to contain the new
                          objects
                        - Deprecated etherStatsBaseGroup and
                          split into etherStatsBaseGroup2 and
                          etherStatsHalfDuplexGroup, so that
                          interfaces which can only operate at
                          full-duplex do not need to implement
                          half-duplex-only statistics
                        - Deprecated dot3Compliance and replaced
                          it with dot3Compliance2, which includes
                          the compliance information for the new
                          object groups

           DESCRIPTION "******** THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********

                       This object contains an OBJECT IDENTIFIER
                       which identifies the chipset used to
                       realize the interface. Ethernet-like
                       interfaces are typically built out of
                       several different chips. The MIB implementor
                       is presented with a decision of which chip
                       to identify via this object. The implementor
                       should identify the chip which is usually
                       called the Medium Access Control chip.
                       If no such chip is easily identifiable,
                       the implementor should identify the chip
                       which actually gathers the transmit
                       and receive statistics and error
                       indications. This would allow a
                       manager station to correlate the
                       statistics and the chip generating
                       them, giving it the ability to take
                       into account any known anomalies
                       in the chip.

                       This object has been deprecated.  Implementation
                       feedback indicates that it is of limited use for
                       debugging network problems in the field, and
                       the administrative overhead involved in
                       maintaining a registry of chipset OIDs is not
                       justified."

                       Management control of the duplex mode is

           DESCRIPTION "******** THIS IDENTITY IS DEPRECATED *******

                       The Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) test is
                       specific to ethernet-like interfaces of type
                       10Base5 and 10Base2.  The TDR value may be
                       useful in determining the approximate distance
                       to a cable fault.  It is advisable to repeat
                       this test to check for a consistent resulting
                       TDR value, to verify that there is a fault.

                       A TDR test returns as its result the time
                       interval, measured in 10 MHz ticks or 100 nsec
                       units, between the start of TDR test
                       transmission and the subsequent detection of a
                       collision or deassertion of carrier.  On
                       successful completion of a TDR test, the result
                       is stored as the value of an appropriate
                       instance of an appropriate vendor specific MIB
                       object, and the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of that
                       instance is stored in the appropriate instance
                       of the appropriate test result code object
                       (thereby indicating where the result has been
                       stored).

   This document was produced by the IETF Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, whose efforts were greatly advanced by the
   contributions of the following people:

       Ran Atkinson
       Mike Ayers
       Mike Heard
       Jeffrey Johnson
       Lynn Kubinec
       Kam Lam
       Kerry McDonald

       Dan Romascanu
       Randy Presuhn
       Andrew Smith

   This document is based on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB, <a href="rfc2665.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2665.html">2665</a> [<a href="rfc2665.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC2665</a>], edited by John Flick of Hewlett-Packard and Jeffrey
   Johnson of RedBack Networks and produced by the Ethernet Interfaces
   and Hub MIB Working Group.  It extends that document by providing
   support for 10 Gb/s Ethernet interfaces as defined in [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.3ae" title='"Amendment: Media Access Control (MAC) Parameters, Physical Layers, and Management Parameters for 10 Gb/s Operation"'>IEEE802.3ae</a>].

   <a href="rfc2358.html">RFC 2358</a> [<a href="rfc2358.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC2358</a>], edited by John Flick of Hewlett-Packard and
   Jeffrey Johnson of RedBack Networks and produced by the 802.3 Hub MIB
   Working Group.  It extends that document by providing support for
   full-duplex Ethernet interfaces and 1000 Mb/sec Ethernet interfaces
   as outlined in [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.3" title='"Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications"'>IEEE802.3</a>].

   <a href="rfc2358.html">RFC 2358</a>, in turn, is almost completely based on both the Standard

   <a href="rfc1398.html">RFC 1398</a>, in turn, is based on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB,
   <a href="rfc1284.html">RFC 1284</a> [<a href="rfc1284.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Ethernet-Like Interface Types"'>RFC1284</a>], which was edited by John Cook of Chipcom and

   There is one management object defined in this MIB that has a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write.  That object, dot3PauseAdminMode, may be
   used to change the flow control configuration on a network interface,
   which may result in dropped packets, or sending flow control packets
   on links where the link partner will not understand them.  Either
   action could be detrimental to network performance.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  In particular, the
   dot3StatsEtherChipSet object may be considered sensitive in many
   environments, since it would allow an intruder to obtain information
   about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.  Note that
   this object has been deprecated.  However, some implementors may
   still choose to implement it for backwards compatability.

   Most of the objects in this MIB module contain statistical
   information about particular network links.  In some network
   environments, this information may be considered sensitive.

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [<a href="rfc3410.html" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>], <a href="#section-8">section</a>
   <a href="#section-8">8</a>), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Furthermore, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   This document does not define any new name space to be administered
   by IANA.  However, <a href="#section-3.2.4">section 3.2.4</a> does specify that some of the
   defined values in a current IANA-maintained name space are to be
   marked as deprecated or obsolete.  In particular, the following
   enumerated values in the IANAifType TEXTUAL-CONVENTION in the
   IANAifType-MIB module have had an ASN.1 comment added by IANA stating
   that they have been deprecated:

       - iso88032Csmacd(7)
       - starLan(11)

   In addition, the following enumerated values have had an ASN.1
   comment added by IANA stating that they are obsolete:

       - fastEther(62)
       - fastEtherFX(69)
       - gigabitEthernet(117)

   In all of the above cases, the ASN.1 comment indicates that
   ethernetCsmacd(6) should be used instead of these values.

   This section enumerates changes made to <a href="rfc2665.html">RFC 2665</a> to produce this
   document.

      (1)   Updated references to the IEEE 802.3 standard to
            refer to the 2002 edition.

      (2)   Added reference to IEEE 802.3ae-2002.

      (3)   Updated WG e-mail address.

      (4)   The following DESCRIPTION clauses have been updated
            to reflect behaviour on 10 Gb/s interfaces:
            dot3StatsAlignmentErrors and dot3StatsSymbolErrors.

      (5)   The following objects have been added for management
            of the Rate Control function in WAN applications of
            ethernet:  dot3StatsRateControlAbility and
            dot3StatsRateControlStatus.

      (6)   The following 64-bit counters have been added to
            support operation on high-speed ethernet interfaces:
            dot3HCControlInUnknownOpcodes, dot3HCInPauseFrames,
            dot3HCOutPauseFrames, dot3HCStatsAlignmentErrors,

      (7)   Object groups and compliances have been added to
            contain the new objects.

      (8)   The MODULE-IDENTITY clause has been updated to
            reflect the changes in the MIB module.

      (9)   Use of the various ifType values for ethernet has
            been clarified to emphasize that all ethernet-like
            interfaces must use the ethernetCsmacd ifType.

      (10)  Several clarifications were made to the section on
            the mapping of the Interface MIB objects to ethernet.

      (11)  MIB boilerplate in <a href="#section-2">section 2</a> has been updated to the
            latest approved text.
