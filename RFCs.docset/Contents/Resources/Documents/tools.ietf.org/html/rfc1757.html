   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      STD 16, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"IAB Recommendations for the Development of Internet Network Management Standards"'>1</a>] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used
      for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      STD 16, <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network Management Review Group"'>2</a>] defines a more concise description mechanism,
      which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

      STD 17, <a href="rfc1213.html">RFC 1213</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>3</a>] which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>4</a>] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Within a given MIB module,
   objects are defined using <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a>'s OBJECT-TYPE macro.  At a
   minimum, each object has a name, a syntax, an access-level, and an
   implementation-status.

   The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name,
   which specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
   of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
   termed the object descriptor, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1[5] language is used for
   this purpose.  However, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The access-level of an object type defines whether it makes "protocol
   sense" to read and/or write the value of an instance of the object
   type.  (This access-level is independent of any administrative
   authorization policy.)

   The implementation-status of an object type indicates whether the
   object is mandatory, optional, obsolete, or deprecated.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

   Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors or probes,
   are instruments that exist for the purpose of managing a network.
   Often these remote probes are stand-alone devices and devote
   significant internal resources for the sole purpose of managing a
   network.  An organization may employ many of these devices, one per
   network segment, to manage its internet.  In addition, these devices
   may be used for a network management service provider to access a
   client network, often geographically remote.

   The objects defined in this document are intended as an interface
   between an RMON agent and an RMON management application and are not
   intended for direct manipulation by humans.  While some users may
   tolerate the direct display of some of these objects, few will
   tolerate the complexity of manually manipulating objects to
   accomplish row creation.  These functions should be handled by the
   management application.

   While most of the objects in this document are suitable for the
   management of any type of network, there are some which are specific
   to managing Ethernet networks.  These are the objects in the
   etherStatsTable, the etherHistoryTable, and some attributes of the
   filterPktStatus and capturBufferPacketStatus objects.  The design of
   this MIB allows similar objects to be defined for other network
   types.  It is intended that future versions of this document and
   additional documents will define extensions for other network types
   such as Token Ring and FDDI.

              o Offline Operation
                  There are sometimes conditions when a management
                  station will not be in constant contact with its
                  remote monitoring devices.  This is sometimes by
                  design in an attempt to lower communications costs
                  (especially when communicating over a WAN or
                  dialup link), or by accident as network failures
                  affect the communications between the management
                  station and the probe.

                  For this reason, this MIB allows a probe to be
                  configured to perform diagnostics and to collect
                  statistics continuously, even when communication with
                  the management station may not be possible or
                  efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify
                  the management station when an exceptional condition
                  occurs.  Thus, even in circumstances where

                  not continuous, fault, performance, and configuration
                  information may be continuously accumulated and
                  communicated to the management station conveniently
                  and efficiently.

              o Proactive Monitoring
                  Given the resources available on the monitor, it
                  is potentially helpful for it continuously to run
                  diagnostics and to log network performance.  The
                  monitor is always available at the onset of any
                  failure.  It can notify the management station of the
                  failure and can store historical statistical
                  information about the failure.  This historical
                  information can be played back by the management
                  station in an attempt to perform further diagnosis
                  into the cause of the problem.

              o Problem Detection and Reporting
                  The monitor can be configured to recognize
                  conditions, most notably error conditions, and
                  continuously to check for them.  When one of these
                  conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and
                  management stations may be notified in a number of
                  ways.

              o Value Added Data
                  Because a remote monitoring device represents a
                  network resource dedicated exclusively to network
                  management functions, and because it is located
                  directly on the monitored portion of the network, the
                  remote network monitoring device has the opportunity
                  to add significant value to the data it collects.
                  For instance, by highlighting those hosts on the
                  network that generate the most traffic or errors, the
                  probe can give the management station precisely the
                  information it needs to solve a class of problems.

              o Multiple Managers
                  An organization may have multiple management stations
                  for different units of the organization, for different
                  functions (e.g. engineering and operations), and in an
                  attempt to provide disaster recovery.  Because
                  environments with multiple management stations are
                  common, the remote network monitoring device has to
                  deal with more than own management station,
                  potentially using its resources concurrently.

   Two new data types are introduced as a textual convention in this MIB
   document.  These textual conventions enhance the readability of the
   specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if
   appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the these
   textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
   are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit
   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

   The new data types are: OwnerString and EntryStatus.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.%20%20Structure%20of%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Structure of MIB</span>

   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

                  - ethernet statistics

                  - history control

                  - ethernet history

                  - alarm

                  - host

                  - hostTopN

                  - matrix

                  - filter

                  - packet capture

                  - event

   These groups are the basic unit of conformance.  If a remote
   monitoring device implements a group, then it must implement all
   objects in that group.  For example, a managed agent that implements
   the host group must implement the hostControlTable, the hostTable and
   the hostTimeTable.

   All groups in this MIB are optional.  Implementations of this MIB
   must also implement the system and interfaces group of MIB-II [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Evolution of the Interfaces Group of MIB-II"'>6</a>].
   MIB-II may also mandate the implementation of additional groups.

   These groups are defined to provide a means of assigning object
   identifiers, and to provide a method for managed agents to know which
   objects they must implement.

   The ethernet statistics group contains statistics measured by the
   probe for each monitored Ethernet interface on this device.  This
   group consists of the etherStatsTable.  In the future other groups
   will be defined for other media types including Token Ring and FDDI.
   These groups should follow the same model as the ethernet statistics
   group.

   The history control group controls the periodic statistical sampling
   of data from various types of networks.  This group consists of the
   historyControlTable.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.3.%20%20The%20Ethernet%20History%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.3" name="section-2.3.3">2.3.3</a>.  The Ethernet History Group</span>

   The ethernet history group records periodic statistical samples from
   an ethernet network and stores them for later retrieval.  This group
   consists of the etherHistoryTable.  In the future, other groups will
   be defined for other media types including Token Ring and FDDI.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.4.%20%20The%20Alarm%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.4" name="section-2.3.4">2.3.4</a>.  The Alarm Group</span>

   The alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from variables
   in the probe and compares them to previously configured thresholds.
   If the monitored variable crosses a threshold, an event is generated.
   A hysteresis mechanism is implemented to limit the generation of
   alarms.  This group consists of the alarmTable and requires the
   implementation of the event group.

   The host group contains statistics associated with each host
   discovered on the network.  This group discovers hosts on the network
   by keeping a list of source and destination MAC Addresses seen in
   good packets promiscuously received from the network.  This group
   consists of the hostControlTable, the hostTable, and the
   hostTimeTable.

   The hostTopN group is used to prepare reports that describe the hosts
   that top a list ordered by one of their statistics.  The available
   statistics are samples of one of their base statistics over an
   interval specified by the management station.  Thus, these statistics
   are rate based.  The management station also selects how many such
   hosts are reported.  This group consists of the hostTopNControlTable
   and the hostTopNTable, and requires the implementation of the host
   group.

   a new entry in its tables.  This group consists of the
   matrixControlTable, the matrixSDTable and the matrixDSTable.

   The filter group allows packets to be matched by a filter equation.
   These matched packets form a data stream that may be captured or may
   generate events.  This group consists of the filterTable and the
   channelTable.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.9.%20%20The%20Packet%20Capture%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.9" name="section-2.3.9">2.3.9</a>.  The Packet Capture Group</span>

   Due to the complex nature of the available functions in these
   devices, the functions often need user configuration.  In many cases,
   the function requires parameters to be set up for a data collection
   operation.  The operation can proceed only after these parameters are
   fully set up.






<span class="grey">Waldbusser                                                      [Page 7]</span></pre>

   Many functional groups in this MIB have one or more tables in which
   to set up control parameters, and one or more data tables in which to
   place the results of the operation.  The control tables are typically
   read-write in nature, while the data tables are typically read-only.
   Because the parameters in the control table often describe resulting
   data in the data table, many of the parameters can be modified only
   when the control entry is invalid.  Thus, the method for modifying
   these parameters is to invalidate the control entry, causing its
   deletion and the deletion of any associated data entries, and then
   create a new control entry with the proper parameters.  Deleting the
   control entry also gives a convenient method for reclaiming the
   resources used by the associated data.

   Some objects in this MIB provide a mechanism to execute an action on
   the remote monitoring device.  These objects may execute an action as
   a result of a change in the state of the object.  For those objects
   in this MIB, a request to set an object to the same value as it
   currently holds would thus cause no action to occur.

   To facilitate control by multiple managers, resources have to be
   shared among the managers.  These resources are typically the memory
   and computation resources that a function requires.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Resource%20Sharing%20Among%20Multiple%20Management%20Stations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Resource Sharing Among Multiple Management Stations</span>

   When multiple management stations wish to use functions that compete
   for a finite amount of resources on a device, a method to facilitate
   this sharing of resources is required.  Potential conflicts include:

              o Two management stations wish to simultaneously use
                resources that together would exceed the capability of
                the device.
              o A management station uses a significant amount of
                resources for a long period of time.
              o A management station uses resources and then crashes,
                forgetting to free the resources so others may
                use them.

   A mechanism is provided for each management station initiated
   function in this MIB to avoid these conflicts and to help resolve
   them when they occur.  Each function has a label identifying the
   initiator (owner) of the function.  This label is set by the
   initiator to provide for the following possibilities:

              o A management station may recognize resources it owns
                and no longer needs.
              o A network operator can find the management station that
                owns the resource and negotiate for it to be freed.



<span class="grey">Waldbusser                                                      [Page 8]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1757.html">RFC 1757</a>             Remote Network Monitoring MIB         February 1995</span>


              o A network operator may decide to unilaterally free
                resources another network operator has reserved.
              o Upon initialization, a management station may recognize
                resources it had reserved in the past.  With this
                information it may free the resources if it no longer
                needs them.

   Management stations and probes should support any format of the owner
   string dictated by the local policy of the organization.  It is
   suggested that this name contain one or more of the following: IP
   address, management station name, network manager's name, location,
   or phone number.  This information will help users to share the
   resources more effectively.

   There is often default functionality that the device or the
   administrator of the probe (often the network administrator) wishes
   to set up.  The resources associated with this functionality are then
   owned by the device itself or by the network administrator, and are
   intended to be long-lived.  In this case, the device or the
   administrator will set the relevant owner object to a string starting
   with 'monitor'.  Indiscriminate modification of the monitor-owned
   configuration by network management stations is discouraged.  In
   fact, a network management station should only modify these objects
   under the direction of the administrator of the probe.

   Resources on a probe are scarce and are typically allocated when
   control rows are created by an application.  Since many applications
   may be using a probe simultaneously, indiscriminate allocation of
   resources to particular applications is very likely to cause resource
   shortages in the probe.

   When a network management station wishes to utilize a function in a
   monitor, it is encouraged to first scan the control table of that
   function to find an instance with similar parameters to share.  This
   is especially true for those instances owned by the monitor, which
   can be assumed to change infrequently.  If a management station
   decides to share an instance owned by another management station, it
   should understand that the management station that owns the instance
   may indiscriminately modify or delete it.

   It should be noted that a management application should have the most
   trust in a monitor-owned row because it should be changed very
   infrequently.  A row owned by the management application is less
   long-lived because a network administrator is more likely to re-
   assign resources from a row that is in use by one user than from a
   monitor-owned row that is potentially in use by many users.  A row
   owned by another application would be even less long-lived because
   the other application may delete or modify that row completely at its

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Row%20Addition%20Among%20Multiple%20Management%20Stations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Row Addition Among Multiple Management Stations</span>

   The addition of new rows is achieved using the method described in
   <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>9</a>].  In this MIB, rows are often added to a table in order
   to configure a function.  This configuration usually involves
   parameters that control the operation of the function.  The agent
   must check these parameters to make sure they are appropriate given
   restrictions defined in this MIB as well as any implementation
   specific restrictions such as lack of resources.  The agent
   implementor may be confused as to when to check these parameters and
   when to signal to the management station that the parameters are
   invalid.  There are two opportunities:

              o When the management station sets each parameter object.

              o When the management station sets the entry status object
                to valid.

   If the latter is chosen, it would be unclear to the management
   station which of the several parameters was invalid and caused the
   badValue error to be emitted.  Thus, wherever possible, the
   implementor should choose the former as it will provide more
   information to the management station.

   A problem can arise when multiple management stations attempt to set
   configuration information simultaneously using SNMP.  When this
   involves the addition of a new conceptual row in the same control
   table, the managers may collide, attempting to create the same entry.
   To guard against these collisions, each such control entry contains a
   status object with special semantics that help to arbitrate among the
   managers.  If an attempt is made with the row addition mechanism to
   create such a status object and that object already exists, an error
   is returned.  When more than one manager simultaneously attempts to
   create the same conceptual row, only the first will succeed.  The
   others will receive an error.

   When a manager wishes to create a new control entry, it needs to
   choose an index for that row.  It may choose this index in a variety
   of ways, hopefully minimizing the chances that the index is in use by
   another manager.  If the index is in use, the mechanism mentioned
   previously will guard against collisions.  Examples of schemes to
   choose index values include random selection or scanning the control
   table looking for the first unused index.  Because index values may
   be any valid value in the range and they are chosen by the manager,
   the agent must allow a row to be created with any unused index value
   if it has the resources to create a new row.

   Some tables in this MIB reference other tables within this MIB.  When
   creating or deleting entries in these tables, it is generally
   allowable for dangling references to exist.  There is no defined
   order for creating or deleting entries in these tables.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Conventions</span>

   The following conventions are used throughout the RMON MIB and its
   companion documents.

   Good Packets

   Good packets are error-free packets that have a valid frame length.
   For example, on Ethernet, good packets are error-free packets that
   are between 64 octets long and 1518 octets long.  They follow the
   form defined in IEEE 802.3 <a href="#section-3.2">section 3.2</a>.all.

   Bad Packets

   Bad packets are packets that have proper framing and are therefore
   recognized as packets, but contain errors within the packet or have
   an invalid length.  For example, on Ethernet, bad packets have a
   valid preamble and SFD, but have a bad CRC, or are either shorter
   than 64 octets or longer than 1518 octets.

                  "This object identifies the source of the data that
                  this etherStats entry is configured to analyze.  This
                  source can be any ethernet interface on this device.
                  In order to identify a particular interface, this
                  object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex
                  object, defined in <a href="rfc1213.html">RFC 1213</a> and <a href="rfc1573.html">RFC 1573</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>4</a>,<a href="#ref-6" title='"Evolution of the Interfaces Group of MIB-II"'>6</a>], for
                  the desired interface.  For example, if an entry
                  were to receive data from interface #1, this object
                  would be set to ifIndex.1.

                  The statistics in this group reflect all packets
                  on the local network segment attached to the
                  identified interface.

                  An agent may or may not be able to tell if
                  fundamental changes to the media of the interface
                  have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of
                  this entry.  For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet
                  card could be pulled out and replaced by a
                  token-ring card.  In such a case, if the agent has
                  such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that
                  it invalidate this entry.

                  This object may not be modified if the associated
                  etherStatsStatus object is equal to valid(1)."

                  seconds in the interval is Interval.  These values
                  are used to calculate the Utilization as follows:

                                   Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8)

                                           Interval * 10,000

                  The result of this equation is the value Utilization
                  which is the percent utilization of the ethernet
                  segment on a scale of 0 to 100 percent."

                  Probe location plays a much smaller role when
                  considering 10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE
                  standard 802.3 defines a collision as the
                  simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD
                  circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same
                  time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
                  collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes
                  placed on a station and a repeater, should report
                  the same number of collisions.

                  Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater
                  should ideally report collisions between the
                  repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit
                  collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver

                  An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental
                  changes to the media of the interface have occurred
                  and necessitate an invalidation of this entry.  For
                  example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be
                  pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card.  In
                  such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the
                  change, it is recommended that it invalidate this
                  entry.

          -- short of resources, it may delete entries as needed.  It
          -- is suggested that the device delete the least recently
          -- used entries first.

          -- The hostTable contains entries for each address
          -- discovered on a particular interface.  Each entry
          -- contains statistical data about that host.  This table is
          -- indexed by the MAC address of the host, through which a
          -- random access may be achieved.

          -- The hostTimeTable contains data in the same format as the
          -- hostTable, and must contain the same set of hosts, but is
          -- indexed using hostTimeCreationOrder rather than
          -- hostAddress.
          -- The hostTimeCreationOrder is an integer which reflects
          -- the relative order in which a particular entry was
          -- discovered and thus inserted into the table.  As this
          -- order, and thus the index, is among those entries
          -- currently in the table, the index for a particular entry
          -- may change if an (earlier) entry is deleted.  Thus the
          -- association between hostTimeCreationOrder and
          -- hostTimeEntry may be broken at any time.

          -- The hostTimeTable has two important uses.  The first is the
          -- fast download of this potentially large table.  Because the
          -- index of this table runs from 1 to the size of the table,
          -- inclusive, its values are predictable.  This allows very
          -- efficient packing of variables into SNMP PDU's and allows
          -- a table transfer to have multiple packets outstanding.
          -- These benefits increase transfer rates tremendously.

          -- The second use of the hostTimeTable is the efficient
          -- discovery by the management station of new entries added
          -- to the table. After the management station has downloaded
          -- the entire table, it knows that new entries will be added
          -- immediately after the end of the current table.  It can
          -- thus detect new entries there and retrieve them easily.

          -- Because the association between hostTimeCreationOrder and
          -- hostTimeEntry may be broken at any time, the management
          -- station must monitor the related hostControlLastDeleteTime
          -- object.  When the management station thus detects a
          -- deletion, it must assume that any such associations have
          --- been broken, and invalidate any it has stored locally.

          -- The Filter Group

          --
          -- The Filter group allows packets to be captured with an
          -- arbitrary filter expression.  A logical data and
          -- event stream or "channel" is formed by the packets
          -- that match the filter expression.
          --
          -- This filter mechanism allows the creation of an arbitrary
          -- logical expression with which to filter packets.  Each
          -- filter associated with a channel is OR'ed with the others.
          -- Within a filter, any bits checked in the data and status
          -- are AND'ed with respect to other bits in the same filter.
          -- The NotMask also allows for checking for inequality.
          -- Finally, the channelAcceptType object allows for
          -- inversion of the whole equation.
          --
          -- If a management station wishes to receive a trap to alert
          -- it that new packets have been captured and are available
          -- for download, it is recommended that it set up an alarm
          -- entry that monitors the value of the relevant
          -- channelMatches instance.
          --
          -- The channel can be turned on or off, and can also

                      the corresponding bit from the filterPktData,
                      then the packet will fail this data match.

                  "The status that is to be matched with the input
                  packet.  The only bits relevant to this match
                  algorithm are those that have the corresponding
                  filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one.  The following
                  two rules are then applied to every packet:

                  (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status
                      with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit
                      set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is
                      not equal to the corresponding bit from the
                      filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this
                      status match.

                  (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status
                      with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit
                      set to one, the bit from the packet status is
                      equal to the corresponding bit from the
                      filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this
                      status match.

                  Any packets that have not failed either of the two
                  matches above have passed this status match.  In
                  particular, a zero length status filter will match any
                  packet's status.

                  The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
                  initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
                  error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
                  2 raised to a value representing E is added to the
                  sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are
                  dependent on the media type of the interface that
                  this channel is receiving packets from.

                  The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
                  Ethernet interface are as follows:

                      bit #    Error
                          0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
                          1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                          2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment
                               error

                  For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
                  value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

                  As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this
                  object will have other media-specific errors
                  defined.

                  An agent may or may not be able to tell if
                  fundamental changes to the media of the interface
                  have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of
                  this entry.  For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet
                  card could be pulled out and replaced by a
                  token-ring card.  In such a case, if the agent has
                  such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that
                  it invalidate this entry.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.%20%20Appendix%3A%20Changes%20from%20RFC%201271"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" name="section-10">10</a>.  Appendix: Changes from <a href="rfc1271.html">RFC 1271</a></span>

   The RMON MIB has not been significantly changed since <a href="rfc1271.html">RFC 1271</a> was
   issued.

   Two changes were made to object definitions:

  1) A new status bit has been defined for the
     captureBufferPacketStatus object, indicating that the packet
     order within the capture buffer may not be identical to the
     packet order as received off the wire.  This bit may only be used
     for packets transmitted by the probe.  Older NMS applications can
     safely ignore this status bit, which might be used by newer
     agents.

  2) The packetMatch trap has been removed.  This trap was never
     actually 'approved' and was not added to this document along with
     the risingAlarm and fallingAlarm traps. The packetMatch trap
     could not be throttled, which could cause disruption of normal
     network traffic under some circumstances. An NMS should configure
     a risingAlarm threshold on the appropriate channelMatches
     instance if a trap is desired for a packetMatch event. Note that
     logging of packetMatch events is still supported--only trap
     generation for such events has been removed.

   In addition, several clarifications to individual object definitions
   have been added to assist agent and NMS implementors:

     - global definition of "good packets" and "bad packets"

     - more detailed text governing conceptual row creation and
       modification

     - instructions for probes relating to interface changes and
       disruptions

     - clarification of some ethernet counter definitions

     - recommended formula for calculating network utilization

     - clarification of channel and captureBuffer behavior for some
       unusual conditions

     - examples of proper instance naming for each table
