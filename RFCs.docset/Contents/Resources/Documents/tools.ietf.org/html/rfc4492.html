<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is emerging as an attractive
   public-key cryptosystem, in particular for mobile (i.e., wireless)
   environments.  Compared to currently prevalent cryptosystems such as
   RSA, ECC offers equivalent security with smaller key sizes.  This is
   illustrated in the following table, based on [<a href="#ref-18" title='"Selecting Cryptographic Key Sizes"'>18</a>], which gives
   approximate comparable key sizes for symmetric- and asymmetric-key
   cryptosystems based on the best-known algorithms for attacking them.

                    Symmetric  |   ECC   |  DH/DSA/RSA
                   ------------+---------+-------------
                        80     |   163   |     1024
                       112     |   233   |     2048
                       128     |   283   |     3072
                       192     |   409   |     7680
                       256     |   571   |    15360

                  Table 1: Comparable Key Sizes (in bits)

   Smaller key sizes result in savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and
   computational cost that make ECC especially attractive for
   constrained environments.

   This document describes additions to TLS to support ECC, applicable
   both to TLS Version 1.0 [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>] and to TLS Version 1.1 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>3</a>].  In
   particular, it defines

   o  the use of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement
      scheme with long-term or ephemeral keys to establish the TLS
      premaster secret, and

   o  the use of fixed-ECDH certificates and ECDSA for authentication of
      TLS peers.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>
   provides an overview of ECC-based key exchange algorithms for TLS.
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> describes the use of ECC certificates for client

   This document introduces five new ECC-based key exchange algorithms
   for TLS.  All of them use ECDH to compute the TLS premaster secret,
   and they differ only in the lifetime of ECDH keys (long-term or
   ephemeral) and the mechanism (if any) used to authenticate them.  The
   derivation of the TLS master secret from the premaster secret and the
   subsequent generation of bulk encryption/MAC keys and initialization
   vectors is independent of the key exchange algorithm and not impacted
   by the introduction of ECC.

   The table below summarizes the new key exchange algorithms, which
   mimic DH_DSS, DHE_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_RSA, and DH_anon (see [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>3</a>]), respectively.

          ECDH_RSA            Fixed ECDH with RSA-signed certificates.

          ECDHE_RSA           Ephemeral ECDH with RSA signatures.

                     Table 2: ECC Key Exchange Algorithms

   The ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA key exchange mechanisms provide forward
   secrecy.  With ECDHE_RSA, a server can reuse its existing RSA
   certificate and easily comply with a constrained client's elliptic
   curve preferences (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).  However, the computational cost

   incurred by a server is higher for ECDHE_RSA than for the traditional
   RSA key exchange, which does not provide forward secrecy.

   The ECDH_RSA mechanism requires a server to acquire an ECC
   certificate, but the certificate issuer can still use an existing RSA
   key for signing.  This eliminates the need to update the keys of
   trusted certification authorities accepted by TLS clients.  The
   ECDH_ECDSA mechanism requires ECC keys for the server as well as the
   certification authority and is best suited for constrained devices
   unable to support RSA.

   The anonymous key exchange algorithm does not provide authentication
   of the server or the client.  Like other anonymous TLS key exchanges,
   it is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.  Implementations of this
   algorithm SHOULD provide authentication by other means.

   Note that there is no structural difference between ECDH and ECDSA
   keys.  A certificate issuer may use X.509 v3 keyUsage and
   extendedKeyUsage extensions to restrict the use of an ECC public key
   to certain computations [<a href="#ref-15" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>15</a>].  This document refers to an ECC key as
   ECDH-capable if its use in ECDH is permitted.  ECDSA-capable is
   defined similarly.

   Figure 1 shows all messages involved in the TLS key establishment
   protocol (aka full handshake).  The addition of ECC has direct impact
   only on the ClientHello, the ServerHello, the server's Certificate
   message, the ServerKeyExchange, the ClientKeyExchange, the
   CertificateRequest, the client's Certificate message, and the
   CertificateVerify.  Next, we describe each ECC key exchange algorithm
   in greater detail in terms of the content and processing of these
   messages.  For ease of exposition, we defer discussion of client
   authentication and associated messages (identified with a + in
   Figure 1) until <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> and of the optional ECC-specific extensions
   (which impact the Hello messages) until <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   In ECDH_ECDSA, the server's certificate MUST contain an ECDH-capable
   public key and be signed with ECDSA.

   A ServerKeyExchange MUST NOT be sent (the server's certificate
   contains all the necessary keying information required by the client
   to arrive at the premaster secret).

   The client generates an ECDH key pair on the same curve as the
   server's long-term public key and sends its public key in the
   ClientKeyExchange message (except when using client authentication
   algorithm ECDSA_fixed_ECDH or RSA_fixed_ECDH, in which case the
   modifications from <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> or <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> apply).

   Both client and server perform an ECDH operation and use the

   In ECDHE_ECDSA, the server's certificate MUST contain an ECDSA-
   capable public key and be signed with ECDSA.

   The server sends its ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification of
   the corresponding curve in the ServerKeyExchange message.  These
   parameters MUST be signed with ECDSA using the private key
   corresponding to the public key in the server's Certificate.

   The client generates an ECDH key pair on the same curve as the
   server's ephemeral ECDH key and sends its public key in the
   ClientKeyExchange message.

   Both client and server perform an ECDH operation (<a href="#section-5.10">Section 5.10</a>) and
   use the resultant shared secret as the premaster secret.

   This key exchange algorithm is the same as ECDHE_ECDSA except that
   the server's certificate MUST contain an RSA public key authorized
   for signing, and that the signature in the ServerKeyExchange message
   must be computed with the corresponding RSA private key.  The server

   In ECDH_anon, the server's Certificate, the CertificateRequest, the
   client's Certificate, and the CertificateVerify messages MUST NOT be
   sent.

   The server MUST send an ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification
   of the corresponding curve in the ServerKeyExchange message.  These
   parameters MUST NOT be signed.

   The client generates an ECDH key pair on the same curve as the
   server's ephemeral ECDH key and sends its public key in the
   ClientKeyExchange message.

   Both client and server perform an ECDH operation and use the

   calculations are performed as specified in <a href="#section-5.10">Section 5.10</a>.

   Note that while the ECDH_ECDSA, ECDHE_ECDSA, ECDH_RSA, and ECDHE_RSA
   key exchange algorithms require the server's certificate to be signed
   with a particular signature scheme, this specification (following the
   similar cases of DH_DSS, DHE_DSS, DH_RSA, and DHE_RSA in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>] and [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>3</a>])
   does not impose restrictions on signature schemes used elsewhere in
   the certificate chain.  (Often such restrictions will be useful, and
   it is expected that this will be taken into account in certification
   authorities' signing practices.  However, such restrictions are not
   strictly required in general: Even if it is beyond the capabilities
   of a client to completely validate a given chain, the client may be
   able to validate the server's certificate by relying on a trusted
   certification authority whose certificate appears as one of the
   intermediate certificates in the chain.)

   This document defines three new client authentication mechanisms,
   each named after the type of client certificate involved: ECDSA_sign,
   ECDSA_fixed_ECDH, and RSA_fixed_ECDH.  The ECDSA_sign mechanism is
   usable with any of the non-anonymous ECC key exchange algorithms
   described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> as well as other non-anonymous (non-ECC) key
   exchange algorithms defined in TLS [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>][3].  The ECDSA_fixed_ECDH and
   RSA_fixed_ECDH mechanisms are usable with ECDH_ECDSA and ECDH_RSA.
   Their use with ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA is prohibited because the
   use of a long-term ECDH client key would jeopardize the forward
   secrecy property of these algorithms.

   The server can request ECC-based client authentication by including
   one or more of these certificate types in its CertificateRequest
   message.  The server must not include any certificate types that are
   prohibited for the negotiated key exchange algorithm.  The client
   must check if it possesses a certificate appropriate for any of the
   methods suggested by the server and is willing to use it for
   authentication.

   If these conditions are not met, the client should send a client
   Certificate message containing no certificates.  In this case, the
   ClientKeyExchange should be sent as described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, and the
   CertificateVerify should not be sent.  If the server requires client
   authentication, it may respond with a fatal handshake failure alert.

   If the client has an appropriate certificate and is willing to use it
   for authentication, it must send that certificate in the client's
   Certificate message (as per <a href="#section-5.6">Section 5.6</a>) and prove possession of the
   private key corresponding to the certified key.  The process of
   determining an appropriate certificate and proving possession is
   different for each authentication mechanism and described below.

   NOTE: It is permissible for a server to request (and the client to
   send) a client certificate of a different type than the server
   certificate.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20ECDSA_sign"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  ECDSA_sign</span>

   To use this authentication mechanism, the client MUST possess a
   certificate containing an ECDSA-capable public key and signed with
   ECDSA.

   The client proves possession of the private key corresponding to the
   certified key by including a signature in the CertificateVerify
   message as described in <a href="#section-5.8">Section 5.8</a>.

   To use this authentication mechanism, the client MUST possess a
   certificate containing an ECDH-capable public key, and that
   certificate MUST be signed with ECDSA.  Furthermore, the client's
   ECDH key MUST be on the same elliptic curve as the server's long-term
   (certified) ECDH key.  This might limit use of this mechanism to
   closed environments.  In situations where the client has an ECC key
   on a different curve, it would have to authenticate using either
   ECDSA_sign or a non-ECC mechanism (e.g., RSA).  Using fixed ECDH for
   both servers and clients is computationally more efficient than
   mechanisms providing forward secrecy.

   When using this authentication mechanism, the client MUST send an
   empty ClientKeyExchange as described in <a href="#section-5.7">Section 5.7</a> and MUST NOT send
   the CertificateVerify message.  The ClientKeyExchange is empty since
   the client's ECDH public key required by the server to compute the
   premaster secret is available inside the client's certificate.  The
   client's ability to arrive at the same premaster secret as the server
   (demonstrated by a successful exchange of Finished messages) proves
   possession of the private key corresponding to the certified public
   key, and the CertificateVerify message is unnecessary.

   This authentication mechanism is identical to ECDSA_fixed_ECDH except
   that the client's certificate MUST be signed with RSA.

   Note that while the ECDSA_sign, ECDSA_fixed_ECDH, and RSA_fixed_ECDH
   client authentication mechanisms require the client's certificate to
   be signed with a particular signature scheme, this specification does
   not impose restrictions on signature schemes used elsewhere in the
   certificate chain.  (Often such restrictions will be useful, and it
   is expected that this will be taken into account in certification
   authorities' signing practices.  However, such restrictions are not
   strictly required in general: Even if it is beyond the capabilities
   of a server to completely validate a given chain, the server may be
   able to validate the clients certificate by relying on a trust anchor
   that appears as one of the intermediate certificates in the chain.)

   Two new TLS extensions are defined in this specification: (i) the
   Supported Elliptic Curves Extension, and (ii) the Supported Point
   Formats Extension.  These allow negotiating the use of specific
   curves and point formats (e.g., compressed vs. uncompressed,
   respectively) during a handshake starting a new session.  These
   extensions are especially relevant for constrained clients that may

   only support a limited number of curves or point formats.  They
   follow the general approach outlined in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions"'>4</a>]; message details are
   specified in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  The client enumerates the curves it supports
   and the point formats it can parse by including the appropriate
   extensions in its ClientHello message.  The server similarly
   enumerates the point formats it can parse by including an extension
   in its ServerHello message.

   A TLS client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its ClientHello
   message SHOULD include these extensions.  Servers implementing ECC
   cipher suites MUST support these extensions, and when a client uses
   these extensions, servers MUST NOT negotiate the use of an ECC cipher
   suite unless they can complete the handshake while respecting the
   choice of curves and compression techniques specified by the client.
   This eliminates the possibility that a negotiated ECC handshake will
   be subsequently aborted due to a client's inability to deal with the
   server's EC key.

   The client MUST NOT include these extensions in the ClientHello
   message if it does not propose any ECC cipher suites.  A client that
   proposes ECC cipher suites may choose not to include these
   extensions.  In this case, the server is free to choose any one of
   the elliptic curves or point formats listed in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  That
   section also describes the structure and processing of these
   extensions in greater detail.

   In the case of session resumption, the server simply ignores the
   Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and the Supported Point Formats
   Extension appearing in the current ClientHello message.  These
   extensions only play a role during handshakes negotiating a new
   session.

   The general structure of TLS extensions is described in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions"'>4</a>], and this
   specification adds two new types to ExtensionType.

       enum { elliptic_curves(10), ec_point_formats(11) } ExtensionType;

   elliptic_curves (Supported Elliptic Curves Extension):   Indicates
      the set of elliptic curves supported by the client.  For this
      extension, the opaque extension_data field contains
      EllipticCurveList.  See <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a> for details.

   ec_point_formats (Supported Point Formats Extension):   Indicates the
      set of point formats that the client can parse.  For this
      extension, the opaque extension_data field contains
      ECPointFormatList.  See <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a> for details.

   Actions of the sender:

   A client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its ClientHello message
   appends these extensions (along with any others), enumerating the
   curves it supports and the point formats it can parse.  Clients
   SHOULD send both the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and the
   Supported Point Formats Extension.  If the Supported Point Formats
   Extension is indeed sent, it MUST contain the value 0 (uncompressed)
   as one of the items in the list of point formats.

   Actions of the receiver:

   A server that receives a ClientHello containing one or both of these
   extensions MUST use the client's enumerated capabilities to guide its
   selection of an appropriate cipher suite.  One of the proposed ECC
   cipher suites must be negotiated only if the server can successfully
   complete the handshake while using the curves and point formats
   supported by the client (cf. Sections <a href="#section-5.3">5.3</a> and <a href="#section-5.4">5.4</a>).

   NOTE: A server participating in an ECDHE-ECDSA key exchange may use
   different curves for (i) the ECDSA key in its certificate, and (ii)
   the ephemeral ECDH key in the ServerKeyExchange message.  The server
   must consider the extensions in both cases.

   If a server does not understand the Supported Elliptic Curves
   Extension, does not understand the Supported Point Formats Extension,
   or is unable to complete the ECC handshake while restricting itself
   to the enumerated curves and point formats, it MUST NOT negotiate the
   use of an ECC cipher suite.  Depending on what other cipher suites
   are proposed by the client and supported by the server, this may
   result in a fatal handshake failure alert due to the lack of common
   cipher suites.

   of the following octets.  Note that the first two octets indicate the
   extension type (Supported Elliptic Curves Extension):

        00 0A 00 06 00 04 00 13 00 15

   A client that supports arbitrary explicit characteristic-2 curves

   This section specifies a TLS extension that can be included with the
   ServerHello message as described in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions"'>4</a>], the Supported Point Formats
   Extension.

   When this extension is sent:

   The Supported Point Formats Extension is included in a ServerHello
   message in response to a ClientHello message containing the Supported
   Point Formats Extension when negotiating an ECC cipher suite.

   Meaning of this extension:

   This extension allows a server to enumerate the point formats it can
   parse (for the curve that will appear in its ServerKeyExchange
   message when using the ECDHE_ECDSA, ECDHE_RSA, or ECDH_anon key
   exchange algorithm, or for the curve that is used in the server's
   public key that will appear in its Certificate message when using the
   ECDH_ECDSA or ECDH_RSA key exchange algorithm).

   Structure of this extension:

   The server's Supported Point Formats Extension has the same structure
   as the client's Supported Point Formats Extension (see
   <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>).  Items in elliptic_curve_list here are ordered
   according to the server's preference (favorite choice first).  Note
   that the server may include items that were not found in the client's
   list (e.g., the server may prefer to receive points in compressed
   format even when a client cannot parse this format: the same client
   may nevertheless be capable of outputting points in compressed
   format).

   Actions of the sender:

   A server that selects an ECC cipher suite in response to a
   ClientHello message including a Supported Point Formats Extension
   appends this extension (along with others) to its ServerHello
   message, enumerating the point formats it can parse.  The Supported
   Point Formats Extension, when used, MUST contain the value 0
   (uncompressed) as one of the items in the list of point formats.

   Actions of the receiver:

   A client that receives a ServerHello message containing a Supported
   Point Formats Extension MUST respect the server's choice of point
   formats during the handshake (cf. Sections <a href="#section-5.6">5.6</a> and <a href="#section-5.7">5.7</a>).  If no
   Supported Point Formats Extension is received with the ServerHello,
   this is equivalent to an extension allowing only the uncompressed
   point format.

   When this message is sent:

   This message is sent in all non-anonymous ECC-based key exchange
   algorithms.

   Meaning of this message:

   This message is used to authentically convey the server's static
   public key to the client.  The following table shows the server
   certificate type appropriate for each key exchange algorithm.  ECC
   public keys MUST be encoded in certificates as described in
   <a href="#section-5.9">Section 5.9</a>.

   NOTE: The server's Certificate message is capable of carrying a chain
   of certificates.  The restrictions mentioned in Table 3 apply only to
   the server's certificate (first in the chain).

                                  MUST be signed with ECDSA.

                                  MUST be signed with RSA.

          ECDHE_RSA               Certificate MUST contain an

                                  use in digital signatures.  It
                                  MUST be signed with RSA.

                    Table 3: Server Certificate Types

   Structure of this message:

   Identical to the TLS Certificate format.

   Actions of the sender:

   The server constructs an appropriate certificate chain and conveys it
   to the client in the Certificate message.  If the client has used a
   Supported Elliptic Curves Extension, the public key in the server's
   certificate MUST respect the client's choice of elliptic curves; in
   particular, the public key MUST employ a named curve (not the same
   curve as an explicit curve) unless the client has indicated support
   for explicit curves of the appropriate type.  If the client has used
   a Supported Point Formats Extension, both the server's public key
   point and (in the case of an explicit curve) the curve's base point
   MUST respect the client's choice of point formats.  (A server that
   cannot satisfy these requirements MUST NOT choose an ECC cipher suite
   in its ServerHello message.)

   Actions of the receiver:

   The client validates the certificate chain, extracts the server's
   public key, and checks that the key type is appropriate for the
   negotiated key exchange algorithm.  (A possible reason for a fatal
   handshake failure is that the client's capabilities for handling

   k1, k2, k3:   The exponents for the pentanomial representation x^m +
      x^k3 + x^k2 + x^k1 + 1 (such that k3 &gt; k2 &gt; k1).

   namedcurve:   Specifies a recommended set of elliptic curve domain
      parameters.  All those values of NamedCurve are allowed that refer
      to a specific curve.  Values of NamedCurve that indicate support
      for a class of explicitly defined curves are not allowed here
      (they are only permissible in the ClientHello extension); this
      applies to arbitrary_explicit_prime_curves(0xFF01) and
      arbitrary_explicit_char2_curves(0xFF02).

            ECParameters    curve_params;
            ECPoint         public;
        } ServerECDHParams;

   curve_params:   Specifies the elliptic curve domain parameters
      associated with the ECDH public key.

   public:   The ephemeral ECDH public key.

   The ServerKeyExchange message is extended as follows.

        enum { ec_diffie_hellman } KeyExchangeAlgorithm;

   ec_diffie_hellman:   Indicates the ServerKeyExchange message contains
      an ECDH public key.

        select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
            case ec_diffie_hellman:
                ServerECDHParams    params;
                Signature           signed_params;
        } ServerKeyExchange;

   params:   Specifies the ECDH public key and associated domain
      parameters.

   signed_params:   A hash of the params, with the signature appropriate
      to that hash applied.  The private key corresponding to the
      certified public key in the server's Certificate message is used
      for signing.

          enum { ecdsa } SignatureAlgorithm;

          select (SignatureAlgorithm) {
              case ecdsa:
                  digitally-signed struct {
                      opaque sha_hash[sha_size];

   NOTE: SignatureAlgorithm is "rsa" for the ECDHE_RSA key exchange
   algorithm and "anonymous" for ECDH_anon.  These cases are defined in
   TLS [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>][3].  SignatureAlgorithm is "ecdsa" for ECDHE_ECDSA.  ECDSA
   signatures are generated and verified as described in <a href="#section-5.10">Section 5.10</a>,
   and SHA in the above template for sha_hash accordingly may denote a
   hash algorithm other than SHA-1.  As per ANSI X9.62, an ECDSA
   signature consists of a pair of integers, r and s.  The digitally-

   Actions of the sender:

   The server selects elliptic curve domain parameters and an ephemeral

   The client verifies the signature (when present) and retrieves the
   server's elliptic curve domain parameters and ephemeral ECDH public
   key from the ServerKeyExchange message.  (A possible reason for a
   fatal handshake failure is that the client's capabilities for

   Actions of the sender:

   The server decides which client authentication methods it would like
   to use, and conveys this information to the client using the format
   defined above.

   Actions of the receiver:

   The client determines whether it has a suitable certificate for use

   When this message is sent:

   This message is sent in response to a CertificateRequest when a
   client has a suitable certificate and has decided to proceed with
   client authentication.  (Note that if the server has used a Supported
   Point Formats Extension, a certificate can only be considered
   suitable for use with the ECDSA_sign, RSA_fixed_ECDH, and
   ECDSA_fixed_ECDH authentication methods if the public key point
   specified in it respects the server's choice of point formats.  If no
   Supported Point Formats Extension has been used, a certificate can
   only be considered suitable for use with these authentication methods
   if the point is represented in uncompressed point format.)

   Meaning of this message:

   This message is used to authentically convey the client's static
   public key to the server.  The following table summarizes what client
   certificate types are appropriate for the ECC-based client
   authentication mechanisms described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  ECC public keys
   must be encoded in certificates as described in <a href="#section-5.9">Section 5.9</a>.

   NOTE: The client's Certificate message is capable of carrying a chain
   of certificates.  The restrictions mentioned in Table 4 apply only to
   the client's certificate (first in the chain).

                     Table 4: Client Certificate Types

   Structure of this message:

   Identical to the TLS client Certificate format.

   Actions of the sender:

   The client constructs an appropriate certificate chain, and conveys
   it to the server in the Certificate message.

   Actions of the receiver:

   The TLS server validates the certificate chain, extracts the client's
   public key, and checks that the key type is appropriate for the
   client authentication method.

   Meaning of the message:

   This message is used to convey ephemeral data relating to the key
   exchange belonging to the client (such as its ephemeral ECDH public
   key).

   Structure of this message:

   The TLS ClientKeyExchange message is extended as follows.

        enum { implicit, explicit } PublicValueEncoding;

   implicit, explicit:   For ECC cipher suites, this indicates whether
      the client's ECDH public key is in the client's certificate
      ("implicit") or is provided, as an ephemeral ECDH public key, in
      the ClientKeyExchange message ("explicit").  (This is "explicit"
      in ECC cipher suites except when the client uses the
      ECDSA_fixed_ECDH or RSA_fixed_ECDH client authentication
      mechanism.)

        struct {
            select (PublicValueEncoding) {
                case implicit: struct { };
                case explicit: ECPoint ecdh_Yc;
            } ecdh_public;
        } ClientECDiffieHellmanPublic;

   ecdh_Yc:   Contains the client's ephemeral ECDH public key as a byte
      string ECPoint.point, which may represent an elliptic curve point
      in uncompressed or compressed format.  Here, the format MUST
      conform to what the server has requested through a Supported Point
      Formats Extension if this extension was used, and MUST be
      uncompressed if this extension was not used.

        struct {
            select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
                case ec_diffie_hellman: ClientECDiffieHellmanPublic;
            } exchange_keys;
        } ClientKeyExchange;

   Actions of the sender:

   The client selects an ephemeral ECDH public key corresponding to the
   parameters it received from the server according to the ECKAS-DH1
   scheme from IEEE 1363 [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>6</a>].  It conveys this information to the client
   in the ClientKeyExchange message using the format defined above.

   When this message is sent:

   This message is sent when the client sends a client certificate
   containing a public key usable for digital signatures, e.g., when the
   client is authenticated using the ECDSA_sign mechanism.

   Meaning of the message:

   This message contains a signature that proves possession of the
   private key corresponding to the public key in the client's
   Certificate message.

   Structure of this message:

   The TLS CertificateVerify message and the underlying Signature type
   are defined in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>] and [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>3</a>], and the latter is extended here in
   <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>.  For the ecdsa case, the signature field in the
   CertificateVerify message contains an ECDSA signature computed over
   handshake messages exchanged so far, exactly similar to
   CertificateVerify with other signing algorithms in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>] and [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>3</a>]:

   ECDSA signatures are computed as described in <a href="#section-5.10">Section 5.10</a>, and SHA
   in the above template for sha_hash accordingly may denote a hash
   algorithm other than SHA-1.  As per ANSI X9.62, an ECDSA signature
   consists of a pair of integers, r and s.  The digitally-signed
   element is encoded as an opaque vector &lt;0..2^16-1&gt;, the contents of
   which are the DER encoding [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Information technology - ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Basic Encoding Rules (BER), Canonical Encoding Rules (CER) and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)"'>9</a>] corresponding to the following ASN.1

   Actions of the sender:

   The client computes its signature over all handshake messages sent or
   received starting at client hello and up to but not including this
   message.  It uses the private key corresponding to its certified
   public key to compute the signature, which is conveyed in the format
   defined above.

   Actions of the receiver:

   The server extracts the client's signature from the CertificateVerify
   message, and verifies the signature using the public key it received
   in the client's Certificate message.

   in ANSI X9.62 [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>7</a>], FIPS 186-2 [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Digital Signature Standard"'>11</a>], and SEC 2 [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters"'>13</a>].

   All ECDH calculations (including parameter and key generation as well
   as the shared secret calculation) are performed according to [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>6</a>]
   using the ECKAS-DH1 scheme with the identity map as key derivation
   function (KDF), so that the premaster secret is the x-coordinate of
   the ECDH shared secret elliptic curve point represented as an octet
   string.  Note that this octet string (Z in IEEE 1363 terminology) as
   output by FE2OSP, the Field Element to Octet String Conversion
   Primitive, has constant length for any given field; leading zeros
   found in this octet string MUST NOT be truncated.

   (Note that this use of the identity KDF is a technicality.  The
   complete picture is that ECDH is employed with a non-trivial KDF
   because TLS does not directly use the premaster secret for anything
   other than for computing the master secret.  As of TLS 1.0 [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>] and
   1.1 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>3</a>], this means that the MD5- and SHA-1-based TLS PRF serves as a
   KDF; it is conceivable that future TLS versions or new TLS extensions
   introduced in the future may vary this computation.)

   All ECDSA computations MUST be performed according to ANSI X9.62 [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>7</a>]
   or its successors.  Data to be signed/verified is hashed, and the
   result run directly through the ECDSA algorithm with no additional
   hashing.  The default hash function is SHA-1 [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>10</a>], and sha_size (see
   Sections <a href="#section-5.4">5.4</a> and <a href="#section-5.8">5.8</a>) is 20.  However, an alternative hash function,
   such as one of the new SHA hash functions specified in FIPS 180-2
   [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>10</a>], may be used instead if the certificate containing the EC public

   The key exchange method, cipher, and hash algorithm for each of these
   cipher suites are easily determined by examining the name.  Ciphers
   (other than AES ciphers) and hash algorithms are defined in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>3</a>].  AES ciphers are defined in [<a href="#ref-19" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>19</a>].

   Server implementations SHOULD support all of the following cipher
   suites, and client implementations SHOULD support at least one of
   them: TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,
   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, and
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.

   Security issues are discussed throughout this memo.

   For TLS handshakes using ECC cipher suites, the security
   considerations in appendices D.2 and D.3 of [<a href="#ref-2" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>2</a>] and [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>3</a>] apply
   accordingly.

   Security discussions specific to ECC can be found in [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>6</a>] and [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>7</a>].
   One important issue that implementers and users must consider is
   elliptic curve selection.  Guidance on selecting an appropriate
   elliptic curve size is given in Table 1.

   Beyond elliptic curve size, the main issue is elliptic curve
   structure.  As a general principle, it is more conservative to use
   elliptic curves with as little algebraic structure as possible.
   Thus, random curves are more conservative than special curves such as
   Koblitz curves, and curves over F_p with p random are more
   conservative than curves over F_p with p of a special form (and
   curves over F_p with p random might be considered more conservative
   than curves over F_2^m as there is no choice between multiple fields
   of similar size for characteristic 2).  Note, however, that algebraic
   structure can also lead to implementation efficiencies, and
   implementers and users may, therefore, need to balance conservatism
   against a need for efficiency.  Concrete attacks are known against
   only very few special classes of curves, such as supersingular
   curves, and these classes are excluded from the ECC standards that
   this document references [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>6</a>], [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>7</a>].

   Another issue is the potential for catastrophic failures when a
   single elliptic curve is widely used.  In this case, an attack on the
   elliptic curve might result in the compromise of a large number of
   keys.  Again, this concern may need to be balanced against efficiency
   and interoperability improvements associated with widely-used curves.
   Substantial additional information on elliptic curve choice can be
   found in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptography"'>5</a>], [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>6</a>], [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"'>7</a>], and [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Digital Signature Standard"'>11</a>].

   Implementers and users must also consider whether they need forward
   secrecy.  Forward secrecy refers to the property that session keys
   are not compromised if the static, certified keys belonging to the
   server and client are compromised.  The ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA key
   exchange algorithms provide forward secrecy protection in the event
   of server key compromise, while ECDH_ECDSA and ECDH_RSA do not.
   Similarly, if the client is providing a static, certified key,
   ECDSA_sign client authentication provides forward secrecy protection
   in the event of client key compromise, while ECDSA_fixed_ECDH and
   RSA_fixed_ECDH do not.  Thus, to obtain complete forward secrecy
   protection, ECDHE_ECDSA or ECDHE_RSA must be used for key exchange,
   with ECDSA_sign used for client authentication if necessary.  Here
   again the security benefits of forward secrecy may need to be
   balanced against the improved efficiency offered by other options.

   This document describes three new name spaces for use with the TLS
   protocol:

   o  NamedCurve (<a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>)

   o  ECPointFormat (<a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>)

   o  ECCurveType (<a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>)

   For each name space, this document defines the initial value
   assignments and defines a range of 256 values (NamedCurve) or eight
   values (ECPointFormat and ECCurveType) reserved for Private Use.  Any
   additional assignments require IETF Consensus action [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>16</a>].
