Abstract

   This document describes a Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) that
   was developed jointly by Cisco Systems, Inc., Nuance Communications,
   and Speechworks, Inc.  It is published as an RFC as input for further
   IETF development in this area.

   MRCP controls media service resources like speech synthesizers,
   recognizers, signal generators, signal detectors, fax servers, etc.,
   over a network.  This protocol is designed to work with streaming
   protocols like RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) or SIP (Session
   Initiation Protocol), which help establish control connections to
   external media streaming devices, and media delivery mechanisms like
   RTP (Real Time Protocol).

   The Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) is designed to provide a
   mechanism for a client device requiring audio/video stream processing
   to control processing resources on the network.  These media
   processing resources may be speech recognizers (a.k.a. Automatic-
   Speech-Recognition (ASR) engines), speech synthesizers (a.k.a. Text-
   To-Speech (TTS) engines), fax, signal detectors, etc.  MRCP allows
   implementation of distributed Interactive Voice Response platforms,
   for example VoiceXML [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.0"'>6</a>] interpreters.  The MRCP protocol defines the
   requests, responses, and events needed to control the media
   processing resources.  The MRCP protocol defines the state machine
   for each resource and the required state transitions for each request
   and server-generated event.

   The MRCP protocol does not address how the control session is
   established with the server and relies on the Real Time Streaming
   Protocol (RTSP) [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)"'>2</a>] to establish and maintain the session.  The
   session control protocol is also responsible for establishing the
   media connection from the client to the network server.  The MRCP
   protocol and its messaging is designed to be carried over RTSP or
   another protocol as a MIME-type similar to the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [<a href="#ref-5" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>5</a>].

   The system consists of a client that requires media streams generated
   or needs media streams processed and a server that has the resources
   or devices to process or generate the streams.  The client
   establishes a control session with the server for media processing
   using a protocol such as RTSP.  This will also set up and establish
   the RTP stream between the client and the server or another RTP
   endpoint.  Each resource needed in processing or generating the
   stream is addressed or referred to by a URL.  The client can now use
   MRCP messages to control the media resources and affect how they
   process or generate the media stream.

   The server is set up to offer a certain set of resources and services
   to the client.  These resources are of 3 types.

   Transmission Resources

   These are resources that are capable of generating real-time streams,
   like signal generators that generate tones and sounds of certain
   frequencies and patterns, and speech synthesizers that generate
   spoken audio streams, etc.

   Reception Resources

   These are resources that receive and process streaming data like
   signal detectors and speech recognizers.

   Dual Mode Resources

   These are resources that both send and receive data like a fax
   resource, capable of sending or receiving fax through a two-way RTP
   stream.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Server%20and%20Resource%20Addressing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Server and Resource Addressing</span>

   The server as a whole is addressed using a container URL, and the
   individual resources the server has to offer are reached by
   individual resource URLs within the container URL.

   RTSP Example:

   A media server or container URL like,

     rtsp://mediaserver.com/media/

   may contain one or more resource URLs of the form,

     rtsp://mediaserver.com/media/speechrecognizer/
     rtsp://mediaserver.com/media/speechsynthesizer/
     rtsp://mediaserver.com/media/fax/

   The message format for MRCP is text based, with mechanisms to carry
   embedded binary data.  This allows data like recognition grammars,
   recognition results, synthesizer speech markup, etc., to be carried
   in the MRCP message between the client and the server resource.  The
   protocol does not address session control management, media
   management, reliable sequencing, and delivery or server or resource
   addressing.  These are left to a protocol like SIP or RTSP.  MRCP
   addresses the issue of controlling and communicating with the
   resource processing the stream, and defines the requests, responses,
   and events needed to do that.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Establishing%20Control%20Session%20and%20Media%20Streams"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Establishing Control Session and Media Streams</span>

   The control session between the client and the server is established
   using a protocol like RTSP.  This protocol will also set up the
   appropriate RTP streams between the server and the client, allocating
   ports and setting up transport parameters as needed.  Each control

   session is identified by a unique session-id.  The format, usage, and
   life cycle of the session-id is in accordance with the RTSP protocol.
   The resources within the session are addressed by the individual
   resource URLs.

   The MRCP protocol is designed to work with and tunnel through another
   protocol like RTSP, and augment its capabilities.  MRCP relies on
   RTSP headers for sequencing, reliability, and addressing to make sure
   that messages get delivered reliably and in the correct order and to
   the right resource.  The MRCP messages are carried in the RTSP
   message body.  The media server delivers the MRCP message to the
   appropriate resource or device by looking at the session-level
   message headers and URL information.  Another protocol, such as SIP
   [<a href="#ref-4" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>4</a>], could be used for tunneling MRCP messages.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20MRCP%20over%20RTSP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  MRCP over RTSP</span>

   RTSP supports both TCP and UDP mechanisms for the client to talk to
   the server and is differentiated by the RTSP URL.  All MRCP based
   media servers MUST support TCP for transport and MAY support UDP.

   In RTSP, the ANNOUNCE method/response MUST be used to carry MRCP
   request/responses between the client and the server.  MRCP messages
   MUST NOT be communicated in the RTSP SETUP or TEARDOWN messages.

   Currently all RTSP messages are request/responses and there is no
   support for asynchronous events in RTSP.  This is because RTSP was
   designed to work over TCP or UDP and, hence, could not assume
   reliability in the underlying protocol.  Hence, when using MRCP over
   RTSP, an asynchronous event from the MRCP server is packaged in a
   server-initiated ANNOUNCE method/response communication.  A future
   RTSP extension to send asynchronous events from the server to the
   client would provide an alternate vehicle to carry such asynchronous
   MRCP events from the server.

   An RTSP session is created when an RTSP SETUP message is sent from
   the client to a server and is addressed to a server URL or any one of
   its resource URLs without specifying a session-id.  The server will
   establish a session context and will respond with a session-id to the
   client.  This sequence will also set up the RTP transport parameters
   between the client and the server, and then the server will be ready
   to receive or send media streams.  If the client wants to attach an
   additional resource to an existing session, the client should send
   that session's ID in the subsequent SETUP message.

   When a media server implementing MRCP over RTSP receives a PLAY,
   RECORD, or PAUSE RTSP method from an MRCP resource URL, it should
   respond with an RTSP 405 "Method not Allowed" response.  For these
   resources, the only allowed RTSP methods are SETUP, TEARDOWN,
   DESCRIBE, and ANNOUNCE.

   For the sake of brevity, most examples from here on show only the

   they are tunneled.  Also, RTSP messages such as response that are not
   carrying an MRCP message are also left out.

   A single set of RTP/RTCP ports is negotiated and shared between the
   MRCP client and server when multiple media processing resources, such
   as automatic speech recognition (ASR) engines and text to speech
   (TTS) engines, are used for a single session.  The individual
   resource instances allocated on the server under a common session
   identifier will feed from/to that single RTP stream.

   The client can send multiple media streams towards the server,
   differentiated by using different synchronized source (SSRC)
   identifier values.  Similarly the server can use multiple
   Synchronized Source (SSRC) identifier values to differentiate media
   streams originating from the individual transmission resource URLs if
   more than one exists.  The individual resources may, on the other
   hand, work together to send just one stream to the client.  This is
   up to the implementation of the media server.

   Since many of the definitions and syntax are identical to HTTP/1.1,
   this specification only points to the section where they are defined
   rather than copying it.  For brevity, [HX.Y] refers to Section X.Y of
   the current HTTP/1.1 specification (<a href="rfc2616.html">RFC 2616</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Hypertext transfer protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>1</a>]).

   All the mechanisms specified in this document are described in both
   prose and an augmented Backus-Naur form (ABNF) similar to that used

   The ABNF provided along with the descriptive text is informative in

   The MRCP PDU is textual using an ISO 10646 character set in the UTF-8
   encoding (<a href="rfc3629.html">RFC 3629</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>12</a>]) to allow many different languages to be
   represented.  However, to assist in compact representations, MRCP
   also allows other character sets such as ISO 8859-1 to be used when
   desired.  The MRCP protocol headers and field names use only the
   US-ASCII subset of UTF-8.  Internationalization only applies to
   certain fields like grammar, results, speech markup, etc., and not to
   MRCP as a whole.

   Lines are terminated by CRLF, but receivers SHOULD be prepared to
   also interpret CR and LF by themselves as line terminators.  Also,
   some parameters in the PDU may contain binary data or a record
   spanning multiple lines.  Such fields have a length value associated
   with the parameter, which indicates the number of octets immediately
   following the parameter.

   The whole MRCP PDU is encoded in the body of the session level
   message as a MIME entity of type application/mrcp.  The individual
   MRCP messages do not have addressing information regarding which
   resource the request/response are to/from.  Instead, the MRCP message
   relies on the header of the session level message carrying it to
   deliver the request to the appropriate resource, or to figure out who
   the response or event is from.

   The MRCP message set consists of requests from the client to the
   server, responses from the server to the client and asynchronous
   events from the server to the client.  All these messages consist of
   a start-line, one or more header fields (also known as "headers"), an
   empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating
   the end of the header fields, and an optional message body.

          generic-message =   start-line
                              message-header
                              CRLF
                              [ message-body ]

          message-body    =   *OCTET

          start-line      =   request-line / status-line / event-line

   The message-body contains resource-specific and message-specific data
   that needs to be carried between the client and server as a MIME
   entity.  The information contained here and the actual MIME-types
   used to carry the data are specified later when addressing the
   specific messages.

   If a message contains data in the message body, the header fields
   will contain content-headers indicating the MIME-type and encoding of
   the data in the message body.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20Request"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Request</span>

   An MRCP request consists of a Request line followed by zero or more
   parameters as part of the message headers and an optional message
   body containing data specific to the request message.

   The Request message from a client to the server includes, within the
   first line, the method to be applied, a method tag for that request,
   and the version of protocol in use.

     request-line   =    method-name SP request-id SP
                         mrcp-version CRLF

   The request-id field is a unique identifier created by the client and
   sent to the server.  The server resource should use this identifier
   in its response to this request.  If the request does not complete
   with the response, future asynchronous events associated with this
   request MUST carry the request-id.

     request-id    =    1*DIGIT

   The method-name field identifies the specific request that the client
   is making to the server.  Each resource supports a certain list of
   requests or methods that can be issued to it, and will be addressed
   in later sections.

     method-name    =    synthesizer-method
                    /    recognizer-method

   The mrcp-version field is the MRCP protocol version that is being
   used by the client.

     mrcp-version   =    "MRCP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

   After receiving and interpreting the request message, the server
   resource responds with an MRCP response message.  It consists of a
   status line optionally followed by a message body.

     response-line  =    mrcp-version SP request-id SP status-code SP
                         request-state CRLF

   The mrcp-version field used here is similar to the one used in the
   Request Line and indicates the version of MRCP protocol running on
   the server.

   The request-id used in the response MUST match the one sent in the
   corresponding request message.

   The status-code field is a 3-digit code representing the success or
   failure or other status of the request.

   The request-state field indicates if the job initiated by the Request
   is PENDING, IN-PROGRESS, or COMPLETE.  The COMPLETE status means that
   the Request was processed to completion and that there will be no
   more events from that resource to the client with that request-id.
   The PENDING status means that the job has been placed on a queue and
   will be processed in first-in-first-out order.  The IN-PROGRESS
   status means that the request is being processed and is not yet
   complete.  A PENDING or IN-PROGRESS status indicates that further
   Event messages will be delivered with that request-id.

     request-state    =  "COMPLETE"

   The server resource may need to communicate a change in state or the
   occurrence of a certain event to the client.  These messages are used
   when a request does not complete immediately and the response returns
   a status of PENDING or IN-PROGRESS.  The intermediate results and
   events of the request are indicated to the client through the event
   message from the server.  Events have the request-id of the request
   that is in progress and is generating these events and status value.
   The status value is COMPLETE if the request is done and this was the
   last event, else it is IN-PROGRESS.

     event-line       =  event-name SP request-id SP request-state SP
                         mrcp-version CRLF

   The mrcp-version used here is identical to the one used in the
   Request/Response Line and indicates the version of MRCP protocol
   running on the server.

   The request-id used in the event should match the one sent in the
   request that caused this event.

   The request-state indicates if the Request/Command causing this event
   is complete or still in progress, and is the same as the one
   mentioned in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>.  The final event will contain a COMPLETE
   status indicating the completion of the request.

   The event-name identifies the nature of the event generated by the
   media resource.  The set of valid event names are dependent on the
   resource generating it, and will be addressed in later sections.

   MRCP header fields, which include general-header (<a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>) and
   resource-specific-header (Sections <a href="#section-7.4">7.4</a> and <a href="#section-8.4">8.4</a>), follow the same
   generic format as that given in <a href="rfc2822.html#section-2.1">Section 2.1 of RFC 2822</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Internet Message Format"'>7</a>].  Each
   header field consists of a name followed by a colon (":") and the
   field value.  Field names are case-insensitive.  The field value MAY
   be preceded by any amount of linear whitespace (LWS), though a single
   SP is preferred.  Header fields can be extended over multiple lines
   by preceding each extra line with at least one SP or HT.

          message-header =    1*(generic-header / resource-header)

   The order in which header fields with differing field names are
   received is not significant.  However, it is "good practice" to send
   general-header fields first, followed by request-header or response-
   header fields, and ending with the entity-header fields.

   Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be
   present in a message if and only if the entire field value for that
   header field is defined as a comma-separated list (i.e., #(values)).

   It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one
   "field-name:field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the
   message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each
   separated by a comma.  Therefore, the order in which header fields
   with the same field-name are received is significant to the
   interpretation of the combined field value, and thus a proxy MUST NOT
   change the order of these field values when a message is forwarded.

   Generic Headers

     generic-header      =    active-request-id-list
                         /    proxy-sync-id

                         /    logging-tag

   All headers in MRCP will be case insensitive, consistent with HTTP
   and RTSP protocol header definitions.

   In a request, this field indicates the list of request-ids to which
   it should apply.  This is useful when there are multiple Requests
   that are PENDING or IN-PROGRESS and you want this request to apply to
   one or more of these specifically.

   In a response, this field returns the list of request-ids that the
   operation modified or were in progress or just completed.  There
   could be one or more requests that returned a request-state of
   PENDING or IN-PROGRESS.  When a method affecting one or more PENDING

   or IN-PROGRESS requests is sent from the client to the server, the
   response MUST contain the list of request-ids that were affected in
   this header field.

   The active-request-id-list is only used in requests and responses,
   not in events.

   For example, if a STOP request with no active-request-id-list is sent
   to a synthesizer resource (a wildcard STOP) that has one or more
   SPEAK requests in the PENDING or IN-PROGRESS state, all SPEAK
   requests MUST be cancelled, including the one IN-PROGRESS.  In
   addition, the response to the STOP request would contain the
   request-id of all the SPEAK requests that were terminated in the
   active-request-id-list.  In this case, no SPEAK-COMPLETE or
   RECOGNITION-COMPLETE events will be sent for these terminated
   requests.

     active-request-id-list  =  "Active-Request-Id-List" ":" request-id

   When any server resource generates a barge-in-able event, it will
   generate a unique Tag and send it as a header field in an event to
   the client.  The client then acts as a proxy to the server resource
   and sends a BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method (<a href="#section-7.10">Section 7.10</a>) to the
   synthesizer server resource with the Proxy-Sync-Id it received from
   the server resource.  When the recognizer and synthesizer resources
   are part of the same session, they may choose to work together to
   achieve quicker interaction and response.  Here, the proxy-sync-id
   helps the resource receiving the event, proxied by the client, to
   decide if this event has been processed through a direct interaction
   of the resources.

   See [H14.2].  This specifies the acceptable character set for

   request.  This is useful in specifying the character set to use in
   the Natural Language Semantics Markup Language (NLSML) results of a

   See [H14.17].  Note that the content types suitable for MRCP are
   restricted to speech markup, grammar, recognition results, etc., and
   are specified later in this document.  The multi-part content type
   "multi-part/mixed" is supported to communicate multiple of the above
   mentioned contents, in which case the body parts cannot contain any
   MRCP specific headers.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.5.%20%20Content-Id"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4.5" name="section-5.4.5">5.4.5</a>.  Content-Id</span>

   This field contains an ID or name for the content, by which it can be
   referred to.  The definition of this field conforms to <a href="rfc2392.html">RFC 2392</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Content-ID and Message-ID Uniform Resource Locators"'>14</a>],
   <a href="rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Internet Message Format"'>7</a>], <a href="rfc2046.html">RFC 2046</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>13</a>] and is needed in multi-part messages.  In
   MRCP whenever the content needs to be stored, by either the client or
   the server, it is stored associated with this ID.  Such content can
   be referenced during the session in URI form using the session:URI
   scheme described in a later section.

   The content-base entity-header field may be used to specify the base
   URI for resolving relative URLs within the entity.

     content-base      = "Content-Base" ":" absoluteURI CRLF

   Note, however, that the base URI of the contents within the entity-
   body may be redefined within that entity-body.  An example of this
   would be a multi-part MIME entity, which in turn can have multiple
   entities within it.

   The content-encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the
   media-type.  When present, its value indicates what additional
   content coding has been applied to the entity-body, and thus what
   decoding mechanisms must be applied in order to obtain the media-type
   referenced by the content-type header field.  Content-encoding is
   primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without losing
   the identity of its underlying media type.

                              / "_" / "+" / "`" / "'" / "~" )

   Content coding is defined in [H3.5].  An example of its use is

     Content-Encoding:gzip

   If multiple encodings have been applied to an entity, the content
   codings MUST be listed in the order in which they were applied.

   The content-location entity-header field MAY BE used to supply the
   resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that
   entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested
   resource's URI.

     content-location =  "Content-Location" ":" ( absoluteURI /
                             relativeURI ) CRLF

   The content-location value is a statement of the location of the
   resource corresponding to this particular entity at the time of the
   request.  The media server MAY use this header field to optimize
   certain operations.  When providing this header field, the entity
   being sent should not have been modified from what was retrieved from
   the content-location URI.

   For example, if the client provided a grammar markup inline, and it
   had previously retrieved it from a certain URI, that URI can be
   provided as part of the entity, using the content-location header
   field.  This allows a resource like the recognizer to look into its
   cache to see if this grammar was previously retrieved, compiled, and
   cached.  In which case, it might optimize by using the previously
   compiled grammar object.

   If the content-location is a relative URI, the relative URI is
   interpreted relative to the content-base URI.

   This field contains the length of the content of the message body
   (i.e., after the double CRLF following the last header field).
   Unlike HTTP, it MUST be included in all messages that carry content
   beyond the header portion of the message.  If it is missing, a
   default value of zero is assumed.  It is interpreted according to
   [H14.13].

   If the media server plans on implementing caching, it MUST adhere to
   the cache correctness rules of HTTP 1.1 (<a href="rfc2616.html">RFC2616</a>), when accessing and
   caching HTTP URI.  In particular, the expires and cache-control
   headers of the cached URI or document must be honored and will always
   take precedence over the Cache-Control defaults set by this header
   field.  The cache-control directives are used to define the default
   caching algorithms on the media server for the session or request.
   The scope of the directive is based on the method it is sent on.  If
   the directives are sent on a SET-PARAMS method, it SHOULD apply for
   all requests for documents the media server may make in that session.
   If the directives are sent on any other messages, they MUST only
   apply to document requests the media server needs to make for that
   method.  An empty cache-control header on the GET-PARAMS method is a
   request for the media server to return the current cache-control
   directives setting on the server.

          cache-control  =    "Cache-Control" ":" *WSP cache-directive
                              *( *WSP "," *WSP cache-directive *WSP )

                          /   "min-fresh" "=" delta-seconds

          delta-seconds       = 1*DIGIT

   Here, delta-seconds is a time value to be specified as an integer
   number of seconds, represented in decimal, after the time that the
   message response or data was received by the media server.

   These directives allow the media server to override the basic
   expiration mechanism.

   max-age

      Indicates that the client is OK with the media server using a
      response whose age is no greater than the specified time in
      seconds.  Unless a max-stale directive is also included, the
      client is not willing to accept the media server using a stale
      response.

   min-fresh

      Indicates that the client is willing to accept the media server
      using a response whose freshness lifetime is no less than its
      current age plus the specified time in seconds.  That is, the

      client wants the media server to use a response that will still be
      fresh for at least the specified number of seconds.

   max-stale

      Indicates that the client is willing to accept the media server
      using a response that has exceeded its expiration time.  If max-
      stale is assigned a value, then the client is willing to accept
      the media server using a response that has exceeded its expiration
      time by no more than the specified number of seconds.  If no value
      is assigned to max-stale, then the client is willing to accept the
      media server using a stale response of any age.

   The media server cache MAY BE requested to use stale response/data
   without validation, but only if this does not conflict with any
   "MUST"-level requirements concerning cache validation (e.g., a
   "must-revalidate" cache-control directive) in the HTTP 1.1
   specification pertaining the URI.

   If both the MRCP cache-control directive and the cached entry on the
   media server include "max-age" directives, then the lesser of the two
   values is used for determining the freshness of the cached entry for
   that request.

   Once set, the value persists until a new value is set or the session
   is ended.  The MRCP server should provide a mechanism to subset its

   the log file portion during which the logging tag was set to a
   certain value.

   MRCP clients using this feature should take care to ensure that no

   application follows the SIP <a href="rfc2543.html">RFC 2543</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>4</a>], but is limited to media-
   related negotiation and description.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20%20Media%20Server%20Session"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Media Server Session</span>

   As discussed in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>, a client/server should share one RTSP
   session-id for the different resources it may use under the same
   session.  The client MUST allocate a set of client RTP/RTCP ports for
   a new session and MUST NOT send a Session-ID in the SETUP message for
   the first resource.  The server then creates a Session-ID and
   allocates a set of server RTP/RTCP ports and responds to the SETUP
   message.

   If the client wants to open more resources with the same server under
   the same session, it will send the session-id (that it got in the
   earlier SETUP response) in the SETUP for the new resource.  A SETUP
   message with an existing session-id tells the server that this new
   resource will feed from/into the same RTP/RTCP stream of that
   existing session.

   If the client wants to open a resource from a media server that is
   not where the first resource came from, it will send separate SETUP
   requests with no session-id header field in them.  Each server will
   allocate its own session-id and return it in the response.  Each of
   them will also come back with their own set of RTP/RTCP ports.  This
   would be the case when the synthesizer engine and the recognition
   engine are on different servers.

   The RTSP SETUP method SHOULD contain an SDP description of the media
   stream being set up.  The RTSP SETUP response MUST contain an SDP
   description of the media stream that it expects to receive and send
   on that session.

   The SDP description in the SETUP method from the client SHOULD
   describe the required media parameters like codec, Named Signaling
   Event (NSE) payload types, etc.  This could have multiple media

   headers (i.e., m-lines) to allow the client to provide the media
   server with more than one option to choose from.

   The SDP description in the SETUP response should reflect the media

   If an SDP description was not provided in the RTSP SETUP method, then
   the media server may decide on parameters of the stream but MUST
   specify what it chooses in the SETUP response.  An SDP announcement
   is only returned in a response to a SETUP message that does not
   specify a Session.  That is, the server will not return an SDP
   announcement for the synthesizer SETUP of a session already
   established with a recognizer.

   This resource is capable of converting text provided by the client
   and generating a speech stream in real-time.  Depending on the
   implementation and capability of this resource, the client can
   control parameters like voice characteristics, speaker speed, etc.

   The synthesizer resource is controlled by MRCP requests from the
   client.  Similarly, the resource can respond to these requests or
   generate asynchronous events to the server to indicate certain
   conditions during the processing of the stream.

   to say that audio is only fetched when it is needed, never before;
   "prefetch" to permit, but not require the platform to pre-fetch the

   Marked-up text for the synthesizer to speak is specified as a MIME
   entity in the message body.  The message to be spoken by the
   synthesizer can be specified inline (by embedding the data in the
   message body) or by reference (by providing the URI to the data).  In
   either case, the data and the format used to markup the speech needs
   to be supported by the media server.

   All media servers MUST support plain text speech data and W3C's
   Speech Synthesis Markup Language [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0"'>9</a>] at a minimum and, hence, MUST
   support the MIME types text/plain and application/synthesis+ssml at a
   minimum.

   If the speech data needs to be specified by URI reference, the MIME
   type text/uri-list is used to specify the one or more URIs that will
   list what needs to be spoken.  If a list of speech URIs is specified,
   speech data provided by each URI must be spoken in the order in which
   the URI are specified.

   If the data to be spoken consists of a mix of URI and inline speech
   data, the multipart/mixed MIME-type is used and embedded with the
   MIME-blocks for text/uri-list, application/synthesis+ssml or
   text/plain.  The character set and encoding used in the speech data
   may be specified according to standard MIME-type definitions.  The
   multi-part MIME-block can contain actual audio data in .wav or Sun
   audio format.  This is used when the client has audio clips that it
   may have recorded, then stored in memory or a local device, and that
   it currently needs to play as part of the SPEAK request.  The audio
   MIME-parts can be sent by the client as part of the multi-part MIME-
   block.  This audio will be referenced in the speech markup data that
   will be another part in the multi-part MIME-block according to the
   multipart/mixed MIME-type specification.

   The SET-PARAMS method, from the client to server, tells the
   synthesizer resource to define default synthesizer context
   parameters, like voice characteristics and prosody, etc.  If the
   server accepted and set all parameters, it MUST return a Response-
   Status of 200.  If it chose to ignore some optional parameters, it
   MUST return 201.

   If some of the parameters being set are unsupported or have illegal
   values, the server accepts and sets the remaining parameters and MUST
   respond with a Response-Status of 403 or 404, and MUST include in the
   response the header fields that could not be set.

   Example:
     C-&gt;S:SET-PARAMS 543256 MRCP/1.0
         Voice-gender:female
         Voice-category:adult

   The GET-PARAMS method, from the client to server, asks the
   synthesizer resource for its current synthesizer context parameters,
   like voice characteristics and prosody, etc.  The client SHOULD send
   the list of parameters it wants to read from the server by listing a
   set of empty parameter header fields.  If a specific list is not
   specified then the server SHOULD return all the settable parameters
   including vendor-specific parameters and their current values.  The
   wild card use can be very intensive as the number of settable
   parameters can be large depending on the vendor.  Hence, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the client does not use the wildcard GET-PARAMS
   operation very often.

   Example:
     C-&gt;S:GET-PARAMS 543256 MRCP/1.0
          Voice-gender:

   The SPEAK method from the client to the server provides the
   synthesizer resource with the speech text and initiates speech
   synthesis and streaming.  The SPEAK method can carry voice and
   prosody header fields that define the behavior of the voice being
   synthesized, as well as the actual marked-up text to be spoken.  If
   specific voice and prosody parameters are specified as part of the
   speech markup text, it will take precedence over the values specified
   in the header fields and those set using a previous SET-PARAMS
   request.

   When applying voice parameters, there are 3 levels of scope.  The
   highest precedence are those specified within the speech markup text,
   followed by those specified in the header fields of the SPEAK request
   and, hence, apply for that SPEAK request only, followed by the
   session default values that can be set using the SET-PARAMS request
   and apply for the whole session moving forward.

   If the resource is idle and the SPEAK request is being actively
   processed, the resource will respond with a success status code and a
   request-state of IN-PROGRESS.

   If the resource is in the speaking or paused states (i.e., it is in
   the middle of processing a previous SPEAK request), the status
   returns success and a request-state of PENDING.  This means that this
   SPEAK request is in queue and will be processed after the currently
   active SPEAK request is completed.

   For the synthesizer resource, this is the only request that can
   return a request-state of IN-PROGRESS or PENDING.  When the text to
   be synthesized is complete, the resource will issue a SPEAK-COMPLETE
   event with the request-id of the SPEAK message and a request-state of
   COMPLETE.

   The STOP method from the client to the server tells the resource to
   stop speaking if it is speaking something.

   The STOP request can be sent with an active-request-id-list header
   field to stop the zero or more specific SPEAK requests that may be in
   queue and return a response code of 200(Success).  If no active-
   request-id-list header field is sent in the STOP request, it will
   terminate all outstanding SPEAK requests.

   If a STOP request successfully terminated one or more PENDING or
   IN-PROGRESS SPEAK requests, then the response message body contains
   an active-request-id-list header field listing the SPEAK request-ids
   that were terminated.  Otherwise, there will be no active-request-
   id-list header field in the response.  No SPEAK-COMPLETE events will
   be sent for these terminated requests.

   If a SPEAK request that was IN-PROGRESS and speaking was stopped, the
   next pending SPEAK request, if any, would become IN-PROGRESS and move
   to the speaking state.

   If a SPEAK request that was IN-PROGRESS and in the paused state was
   stopped, the next pending SPEAK request, if any, would become
   IN-PROGRESS and move to the paused state.

   The BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method is a mechanism for the client to
   communicate a barge-in-able event it detects to the speech resource.

   This event is useful in two scenarios,

   1.  The client has detected some events like DTMF digits or other
       barge-in-able events and wants to communicate that to the
       synthesizer.

   2.  The recognizer resource and the synthesizer resource are in
       different servers.  In which case the client MUST act as a Proxy
       and receive event from the recognition resource, and then send a
       BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method to the synthesizer.  In such cases, the
       BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method would also have a proxy-sync-id header
       field received from the resource generating the original event.

   If a SPEAK request is active with kill-on-barge-in enabled, and the
   BARGE-IN-OCCURRED event is received, the synthesizer should stop
   streaming out audio.  It should also terminate any speech requests
   queued behind the current active one, irrespective of whether they

   have barge-in enabled or not.  If a barge-in-able prompt was playing
   and it was terminated, the response MUST contain the request-ids of
   all SPEAK requests that were terminated in its active-request-id-
   list.  There will be no SPEAK-COMPLETE events generated for these
   requests.

   If the synthesizer and the recognizer are on the same server, they
   could be optimized for a quicker kill-on-barge-in response by having
   them interact directly based on a common RTSP session-id.  In these
   cases, the client MUST still proxy the recognition event through a
   BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method, but the synthesizer resource may have
   already stopped and sent a SPEAK-COMPLETE event with a barge-in
   completion cause code.  If there were no SPEAK requests terminated as
   a result of the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method, the response would still be
   a 200 success, but MUST not contain an active-request-id-list header
   field.

   The CONTROL method from the client to the server tells a synthesizer
   that is speaking to modify what it is speaking on the fly.  This
   method is used to make the synthesizer jump forward or backward in
   what it is being spoken, change speaker rate and speaker parameters,
   etc.  It affects the active or IN-PROGRESS SPEAK request.  Depending
   on the implementation and capability of the synthesizer resource, it
   may allow this operation or one or more of its parameters.

   When a CONTROL to jump forward is issued and the operation goes
   beyond the end of the active SPEAK method's text, the request
   succeeds.  A SPEAK-COMPLETE event follows the response to the CONTROL
   method.  If there are more SPEAK requests in the queue, the
   synthesizer resource will continue to process the next SPEAK method.
   When a CONTROL to jump backwards is issued and the operation jumps to
   the beginning of the speech data of the active SPEAK request, the
   response to the CONTROL request contains the speak-restart header.

   These two behaviors can be used to rewind or fast-forward across
   multiple speech requests, if the client wants to break up a speech
   markup text into multiple SPEAK requests.

   If a SPEAK request was active when the CONTROL method was received,
   the server MUST return an active-request-id-list header with the
   Request-id of the SPEAK request that was active.

   This is an event generated by the synthesizer resource to the client
   when it hits a marker tag in the speech markup it is currently
   processing.  The request-id field in the header matches the SPEAK
   request request-id that initiated the speech.  The request-state
   field should be IN-PROGRESS as the speech is still not complete and
   there is more to be spoken.  The actual speech marker tag hit,
   describing where the synthesizer is in the speech markup, is returned

   The speech recognizer resource is capable of receiving an incoming
   voice stream and providing the client with an interpretation of what
   was spoken in textual form.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.%20%20Recognizer%20State%20Machine"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" name="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Recognizer State Machine</span>

   The recognizer resource is controlled by MRCP requests from the
   client.  Similarly, the resource can respond to these requests or
   generate asynchronous events to the server to indicate certain
   conditions during the processing of the stream.  Hence, the
   recognizer maintains states to correlate MRCP requests from the
   client.  The state transitions are described below.

   When a recognition resource recognizes or matches a spoken phrase
   with some portion of the grammar, it associates a confidence level
   with that conclusion.  The confidence-threshold parameter tells the
   recognizer resource what confidence level should be considered a
   successful match.  This is an integer from 0-100 indicating the
   recognizer's confidence in the recognition.  If the recognizer
   determines that its confidence in all its recognition results is less
   than the confidence threshold, then it MUST return no-match as the
   recognition result.  This header field MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, SET-
   PARAMS, or GET-PARAMS.  The default value for this field is platform
   specific.

   To filter out background noise and not mistake it for speech, the
   recognizer may support a variable level of sound sensitivity.  The
   sensitivity-level parameter allows the client to set this value on
   the recognizer.  This header field MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, SET-
   PARAMS, or GET-PARAMS.  A higher value for this field means higher
   sensitivity.  The default value for this field is platform specific.

   Depending on the implementation and capability of the recognizer
   resource, it may be tunable towards Performance or Accuracy.  Higher
   accuracy may mean more processing and higher CPU utilization, meaning
   less calls per media server and vice versa.  This parameter on the
   resource can be tuned by the speed-vs-accuracy header.  This header
   field MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, SET-PARAMS, or GET-PARAMS.  A higher
   value for this field means higher speed.  The default value for this
   field is platform specific.

   When the recognizer matches an incoming stream with the grammar, it
   may come up with more than one alternative match because of
   confidence levels in certain words or conversation paths.  If this
   header field is not specified, by default, the recognition resource
   will only return the best match above the confidence threshold.  The
   client, by setting this parameter, could ask the recognition resource
   to send it more than 1 alternative.  All alternatives must still be
   above the confidence-threshold.  A value greater than one does not
   guarantee that the recognizer will send the requested number of
   alternatives.  This header field MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, SET-PARAMS,
   or GET-PARAMS.  The minimum value for this field is 1.  The default
   value for this field is 1.

   When recognition is started and there is no speech detected for a
   certain period of time, the recognizer can send a RECOGNITION-
   COMPLETE event to the client and terminate the recognition operation.
   The no-input-timeout header field can set this timeout value.  The
   value is in milliseconds.  This header field MAY occur in RECOGNIZE,

   If the save-waveform header field is set to true, the recognizer MUST

   provide a URI for the client to access it.  This header MUST be
   present in the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event if the save-waveform header
   field was set to true.  The URL value of the header MUST be NULL if
   there was some error condition preventing the server from recording.

   This parameter MAY BE sent as part of the RECOGNIZE request.  A value
   of false tells the recognizer to start recognition, but not to start
   the no-input timer yet.  The recognizer should not start the timers
   until the client sends a RECOGNITION-START-TIMERS request to the
   recognizer.  This is useful in the scenario when the recognizer and
   synthesizer engines are not part of the same session.  Here, when a
   kill-on-barge-in prompt is being played, you want the RECOGNIZE
   request to be simultaneously active so that it can detect and
   implement kill-on-barge-in.  But at the same time, you don't want the
   recognizer to start the no-input timers until the prompt is finished.
   The default value is "true".

   This set of headers allows the client to set Vendor Specific
   parameters.

   This header can be sent in the SET-PARAMS method and is used to set
   vendor-specific parameters on the server.  The vendor-av-pair-name
   can be any vendor-specific field name and conforms to the XML
   vendor-specific attribute naming convention.  The vendor-av-pair-
   value is the value to set the attribute to, and needs to be quoted.

   When asking the server to get the current value of these parameters,
   this header can be sent in the GET-PARAMS method with the list of
   vendor-specific attribute names to get separated by a semicolon.
   This header field MAY occur in SET-PARAMS or GET-PARAMS.

   This header field specifies the length of silence required following
   user speech before the speech recognizer finalizes a result (either
   accepting it or throwing a nomatch event).  The speech-complete-
   timeout value is used when the recognizer currently has a complete
   match of an active grammar, and specifies how long it should wait for
   more input before declaring a match.  By contrast, the incomplete
   timeout is used when the speech is an incomplete match to an active
   grammar.  The value is in milliseconds.

   A long speech-complete-timeout value delays the result completion
   and, therefore, makes the computer's response slow.  A short speech-
   complete-timeout may lead to an utterance being broken up
   inappropriately.  Reasonable complete timeout values are typically in
   the range of 0.3 seconds to 1.0 seconds.  The value for this field
   ranges from 0 to MAXTIMEOUT, where MAXTIMEOUT is platform specific.
   The default value for this field is platform specific.  This header
   field MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, SET-PARAMS, or GET-PARAMS.

   This header field specifies the required length of silence following
   user speech, after which a recognizer finalizes a result.  The
   incomplete timeout applies when the speech prior to the silence is an
   incomplete match of all active grammars.  In this case, once the
   timeout is triggered, the partial result is rejected (with a nomatch
   event).  The value is in milliseconds.  The value for this field
   ranges from 0 to MAXTIMEOUT, where MAXTIMEOUT is platform specific.
   The default value for this field is platform specific.

     speech-incomplete-timeout = "Speech-Incomplete-Timeout" ":"
                                 1*DIGIT CRLF

   The speech-incomplete-timeout also applies when the speech prior to
   the silence is a complete match of an active grammar, but where it is
   possible to speak further and still match the grammar.  By contrast,
   the complete timeout is used when the speech is a complete match to
   an active grammar and no further words can be spoken.

   A long speech-incomplete-timeout value delays the result completion
   and, therefore, makes the computer's response slow.  A short speech-
   incomplete-timeout may lead to an utterance being broken up
   inappropriately.

   The speech-incomplete-timeout is usually longer than the speech-
   complete-timeout to allow users to pause mid-utterance (for example,
   to breathe).  This header field MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, SET-PARAMS,
   or GET-PARAMS.

   A recognizer message may carry additional data associated with the

   recognized in DEFINE-GRAMMAR or RECOGNIZE requests.  When the grammar
   is sent in the DEFINE-GRAMMAR method, the server should be able to
   download compile and optimize the grammar.  The RECOGNIZE request
   MUST contain a list of grammars that need to be active during the
   recognition.  The server resource may send the recognition results in
   the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event or the GET-RESULT response.  This data
   will be carried in the message body of the corresponding MRCP
   message.

   Recognizer grammar data from the client to the server can be provided
   inline or by reference.  Either way, they are carried as MIME
   entities in the message body of the MRCP request message.  The
   grammar specified inline or by reference specifies the grammar used
   to match in the recognition process and this data is specified in one
   of the standard grammar specification formats like W3C's XML or ABNF
   or Sun's Java Speech Grammar Format, etc.  All media servers MUST
   support W3C's XML based grammar markup format [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0"'>11</a>] (MIME-type
   application/grammar+xml) and SHOULD support the ABNF form (MIME-type
   application/grammar).

   When a grammar is specified in-line in the message, the client MUST
   provide a content-id for that grammar as part of the content headers.
   The server MUST store the grammar associated with that content-id for
   the duration of the session.  A stored grammar can be overwritten by
   defining a new grammar with the same content-id.  Grammars that have
   been associated with a content-id can be referenced through a special
   "session:" URI scheme.

   Example:
     session:help@root-level.store

   If grammar data needs to be specified by external URI reference, the
   MIME-type text/uri-list is used to list the one or more URI that will
   specify the grammar data.  All media servers MUST support the HTTP
   URI access mechanism.

   If the data to be defined consists of a mix of URI and inline grammar
   data, the multipart/mixed MIME-type is used and embedded with the
   MIME-blocks for text/uri-list, application/grammar or
   application/grammar+xml.  The character set and encoding used in the
   grammar data may be specified according to standard MIME-type
   definitions.

   When more than one grammar URI or inline grammar block is specified
   in a message body of the RECOGNIZE request, it is an active list of
   grammar alternatives to listen.  The ordering of the list implies the
   precedence of the grammars, with the first grammar in the list having
   the highest precedence.

   Example 1:
       Content-Type:application/grammar+xml
       Content-Id:request1@form-level.store
       Content-Length:104

   Recognition result data from the server is carried in the MRCP
   message body of the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event or the GET-RESULT
   response message as MIME entities.  All media servers MUST support
   W3C's Natural Language Semantics Markup Language (NLSML) [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Natural Language Semantics Markup Language (NLSML) for the Speech Interface Framework"'>10</a>] as the
   default standard for returning recognition results back to the
   client, and hence MUST support the MIME-type application/x-nlsml.

   Example 1:
      Content-Type:application/x-nlsml
      Content-Length:104

      &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

   When the client has to change recognition servers within a call, this
   is a block of data that the client MAY collect from the first media
   server and provide to the second media server.  This may be because
   the client needs different language support or because the media
   server issued an RTSP RE-DIRECT.  Here, the first recognizer may have
   collected acoustic and other data during its recognition.  When we
   switch recognition servers, communicating this data may allow the
   second recognition server to provide better recognition based on the
   acoustic data collected by the previous recognizer.  This block of
   data is vendor-specific and MUST be carried as MIME-type
   application/octets in the body of the message.

   This block of data is communicated in the SET-PARAMS and GET-PARAMS
   method/response messages.  In the GET-PARAMS method, if an empty
   recognizer-context-block header field is present, then the recognizer
   should return its vendor-specific context block in the message body
   as a MIME-entity with a specific content-id.  The content-id value
   should also be specified in the recognizer-context-block header field



<span class="grey">Shanmugham, et al.           Informational                     [Page 55]</span></pre>

   in the GET-PARAMS response.  The SET-PARAMS request wishing to
   provide this vendor-specific data should send it in the message body
   as a MIME-entity with the same content-id that it received from the
   GET-PARAMS.  The content-id should also be sent in the recognizer-
   context-block header field of the SET-PARAMS message.

   Each automatic speech recognition (ASR) vendor choosing to use this
   mechanism to handoff recognizer context data among its servers should
   distinguish its vendor-specific block of data from other vendors by
   choosing a unique content-id that they should recognize.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.6.%20%20SET-PARAMS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.6" name="section-8.6">8.6</a>.  SET-PARAMS</span>

   The SET-PARAMS method, from the client to the server, tells the
   recognizer resource to set and modify recognizer context parameters
   like recognizer characteristics, result detail level, etc.  In the
   following sections some standard parameters are discussed.  If the
   server resource does not recognize an OPTIONAL parameter, it MUST
   ignore that field.  Many of the parameters in the SET-PARAMS method
   can also be used in another method like the RECOGNIZE method.  But
   the difference is that when you set something like the sensitivity-
   level using the SET-PARAMS, it applies for all future requests,
   whenever applicable.  On the other hand, when you pass sensitivity-
   level in a RECOGNIZE request, it applies only to that request.

   Example:
     C-&gt;S:SET-PARAMS 543256 MRCP/1.0
          Sensitivity-Level:20
          Recognition-Timeout:30
          Confidence-Threshold:85

     S-&gt;C:MRCP/1.0 543256 200 COMPLETE

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.7.%20%20GET-PARAMS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.7" name="section-8.7">8.7</a>.  GET-PARAMS</span>

   The GET-PARAMS method, from the client to the server, asks the
   recognizer resource for its current default parameters, like
   sensitivity-level, n-best-list-length, etc.  The client can request
   specific parameters from the server by sending it one or more empty
   parameter headers with no values.  The server should then return the
   settings for those specific parameters only.  When the client does
   not send a specific list of empty parameter headers, the recognizer
   should return the settings for all parameters.  The wild card use can
   be very intensive as the number of settable parameters can be large
   depending on the vendor.  Hence, it is RECOMMENDED that the client
   does not use the wildcard GET-PARAMS operation very often.

   The DEFINE-GRAMMAR method, from the client to the server, provides a
   grammar and tells the server to define, download if needed, and
   compile the grammar.

   If the server resource is in the recognition state, the DEFINE-
   GRAMMAR request MUST respond with a failure status.

   If the resource is in the idle state and is able to successfully load
   and compile the grammar, the status MUST return a success code and
   the request-state MUST be COMPLETE.

   If the recognizer could not define the grammar for some reason, say
   the download failed or the grammar failed to compile, or the grammar
   was in an unsupported form, the MRCP response for the DEFINE-GRAMMAR
   method MUST contain a failure status code of 407, and a completion-
   cause header field describing the failure reason.

   provided by the recognizer.  These parameters override the current
   defaults set by a previous SET-PARAMS method.

   If the resource is in the recognition state, the RECOGNIZE request
   MUST respond with a failure status.

   If the resource is in the Idle state and was able to successfully
   start the recognition, the server MUST return a success code and a
   request-state of IN-PROGRESS.  This means that the recognizer is
   active and that the client should expect further events with this
   request-id.

   If the resource could not start a recognition, it MUST return a
   failure status code of 407 and contain a completion-cause header
   field describing the cause of failure.

   For the recognizer resource, this is the only request that can return
   request-state of IN-PROGRESS, meaning that recognition is in
   progress.  When the recognition completes by matching one of the
   grammar alternatives or by a time-out without a match or for some
   other reason, the recognizer resource MUST send the client a
   RECOGNITON-COMPLETE event with the result of the recognition and a
   request-state of COMPLETE.

   For large grammars that can take a long time to compile and for
   grammars that are used repeatedly, the client could issue a DEFINE-
   GRAMMAR request with the grammar ahead of time.  In such a case, the
   client can issue the RECOGNIZE request and reference the grammar
   through the "session:" special URI.  This also applies in general if
   the client wants to restart recognition with a previous inline
   grammar.

   Note that since the audio and the messages are carried over separate
   communication paths there may be a race condition between the start
   of the flow of audio and the receipt of the RECOGNIZE method.  For
   example, if audio flow is started by the client at the same time as
   the RECOGNIZE method is sent, either the audio or the RECOGNIZE will
   arrive at the recognizer first.  As another example, the client may
   chose to continuously send audio to the Media server and signal the
   Media server to recognize using the RECOGNIZE method.  A number of
   mechanisms exist to resolve this condition and the mechanism chosen
   is left to the implementers of recognizer Media servers.

   The STOP method from the client to the server tells the resource to
   stop recognition if one is active.  If a RECOGNIZE request is active
   and the STOP request successfully terminated it, then the response
   header contains an active-request-id-list header field containing the
   request-id of the RECOGNIZE request that was terminated.  In this
   case, no RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event will be sent for the terminated
   request.  If there was no recognition active, then the response MUST

   The GET-RESULT method from the client to the server can be issued
   when the recognizer is in the recognized state.  This request allows
   the client to retrieve results for a completed recognition.  This is
   useful if the client decides it wants more alternatives or more
   information.  When the media server receives this request, it should
   re-compute and return the results according to the recognition
   constraints provided in the GET-RESULT request.

   The GET-RESULT request could specify constraints like a different
   confidence-threshold, or n-best-list-length.  This feature is
   optional and the automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine may return
   a status of unsupported feature.

   This is an event from the recognizer to the client indicating that it
   has detected speech.  This event is useful in implementing kill-on-
   barge-in scenarios when the synthesizer resource is in a different
   session than the recognizer resource and, hence, is not aware of an
   incoming audio source.  In these cases, it is up to the client to act

   as a proxy and turn around and issue the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method to
   the synthesizer resource.  The recognizer resource also sends a
   unique proxy-sync-id in the header for this event, which is sent to
   the synthesizer in the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method to the synthesizer.

   This event should be generated irrespective of whether the
   synthesizer and recognizer are in the same media server or not.

   This request is sent from the client to the recognition resource when
   it knows that a kill-on-barge-in prompt has finished playing.  This
   is useful in the scenario when the recognition and synthesizer
   engines are not in the same session.  Here, when a kill-on-barge-in
   prompt is being played, you want the RECOGNIZE request to be
   simultaneously active so that it can detect and implement kill-on-
   barge-in.  But at the same time, you don't want the recognizer to
   start the no-input timers until the prompt is finished.  The
   parameter recognizer-start-timers header field in the RECOGNIZE
   request will allow the client to say if the timers should be started
   or not.  The recognizer should not start the timers until the client
   sends a RECOGNITION-START-TIMERS method to the recognizer.

   This is an Event from the recognizer resource to the client
   indicating that the recognition completed.  The recognition result is
   sent in the MRCP body of the message.  The request-state field MUST
   be COMPLETE indicating that this is the last event with that
   request-id, and that the request with that request-id is now
   complete.  The recognizer context still holds the results and the
   audio waveform input of that recognition until the next RECOGNIZE
   request is issued.  A URL to the audio waveform MAY BE returned to
   the client in a waveform-url header field in the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE
   event.  The client can use this URI to retrieve or playback the
   audio.

   Various sections of the recognizer could be distributed into Digital
   Signal Processors (DSPs) on the Voice Browser/Gateway or IP Phones.
   For instance, the gateway might perform voice activity detection to
   reduce network bandwidth and CPU requirement of the automatic speech

   The MRCP protocol may carry sensitive information such as account
   numbers, passwords, etc.  For this reason it is important that the
   client have the option of secure communication with the server for
   both the control messages as well as the media, though the client is
   not required to use it.  If all MRCP communications happens in a
   trusted domain behind a firewall, this may not be necessary.  If the
   client or server is deployed in an insecure network, communication
   happening across this insecure network needs to be protected.  In
   such cases, the following additional security functionality MUST be
   supported on the MRCP server.  MRCP servers MUST implement Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) to secure the RTSP communication, i.e., the RTSP
   stack SHOULD support the rtsps: URI form.  MRCP servers MUST support
   Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) as an option to send and
   receive media.

   The client issues the next MRCP SPEAK method in an ANNOUNCE message,
   asking the user the question.  It is generally RECOMMENDED when
   playing a prompt to the user with kill-on-barge-in and asking for
   input, that the client issue the RECOGNIZE request ahead of the SPEAK
   request for optimum performance and user experience.  This way, it is
   guaranteed that the recognizer is online before the prompt starts
   playing and the user's speech will not be truncated at the beginning
   (especially for power users).

   Since the last SPEAK request had Kill-On-Barge-In set to "true", the
   message synthesizer is interrupted when the user starts speaking, and
   the client is notified.

   Now, since the recognition and synthesizer resources are in the same
   session, they worked with each other to deliver kill-on-barge-in.  If
   the resources were in different sessions, it would have taken a few
   more messages before the client got the SPEAK-COMPLETE event from the

   synthesizer resource.  Whether the synthesizer and recognizer are in
   the same session or not, the recognizer MUST generate the START-OF-
   SPEECH event to the client.

   The client should have then blindly turned around and issued a
   BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method to the synthesizer resource.  The
   synthesizer, if kill-on-barge-in was enabled on the current SPEAK
   request, would have then interrupted it and issued SPEAK-COMPLETE
   event to the client.  In this example, since the synthesizer and
   recognizer are in the same session, the client did not issue the
   BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method to the synthesizer and assumed that kill-
   on-barge-in was implemented between the two resources in the same
   session and worked.

   The completion-cause code differentiates if this is normal completion
   or a kill-on-barge-in interruption.
