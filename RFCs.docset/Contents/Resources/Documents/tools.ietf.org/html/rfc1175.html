1a. Background and Purpose

   On 1 June 1989, several members of the IETF User Services Working
   Group convened an interim working group session at the JVNC
   Supercomputer Center in Princeton, NJ.  The purpose of the meeting
   was to form a distinct working group that would assemble a
   bibliography of useful information about the Internet for end users
   and for those who help end users.  The first official meeting of the
   User Documents Working Group was held at the Stanford IETF in July
   1989.  The goal of the working group was to prepare a bibliography of
   on-line and hard copy documents, reference materials, and multimedia
   training tools that address general networking information and "how
   to use the Internet".  The target audience was beginner level and
   intermediate level end users.

1b. Scope

   This bibliography is the result of volunteer work provided by members
   of the User Documents Working Group.  The intent of this effort is to
   present a representative collection of materials that will help the
   reader become familiar with the concepts of internetworking and will
   form the basis for future study.  This is, quite simply, a good place
   to start.  References to other sources of information within this
   collection of materials will be useful to readers who wish to pursue,
   in greater depth, the issues and complexities of the current
   networking environment.  Please send comments to us-wg@nnsc.nsf.net.

1c. Organization of Document

   This version of the bibliography is divided into 10 distinct
   categories of material, and each category is presented in a separate
   section:

           2  ARTICLES
           3  BIBLIOGRAPHIES
           4  BOOKS
           5  CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS
           6  GLOSSARIES
           7  GUIDES
           8  MULTIMEDIA
           9  NEWSLETTERS
           10 REPORTS AND PAPERS
           11 REQUESTS FOR COMMENTS (RFCs)

   Within each section, material is arranged in alphabetical order by
   author or authoring organization with the exception of <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>:

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1175.html">RFC 1175</a>                   FYI - Bibliography                August 1990</span>


   REQUESTS FOR COMMENTS (RFCs).  The RFCs are ordered numerically.  All
   entries contain fairly standard bibliographic information and provide
   a short abstract with information on how to obtain the particular
   material addressed.

   For brand new network users, unsure of what to read first, we suggest
   reading Ed Krol's, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Internet" (listed
   in the Guide section).  For general information on an introduction to
   Internet protocols, two documents are quite useful: Charles
   Hedrick's, "Introduction to the Internet Protocols", and Doug Comer's
   textbook, "Internetworking with TCP/IP: Principles, Protocols, and
   Architecture".  Two excellent guides to existing networks are Tracy
   L.  LaQuey's, "Users' Directory of Computer Networks" and John S.
   Quarterman's "The Matrix: Computer Networks and Conferencing Systems
   Worldwide".  We strongly encourage the reader to scan the
   bibliography in its entirety as some items may be more applicable to
   personal needs or site requirements.  (Please note that in many
   instances the abstracts are excerpts, provided verbatim, from the
   material described.)

1d. Obtaining Files By Anonymous FTP

   Much of the material referenced in this bibliography is available
   on-line and can be obtained by using the File Transfer Protocol
   (FTP).  Directions on how to obtain on-line files by anonymous FTP
   action follow.  In this example, the host used is nic.ddn.mil.

   Files may be obtained with the FTP program in conjunction with an
   ANONYMOUS login.  Versions of the FTP program may vary from system to
   system, so the commands shown in this example may need to be modified
   to work on your system.

       % ftp nic.ddn.mil  &lt;== Use the FTP program to
                                       connect to nic.ddn.mil
       Connected to nic.ddn.mil
       220 NIC.DDN.MIL FTP Server 5Z(47)-6 at Fri 23-Jun-89 09:38-PDT

   The system should respond with a message to indicate that a
   connection has been made.  Users on a Unix system will probably be
   prompted for a login name.  Type in "anonymous" as in the example
   below:

   Spectrum, vol. 25, no. 2, pa. 54-57, IEEE Spectrum, New York, NY, Feb
   1988.

      This article is written by Gordon Bell, the former Chair of the
      FCCSET subcommittee on computer networking, infrastructure and
      digital communications.  It discusses the merits of a national
      network and the potential of such a network to trigger significant
      advances in computing and communications research.  The most
      viable solution is a national research network organized and
      maintained by the Federal government.  However, the success of
      such a venture is tied to the need for effective leadership in
      communications and a coordinated Federal science and technology
      policy.

   LaQuey, Tracy L., "Networks for Academics," Academic Computing, vol.
   4, no. 3, pp. 32-39, Academic Computing Publications, Inc., McKinney,
   TX, November 1989.

      A variety of computer networks serve academic needs at the
      nation's campuses.  Their thrusts differ significantly, and it is
      not uncommon to find campuses subscribing to multiple networks.
      This article is an overview of the major players.  This November
      1989 issue of Academic Computing also contains other interesting
      articles on networking.

   Markoff, John, "A Supercomputer in Every Pot," New York Times, p. 1,
   New York, NY, December 29, 1988.

      This article discusses the need for a gigabit national network to
      provide researchers with high speed access to remote resources and
      to develop other useful network applications.

   Networks," Communications of the ACM, vol. 29, no. 10, pp. 932-971,
   Association from Computing Machinery, Inc., New York, NY, October
   1986.

      This is a summary of the state of the world of networks as of late
      1986.  Although influential in its time and still of historical
      interest, it has since been superseded by Quarterman's Book, The
      Matrix, published in October 1989.

   Interoperability Report, vol. 3, no. 4, pp. 12-16, Advanced Computing
   Environments, Mountain View, CA, March 1989.

      Learning how to use a computer system properly takes much longer
      than simply learning the mechanics of making it do things.
      Learning to use a system without offending other users and to
      maximum benefit involves etiquette. Learning to use a system
      without causing harm to others involves ethics.  These are not
      completely separable subjects, and the former tends to blend into
      the latter as the seriousness of the situation increases.  This
      article presents a discussion of these subjects, and some
      suggested guidelines for appropriate behavior.

      communicate at the application layer.  The set of such networks
      that are non-commercial, e.g., academic, research, or military, is
      sometimes called Worldnet.  There are also some commercial
      networks and conferencing systems connected, and the metanetwork
      that includes all of these is what is called the Matrix.  This
      article describes some problems associated with electronic mail
      correspondence through the Matrix.

   Vaqueros, (714) 821-8380, September 1983.

      This article emphasizes how approaches to interconnection, network
      access, network services, and protocol functions are related and
      overlap.  Decisions on which approach to undertake are based on
      user requirements and existing specifications.  Applications to
      TCP/IP and the DDN Internet are provided.

   Rose, Marshall T., The Open Book: A Practical Perspective on OSI, 651
   pgs., Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1989.

      This is a comprehensive book about Open Systems Interconnection
      (OSI).  In particular, this book focuses on the pragmatic aspects
      of OSI: what OSI is, how OSI is implemented, and how OSI is
      integrated with existing networks.  In order to provide this
      pragmatic look at OSI the book makes consistent comparisons and
      analogies of the OSI pieces with the TCP/IP suite of networking
      protocols.

   Deutsch, Debra, An Introduction to the X.500 Series Network Directory
   Service, 13 pgs., BBN Systems &amp; Technologies Corporation, Cambridge,
   MA, June 1988.

      This paper introduces the concepts and function of the Directory
      Services specified in the X.500 series and outlines how the CCITT
      and ISO have approached the associated technical issues.  The
      discussion is at a fairly high level, but does assume a knowledge
      of networking concepts.  It begins with an explanation of the
      model and concepts used in the standard; describes the services
      provided and the protocols that implement those services;
      describes some of the kinds of names and objects that the CCITT
      and ISO anticipate will appear in the database; and ends with a
      discussion of some issues that CCITT and ISO are expected to
      address in the near- to mid-future.  Available by sending

   National Computing Initiative, The Agenda for Leadership, 77 pgs.,
   Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, PA,
   February 1987.

      In response to congressional inquiries and urged on by the
      extraordinary opportunities created by rapid developments in
      high-performance computing, the Federal Coordinating Council on
      Science, Engineering and Technology (FCCSET) recommended that
      several federal agencies convene expert panels to assess high-
      performance computing.  In attendance were 45 recognized leaders
      from industry, academe and national laboratories.  In three
      separate sub-panels, they considered the steps necessary to grasp
      the opportunities and face the challenges of the next decade: in
      particular, to maintain U.S.  leadership in computing technology
      and the strengthening of our competitive position vis-a-vis our
      trading partners.  The three sub-panel reports follow an executive
      summary of the workshop.  For copies, contact Society for

<a href="rfc11.html">11</a>.a The Request for Comments Document Series

   The RFCs are working notes of the Internet research and development
   community.  A document in this series may be on essentially any topic
   related to computer communication, and may be anything from a meeting
   report to the specification of a standard.

   Most RFCs are the descriptions of network protocols or services,
   often giving detailed procedures and formats providing the
   information necessary for creating implementations.  Other RFCs
   report on the results of policy studies or summarize the work of
   technical committees or workshops.

   Note: Currently, all standards are published as RFCs, but not all
   RFCs specify standards.

   Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC.  Submissions
   must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor.  The RFC Editor
   is Jon Postel (Postel@ISI.EDU).

   While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive technical
   review from either the task forces, individual technical experts, or
   the RFC Editor, as appropriate.

   RFCs are distributed on-line by being stored as public access files,
   and a short message is sent to the RFC distribution list (RFC-
   REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL) indicating the availability of the memo.

   The on-line files are copied by the interested people and printed or
   displayed at their site on their equipment.  An RFC may also be
   returned via email in response to an email query. RFCs can be
   obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT
   (where "nnnn" refers to the number of the RFC).  Login with FTP,
   username "anonymous", password "guest".

   The DDN Network Information Center (NIC) also provides an automatic
   mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address the
   request to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and in the subject field of the
   message indicate the RFC number, as in "Subject: RFC nnnn".

   RFCs can also be contained via FTP from NIS.NSF.NET.  Using FTP,
   login with username "anonymous", and password "guest"; then connect
   to the RFC directory (cd RFC).  The file name is of the form
   RFCnnnn.TXT-1 (where "nnnn" refers to the number of the RFC).

   The NSFNet Network Information Service (NIS) also provides an

   automatic mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address
   the request to NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET and leave the subject field of
   the message blank.  The first line of the text of the message must be
   "SEND RFCnnnn.TXT-1", where "nnnn" is replaced by the RFC number.
   This means that the format of the online files must meet the
   constraints of a wide variety of printing and display equipment.

   Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC is
   never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is never a
   question of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.
   However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be
   improved and re-documented many times in several different RFCs.  It
   is important to verify that you have the most recent RFC on a
   particular protocol.

   The Internet Activities Board (IAB) published the "IAB Official
   Protocol Standards" (currently <a href="rfc1140.html">RFC-1140</a>), which describes the state
   of standardization of protocols used in the Internet.  This document
   is issued quarterly.  Current copies may be obtained from the DDN
   Network Information Center or from the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority.  Please refer to the latest edition of the "IAB Protocol
   Standards" RFC for current information on the state and status of
   standard Internet protocols.

   The complete set of all RFCs issued is maintained at, and available
   from, the DDN Network Information Center at SRI International.  For
   further information, phone: 1-800-235-3155 (E-mail: NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL).
   Subsets of this master set (shadow copies) are maintained at MERIT
   and CSNET.  Use of the RFC repositories at these sites may be more
   suitable to your network connectivity requirements.  Please note,
   however, that the NIC.DDN.MIL is the central repository and will
   contain the most up-to-date set of RFCs.
