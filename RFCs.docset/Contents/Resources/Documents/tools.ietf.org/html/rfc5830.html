   [<a id="ref-GOST28147-89" name="ref-GOST28147-89">GOST28147-89</a>] is the unified cryptographic transformation algorithm
   for information processing systems of different purposes, defining
   the encryption/decryption rules and the message authentication code
   (MAC) generation rules.

   This cryptographic transformation algorithm is intended for hardware
   or software implementation and corresponds to the cryptographic
   requirements.  It puts no limitations on the encrypted information
   secrecy level.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Applicability</span>

   GOST 28147-89 defines the encryption/decryption model and MAC
   generation for a given message (document) that is meant for
   transmission via insecure public telecommunication channels between
   data processing systems of different purposes.

   GOST 28147-89 is obligatory to use in the Russian Federation in all
   data processing systems providing public services.

   The following terms are used in the standard:

   Running key: a pseudo-random bit sequence generated by a given
   algorithm for encrypting plain texts and decrypting encrypted texts.

   Encryption: the process of transforming plain text to encrypted data
   using a cipher.

   MAC: an information string of fixed length that is generated from
   plain text and a key according to some rule and added to the
   encrypted data for protection against data falsification.

   Key: a defined secret state of some parameters of a cryptographic
   transformation algorithm, that provides a choice of one
   transformation out of all the possible transformations.

   Cryptographic protection: data protection using the data
   cryptographic transformations.

   - a 32-bit adder of bitwise sums modulo 2 (CM2);

   - a 32-bit adder modulo (2^32-1) (CM4);

   - an adder modulo 2 (CM5), with no limitation to its width;

   - a substitution box (K);

   - a register for a cyclic shift of 11 steps to the top digit (R).

   A substitution box (S-box) K consists of eight substitution points
   K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, K6, K7, K8, with 64-bit memory.  A 32-bit vector
   coming to the substitution box is divided into eight successive 4-bit
   vectors, and each of them is transformed into a 4-bit vector by a
   corresponding substitution point.  A substitution point is a table
   consisting of 16 lines, each containing four bits.  The incoming
   vector defines the line address in the table, and the contents of
   that line is the outgoing vector.  Then, these 4-bit outgoing vectors
   are successively combined into a 32-bit vector.

   Remark: the standard doesn't define any S-boxes.  Some of them are
   defined in [<a href="rfc4357.html" title='"Additional Cryptographic Algorithms for Use with GOST 28147-89, GOST R 34.10-94, GOST R 34.10-2001, and GOST R 34.11-94 Algorithms"'>RFC4357</a>].

   When adding and cyclically shifting binary vectors, the registers
   with larger numbers are considered the top digits.

   When writing a key (W1, W2, ..., W256), Wq = 0..1, q = 1..256, in the
   KDS the value:

   - W1 is written into the 1st bit of the register X0;

   - the value W2 is written into the 2nd bit of the register X0 (etc.);

   - the value W32 is written into the 32nd bit of the register X0;

   - the value W33 is written into the 1st bit of the register X1;

   - the value W34 is written into the 2nd bit of the register X1
     (etc.);

   - the value W64 is written into the 32nd bit of the register X1;

   - the value W65 is written into the 1st bit of the register X2
     (etc.);

   - the value W256 is written into the 32nd bit of the register X7.

   When rewriting the information, the value of the p-th bit of one
   register (adder) is written into the p-th bit of another register
   (adder).

   The values of the constants C1 and C2 in the registers N5 and N6 are
   in the Appendix 1.

   The keys defining fillings of KDS and the substitution box K tables
   are secret elements and are provided in accordance with the
   established procedure.

   The filling of the substitution box K is described in GOST 28147-89
   as a long-term key element common for a whole computer network.
   Usually, K is used as a parameter of algorithm, some possible sets of
   K are described in [<a href="rfc4357.html" title='"Additional Cryptographic Algorithms for Use with GOST 28147-89, GOST R 34.10-94, GOST R 34.10-2001, and GOST R 34.11-94 Algorithms"'>RFC4357</a>].

   The cryptographic model contemplates four working modes:

   - data encryption (decryption) in the electronic codebook (ECB) mode,

   - data encryption (decryption) in the counter (CNT) mode,

   - data encryption (decryption) in the cipher feedback (CFB) mode, and

   - the MAC generation mode.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4357" name="ref-RFC4357">RFC4357</a>] also describes the CBC mode of GOST 28147-89, but this mode
   is not a part of the standard.

   The plain text to be encrypted is split into 64-bit blocks.  Input of
   a binary data block Tp = (a1(0), a2(0), ... , a31(0), a32(0), b1(0),
   b2(0), ..., b32(0)) into the registers N1 and N2 is done so that the
   value of a1(0) is put into the first bit of N1, the value of a2(0) is
   put into the second bit of N1, etc., and the value of a32(0) is put
   into the 32nd bit of N1.  The value of b1(0) is put into the first
   bit of N2, the value of b2(0) is put into the 2nd bit of N2, etc.,
   and the value of b32(0) is input into the 32nd bit of N2.

   The result is the state (a32(0), a31(0), ..., a2(0), a1(0)) of the
   register N1 and the state (b32(0), b31(0), ..., b1(0)) of the
   register N2.

   The 256 bits of the key are entered into the KDS.  The contents of
   eight 32-bit registers X0, X1, ..., X7 are:

      X0 = W32, W31, ..., W2, W1

      X1 = W64, W63, ..., W34, W33

      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

      X7 = W256, W255, ..., W226, W225

   The algorithm for enciphering 64-bit blocks of plain text in the
   electronic codebook mode consists of 32 rounds.

   In the first round, the initial value of register N1 is added modulo
   2^32 in the adder CM1 to the contents of the register X0.  Note: the
   value of register N1 is unchanged.

   The result of the addition is transformed in the substitution block
   K, and the resulting vector is put into the register R, where it is
   cyclically shifted by 11 steps towards the top digit.  The result of
   this shift is added bitwise modulo 2 in the adder CM2 to the 32-bit
   contents of the register N2.  The result produced in CM2 is then
   written into N1, and the old contents of N1 are written in N2.  Thus,
   the first round ends.

   The subsequent rounds are similar to the first one:

   - in the second round, the contents of X1 are read from the KDS;

   - in the third round, the contents of X2 are read from the KDS, etc.;

   - in the 8th round, the contents of X7 are read from the KDS.

   - in rounds 9 through 16 and 17 through 24, the contents of the KDS
     are read in the same order:

      X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7.

   - in the last eight rounds from the 25th to the 32nd, the contents of
     the KDS are read backwards:

      X7, X6, X5, X4, X3, X2, X1, X0.

   Thus, during the 32 rounds of encryption, the following order of
   choosing the registers' contents is implemented:

      X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7,

      X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X7, X6, X5, X4, X3, X2, X1, X0

   In the 32nd round, the result in the adder CM2 is written into the
   register N2, and the old contents of register N1 are unchanged.

   After the 32nd round, the contents of the registers N1 and N2 are an
   encrypted data block corresponding to a block of plain text.

   The equations for enciphering in the electronic codebook mode are:

      |a(j) = (a(j-1) [+] X(j-1)(mod 8))*K*R (+) b (j-1)
      |                                                      j = 1..24;
      |b(j) = a(j-1)

      |a(j) = (a(j-1) [+] X(32-j))*K*R (+) b(j-1)
      |                                          j = 25..31; a32 = a31;
      |b(j) = a(j-1)

      b(32) = (a(31) [+] X0)*K*R (+) b(31)                        j=32,

   where:

   a(0) = (a32(0), a31(0), ..., a1(0)) constitutes the initial contents
   of N1 before the first round of encryption;

   b(0) = (b32(0), b31(0), ..., b1(0)) constitutes the initial contents
   of N2 before the first round of encryption;

   a(j) = (a32(j), a31(j), ..., a1(j)) constitutes the contents of N1
   after the j-th round of encryption;

   b(j) = (b32(j), b31(j), ..., b1(j)) constitutes the contents of N2
   after the j-th round of encryption, j = 1..32.

   R is the operation of cyclic shift towards the top digit by 11 steps,
   as follows:

      R(r32, r31, r30, r29, r28, r27, r26, r25, r24, r23, r22, r21,
      r20, ..., r2, r1) =

      r24, r23, r22)

   The 64-bit block of ciphertext Tc is taken out of the registers N1,
   N2 in the following order:

   the first, second, ..., 32nd bit of the register N1, then the first,
   second, ..., 32nd bit of the register N2, i.e.,

      Tc = a1(32), a2(32), ..., a32(32), b1(32), b2(32), ..., b32(32)).

   The same 256-bit key that was used for encryption is loaded into the
   KDS, the encrypted data to be deciphered is divided into 64-bit
   blocks.  The loading of any binary information block

      Tc = (a1(32), a2(32), ..., a32(32), b1(32), b2(32), ..., b32(32))

   into the registers N1 and N2 is done in such a way that:

   - the contents of a1(32) are written into the first bit of N1;

   - the contents of a2(32) are written into the second bit of N1 (and

   - the contents of a32(32) are written into the 32nd bit of N1;

   - the contents of b1(32) are written into the first bit of N2 (and so
     on);

   - and the contents of b32(32) are written into the 32nd bit of N2.

   The decryption procedure uses the same algorithm as the encryption of
   plain text, with one exception: the contents of the registers X0, X1,

      X7,X6,X5,X4,X3,X2,X1,X0, X7,X6,X5,X4,X3,X2,X1,X0.

   The decryption equations are:

   The fillings of the adders N1 and N2 after 32 working rounds are a
   plain text block.

      Tp = (a1(0), a2(0), ... , a32(0), b1(0), b2(0), ..., b32(0))

   corresponding to the encrypted data block:

   - the value of a1(0) of the block Tp corresponds to the contents of

   - the value of a2(0) corresponds to the contents of the second bit of

   The encryption algorithm in the electronic codebook mode of a 64-bit

   256 bits of the key are put into the KDS.  The registers N1 and N2
   accept a 64-bit binary sequence (an initialisation vector) S = (S1,
   S2, ..., S64), that is, the initial filling of these registers for
   subsequent generation of M blocks of the running key.  The
   initialisation vector is put into the registers N1 and N2 so:

   - the value of S1 is written into the first bit of N1;

   - the value of S2 is written into the second bit of N1 (etc.);

   - the value of S32 is written into the 32nd bit of N1;

   - the value of S33 is written into the first bit of N2;

   - the value of S34 is written into the 33th bit of N2 (etc.);

   - the value of S64 is written into the 32nd bit of N2.

   The initial filling of the registers N1 and N2 (the initialisation
   vector S) is encrypted in the electronic codebook mode in accordance
   with the requirements from <a href="#section-5.1">section 5.1</a>.  The result of that
   encryption A(S) = (Y0, Z0) is rewritten into the 32-bit registers N3
   and N4 so as the contents of N1 are written into N3, and the contents
   of N2 are written into N4.

   The filling of the register N4 is added modulo (2^32-1) in the adder
   CM4 to the 32-bit constant C1 from the register N6; the result is
   written into N4.  The filling of the register N3 is added modulo 2^32
   in the adder CM3 with the 32-bit constant C2 from the register N5;
   the result is written into N3.

   The filling of N3 is copied into N1, and the filling of N4 is copied
   into N2, while the fillings of N3 and N4 are kept.

   The filling of N1 and N2 is encrypted in the electronic codebook mode
   according to the requirements of <a href="#section-5.1">section 5.1</a>.  The resulting
   encrypted filling of N1 and N2 is the first 64-bit block of the

      Tp(1) = (t1(1), t2(1), ..., t63(1), t64(1)).

   The result of this addition is a 64-bit block of the encrypted data:

   The value of tau1(1) of the block Tc(1) is the result of the addition
   of modulo 2 in the CM5 the value t1(1) of the block Tp(1) to the
   value of the first bit of N1; the value of tau2(1) of the block Tc(1)
   is the result of addition modulo 2 in the CM5 the value of t2(1) from
   the block Tp(1) to the value of the second bit of N1, etc.; the value
   of tau64(1) of the block Tc(1) is the result of addition modulo 2 in
   the CM5 of the value t64(1) of the block Tp(1) to the value of the
   32nd bit of N2.

   To get the next 64-bit block of the running key Gc(2), the filling of
   N4 is added modulo (2^32-1) in the adder CM4 with the constant C1
   from N6; the filling of N3 is added modulo 2^32 in the adder CM3 with
   the constant C2 from N5.  The new filling of N3 is copied into N1;
   the new filling of N4 is copied into N2; the fillings of N3 and N4
   are kept.

   The filling of N1 and N2 is encrypted in the electronic codebook mode
   according to the requirements of <a href="#section-5.1">section 5.1</a>.  The resulting
   encrypted filling of N1 and N2 is the second 64-bit block of the
   running key Gc(2); this block is bitwise added modulo 2 in the adder
   CM5 with the first 64-bit block of the plain text Tp(2).  The
   remaining running key blocks Gc(3), Gc(4), ..., Gc(M) are generated
   and the plain text blocks Tp(3), Tp(4), ..., Tp(M) are encrypted

   less than 64 bits, then only the corresponding number of bits from
   the last M-th block of the running key is used; remaining bits are
   discarded.

   The initialisation vector S and the blocks of encrypted data Tc(1),

   256 bits of the key that was used for encrypting the data Tp(1),
   Tp(2), ..., Tp(M) are put into the KDS.  The initialisation vector S
   is put into the registers N1 and N2 and, like in the <a href="#section-6.1">section 6.1</a> M
   blocks of the running key, Gc(1), Gc(2), ..., Gc(M) are generated.
   The encrypted data blocks Tc(1), Tc(2), ..., Tc(M) are added bitwise
   modulo 2 in the adder CM5 with the blocks of the running key, and
   this results in the blocks of plain text Tp(1), Tp(2), ..., Tp(M),
   and Tp(M) may contain less than 64 bit.

   The decryption equation is:

      Tp(i) = A (Y[i-1] [+] C2, Z[i-1] [+]' C1) (+) Tc(i)

   The plain text is divided into 64-bit blocks Tp(1), Tp(2), ..., Tp(M)
   and encrypted in the cipher feedback mode by bitwise addition modulo
   2 in the adder CM5 with the running key Gc generated in 64-bit
   blocks, i.e., Gc(i)=(Gc(1), Gc(2), ..., Gc(M)), where M is defined by

   the length of the plain text, Gc(i) is the i-th 64-bit block, i=1,M.
   The number of bits in the block Tp(M) may be less than 64.

   256 bits of the key are put into the KDS.  The 64-bit initialisation
   vector S = (S1, S2, ..., S64) is put into N1 and N2 as described in
   <a href="#section-6.1">section 6.1</a>.

   The initial filling of N1 and N2 is encrypted in the electronic
   codebook mode in accordance with the requirements in <a href="#section-6.1">section 6.1</a>.  If
   resulting encrypted filling N1 and N2 is the first 64-bit block of

   t64(1)).

   The result is a 64-bit block of encrypted data

      Tc(1) = (tau1(1), tau2(1), ..., tau64(1)).

   The block of encrypted data Tc(1) is simultaneously the initial state
   of N1 and N2 for generating the second block of the running key Gc(2)
   and is written on feedback in these registers.  Here:

   - the value of tau1(1) is written into the first bit of N1;

   - the value of tau64(1) is written into the 32nd bit of N2.

   The filling of N1 and N2 is encrypted in the electronic codebook mode
   in accordance with the requirements in the <a href="#section-6.1">section 6.1</a>.  The
   encrypted filling of N1 and N2 makes the second 64-bit block of the
   running key Gc(2), this block is added bitwise modulo 2 in the adder
   CM5 to the second block of the plain text Tp(2).

   The generation of subsequent blocks of the running key Gc(i) and the
   encryption of the corresponding blocks of the plain text Tp(i) (i =
   3..M) are performed similarly.  If the length of the last M-th block
   of the plain text is less than 64 bits, only the corresponding number
   of bits of the M-th block of the running key Gc(M) is used; remaining
   bits are discarded.

   The encryption equations in the cipher feedback mode are:

      |Tc(1) = A(S) (+) Tp(1) = Gc(1) (+) Tp(1)
      |
      |Tc(i) = A(Tc(i-1)) (+) Tp(i) = Gc(i) + Tp(i), i = 2..M.

   The initialisation vector S and the blocks of encrypted data Tc(1),

   or to the computer memory.

   The block of encrypted data Tc(1) makes the initial filling of N1, N2
   for generating the second block of the running key Gc(2).  The block
   Tc(1) is written in N1 and N2 in accordance with the requirements in

   2 in the adder CM5 to the second block of the encrypted data Tc(2).
   This results in the block of plain text Tc(2).

   Similarly, the blocks of encrypted data Tc(2), Tc(3), ..., Tc(M-1)
   are written in N1, N2 successively, and the blocks of the running key
   Gc(3), Gc(4), ..., Gc(M) are generated out of them in the electronic
   codebook mode.  The blocks of the running key are added bitwise
   modulo 2 in the adder CM5 to the blocks of the encrypted data Tc(3),
   Tc(4), ..., Tc(M), this results in the blocks of plain text Tp(3),
   Tp(4), ..., Tp(M); here, the number of bits in the last block of the
   plain text Tp(M) can be less than 64 bit.

   The decryption equations in the cipher feedback mode are:

   To provide the protection from falsification of plain text consisting

   The filling of N1 and N2 is transformed in accordance with the first
   16 rounds of the encryption algorithm in the electronic codebook mode
   (see the sub<a href="#section-6.1">section 6.1</a>).  In the KDS, there exists the same key that

   The MAC I(l) (I'(l)) can be generated either before encryption (after
   decryption, respectively) of the whole message or simultaneously with
   the encryption (decryption) in blocks.  The first plain text blocks,
   used in the MAC generation, can contain service information (the
   address section, a time mark, the initialisation vector, etc.)  and
   they may be unencrypted.

   The parameter l value (the bit length of the MAC) is defined by the
   actual cryptographic requirements, while considering that the
   possibility of imposing false data is 2^-l.
