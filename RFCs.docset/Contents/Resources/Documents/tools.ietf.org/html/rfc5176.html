Abstract

   This document describes a currently deployed extension to the Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol, allowing
   dynamic changes to a user session, as implemented by network access
   server products.  This includes support for disconnecting users and
   changing authorizations applicable to a user session.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The RADIUS protocol, defined in [<a href="rfc2865.html" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>], does not support
   unsolicited messages sent from the RADIUS server to the Network
   Access Server (NAS).

   However, there are many instances in which it is desirable for
   changes to be made to session characteristics, without requiring the
   NAS to initiate the exchange.  For example, it may be desirable for
   administrators to be able to terminate user session(s) in progress.
   Alternatively, if the user changes authorization level, this may
   require that authorization attributes be added/deleted from user
   session(s).

   To overcome these limitations, several vendors have implemented
   additional RADIUS commands in order to enable unsolicited messages to
   be sent to the NAS.  These extended commands provide support for
   Disconnect and Change-of-Authorization (CoA) packets.  Disconnect

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5176.html">RFC 5176</a>       Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS   January 2008</span>


   packets cause user session(s) to be terminated immediately, whereas
   CoA packets modify session authorization attributes such as data
   filters.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Applicability</span>

   This protocol is being recommended for publication as an
   Informational RFC rather than as a standards-track RFC because of
   problems that cannot be fixed without creating incompatibilities with
   deployed implementations.  This includes security vulnerabilities, as
   well as semantic ambiguities resulting from the design of the
   Change-of-Authorization (CoA) commands.  While fixes are recommended,
   they cannot be made mandatory since this would be incompatible with
   existing implementations.

   Existing implementations of this protocol do not support
   authorization checks, so that an ISP sharing a NAS with another ISP
   could disconnect or change authorizations for another ISP's users.
   In order to remedy this problem, a "Reverse Path Forwarding" check is
   described; see <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> for details.

   Existing implementations utilize per-packet authentication and
   integrity protection algorithms with known weaknesses [<a href="#ref-MD5Attack" title='"The Status of MD5 After a Recent Attack"'>MD5Attack</a>].
   To provide stronger per-packet authentication and integrity
   protection, the use of IPsec is recommended.  See <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a> for
   details.

   Existing implementations lack replay protection.  In order to support
   replay detection, it is recommended that an Event-Timestamp Attribute
   be added to all packets in situations where IPsec replay protection
   is not employed.  See <a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a> for details.

   The approach taken with CoA commands in existing implementations
   results in a semantic ambiguity.  Existing implementations of the
   CoA-Request identify the affected session, as well as supply the
   authorization changes.  Since RADIUS Attributes included within
   existing implementations of the CoA-Request can be used for session
   identification or authorization change, it may not be clear which
   function a given attribute is serving.

   The problem does not exist within the Diameter protocol [<a href="rfc3588.html" title='"Diameter Base Protocol"'>RFC3588</a>], in
   which server-initiated authorization change is initiated using a
   Re-Auth-Request (RAR) command identifying the session via User-Name
   and Session-Id Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs) and containing a
   Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP with value "AUTHORIZE_ONLY".  This results
   in initiation of a standard Request/Response sequence where
   authorization changes are supplied.  As a result, in no command can
   Diameter AVPs have multiple potential meanings.

        Disconnect-Requests.  While it is possible that the DAC is
        co-resident with a RADIUS authentication or accounting server,
        this need not necessarily be the case.

   Dynamic Authorization Server (DAS)
        The entity receiving CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request packets.
        The DAS may be a NAS or a RADIUS proxy.

   Network Access Server (NAS)
        The device providing access to the network.

   service
        The NAS provides a service to the user, such as IEEE 802 or
        Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).

   session
        Each service provided by the NAS to a user constitutes a
        session, with the beginning of the session defined as the point
        where service is first provided and the end of the session
        defined as the point where service is ended.  A user may have
        multiple sessions in parallel or series if the NAS supports
        that.

   silently discard
        This means the implementation discards the packet without
        further processing.  The implementation SHOULD provide the
        capability of logging the error, including the contents of the
        silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event in a
        statistics counter.

   A Disconnect-Request packet is sent by the Dynamic Authorization
   Client in order to terminate user session(s) on a NAS and discard all
   associated session context.  The Disconnect-Request packet is sent to
   UDP port 3799, and identifies the NAS as well as the user session(s)
   to be terminated by inclusion of the identification attributes
   described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   The NAS responds to a Disconnect-Request packet sent by a Dynamic
   Authorization Client with a Disconnect-ACK if all associated session
   context is discarded and the user session(s) are no longer connected,
   or a Disconnect-NAK, if the NAS was unable to disconnect one or more
   sessions and discard all associated session context.  A Disconnect-
   ACK MAY contain the Acct-Terminate-Cause (49) Attribute [<a href="rfc2866.html" title='"RADIUS Accounting"'>RFC2866</a>]
   with the value set to 6 for Admin-Reset.

   CoA-Request packets contain information for dynamically changing
   session authorizations.  Typically, this is used to change data
   filters.  The data filters can be of either the ingress or egress
   kind, and are sent in addition to the identification attributes as
   described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  The port used and packet format (described
   in <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>) are the same as those for Disconnect-Request packets.

   The following attributes MAY be sent in a CoA-Request:

   Filter-ID (11) -        Indicates the name of a data filter list
                           to be applied for the session(s) that the
                           identification attributes map to.

   NAS-Filter-Rule (92) -  Provides a filter list to be applied for
                           the session(s) that the identification
                           attributes map to [<a href="rfc4849.html" title='"RADIUS Filter Rule Attribute"'>RFC4849</a>].

   The NAS responds to a CoA-Request sent by a Dynamic Authorization
   Client with a CoA-ACK if the NAS is able to successfully change the
   authorizations for the user session(s), or a CoA-NAK if the CoA-
   Request is unsuccessful.  A NAS MUST respond to a CoA-Request
   including a Service-Type Attribute with an unsupported value with a
   CoA-NAK; an Error-Cause Attribute with value "Unsupported Service"
   SHOULD be included.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.%20%20Packet%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Packet Format</span>

   For either Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request packets UDP port 3799 is
   used as the destination port.  For responses, the source and
   destination ports are reversed.  Exactly one RADIUS packet is
   encapsulated in the UDP Data field.

   A summary of the data format is shown below.  The fields are
   transmitted from left to right.

   The packet format consists of the following fields: Code, Identifier,
   Length, Authenticator, and Attributes in Type-Length-Value (TLV)
   format.  All fields hold the same meaning as those described in
   RADIUS [<a href="rfc2865.html" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>].  The Authenticator field MUST be calculated in the
   same way as is specified for an Accounting-Request in [<a href="rfc2866.html" title='"RADIUS Accounting"'>RFC2866</a>].

   Code

      The Code field is one octet, and identifies the type of RADIUS
      packet.  Packets received with an invalid Code field MUST be
      silently discarded.  RADIUS codes (decimal) for this extension are
      assigned as follows:

      40 - Disconnect-Request [<a href="rfc3575.html" title='"IANA Considerations for RADIUS"'>RFC3575</a>]
      41 - Disconnect-ACK [<a href="rfc3575.html" title='"IANA Considerations for RADIUS"'>RFC3575</a>]
      42 - Disconnect-NAK [<a href="rfc3575.html" title='"IANA Considerations for RADIUS"'>RFC3575</a>]
      43 - CoA-Request [<a href="rfc3575.html" title='"IANA Considerations for RADIUS"'>RFC3575</a>]
      44 - CoA-ACK [<a href="rfc3575.html" title='"IANA Considerations for RADIUS"'>RFC3575</a>]
      45 - CoA-NAK [<a href="rfc3575.html" title='"IANA Considerations for RADIUS"'>RFC3575</a>]

   Identifier

      The Identifier field is one octet, and aids in matching requests
      and replies.  A Dynamic Authorization Server implementing this
      specification MUST be capable of detecting a duplicate request if
      it has the same source IP address, source UDP port, and Identifier
      within a short span of time.

      The responsibility for retransmission of Disconnect-Request and
      CoA-Request packets lies with the Dynamic Authorization Client.
      If after sending these packets, the Dynamic Authorization Client
      does not receive a response, it will retransmit.

      The Identifier field MUST be changed whenever the content of the
      Attributes field changes, or whenever a valid reply has been
      received for a previous request.  For retransmissions where the
      contents are identical, the Identifier MUST remain unchanged.

      If the Dynamic Authorization Client is retransmitting a
      Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request to the same Dynamic
      Authorization Server as before, and the attributes haven't
      changed, the same Request Authenticator, Identifier, and source
      port MUST be used.  If any attributes have changed, a new
      Authenticator and Identifier MUST be used.

      If the Request to a primary Dynamic Authorization Server fails, a
      secondary Dynamic Authorization Server must be queried, if
      available; issues relating to failover algorithms are described in
      [<a href="rfc3539.html" title='"Authentication, Authorization and Accounting Transport Profile"'>RFC3539</a>].  Since this represents a new request, a new Request
      Authenticator and Identifier MUST be used.  However, where the
      Dynamic Authorization Client is sending directly to the NAS,
      failover typically does not make sense, since CoA-Request or
      Disconnect-Request packets need to be delivered to the NAS where
      the session resides.

   Length

      The Length field is two octets.  It indicates the length of the
      packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Authenticator, and
      Attribute fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length field
      MUST be treated as padding and ignored on reception.  If the
      packet is shorter than the Length field indicates, it MUST be
      silently discarded.  The minimum length is 20 and maximum length
      is 4096.

   Authenticator

      The Authenticator field is sixteen (16) octets.  The most
      significant octet is transmitted first.  This value is used to
      authenticate packets between the Dynamic Authorization Client and
      the Dynamic Authorization Server.

      Request Authenticator

         In Request packets, the Authenticator value is a 16-octet MD5
         [<a href="rfc1321.html" title='"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>RFC1321</a>] checksum, called the Request Authenticator.  The
         Request Authenticator is calculated the same way as for an
         Accounting-Request, specified in [<a href="rfc2866.html" title='"RADIUS Accounting"'>RFC2866</a>].

         Note that the Request Authenticator of a CoA-Request or
         Disconnect-Request cannot be computed the same way as the
         Request Authenticator of a RADIUS Access-Request, because there
         is no User-Password Attribute in a CoA-Request or Disconnect-
         Request.

      Response Authenticator

         The Authenticator field in a Response packet (e.g.,
         Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK, CoA-ACK, or CoA-NAK) is called
         the Response Authenticator, and contains a one-way MD5 hash
         calculated over a stream of octets consisting of the Code,
         Identifier, Length, the Request Authenticator field from the
         packet being replied to, and the response attributes if any,
         followed by the shared secret.  The resulting 16-octet MD5 hash
         value is stored in the Authenticator field of the Response
         packet.

      Administrative note: As noted in <a href="rfc2865.html#section-3">[RFC2865], Section 3</a>, the secret
      (password shared between the Dynamic Authorization Client and the
      Dynamic Authorization Server) SHOULD be at least as large and
      unguessable as a well-chosen password.  The Dynamic Authorization

      Server MUST use the source IP address of the RADIUS UDP packet to
      decide which shared secret to use, so that requests can be
      proxied.

   Attributes

      In CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request packets, all attributes MUST
      be treated as mandatory.  If one or more authorization changes
      specified in a CoA-Request cannot be carried out, the NAS MUST
      send a CoA-NAK.  A NAS MUST respond to a CoA-Request containing
      one or more unsupported attributes or Attribute values with a
      CoA-NAK; an Error-Cause Attribute with value 401 (Unsupported
      Attribute) or 407 (Invalid Attribute Value) MAY be included.  A
      NAS MUST respond to a Disconnect-Request containing one or more
      unsupported attributes or Attribute values with a Disconnect-NAK;
      an Error-Cause Attribute with value 401 (Unsupported Attribute) or
      407 (Invalid Attribute Value) MAY be included.

      State changes resulting from a CoA-Request MUST be atomic: if the
      CoA-Request is successful for all matching sessions, the NAS MUST
      send a CoA-ACK in reply, and all requested authorization changes
      MUST be made.  If the CoA-Request is unsuccessful for any matching
      sessions, the NAS MUST send a CoA-NAK in reply, and the requested
      authorization changes MUST NOT be made for any of the matching
      sessions.  Similarly, a state change MUST NOT occur as a result of
      a Disconnect-Request that is unsuccessful with respect to any of
      the matching sessions; a NAS MUST send a Disconnect-NAK in reply
      if any of the matching sessions cannot be successfully terminated.
      A NAS that does not support dynamic authorization changes applying
      to multiple sessions MUST send a CoA-NAK or Disconnect-NAK in
      reply; an Error-Cause Attribute with value 508 (Multiple Session
      Selection Unsupported) SHOULD be included.

      Within this specification, attributes can be used for
      identification, authorization, or other purposes.  RADIUS
      Attribute specifications created after publication of this
      document SHOULD state whether an attribute can be included in CoA
      or Disconnect messages, and if so, which messages it can be
      included in and whether it serves as an identification or
      authorization attribute.

      Even if a NAS implements an attribute for use with RADIUS
      authentication and accounting, it is possible that it will not
      support inclusion of that attribute within CoA-Request and
      Disconnect-Request packets, given the difference in attribute
      semantics.  This is true even for attributes specified as

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Attributes</span>

   In Disconnect-Request and CoA-Request packets, certain attributes are
   used to uniquely identify the NAS as well as user session(s) on the
   NAS.  The combination of NAS and session identification attributes
   included in a CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request packet MUST match at
   least one session in order for a Request to be successful; otherwise
   a Disconnect-NAK or CoA-NAK MUST be sent.  If all NAS identification
   attributes match, and more than one session matches all of the
   session identification attributes, then a CoA-Request or Disconnect-
   Request MUST apply to all matching sessions.

   Identification attributes include NAS and session identification
   attributes, as described below.

     Identity                              or more sessions.  Needed
                                           where a privacy Network
                                           Access Identifier (NAI) is
                                           used, since in this case the

                                           with Framed-Interface-Id.

   To address security concerns described in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>, either the
   User-Name or Chargeable-User-Identity attribute SHOULD be present in
   Disconnect-Request and CoA-Request packets.

   Where a Diameter client utilizes the same Session-Id for both
   authorization and accounting, inclusion of an Acct-Session-Id
   Attribute in a Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request can assist with
   Diameter/RADIUS translation, since Diameter RAR and ASR commands
   include a Session-Id AVP.  An Acct-Session-Id Attribute SHOULD be
   included in Disconnect-Request and CoA-Request packets.

   A NAS implementing this specification SHOULD send an Acct-Session-Id
   or Acct-Multi-Session-Id Attribute within an Access-Request.  Where
   an Acct-Session-Id or Acct-Multi-Session-Id Attribute is not included
   within an Access-Request, the Dynamic Authorization Client will not
   know the Acct-Session-Id or Acct-Multi-Session-Id of the session it
   is attempting to target, unless it also has access to the accounting
   data for that session.

   Where an Acct-Session-Id or Acct-Multi-Session-Id Attribute is not
   present in a CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request, it is possible that
   the User-Name or Chargeable-User-Identity attributes will not be
   sufficient to uniquely identify a single session (e.g., if the same
   user has multiple sessions on the NAS, or if the privacy NAI is
   used).  In this case, if it is desired to identify a single session,
   session identification MAY be performed by using one or more of the
   Framed-IP-Address, Framed-IPv6-Prefix/Framed-Interface-Id, Called-
   Station-Id, Calling-Station-Id, NAS-Port, and NAS-Port-Id attributes.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5176.html">RFC 5176</a>       Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS   January 2008</span>


   To assist RADIUS proxies in routing Request packets to their
   destination, one or more of the NAS-IP-Address or NAS-IPv6-Address
   attributes SHOULD be present in CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request
   packets; the NAS-Identifier Attribute MAY be present.  Impersonation
   issues with NAS Identification attributes are discussed in <a href="rfc3579.html#section-4.3.7">[RFC3579],
   Section 4.3.7</a>.

   A Disconnect-Request MUST contain only NAS and session identification
   attributes.  If other attributes are included in a Disconnect-
   Request, implementations MUST send a Disconnect-NAK; an Error-Cause
   Attribute with value "Unsupported Attribute" MAY be included.

   The DAC may require access to data from RADIUS authentication or
   accounting packets.  It uses this data to compose compliant CoA-
   Request or Disconnect-Request packets.  For example, as described in
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>, a CoA-Request packet containing a Service-Type Attribute
   with a value of "Authorize Only" is required to contain a State
   Attribute.  The NAS will subsequently transmit this attribute to the
   RADIUS server in an Access-Request.  In order for the DAC to include
   a State Attribute that the RADIUS server will subsequently accept,
   some coordination between the two parties may be required.

   This coordination can be achieved in multiple ways.  The DAC may be
   co-located with a RADIUS server, in which case it is presumed to have
   access to the necessary data.  The RADIUS server may also store that
   information in a common database.  The DAC can then be separated from
   the RADIUS server, so long as it has access to that common database.

   Where the DAC is not co-located with a RADIUS server, and does not
   have access to a common database, the DAC SHOULD send CoA-Request or
   Disconnect-Request packets to a RADIUS server acting as a proxy,
   rather than sending them directly to the NAS.

   A RADIUS server receiving a CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request packet
   from the DAC MAY then add or update attributes (such as adding NAS or
   session identification attributes or appending a State Attribute),
   prior to forwarding the packet.  Having CoA/Disconnect-Requests
   forwarded by a RADIUS server can also enable upstream RADIUS proxies
   to perform a Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check (see <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Proxy%20State"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Proxy State</span>

   If there are any Proxy-State attributes in a Disconnect-Request or
   CoA-Request received from the Dynamic Authorization Client, the
   Dynamic Authorization Server MUST include those Proxy-State
   attributes in its response to the Dynamic Authorization Client.





<span class="grey">Chiba, et al.                Informational                     [Page 12]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5176.html">RFC 5176</a>       Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS   January 2008</span>


   A forwarding proxy or NAS MUST NOT modify existing Proxy-State,
   State, or Class attributes present in the packet.  The forwarding
   proxy or NAS MUST treat any Proxy-State attributes already in the
   packet as opaque data.  Its operation MUST NOT depend on the content
   of Proxy-State attributes added by previous proxies.  The forwarding
   proxy MUST NOT modify any other Proxy-State attributes that were in
   the packet; it may choose not to forward them, but it MUST NOT change
   their contents.  If the forwarding proxy omits the Proxy-State
   attributes in the request, it MUST attach them to the response before
   sending it.

   When the proxy forwards a Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request, it MAY
   add a Proxy-State Attribute, but it MUST NOT add more than one.  If a
   Proxy-State Attribute is added to a packet when forwarding the
   packet, the Proxy-State Attribute MUST be added after any existing
   Proxy-State attributes.  The forwarding proxy MUST NOT change the
   order of any attributes of the same type, including Proxy-State.
   Other attributes can be placed before, after, or even between the
   Proxy-State attributes.

   When the proxy receives a response to a CoA-Request or Disconnect-
   Request, it MUST remove its own Proxy-State Attribute (the last
   Proxy-State in the packet) before forwarding the response.  Since
   Disconnect and CoA responses are authenticated on the entire packet
   contents, the stripping of the Proxy-State Attribute invalidates the
   integrity check, so the proxy MUST recompute it.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Authorize%20Only"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Authorize Only</span>

   To simplify translation between RADIUS and Diameter, Dynamic
   Authorization Clients can include a Service-Type Attribute with value
   "Authorize Only" within a CoA-Request; see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for details on
   Diameter considerations.  Support for a CoA-Request including a
   Service-Type Attribute with value "Authorize Only" is OPTIONAL on the
   NAS and Dynamic Authorization Client.  A Service-Type Attribute MUST
   NOT be included within a Disconnect-Request.

   A NAS MUST respond to a CoA-Request including a Service-Type
   Attribute with value "Authorize Only" with a CoA-NAK; a CoA-ACK MUST
   NOT be sent.  If the NAS does not support a Service-Type value of
   "Authorize Only", then it MUST respond with a CoA-NAK; an Error-Cause
   Attribute with a value of 405 (Unsupported Service) SHOULD be
   included.

   A CoA-Request containing a Service-Type Attribute with value
   "Authorize Only" MUST in addition contain only NAS or session
   identification attributes, as well as a State Attribute.  If other

   attributes are included in such a CoA-Request, a CoA-NAK MUST be
   sent; an Error-Cause Attribute with value 401 (Unsupported Attribute)
   SHOULD be included.

   If a CoA-Request packet including a Service-Type value of "Authorize
   Only" is successfully processed, the NAS MUST respond with a CoA-NAK
   containing a Service-Type Attribute with value "Authorize Only", and
   an Error-Cause Attribute with value 507 (Request Initiated).  The NAS
   then MUST send an Access-Request to the RADIUS server including a
   Service-Type Attribute with value "Authorize Only", along with a
   State Attribute.  This Access-Request SHOULD contain the NAS
   identification attributes from the CoA-Request, as well as the
   session identification attributes from the CoA-Request permitted in
   an Access-Request; it also MAY contain other attributes permitted in
   an Access-Request.

   As noted in <a href="rfc2869.html#section-5.19">[RFC2869], Section 5.19</a>, a Message-Authenticator
   attribute SHOULD be included in an Access-Request that does not
   contain a User-Password, CHAP-Password, ARAP-Password, or EAP-Message
   Attribute.  The RADIUS server then will respond to the Access-Request
   with an Access-Accept to (re-)authorize the session or an Access-
   Reject to refuse to (re-)authorize it.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20State"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  State</span>

   The State Attribute is available to be sent by the Dynamic
   Authorization Client to the NAS in a CoA-Request packet and MUST be
   sent unmodified from the NAS to the Dynamic Authorization Client in a
   subsequent ACK or NAK packet.

   <a href="rfc2865.html#section-5.44">[RFC2865], Section 5.44</a> states:

      An Access-Request MUST contain either a User-Password or a
      CHAP-Password or State.  An Access-Request MUST NOT contain both a
      User-Password and a CHAP-Password.  If future extensions allow
      other kinds of authentication information to be conveyed, the
      attribute for that can be used in an Access-Request instead of
      User-Password or CHAP-Password.

   In order to satisfy the requirements of <a href="rfc2865.html#section-5.44">[RFC2865], Section 5.44</a>, an
   Access-Request with Service-Type Attribute with value "Authorize
   Only" MUST contain a State Attribute.

   In order to provide a State Attribute to the NAS, a Dynamic
   Authorization Client sending a CoA-Request with a Service-Type
   Attribute with a value of "Authorize Only" MUST include a State
   Attribute, and the NAS MUST send the State Attribute unmodified to
   the RADIUS server in the resulting Access-Request, if any.  A NAS

   receiving a CoA-Request containing a Service-Type Attribute with a
   value of "Authorize Only" but lacking a State Attribute MUST send a
   CoA-NAK and SHOULD include an Error-Cause Attribute with a value of
   402 (Missing Attribute).

   The State Attribute is also available to be sent by the Dynamic
   Authorization Client to the NAS in a CoA-Request that also includes a
   Termination-Action Attribute with the value of RADIUS-Request.  If
   the NAS performs the Termination-Action by sending a new Access-
   Request upon termination of the current session, it MUST include the
   State Attribute unchanged in that Access-Request.  In either usage,
   the Dynamic Authorization Server MUST NOT interpret the Attribute
   locally.  A CoA-Request packet MUST have only zero or one State
   Attribute.  Usage of the State Attribute is implementation dependent.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.4.%20%20Message-Authenticator"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" name="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Message-Authenticator</span>

   The Message-Authenticator Attribute MAY be used to authenticate and
   integrity-protect CoA-Request, CoA-ACK, CoA-NAK, Disconnect-Request,
   Disconnect-ACK, and Disconnect-NAK packets in order to prevent
   spoofing.

   A Dynamic Authorization Server receiving a CoA-Request or
   Disconnect-Request with a Message-Authenticator Attribute present
   MUST calculate the correct value of the Message-Authenticator and
   silently discard the packet if it does not match the value sent.  A
   Dynamic Authorization Client receiving a CoA/Disconnect-ACK or
   CoA/Disconnect-NAK with a Message-Authenticator Attribute present
   MUST calculate the correct value of the Message-Authenticator and
   silently discard the packet if it does not match the value sent.

   When a Message-Authenticator Attribute is included within a CoA-
   Request or Disconnect-Request, it is calculated as follows:

      Message-Authenticator = HMAC-MD5 (Type, Identifier, Length,
      Request Authenticator, Attributes)

      When the HMAC-MD5 message integrity check is calculated the
      Request Authenticator field and Message-Authenticator Attribute
      MUST each be considered to be sixteen octets of zero.  The
      Message-Authenticator Attribute is calculated and inserted in the
      packet before the Request Authenticator is calculated.

      When the HMAC-MD5 message integrity check is calculated, the

   Description

      It is possible that a Dynamic Authorization Server cannot honor
      Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request packets for some reason.  The
      Error-Cause Attribute provides more detail on the cause of the

      "Residual Session Context Removed" is sent in response to a
      Disconnect-Request if one or more user sessions are no longer
      active, but residual session context was found and successfully
      removed.  This value is only sent within a Disconnect-ACK and MUST
      NOT be sent within a CoA-ACK, Disconnect-NAK, or CoA-NAK.

      "Invalid EAP Packet (Ignored)" is a non-fatal error that MUST NOT
      be sent by implementations of this specification.

      "Unsupported Attribute" is a fatal error sent if a Request
      contains an attribute (such as a Vendor-Specific or EAP-Message
      Attribute) that is not supported.

      "Missing Attribute" is a fatal error sent if critical attributes
      (such as NAS or session identification attributes) are missing
      from a Request.

      "NAS Identification Mismatch" is a fatal error sent if one or more
      NAS identification attributes (see <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) do not match the
      identity of the NAS receiving the Request.

      "Invalid Request" is a fatal error sent if some other aspect of
      the Request is invalid, such as if one or more attributes (such as
      EAP-Message Attribute(s)) are not formatted properly.

      "Unsupported Service" is a fatal error sent if a Service-Type
      Attribute included with the Request is sent with an invalid or
      unsupported value.  This error cannot be sent in response to a
      Disconnect-Request.

      "Unsupported Extension" is a fatal error sent due to lack of
      support for an extension such as Disconnect and/or CoA packets.
      This will typically be sent by a proxy receiving an ICMP port
      unreachable message after attempting to forward a CoA-Request or
      Disconnect-Request to the NAS.

      "Invalid Attribute Value" is a fatal error sent if a CoA-Request
      or Disconnect-Request contains an attribute with an unsupported
      value.

      "Administratively Prohibited" is a fatal error sent if the NAS is
      configured to prohibit honoring of CoA-Request or Disconnect-
      Request packets for the specified session.

      "Request Not Routable" is a fatal error that MAY be sent by a
      proxy and MUST NOT be sent by a NAS.  It indicates that the proxy
      was unable to determine how to route a CoA-Request or Disconnect-
      Request to the NAS.  For example, this can occur if the required
      entries are not present in the proxy's realm routing table.

      "Session Context Not Found" is a fatal error sent if the session
      context identified in the CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request does
      not exist on the NAS.

      "Session Context Not Removable" is a fatal error sent in response
      to a Disconnect-Request if the NAS was able to locate the session
      context, but could not remove it for some reason.  It MUST NOT be
      sent within a CoA-ACK, CoA-NAK, or Disconnect-ACK, only within a
      Disconnect-NAK.

      "Other Proxy Processing Error" is a fatal error sent in response
      to a CoA or Disconnect-Request that could not be processed by a
      proxy, for reasons other than routing.

      "Resources Unavailable" is a fatal error sent when a CoA or
      Disconnect-Request could not be honored due to lack of available
      NAS resources (memory, non-volatile storage, etc.).

      "Request Initiated" is a fatal error sent by a NAS in response to
      a CoA-Request including a Service-Type Attribute with a value of
      "Authorize Only".  It indicates that the CoA-Request has not been
      honored, but that the NAS is sending one or more RADIUS Access-
      Requests including a Service-Type Attribute with value "Authorize
      Only" to the RADIUS server.

      "Multiple Session Selection Unsupported" is a fatal error sent by
      a NAS in response to a CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request whose
      session identification attributes match multiple sessions, where
      the NAS does not support Requests applying to multiple sessions.

   (Note 1) Where NAS or session identification attributes are included
   in Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request packets, they are used for
   identification purposes only.  These attributes MUST NOT be used for
   purposes other than identification (e.g., within CoA-Request packets
   to request authorization changes).

   (Note 2) The Reply-Message Attribute is used to present a displayable
   message to the user.  The message is only displayed as a result of a
   successful Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request (where a Disconnect-ACK
   or CoA-ACK is subsequently sent).  Where Extension Authentication
   Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication, an EAP-
   Message/Notification-Request Attribute is sent instead, and
   Disconnect-ACK or CoA-ACK packets contain an EAP-
   Message/Notification-Response Attribute.

   (Note 3) When included within a CoA-Request, these attributes
   represent an authorization change request.  When one of these
   attributes is omitted from a CoA-Request, the NAS assumes that the
   attribute value is to remain unchanged.  Attributes included in a
   CoA-Request replace all existing values of the same attribute(s).

   (Note 4) When included within a successful Disconnect-Request (where
   a Disconnect-ACK is subsequently sent), the Class Attribute SHOULD be
   sent unmodified by the NAS to the RADIUS accounting server in the
   Accounting Stop packet.  If the Disconnect-Request is unsuccessful,
   then the Class Attribute is not processed.

   (Note 5) When included within a CoA-Request, these attributes
   represent an authorization change request.  Where tunnel attributes
   are included within a successful CoA-Request, all existing tunnel
   attributes are removed and replaced by the new attribute(s).

   (Note 6) Since the Framed-IP-Address, Framed-IPv6-Prefix, and
   Framed-Interface-Id attributes are used for session identification,
   renumbering cannot be accomplished by including values of these
   attributes within a CoA-Request.  Instead, a CoA-Request including a
   Service-Type Attribute with a value of "Authorize Only" is sent; new
   values can be supplied in an Access-Accept sent in response to the
   ensuing Access-Request.  Note that renumbering will not be possible
   in all situations.  For example, in order to change an IP address,
   IPCP or IPv6CP re-negotiation could be required, which is not
   supported by all PPP implementations.

   (Note 7) Within Disconnect-Request packets, Vendor-Specific
   Attributes (VSAs) MAY be used for session identification.  Within
   CoA-Request packets, VSAs MAY be used for either session
   identification or authorization change.  However, the same Attribute
   MUST NOT be used for both purposes simultaneously.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Diameter%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Diameter Considerations</span>

   Due to differences in handling change-of-authorization requests in
   RADIUS and Diameter, it may be difficult or impossible for a
   Diameter/RADIUS gateway to successfully translate a Diameter
   Re-Auth-Request (RAR) to a CoA-Request and vice versa.  For example,
   since a CoA-Request only initiates an authorization change but does
   not initiate re-authentication, a RAR command containing a
   Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP with value "AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE" cannot
   be directly translated to a CoA-Request.  A Diameter/RADIUS gateway
   receiving a CoA-Request containing authorization changes will need to
   translate this into two Diameter exchanges.  First, the
   Diameter/RADIUS gateway will issue a RAR command including a
   Session-Id AVP and a Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP with value "AUTHORIZE
   ONLY".  Then the Diameter/RADIUS gateway will respond to the ensuing
   access request with a response including the authorization attributes
   gleaned from the CoA-Request.  To enable translation, the CoA-Request
   SHOULD include a Acct-Session-Id Attribute.  If the Diameter client
   uses the same Session-Id for both authorization and accounting, then
   the Diameter/RADIUS gateway can copy the contents of the Acct-
   Session-Id Attribute into the Session-Id AVP;  otherwise, it will
   need to map the Acct-Session-Id value to an equivalent Session-Id for
   use within a RAR command.

   Where an Acct-Session-Id Attribute is not present in a CoA-Request or
   Disconnect-Request, a Diameter/RADIUS gateway will either need to
   determine the appropriate Acct-Session-Id or, if it cannot do so, it
   can send a CoA-NAK or Disconnect-NAK in reply, possibly including an
   Error-Cause Attribute with a value of 508 (Multiple Session Selection
   Unsupported).

   To simplify translation between RADIUS and Diameter, Dynamic
   Authorization Clients can include a Service-Type Attribute with value
   "Authorize Only" within a CoA-Request, as described in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.
   A Diameter/RADIUS gateway receiving a CoA-Request containing a
   Service-Type Attribute with a value "Authorize Only" translates this
   to a RAR with Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP with value "AUTHORIZE ONLY".
   The received RAA is then translated to a CoA-NAK with a Service-Type
   Attribute with value "Authorize Only".  If the Result-Code AVP in the
   RAA has a value in the success category, then an Error-Cause
   Attribute with value "Request Initiated" is included in the CoA-NAK.
   If the Result-Code AVP in the RAA has a value indicating a Protocol
   Error or a Transient or Permanent Failure, then an alternate Error-
   Cause Attribute is returned as suggested below.

   Within Diameter, a server can request that a session be aborted by
   sending an Abort-Session-Request (ASR), identifying the session to be
   terminated using Session-ID and User-Name AVPs.  The ASR command is

   translated to a Disconnect-Request containing Acct-Session-Id and
   User-Name attributes.  If the Diameter client utilizes the same
   Session-Id in both authorization and accounting, then the value of
   the Session-ID AVP may be placed in the Acct-Session-Id Attribute;
   otherwise the value of the Session-ID AVP will need to be mapped to
   an appropriate Acct-Session-Id Attribute.  To enable translation of a
   Disconnect-Request to an ASR, an Acct-Session-Id Attribute SHOULD be
   present.

   If the Diameter client utilizes the same Session-Id in both
   authorization and accounting, then the value of the Acct-Session-Id
   Attribute may be placed into the Session-ID AVP within the ASR;
   otherwise the value of the Acct-Session-Id Attribute will need to be
   mapped to an appropriate Session-ID AVP.

   An Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) command is sent in response to an ASR
   in order to indicate the disposition of the request.  A
   Diameter/RADIUS gateway receiving a Disconnect-ACK translates this to
   an ASA command with a Result-Code AVP of "DIAMETER_SUCCESS".  A
   Disconnect-NAK received from the NAS is translated to an ASA command
   with a Result-Code AVP that depends on the value of the Error-Cause
   Attribute.  Suggested translations between Error-Cause Attribute
   values and Result-Code AVP values are included below:

    #    Error-Cause Attribute Value   Result-Code AVP

   Since both the ASR/ASA and Disconnect-Request/Disconnect-
   NAK/Disconnect-ACK exchanges involve just a request and response,
   inclusion of an "Authorize Only" Service-Type within a Disconnect-
   Request is not needed to assist in Diameter/RADIUS translation, and
   may make translation more difficult.  As a result, as noted in
   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>, the Service-Type Attribute MUST NOT be used within a
   Disconnect-Request.

   This document uses the RADIUS [<a href="rfc2865.html" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>] namespace; see
   &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types">http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types</a>&gt;.  In addition to the

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20%20Authorization%20Issues"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Authorization Issues</span>

   Where a NAS is shared by multiple providers, it is undesirable for
   one provider to be able to send Disconnect-Requests or CoA-Requests
   affecting the sessions of another provider.

   A Dynamic Authorization Server MUST silently discard Disconnect-
   Request or CoA-Request packets from untrusted sources.  In situations
   where the Dynamic Authorization Client is co-resident with a RADIUS
   authentication or accounting server, a proxy MAY perform a "reverse
   path forwarding" (RPF) check to verify that a Disconnect-Request or
   CoA-Request originates from an authorized Dynamic Authorization
   Client.  In addition, it SHOULD be possible to explicitly authorize
   additional sources of Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request packets
   relating to certain classes of sessions.  For example, a particular
   source can be explicitly authorized to send CoA-Request packets
   relating to users within a set of realms.

   To perform the RPF check, the Dynamic Authorization Server uses the
   session identification attributes included in Disconnect-Request or
   CoA-Request packets, in order to determine the RADIUS server(s) to
   which an equivalent Access-Request could be routed.  If the source
   address of the Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request is within this set,
   then the CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request is forwarded; otherwise it
   MUST be silently discarded.



<span class="grey">Chiba, et al.                Informational                     [Page 26]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5176.html">RFC 5176</a>       Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS   January 2008</span>


   Typically, the Dynamic Authorization Server will extract the realm
   from the Network Access Identifier [<a href="rfc4282.html" title='"The Network Access Identifier"'>RFC4282</a>] included within the
   User-Name or Chargeable-User-Identity Attribute, and determine the
   corresponding RADIUS servers in the realm routing tables.  If the
   Dynamic Authorization Server maintains long-term session state, it
   MAY perform the authorization check based on the session
   identification attributes in the CoA-Request.  The session
   identification attributes can be used to tie a session to a
   particular proxy or set of proxies, as with the NAI realm.

   Where no proxy is present, the RPF check can only be performed by the
   NAS if it maintains its own a realm routing table.  If the NAS does
   not maintain a realm routing table (e.g., it selects forwarding
   proxies based on primary/secondary configuration and/or liveness
   checks), then an RPF check cannot be performed.

   Since authorization to send a Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request is
   determined based on the source address and the corresponding shared
   secret, the Dynamic Authorization Server SHOULD configure a different
   shared secret for each Dynamic Authorization Client.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2.%20%20IPsec%20Usage%20Guidelines"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" name="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  IPsec Usage Guidelines</span>

   In addition to security vulnerabilities unique to Disconnect or CoA
   packets, the protocol exchanges described in this document are
   susceptible to the same vulnerabilities as RADIUS [<a href="rfc2865.html" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>].  It is
   RECOMMENDED that IPsec be employed to afford better security,
   utilizing the profile described in <a href="rfc3579.html#section-4.2">[RFC3579], Section 4.2</a>.

   For Dynamic Authorization Servers implementing this specification,
   the IPsec policy would be "Require IPsec, from any to me, destination
   port UDP 3799".  This causes the Dynamic Authorization Server to
   require use of IPsec.  If some Dynamic Authorization Clients do not
   support IPsec, then a more granular policy will be required: "Require
   IPsec, from IPsec-Capable-DAC to me".

   For Dynamic Authorization Clients implementing this specification,
   the IPsec policy would be "Initiate IPsec, from me to any,
   destination port UDP 3799".  This causes the Dynamic Authorization
   Client to initiate IPsec when sending Dynamic Authorization traffic
   to any Dynamic Authorization Server.  If some Dynamic Authorization
   Servers contacted by the Dynamic Authorization Client do not support
   IPsec, then a more granular policy will be required, such as
   "Initiate IPsec, from me to IPsec-Capable-DAS, destination port UDP
   3799".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.3.%20%20Replay%20Protection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" name="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Replay Protection</span>

   Where IPsec replay protection is not used, an Event-Timestamp (55)
   [<a href="rfc2869.html" title='"RADIUS Extensions"'>RFC2869</a>] Attribute SHOULD be included within CoA-Request and
   Disconnect-Request packets, and MAY be included within CoA-ACK, CoA-
   NAK, Disconnect-ACK, and Disconnect-NAK packets.

   When the Event-Timestamp Attribute is present, both the Dynamic
   Authorization Server and the Dynamic Authorization Client MUST check
   that the Event-Timestamp Attribute is current within an acceptable
   time window.  If the Event-Timestamp Attribute is not current, then
   the packet MUST be silently discarded.  This implies the need for
   loose time synchronization within the network, which can be achieved
   by a variety of means, including Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP),
   as described in [<a href="rfc4330.html" title='"Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI"'>RFC4330</a>].  Implementations SHOULD be configurable to
   discard CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request packets not containing an
   Event-Timestamp Attribute.

   If the Event-Timestamp Attribute is included, it represents the time
   at which the original packet was sent, and therefore it SHOULD NOT be
   updated when the packet is retransmitted.  If the Event-Timestamp
   Attribute is not updated, this implies that the Identifier is not
   changed in retransmitted packets.  As a result, the ability to detect
   replay within the time window is dependent on support for duplicate
   detection within that same window.  As noted in <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>,
   duplicate detection is REQUIRED for Dynamic Authorization Servers
   implementing this specification.

   The time window used for duplicate detection MUST be the same as the
   window used to detect a stale Event-Timestamp Attribute.  Since the
   RADIUS Identifier cannot be repeated within the selected time window,
   no more than 256 Requests can be accepted within the time window.  As
   a result, the chosen time window will depend on the expected maximum
   volume of CoA/Disconnect-Requests, so that unnecessary discards can
   be avoided.  A default time window of 300 seconds should be adequate
   in many circumstances.

   This Appendix lists the major changes between [<a href="rfc3576.html" title='"Dynamic Authorization Extensions to Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC3576</a>] and this
   document.  Minor changes, including style, grammar, spelling, and
   editorial changes, are not mentioned here.

   o The term "Dynamic Authorization Client" is used instead of RADIUS
   server where it applies to the originator of CoA-Request and
   Disconnect-Request packets.  The term "Dynamic Authorization Server"
   is used instead of NAS where it applies to the receiver of CoA-
   Request and Disconnect-Request packets.  Definitions of these terms
   have been added (<a href="#section-1.3">Section 1.3</a>).

   o  Added requirement for duplicate detection on the Dynamic
      Authorization Server (<a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>).

   o  Clarified expected behavior when session identification attributes
      match more than one session (Sections <a href="#section-2.3">2.3</a>, <a href="#section-3">3</a>, <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>, <a href="#section-4">4</a>).

   o  Added Chargeable-User-Identity as a session identification
      attribute.  Removed NAS-Port-Type as a session identification
      attribute (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).

   o  Added recommendation that an Acct-Session-Id or Acct-Multi-
      Session-Id Attribute be included in an Access-Request (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).

   o  Added discussion of scenarios in which the "Dynamic Authorization
      Client" and RADIUS server are not co-located (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).

   o  Added details relating to handling of the Proxy-State Attribute
      (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>).

   o  Added clarification that support for a Service-Type Attribute with
      value "Authorize Only" is optional on both the NAS and Dynamic
      Authorization Client (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).  Use of the Service-Type
      Attribute within a Disconnect-Request is prohibited (Sections <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>,
      3.6).

   o  Added requirement for inclusion of the State Attribute in CoA-
      Request packets including a Service-Type Attribute with a value of
      "Authorize Only" (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>).

   o  Added clarification on the calculation of the Message-
      Authenticator Attribute (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>).

   o  Additional Error-Cause Attribute values are allocated for Invalid
      Attribute Value (407) and Multiple Session Selection
      Identification (508) (Sections <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>, <a href="#section-4">4</a>).

   o  Updated the CoA-Request Attribute Table to include Filter-Rule,
      Delegated-IPv6-Prefix, Egress-VLANID, Ingress-Filters, Egress-
      VLAN-Name, and User-Priority attributes (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>).

   o  Added the Chargeable-User-Identity Attribute to both the CoA-
      Request and Disconnect-Request Attribute table (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>).

   o  Use of Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs) for session
      identification and authorization change has been clarified
      (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>).

   o  Added Note 6 on the use of the CoA-Request for renumbering, and
      Note 7 on the use of Vendor-Specific attributes (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>).

   o  Added Diameter Considerations (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).

   o  Event-Timestamp Attribute should not be recalculated on
      retransmission.  The implications for replay and duplicate
      detection are discussed (<a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>).

   o  Operation of the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check has been
      clarified.  Use of the RPF check is optional rather than
      recommended by default (<a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>).

   o  Text on impersonation (included in <a href="rfc3579.html#section-4.3.7">[RFC3579], Section 4.3.7</a>) and
      IPsec operation (included in <a href="rfc3579.html#section-4.2">[RFC3579], Section 4.2</a>) has been
      removed, and is now referenced.
