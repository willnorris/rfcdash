<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document is intended to provide terminology for the benchmarking
   of local area network (LAN) switching devices.  It extends the
   terminology already defined for benchmarking network interconnect
   devices in RFCs 1242 and 1944 to switching devices.

   Although it might be found useful to apply some of the terms defined
   here to a broader range of network interconnect devices, this RFC
   primarily deals with devices which switch frames at the Medium Access
   Control (MAC) layer.  It defines terms in relation to the traffic put
   to use when benchmarking switching devices, forwarding performance,
   congestion control, latency, address handling and filtering.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Existing%20definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Existing definitions</span>

   <a href="rfc1242.html">RFC 1242</a> "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect Devices"
   should be consulted before attempting to make use of this document.
   <a href="rfc1944.html">RFC 1944</a> "Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"
   contains discussions of a number of terms relevant to the
   benchmarking of switching devices and should also be consulted.

   For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template
   for definitions set out in <a href="rfc1242.html#section-2">Section 2 of RFC 1242</a>.  Definitions are
   indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   Discussion:

      A system under test may be comprised of a variety of networking
      devices.  Some devices may be active in the forwarding decision-
      making process, such as routers or switches; other devices may be
      passive such as a CSU/DSU.  Regardless of constituent components,
      the system is treated as a singular entity to which stimulus is
      offered and response measured.

   Definition:

      When all frames presented to the input interfaces of a DUT/SUT are
      addressed to output interfaces which do not themselves receive any
      frames.

   Discussion:

      This definition conforms to the discussion in section 16 of <a href="rfc1944.html">RFC</a>
      <a href="rfc1944.html">1944</a> which describes how unidirectional traffic can be offered to
      a DUT/SUT to measure throughput.  Unidirectional traffic is also
      appropriate for:

      -the measurement of the minimum inter-frame gap -the creation of
      many-to-one or one-to-many interface overload -the detection of
      head of line blocking -the measurement of forwarding rates and
      throughput when congestion control mechanisms are active.

      When a tester offers unidirectional traffic to a DUT/SUT reception
      and transmission are handled by different interfaces or sets of
      interfaces of the DUT/SUT.  All frames received from the tester by
      the DUT/SUT are transmitted back to the tester from interfaces
      which do not themselves receive any frames.

      It is useful to distinguish traffic orientation and traffic
      distribution when considering traffic patterns used in device
      testing.  Unidirectional traffic, for example, is traffic
      orientated in a single direction between mutually exclusive sets
      of source and destination interfaces of a DUT/SUT.  Such traffic,



<span class="grey">Mandeville                   Informational                      [Page 4]</span></pre>

      however, can be distributed between interfaces in different ways.
      When traffic is sent to two or more interfaces from an external
      source and then forwarded by the DUT/SUT to a single output
      interface the traffic orientation is unidirectional and the
      traffic distribution between interfaces is many-to-one.  Traffic
      can also be sent to a single input interface and forwarded by the
      DUT/SUT to two or more output interfaces to achieve a one-to-many
      distribution of traffic.

      Such traffic distributions can also be combined to test for head
      of line blocking or to measure forwarding rates and throughput
      when congestion control mechanisms are active.

      When a DUT/SUT is equipped with interfaces running at different
      media rates the number of input interfaces required to load or
      overload an output interface or interfaces will vary.

      It should be noted that measurement of the minimum inter-frame gap
      serves to detect violations of the IEEE 802.3 standard.

      When a tester offers bidirectional traffic to a DUT/SUT all the
      interfaces which receive frames from the tester also transmit
      frames back to the tester.

   Definition:

      Frames offered to one or more input interfaces of a DUT/SUT and
      addressed to one or more output interfaces where input and output
      interfaces are mutually exclusive and mapped one-to-many, many-
      to-one or many-to-many.

      This definition follows from the discussion in section 16 of <a href="rfc1944.html">RFC</a>
      <a href="rfc1944.html">1944</a> on multi-port testing.  Partially meshed traffic allows for
      one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many mappings of input to
      output interfaces and readily extends to configurations with
      multiple switching devices linked together over backbone
      connections.

      It should be noted that partially meshed traffic can load backbone
      connections linking together two switching devices or systems more
      than fully meshed traffic.  When offered partially meshed traffic
      devices or systems can be set up to forward all of the frames they
      receive to the opposite side of the backbone connection whereas
      fully meshed traffic requires at least some of the offered frames
      to be forwarded locally, that is to the interfaces of the DUT/SUT
      receiving them.  Such frames will not traverse the backbone
      connection.

   Definition:

      Frames offered to a designated number of interfaces of a DUT/SUT
      such that each one of the interfaces under test receives frames
      addressed to all of the other interfaces under test.

   Discussion:

      As with bidirectional partially meshed traffic, fully meshed
      traffic requires each one the interfaces of a DUT/SUT to both
      receive and transmit frames.  But since the interfaces are not
      divided into groups as with partially meshed traffic every
      interface forwards frames to and receives frames from every other
      interface.  The total number of individual input/output interface
      pairs when traffic is fully meshed over n switched interfaces
      equals n x (n - 1).  This compares with n x (n / 2) such interface
      pairs when traffic is partially meshed.

      Fully meshed traffic on half duplex interfaces is inherently
      bursty since interfaces must interrupt transmission whenever they
      receive frames.  This kind of bursty meshed traffic is
      characteristic of real network traffic and can be advantageously
      used to diagnose a DUT/SUT by exercising many of its component
      parts simultaneously.  Additional inspection may be warranted to
      correlate the frame forwarding capacity of a DUT/SUT when offered
      meshed traffic and the behavior of individual elements such as
      input or output buffers, buffer allocation mechanisms, aggregate
      switching capacity, processing speed or medium access control.

      The analysis of forwarding rate measurements presents a challenge
      when offering bidirectional or fully meshed traffic since the rate
      at which the tester can be observed to transmit frames to the
      DUT/SUT may be smaller than the rate at which it intends to
      transmit due to collisions on half duplex media or the action of
      congestion control mechanisms.  This makes it important to take
      account of both the intended and offered loads defined in sections
      3.5.1.and 3.5.2 below when reporting the results of such
      forwarding rate measurements.

      When offering bursty meshed traffic to a DUT/SUT a number of

   Definition:

      The number of frames in a burst.

   Discussion:

      Burst size can range from one to infinity.  In unidirectional
      traffic as well as in bidirectional or meshed traffic on full
      duplex interfaces there is no theoretical limit to burst length.
      When traffic is bidirectional or meshed bursts on half duplex
      media are finite since interfaces interrupt transmission
      intermittently to receive frames.

      On real networks burst size will normally increase with window
      size.  This makes it desirable to test devices with small as well
      as large burst sizes.

      Bidirectional and meshed traffic are inherently bursty since
      interfaces share their time between receiving and transmitting
      frames.  External sources offering bursty traffic for a given

   Definition:

      The number of frames per second that an external source can be
      observed or measured to transmit to a DUT/SUT for forwarding to a
      specified output interface or interfaces.

   Discussion:

      The load which an external device can be observed to apply to a
      DUT/SUT may be less than the intended load due to collisions on
      half duplex media or the action of congestion control mechanisms.
      This makes it important to distinguish intended and offered load
      when analyzing the results of forwarding rate measurements using
      bidirectional or fully meshed traffic.

      Frames which are not successfully transmitted by an external
      source of traffic to a DUT/SUT MUST NOT be counted as transmitted
      frames when measuring forwarding rates.

      The frame count on an interface of a DUT/SUT may exceed the rate
      at which an external device offers frames due to the presence of
      spanning tree BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units) on 802.1D-
      compliant switches or SNMP frames.  Such frames should be treated
      as modifiers as described in <a href="rfc1944.html#section-11">section 11 of RFC 1944</a>.

   Definition:

      The highest number of frames per second that an external source
      can transmit to a DUT/SUT for forwarding to a specified output
      interface or interfaces.

   Discussion:

      The maximum load that an external device can apply to a DUT/SUT
      may not equal the maximum load allowed by the medium.  This
      will be the case  when an external source lacks the resources
      to transmit frames at the minimum legal inter-frame gap or when
      it has sufficient resources to transmit frames below the
      minimum legal inter-frame gap.  Moreover, maximum load may vary
      with respect to parameters other than a medium's maximum
      theoretical utilization.  For example, on those media employing
      tokens, maximum load may vary as a function of Token Rotation
      Time, Token Holding Time, or the ability to chain multiple
      frames to a single token.  The maximum load that an external
      device applies to a DUT/SUT MUST be specified when measuring
      forwarding rates.

   Definition:

      Attempting to load a DUT/SUT in excess of the maximum rate of
      transmission allowed by the medium.

   Discussion:

      Overloading can serve to exercise buffers and buffer allocation
      algorithms as well as congestion control mechanisms.  The number
      of input interfaces required to overload one or more output
      interfaces of a DUT/SUT will vary according to the media rates of
      the interfaces involved.

      An external source can also overload an interface by transmitting
      frames below the minimum inter-frame gap.  A DUT/SUT MUST forward
      such frames at intervals equal to or above the minimum gap
      specified in standards.

      A DUT/SUT using congestion control techniques such as backpressure
      or forward pressure may exhibit no frame loss when a tester
      attempts to overload one or more of its interfaces.  This should
      not be exploited to suggest that the DUT/SUT supports rates of
      transmission in excess of the maximum rate allowed by the medium
      since both techniques reduce the rate at which the tester offers
      frames to prevent overloading.  Backpressure achieves this purpose
      by jamming the transmission interfaces of the tester and forward
      pressure by hindering the tester from gaining fair access to the
      medium.  Analysis of both cases should take the distinction
      between intended load (3.5.1) and offered load (3.5.2) into
      account.

   Discussion:

      Unlike throughput defined in <a href="rfc1242.html#section-3.17">section 3.17 of RFC 1242</a>, forwarding
      rate makes no explicit reference to frame loss.  Forwarding rate
      refers to the number of frames per second observed on the output
      side of the interface under test and MUST be reported in relation
      to the offered load.  Forwarding rate can be measured with
      different traffic orientations and distributions.

      It should be noted that the forwarding rate of a DUT/SUT may be
      sensitive to the action of congestion control mechanisms.

      Forwarding rate at maximum offered load may be less than the

      The following example illustrates how the terms relative to
      loading and forwarding rates are meant to be used.  In particular
      it shows how the distinction between forwarding rate at maximum
      offered load (FRMOL) and maximum forwarding rate (MFR) can be used

   Discussion:

      Some switches send jam signals, for example preamble bits, back to
      traffic sources when their transmit and/or receive buffers start
      to overfill.  Switches implementing full duplex Ethernet links may
      use IEEE 802.3x Flow Control for the same purpose.  Such devices
      may incur no frame loss when external sources attempt to offer
      traffic to congested or overloaded interfaces.

      It should be noted that jamming and other flow control methods may
      slow all traffic transmitted to congested input interfaces
      including traffic intended for uncongested output interfaces.

      A DUT/SUT applying backpressure may exhibit no frame loss when a
      tester attempts to overload one or more of its interfaces.  This
      should not be interpreted to suggest that the interfaces of the
      DUT/SUT support forwarding rates above the maximum rate allowed by
      the medium.  In these cases overloading is only apparent since
      through the application of backpressure the DUT/SUT avoids
      overloading by reducing the rate at which the tester can offer
      frames.

      Methods which depart from or otherwise violate a defined

   Discussion:

      A DUT/SUT may be found to inhibit or abort back-off algorithms in
      order to force access to the medium when contention occurs.  It
      should be noted that the back-off algorithm should be fair whether
      the DUT/SUT is in a congested or an uncongested state.
      Transmission below the minimum inter-frame gap or the disregard of
      flow control primitives fall into this category.

      A DUT/SUT applying forward pressure may eliminate all or most
      frame loss when a tester attempts to overload one or more of its
      interfaces.  This should not be interpreted to suggest that the
      interfaces of the DUT/SUT can sustain forwarding rates above the
      maximum rate allowed by the medium.  Overloading in such cases is
      only apparent since the application of forward pressure by the
      DUT/SUT enables interfaces to relieve saturated output queues by
      forcing access to the medium and concomitantly inhibiting the
      tester from transmitting frames.

      interfaces on different chassis linked together over backbone
      connections.  The terms maximum broadcast forwarding rate and
      broadcast forwarding rate at maximum load follow directly from the
      terms already defined for forwarding rate measurements in <a href="#section-3.6">section</a>
      <a href="#section-3.6">3.6</a> above.

   Measurement units:

      N-octet frames per second

   Issues:

   See Also:

      forwarding rate at maximum load (3.6.2)
      maximum forwarding rate (3.6.3)
      broadcast latency (3.10.2)

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.10.2%20Broadcast%20latency"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.10.2" name="section-3.10.2">3.10.2</a> Broadcast latency</span>

   Definition:

      The time required by a DUT/SUT to forward a broadcast frame to
      each interface located within a broadcast domain.

   Discussion:

      Since there is no standard way for switches to process
      broadcast frames, broadcast latency may not be the same on all
      receiving interfaces of a switching device.  The latency
      measurements SHOULD be bit oriented as described in <a href="rfc1242.html#section-3.8">section 3.8
      of RFC 1242</a>.  It is useful to determine broadcast latency for
      frames forwarded between interfaces on the same card, on
      different cards in the same chassis and on different chassis
      linked over backbone connections.

   Measurement units:

         nanoseconds
         microseconds
         milliseconds
         seconds

   Issues:

   See Also:

      broadcast forwarding rate (3.10.1)

   Documents of this type do not directly effect the security of the
   Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not
   performed on devices or systems connected to operating networks.

   The document points out that switching devices may violate the IEEE
   802.3 standard by transmitting frames below the minimum interframe
   gap or unfairly accessing the medium by inhibiting the backoff
   algorithm.  Although such violations do not directly engender
   breaches in security, they may perturb the normal functioning of
   other interworking devices by obstructing their access to the medium.
   Their use on the Internet or on corporate networks should be
   discouraged.
