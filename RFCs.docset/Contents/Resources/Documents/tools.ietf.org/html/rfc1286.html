<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Abstract"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Abstract</span>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing bridges based on the
   IEEE 802.1d draft standard between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.
   Provisions are made for support of transparent and source route
   bridging.  Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to
   bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20The%20Network%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  The Network Management Framework</span>

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
      and naming objects for the purpose of management.  <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a>
      defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
      consistent with the SMI.

      <a href="rfc1156.html">RFC 1156</a> which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
      the Internet suite of protocols.  <a href="rfc1213.html">RFC 1213</a>, defines MIB-II, an
      evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
      operational requirements.

      <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
      access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Objects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Objects</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-7" title=" International Organization for Standardization">7</a>]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1286.html">RFC 1286</a>                       Bridge MIB                  December 1991</span>


   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>3</a>] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-8" title=" International Standard 8825">8</a>],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>9</a>,<a href="#ref-10" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>10</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Overview</span>

   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This device
   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network
   layer.  There are two major modes defined for this bridging;
   transparent and source route.  The transparent method of bridging is
   defined in the draft IEEE 802.1d specification [<a href="#ref-11" title='"IEEE Project 802 Local and Metropolitan Area Networks"'>11</a>].  Source route
   bridging has been defined by I.B.M. and is described in the Token
   Ring Architecture Reference [<a href="#ref-12">12</a>].  IEEE 802.1d is currently working
   on combining the source route and transparent techniques in a
   compatible fashion.  This memo defines those objects needed for the
   management of a bridging entity operating in one of these modes.

   To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practice,
   an explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB as simple as possible.
   This was accomplished by applying the following criteria to objects
   proposed for inclusion:

      (1)  Start with a small set of essential objects and add only
           as further objects are needed.

      (2)  Require objects be essential for either fault or
           configuration management.

      (3)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

      (4)  Limit the total of objects.

      (5)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
           this or other MIBs.

      (6)  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily
           instrumented.  The guideline that was followed is one
           counter per critical section per layer.

   least) the 'system' group and the 'interfaces' group defined in MIB-
   II [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>6</a>].

   In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
   object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to the
   entity as a whole irrespective of whether the entity's sole
   functionality is bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of
   the entity's functionality.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.2.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20%27interfaces%27%20group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.2" name="section-4.2.2">4.2.2</a>.  Relationship to the 'interfaces' group</span>

   In MIB-II, the 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for
   all systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces, where
   each interface is thought of as being attached to a `subnetwork'.
   (Note that this term is not to be confused with `subnet' which refers
   to an addressing partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of
   protocols.) The term 'segment' is used in this memo to refer to such
   a subnetwork, whether it be an Ethernet segment, a 'ring', a WAN
   link, or even an X.25 virtual circuit.

   Implicit in this Bridge MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each
   of these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces'
   group, and in most situations, each port is associated with a
   different interface. However, there are situations in which multiple
   ports are associated with the same interface.  An example of such a
   situation would be several ports each corresponding one-to-one with
   several X.25 virtual circuits but all on the same interface.

   Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port number has
   no mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the simple
   case a port number will have the same value as the corresponding
   interface's interface number.  Port numbers are in the range
   (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).

   Some entities perform other functionality as well as bridging through
   the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.  In such
   situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an interface
   is within the domain of the entity's bridging functionality.  This
   subset is considered to be delineated according to a set of
   protocols, with some protocols being bridged, and other protocols not
   being bridged. For example, in an entity which exclusively performed
   bridging, all protocols would be considered as being bridged, whereas
   in an entity which performed IP routing on IP datagrams and only
   bridged other protocols, only the non-IP data would be considered as
   being bridged.

   Thus, this Bridge MIB (and in particular, its counters) are
   applicable only to that subset of the data on an entity's interfaces
   which is sent/received for a protocol being bridged.  All such data
   is sent/received via the ports of the bridge.

   The datatypes, MacAddress, BridgeId and Timeout, are used as textual
   conventions in this document.  These textual conventions have NO
   effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed object.
   Objects defined using these conventions are always encoded by means
   of the rules that define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to
   the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual
   conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

               with a Spanning Tree Explorer frame.  The value
               'disabled(2)' indicates that the port will not
               accept or send Spanning Tree Explorer packets; any
               STE packets received will be silently discarded.
               The value 'forced(3)' indicates the port will
               always accept and propagate Spanning Tree Explorer
               frames.  This allows a manually configured
               Spanning Tree for this class of packet to be
               configured.  Note that unlike transparent bridging
               this is not catastrophic to the network if there
               are loops.  The value 'auto-span(1)' can only be
               returned by a bridge that both implements the
               Spanning Tree Protocol and has use of the protocol
               enabled on this port. The behavior of the port for
               Spanning Tree Explorer frames is determined by the
               state of dot1dStpPortState.  If the port is in the

   This document was produced on behalf of the Bridge Sub-Working Group
   of the SNMP Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force.
   Over the course of its deliberations, the working group received four
   separate documents for consideration as the basis for its work.  The
   first was submitted by Stan Froyd of Advanced Computer
   Communications; the second by Richard Fox of SynOptics; the third by
   Eric Decker of cisco Inc. and Keith McCloghrie of Hughes LAN Systems;
   and the fourth by Paul Langille and Anil Rijsinghani of Digital
   Equipment Corp. After considering the submissions, the working group
   chose to proceed with a document formed as a conjunction of the
   latter two submissions.  This document is the result.

   The authors wish to thank the members of the Bridge Working Group for
   their many comments and suggestions which improved this effort.  In
   particular, Fred Baker (chairman of the working group) of ACC, Steve
   Sherry of Xyplex, and Frank Kastenholz of Clearpoint Research Corp.
   Others members of the Bridge Working Group who contributed to this
   effort are:
