Abstract

   This document examines a wide range of conferencing requirements for
   tightly coupled SIP conferences.  Separate documents will map the
   requirements to existing protocol primitives, define new protocol
   extensions, and introduce new protocols as needed.  Together, these
   documents will provide a guide for building interoperable SIP
   conferencing applications.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document examines a wide range of conferencing requirements for
   tightly coupled SIP (<a href="rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>2</a>]) conferencing.

   The requirements are grouped by subjects in various areas allowing
   solutions to progress in parallel.

   Separate documents will map the requirements to existing protocol
   primitives, define new protocol extensions, and introduce new
   protocols as needed.

   Together, these documents will provide a guide for building
   interoperable SIP conferencing applications.

   The terms "MAY", "SHOULD", and "MUST" are to be interpreted as
   described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>1</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20An%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  An Overview</span>

   A SIP conference is an association of SIP user agents (i.e.,
   conference participants) with a central point (i.e., a conference
   focus), where the focus has direct peer-wise relationships with the
   participants by maintaining a separate SIP dialog with each.

   The focus is a SIP user agent that has abilities to host SIP
   conferences including their creation, maintenance, and manipulation
   using SIP call control means and potentially other non-SIP means.

   In this tightly coupled model, the SIP conference graph is always a
   star.  The conference focus maintains the correlation among
   conference's dialogs internally.

   The conference focus can be implemented either by a participant or by
   a separate application server.

   In the first case, a focus is typically capable of hosting a simple
   ad hoc conference only.  We envision that such basic conference can
   be established using SIP call control primitives only.

   A dedicated conference server, in addition to the basic features,
   offers richer functionality including simultaneous conferences, large
   scalable conferences, reserved conferences, and managed conferences.
   A conferencing server can support any subset of the advanced
   conferencing functions presented in this document.

   The media graph of a SIP conference can be centralized,
   decentralized, or any combination of both, and potentially differ per
   media type.  In the centralized case, the media sessions are
   established between the focus and each one of the participants.  In
   the de-centralized (i.e., distributed) case, the media graph is a
   (multicast or multi-unicast) mesh among the participants.
   Consequently, the media processing (e.g., mixing) can be performed
   either by the focus alone or by the participants.

   Conference participants and third parties can have different roles
   and privileges in a certain conference.  For example, conferencing
   policy can state that the rights to disconnect from and to invite to
   a conference are limited to the conference chair only.

   Throughout the document, by conference policies we mean a set of
   parameters and rules (e.g., maximum number of participants, needs
   chair-person supervision or not, password protected or not, duration,
   or a way of media mixing) that are defined at the onset of a
   conference.  Typically, conference policies would be specified by a
   conference creator and need special privileges to be manipulated.

   Throughout the document, by a conference state we mean a set of
   information describing the conference in progress.  This includes
   participants' information (such as dialog identifiers), media
   sessions in progress, the current loudest speaker, the current chair,
   etc.

   In addition to the requirements presented in this document,
   supplementary requirements for conferencing policy, media mixing and
   other manipulations, floor control, privilege control, etc. will be
   discussed in separate documents.

   Some of the requirements presented in this section can be met either
   by configuration means or by using proprietary conventions.
   Nevertheless, there is consensus that standard means for implementing
   these functions by automata MUST be defined.

        server(s).

   REQ-2: Given a SIP Address-of-Record (AOR) of a certain entity,
        resolution whether the SIP entity has focus capabilities.

   REQ-3: Given a global identifier of a particular conference, locating
        the conference focus.

   REQ-1: Given a conference identifier, a means MUST be defined for a
        user agent to disconnect all participants from the conference
        and terminate the conference including the release of the
        associated resources.

        Some of the requirements presented in this section can be met by
        human intervention, configuration means, or proprietary
        conventions.  Nevertheless, there is consensus that standard
        means for implementing these functions by automata MUST be
        defined.

   By a conference state, we mean a virtual database describing the
   conference in progress.  This includes different conference aspects:
   participants' information (such as dialog identifiers and state),
   media sessions in progress (such as current stream contributing
   sources and encoding schemes), the current loudest speaker, the
   current chair, etc.  Conference state is the latest conference
   snapshot triggered by changes in participants' state, conference
   policy changes, etc.

   REQ-1: A conference state virtual database MUST have a modular
        definition that is, it MUST be possible to access different
        conference aspects independently.

   REQ-2: It MUST be possible to aggregate information relating to
        different conference aspects in a single report.

   REQ-3: A mechanism for extensible definition and registration of
        conference state evolving aspects MUST be present.

   REQ-4: A default conference state report MUST be defined.  It SHOULD
        contain a minimal useful set of information (e.g., a list of
        current conference participants).

   "Cascading of Conferences" is a term that has different meanings in
   different contexts.  Some examples are listed below:

      -    Peer-to-peer chaining of signaling.  (Many ways exist to
           build the media graph in this case.)

      -    Conferences have hierarchal signaling relations.  (Many ways
           exists to build the media graph in this case.)

      -    "Cascading" is used to distribute the media "mixing" only.
           The distribution of signaling is not required.

   As it can be seen from the examples, each will define a different set
   of requirements.

   This document discusses high-level requirements for SIP conferencing.
   Conferencing has some specific security requirements, which will be
   summarized here at a very high level.

   All of the operations and functions described in this document need
   to be authorized by a focus or a participant.  It is expected that
   conferences will be governed by a set of authorization rules defined
   as a part of the conference policy.  In order for the conference
   policy to be implemented, the focus needs to be able to authenticate
   potential participants.  Normal SIP mechanisms including Digest
   authentication and certificates can be used [<a href="#ref-2" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>2</a>].  These conference-
   specific security requirements will be discussed in detail in the
   protocol documents.

   Conferencing also has privacy implications.  Some of these are
   discussed in this document.  Standard SIP mechanisms for a user agent
   to request privacy should be utilized by a focus and will be detailed
   in the protocol documents.
