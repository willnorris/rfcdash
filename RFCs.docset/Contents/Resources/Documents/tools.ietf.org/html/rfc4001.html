   Several standards-track MIB modules use the IpAddress SMIv2 base
   type.  This limits the applicability of these MIB modules to IP
   Version 4 (IPv4), as the IpAddress SMIv2 base type can only contain
   4-byte IPv4 addresses.  The IpAddress SMIv2 base type has become
   problematic with the introduction of IP Version 6 (IPv6) addresses
   [<a href="rfc3513.html" title='"Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture"'>RFC3513</a>].

   This document defines multiple textual conventions (TCs) as a means
   to express generic Internet network layer addresses within MIB module
   specifications.  The solution is compatible with SMIv2 (STD 58) and
   SMIv1 (STD 16).  New MIB definitions that have to express network
   layer Internet addresses SHOULD use the textual conventions defined
   in this memo.  New MIB modules SHOULD NOT use the SMIv2 IpAddress
   base type anymore.

   A generic Internet address consists of two objects: one whose syntax
   is InetAddressType, and another whose syntax is InetAddress.  The
   value of the first object determines how the value of the second is
   encoded.  The InetAddress textual convention represents an opaque
   Internet address value.  The InetAddressType enumeration is used to
   "cast" the InetAddress value into a concrete textual convention for
   the address type.  This usage of multiple textual conventions allows
   expression of the display characteristics of each address type and
   makes the set of defined Internet address types extensible.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4001.html">RFC 4001</a>          Internet Network Address Conventions     February 2005</span>


   The textual conventions for well-known transport domains support
   scoped Internet addresses.  The scope of an Internet address is a
   topological span within which the address may be used as a unique
   identifier for an interface or set of interfaces.  A scope zone (or,
   simply, a zone) is a concrete connected region of topology of a given
   scope.  Note that a zone is a particular instance of a topological
   region, whereas a scope is the size of a topological region
   [<a href="rfc4007.html" title='"IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture"'>RFC4007</a>].  Since Internet addresses on devices that connect multiple
   zones are not necessarily unique, an additional zone index is needed
   on these devices to select an interface.  The textual conventions
   InetAddressIPv4z and InetAddressIPv6z are provided to support
   Internet addresses that include a zone index.  To support arbitrary
   combinations of scoped Internet addresses, MIB authors SHOULD use a
   separate InetAddressType object for each InetAddress object.

   The textual conventions defined in this document can also be used to
   represent generic Internet subnets and Internet address ranges.  A
   generic Internet subnet is represented by three objects: one whose
   syntax is InetAddressType, a second one whose syntax is InetAddress,
   and a third one whose syntax is InetAddressPrefixLength.  The
   InetAddressType value again determines the concrete format of the
   InetAddress value, whereas the InetAddressPrefixLength identifies the
   Internet network address prefix.

   A generic range of consecutive Internet addresses is represented by
   three objects.  The first one has the syntax InetAddressType, and the
   remaining objects have the syntax InetAddress and specify the start
   and end of the address range.  Again, the InetAddressType value
   determines the format of the InetAddress values.

   The textual conventions defined in this document can be used to
   define Internet addresses by using DNS domain names in addition to
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  A MIB designer can write compliance
   statements to express that only a subset of the possible address
   types must be supported by a compliant implementation.

   MIB developers who need to represent Internet addresses SHOULD use
   these definitions whenever applicable, as opposed to defining their
   own constructs.  Even MIB modules that only need to represent IPv4 or
   IPv6 addresses SHOULD use the InetAddressType/InetAddress textual
   conventions defined in this memo.

   There are many widely deployed MIB modules that use IPv4 addresses
   and that have to be revised to support IPv6.  These MIB modules can
   be categorized as follows:






<span class="grey">Daniele, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-4" id="page-4" name="page-4"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4001.html">RFC 4001</a>          Internet Network Address Conventions     February 2005</span>


   1.  MIB modules that define management information that is, in
       principle, IP version neutral, but the MIB currently uses
       addressing constructs specific to a certain IP version.

   2.  MIB modules that define management information that is specific
       to a particular IP version (either IPv4 or IPv6) and that is very
       unlikely to ever be applicable to another IP version.

   MIB modules of the first type SHOULD provide object definitions
   (e.g., tables) that work with all versions of IP.  In particular,
   when revising a MIB module that contains IPv4 specific tables, it is
   suggested to define new tables using the textual conventions defined
   in this memo that support all versions of IP.  The status of the new
   tables SHOULD be "current", whereas the status of the old IP version
   specific tables SHOULD be changed to "deprecated".  The other
   approach, of having multiple similar tables for different IP
   versions, is strongly discouraged.

   MIB modules of the second type, which are inherently IP version
   specific, do not need to be redefined.  Note that even in this case,
   any additions to these MIB modules or to new IP version specific MIB

InetAddressType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A value that represents a type of Internet address.

         unknown(0)  An unknown address type.  This value MUST
                     be used if the value of the corresponding
                     InetAddress object is a zero-length string.
                     It may also be used to indicate an IP address
                     that is not in one of the formats defined
                     below.

         ipv4(1)     An IPv4 address as defined by the
                     InetAddressIPv4 textual convention.

         ipv6(2)     An IPv6 address as defined by the
                     InetAddressIPv6 textual convention.

         ipv4z(3)    A non-global IPv4 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv4z
                     textual convention.

         ipv6z(4)    A non-global IPv6 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv6z
                     textual convention.

         dns(16)     A DNS domain name as defined by the
                     InetAddressDNS textual convention.

         Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be
         accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
         with that InetAddressType.

         To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual
         convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions.
         It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to
         require only a subset of these address types for a compliant
         implementation.

         Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects
         and any dependent objects (e.g., InetAddress objects) are
         consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
         if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
         for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In

         An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the context
         of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the InetAddress
         textual convention is required to specify the InetAddressType
         object that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
         InetAddressType object be logically registered before the
         object(s) that use the InetAddress textual convention, if
         they appear in the same logical row.

         The value of an InetAddress object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated InetAddressType
         object.  Attempts to set an InetAddress object to a value
         inconsistent with the associated InetAddressType
         must fail with an inconsistentValue error.

         When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
         the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to
         limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers;

    DESCRIPTION
        "A zone index identifies an instance of a zone of a
         specific scope.

         The zone index MUST disambiguate identical address
         values.  For link-local addresses, the zone index will
         typically be the interface index (ifIndex as defined in the
         IF-MIB) of the interface on which the address is configured.

         The zone index may contain the special value 0, which refers
         to the default zone.  The default zone may be used in cases
         where the valid zone index is not known (e.g., when a
         management application has to write a link-local IPv6
         address without knowing the interface index value).  The
         default zone SHOULD NOT be used as an easy way out in

   The InetAddressType and InetAddress textual conventions have been
   introduced to avoid over-constraining an object definition by the use
   of the IpAddress SMI base type, which is IPv4 specific.  An
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pair can represent IP addresses in
   various formats.

   The InetAddressType and InetAddress objects SHOULD NOT be sub-typed
   in object definitions.  Sub-typing binds the MIB module to specific
   address formats, which may cause serious problems if new address
   formats need to be introduced.  Note that it is possible to write
   compliance statements indicating that only a subset of the defined
   address types must be implemented to be compliant.

   Every usage of the InetAddress or InetAddressPrefixLength textual
   conventions must specify which InetAddressType object provides the
   context for the interpretation of the InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength textual convention.

   It is suggested that the InetAddressType object is logically
   registered before the object(s) that use(s) the InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength textual convention.  An InetAddressType
   object is logically registered before an InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength object if it appears before the InetAddress
   or InetAddressPrefixLength object in the conceptual row (which
   includes any index objects).  This rule allows programs such as MIB
   compilers to identify the InetAddressType of a given InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength object by searching for the InetAddressType
   object, which precedes an InetAddress or InetAddressPrefixLength
   object.

   When a generic Internet address is used as an index, both the
   InetAddressType and InetAddress objects MUST be used.  The
   InetAddressType object MUST be listed before the InetAddress object
   in the INDEX clause.

   The IMPLIED keyword MUST NOT be used for an object of type
   InetAddress in an INDEX clause.  Instance sub-identifiers are then of
   the form T.N.O1.O2...On, where T is the value of the InetAddressType
   object, O1...On are the octets in the InetAddress object, and N is
   the number of those octets.

   There is a meaningful lexicographical ordering to tables indexed in
   this fashion.  Command generator applications may look up specific
   addresses of known type and value, issue GetNext requests for
   addresses of a single type, or issue GetNext requests for a specific
   type and address prefix.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Uniqueness%20of%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Uniqueness of Addresses</span>

   IPv4 addresses were intended to be globally unique, current usage
   notwithstanding.  IPv6 addresses were architected to have different
   scopes and hence uniqueness [<a href="rfc3513.html" title='"Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture"'>RFC3513</a>].  In particular, IPv6 "link-
   local" unicast addresses are not guaranteed to be unique on any
   particular node.  In such cases, the duplicate addresses must be
   configured on different interfaces.  So the combination of an IPv6
   address and a zone index is unique [<a href="rfc4007.html" title='"IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture"'>RFC4007</a>].

   The InetAddressIPv6 textual convention has been defined to represent
   global IPv6 addresses and non-global IPv6 addresses in cases where no
   zone index is needed (e.g., on end hosts with a single interface).
   The InetAddressIPv6z textual convention has been defined to represent
   non-global IPv6 addresses in cases where a zone index is needed
   (e.g., a router connecting multiple zones).  Therefore, MIB designers
   who use InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs do not need to define
   additional objects in order to support non-global addresses on nodes
   that connect multiple zones.

   The InetAddressIPv4z is intended for use in MIB modules (such as the
   TCP-MIB) which report addresses in the address family used on the
   wire, but where the entity instrumented obtains these addresses from
   applications or administrators in a form that includes a zone index,
   such as v4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

   The size of the zone index has been chosen so that it is consistent
   with (i) the numerical zone index, defined in [<a href="rfc4007.html" title='"IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture"'>RFC4007</a>], and (ii) the
   sin6_scope_id field of the sockaddr_in6 structure, defined in <a href="rfc2553.html">RFC</a>

   A single host system may be configured with multiple addresses (IPv4
   or IPv6), and possibly with multiple DNS names.  Thus it is possible
   for a single host system to be accessible by multiple
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs.

   If this could be an implementation or usage issue, the DESCRIPTION
   clause of the relevant objects must fully describe which address is
   reported in a given InetAddressType/InetAddress pair.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20Resolving%20DNS%20Names"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Resolving DNS Names</span>

   DNS names MUST be resolved to IP addresses when communication with
   the named host is required.  This raises a temporal aspect to
   defining MIB objects whose value is a DNS name: When is the name
   translated to an address?

   For example, consider an object defined to indicate a forwarding
   destination, and whose value is a DNS name.  When does the forwarding
   entity resolve the DNS name? Each time forwarding occurs, or just
   once when the object was instantiated?

   The DESCRIPTION clause of these objects SHOULD precisely define how
   and when any required name to address resolution is done.

   Similarly, the DESCRIPTION clause of these objects SHOULD precisely
   define how and when a reverse lookup is being done, if an agent has
   accessed instrumentation that knows about an IP address, and if the
   MIB module or implementation requires it to map the IP address to a
   DNS name.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Table%20Indexing%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Table Indexing Example</span>

   This example shows a table listing communication peers that are
   identified by either an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a DNS name.
   The table definition also prohibits entries with an empty address
   (whose type would be "unknown").  The size of a DNS name is limited
   to 64 characters in order to satisfy OID length constraints.

   o  Added a range restriction to the InetAddressPrefixLength textual
      convention.

   o  Added new textual conventions InetZoneIndex, InetScopeType, and

   o  Updated boilerplate text and references.

   o  Rewrote the introduction to say clearly that, in general, one
      should define MIB tables that work with all versions of IP.  The
      other approach of multiple tables for different IP versions is
      strongly discouraged.

   o  Added text to the InetAddressType and InetAddress descriptions

      inconsistentValue error if they lead to inconsistencies.

   o  Removed the strict ordering constraints.  Description clauses now
      must explain which InetAddressType object provides the context for
      an InetAddress or InetAddressPrefixLength object.

   o  Aligned wordings with the IPv6 scoping architecture document.

   o  Split the InetAddressIPv6 textual convention into the two textual
      conventions (InetAddressIPv6 and InetAddressIPv6z) and introduced
      a new textual convention InetAddressIPv4z.  Added ipv4z(3) and
      ipv6z(4) named numbers to the InetAddressType enumeration.
      Motivations for this change: (i) to enable the introduction of a
      textual conventions for non-global IPv4 addresses, (ii) alignment
      with the textual conventions for transport addresses, (iii)
      simpler compliance statements in cases where support for IPv6
      addresses with zone indices is not required, and (iv) to simplify
      implementations for host systems that will never have to report
      zone indices.
