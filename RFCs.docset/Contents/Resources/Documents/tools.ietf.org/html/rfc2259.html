Abstract

   The Simple Nomenclator Query Protocol (SNQP) allows a client to
   communicate with a descriptive name service or other relational-style
   query service.  The protocol is useful to services that search many
   data repositories for query responses.  Clients can pose queries on
   relations, list descriptions of relations, and obtain advice on
   reducing the search time and cost of their queries.  Clients are
   informed of the age of information in caches, and may request more
   recent information.  SNQP provides support for graphical user
   interfaces.  It also supports different types of comparison
   operators, so services can use SNQP with a variety of back-end
   servers, e.g. relational database servers, CCSO servers, and servers
   providing relational views of X.500.

   SNQP is an ASCII protocol in the request-reply style of SMTP.  It was
   specifically designed for use with the Nomenclator name and
   information service, and has been useful elsewhere.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   The Simple Nomenclator Query Protocol (SNQP) is a protocol for
   querying servers that search collections of data repositories.  Users
   retrieve information from an SNQP server by describing attributes of
   the information.  SNQP servers contact one or many data repositories
   to retrieve the response to a user query.  If the data repositories

   differ in protocol or data format, it is responsibility of the SNQP
   server to translate protocols and data formats to provide one,
   integrated answer to the user's query.

   SNQP servers share the protocol needs of centralized data
   repositories that answer queries with locally stored data.  SNQP
   servers also require specialized protocol features due to their
   distributed search characteristics.

   In highly distributed environments, it is unreasonable to expect all
   data repositories that need to be searched to be available when
   queries are posed.  SNQP servers require facilities for returning
   partial results in the presence of communications errors with data
   repositories.   The partial results must indicate how to resubmit the
   query only to those data repositories that are unavailable.

   In addition, users may pose queries without realizing the cost of the
   search for query responses.  SNQP provides facilities for informing
   users of query costs and advising them on limiting that cost.  Costs
   and advice are returned before queries are executed.

   Finally, SNQP servers may cache data and meta-data to speed query
   responses.  Servers can inform users of the t-bound for their query
   response.   A t-bound is the time after which changes may have
   occurred to the data that are not reflected in the query response
   [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Descriptive Name Services for Large Internets,"'>6</a>,<a href="#ref-2" title='"Read-Only Transactions in a Distributed Database,"'>2</a>].  A t-bound is the time of the oldest cache entry used to
   calculate the response.  Users can request that query responses are
   more current then a particular t-bound.  Making such a request
   flushes older items from the cache.

   SNQP provides support for graphical user interfaces.  It also
   supports different types of comparison operators, so SNQP servers can
   query a variety of back-end data repositories, e.g. relational
   databases, CCSO servers [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The CCSO Nameserver: A Description,"'>3</a>], and servers providing relational views
   of X.500 [10].

   SNQP is a connection-oriented protocol.  A client initiates a query
   session with an SNQP server by making a TCP connection to a well-
   known port.  The client then executes a series of SNQP commands.
   These commands are listed briefly in Table 1.  <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> provides
   some typical scenarios for using these commands, and <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>
   describes the commands fully.  The server replies to each command
   using the theory of reply codes described for the Simple Mail
   Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>9</a>]. The theory of reply codes and the
   defined reply codes are described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

                         Table 1: SNQP Commands

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   SNQP queries are posed in SQL, a standard relational database query
   language [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Parsing SQL,"'>4</a>,12].  Information that is obtained through SNQP servers
   is organized by type into database relations.  SQL queries may often
   have more functionality then a server supports or an application
   demands.  Moreover, advice on query costs, some types of comparison
   operations or t-bounds may not be supported by a particular server.
   SNQP defines a minimal subset of functionality for a working SNQP
   protocol.  Functionality beyond this subset is optional.  Servers
   that do not support optional functionality must return replies that
   indicate this to the user.  The required and optional features of
   SNQP are summarized in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   SNQP was specifically designed for use with the Nomenclator name and
   information service [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Nomenclator Home Page."'>8</a>,<a href="#ref-7" title='"Distributed Active Catalogs and Meta-Data Caching in Descriptive Name Services,"'>7</a>,<a href="#ref-5" title='"The Internet Nomenclator Project"'>5</a>].  Nomenclator produces query responses by
   integrating information from data repositories with different
   protocols and data formats.  It constrains the searches for query
   responses through a variety of distributed indexing techniques.  SNQP
   has also been found useful elsewhere, even as a query language for a
   single data repository.

   SNQP is defined for US-ASCII only, and use with other character sets
   will require further work.

   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> concludes this document with a description of security
   considerations.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Scenarios"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Scenarios</span>

   This section illustrates the basic SNQP commands by presenting
   several client scenarios.  The scenarios include a new user, a user
   who prefers CCSO style comparisons and more current responses, a
   graphical user interface program, a user with a change of mind, and a
   user worried about costs.  Although SNQP will work for a human client
   on a bare connection (like one provided by telnet), it also works for
   client programs.  Several of these programs have been written and
   provide enhanced interfaces.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20New%20User"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a> New User</span>

   A new SNQP user will first make a tcp connection to an SNQP server.
   For purposes of illustration, we will assume that the user makes the
   connection with the Unix telnet command, and that the server is
   located at nomen.research.bell-labs.com on port 4224. The user enters
   a relation command to discover what relations are available, and an
   attributes command to discover the attributes for a particular
   relation.  The user eventually asks for people with a given name of
   "J*" and a surname of "Ordille" who work for "Lucent Tech*". The
   response is current through June 11, 1996 at 11 p.m. EDT.  Figure 1a
   and Figure 1b provide this scenario.

   A user who is accustomed to CCSO name servers prefers CCSO word-based
   matching within attribute strings.  Each word in the query string for
   an attribute must appear in some order in the response string.  The
   wildcard "*" matches any substring within a word.  The default

   matching, illustrated in Figure 1b, is exact matching of a query
   string.  The query string may include "*" wildcards which match any
   substring within the response string.  Both types of matching are
   case insensitive.

   In Figure 2, the CCSO-style user connects to the SNQP server, enables
   csso matching, and requests some information about Ordille who works
   in research at a lab division of some company.  The request asks for
   information that is more current than June 11, 1996 at 11 p.m. if it
   is available.

   asks for advice on searching for a friend named "Susan Brown".  The
   user can not recall the name of the organization where Susan works,
   but remembers that the state name begins with "I".  The advice
   response lists the locations of the data repositories that will be
   contacted. These locations can be supplied to the SNQP server using
   the "source" attribute.  Each location is followed by a blank and a

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20Commands"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. Commands</span>

   SNQP commands are case insensitive and terminated with a newline &lt;LF&gt;
   or carriage return &lt;CR&gt;.  In the following descriptions, SNQP
   commands are in upper case and SNQP replies are in mixed case.  Items
   in a command list are separated by blanks.

   Most SNQP replies are short.  They have a rely code (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>),
   followed by a continuation character and reply text.  If the
   continuation character is blank, the reply is complete.  If the
   continuation character is a dash ("-"), the reply continues on the
   next line.  Text within the reply can vary, but the reply code
   remains the same.  A two line reply example is given below:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

      nnn-Message1
      nnn Message2

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   In some cases commands or replies may be long, so these
   commands/replies use the '.'-terminated block structure that is used
   for message bodies in SMTP. Blocks are comprised of lines of text
   that constitute the command/reply.  Blocks are terminated with a
   period on a line by itself.

   SNQP generally ignores blank lines in both directions, except that
   blanks lines separate tuples within query response blocks.

   Whenever a time is listed in a command or response, it has the
   format:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM ZZZ

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   where DD is the day, MMM are the first three characters of the month,
   YYYY is the year, HH the hours on a 24 hour clock, MM the minutes,
   and ZZZ the commonly used US timezone abbreviations.  If time zone is
   unspecified in a command, the timezone of the SNQP server is assumed.

   SNQP servers support a source attribute in every relation.  In
   queries, the source attribute directs the SNQP server to a particular
   data repository.  In query responses, the source attribute indicates
   the origin of the information in a tuple.  In advice and error

   messages, the source attribute is provided so the client can contact
   the source in later queries.  The source attribute has two possible
   forms:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   &lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;domain-name&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

   &lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;domain-name&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;tuple-id&gt;

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   &lt;protocol&gt; identifies the protocol used to contact the data
   repository. The data repository can be (was) contacted at &lt;domain-
   name&gt; and &lt;port&gt;.  When present, &lt;tuple-id&gt; identifies a specific
   entry in the data repository.  It is missing when the data repository
   does not have an attribute that uniquely identifies its entries.
   Although the source string is similar to a URL, the protocols listed
   may or may not be supported by World-Wide Web browsers.  An effort
   should be made to keep the protocol identifiers consistent with
   accepted standards, but in the end they are specific to SNQP servers.

   When a connection is established with an SNQP server, the server
   returns the following greeting where &lt;domain-name&gt; is the domain name
   of the server host, e.g.  nomen.research.bell-labs.com,  and
   &lt;service-name&gt; is the name of the service, e.g. Nomenclator:

   The following sections describe each command in detail.  The commands
   are ordered alphabetically.  Typical reply messages are explained
   with each command.  Exceptional error conditions, for example system

   These error replies are documented in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   In all cases, advice disables query searches. When queries are
   submitted, advice is returned about the cost of the query or ways of
   constraining the query further.  There are two forms of the advice
   command.

   The first form of command does not include an attribute name.  When
   an SQL query is processed, the SNQP server returns a list of data
   repositories that it will contact.  It also returns a list of
   attributes that may constrain the query further.  The specific values
   of the attributes will determine whether the query is constrained
   further.  If advice is not available from the server, an error is
   returned.

   The second form of advice includes the name of a relation and the
   name of an attribute in that relation.  SQL queries return a list of
   possible values for the attribute.  The list may be complete, or may
   only include values that are known to constrain the search.  This
   distinction is described further in the query command.  If advice is
   not available on the attribute or the relation or attribute is
   unknown, an error is returned.  When advice is not available on an
   attribute, basic advice and advice on other attributes may be
   available.

   Basic advice and advice for one or more attributes can be enabled
   simultaneously. They are not mutually exclusive.

   The advice command is useful to application programs which present
   lists of alternatives to the user.  A query-form program can enable
   advice for an attribute, submit an empty query, and obtain the list
   of options for the attribute.  The list will indicate whether it is a
   full list of all values for the attribute, or a constraint list of

   only those values known to constrain queries.  The program can use
   full lists to create a selection menu on its query form.  A program

   The attributes command lists the attributes defined for the given
   relation.  Since characteristics of relations may be defined outside
   the SNQP server and cached there, the user may ask for an answer that
   is more recent than &lt;TIME&gt;.  The SNQP server will endeavor to provide
   this information.  The first line of the reply notes the number of
   attributes &lt;n&gt;.  Subsequent lines list the attribute names.  The
   information in the response is current through the time returned, but
   may have changed after that time.  Accepting requests to improve a
   t-bound and indicating the t-bound of the result are optional for
   SNQP servers.

   If the relation is unknown, an error is returned.  If &lt;TIME&gt; is
   submitted when t-bounds are not supported, an error is returned.

   matches words within strings.  Each word in the query string for an
   attribute must appear in some order in the response string.  Words
   are delimited by blank, comma, colon, semi-colon, tab, and newline.
   The wildcard "*" matches any substring within a word.  Both string
   and word comparisons are case insensitive.

      552 Query blocks are limited to one SQL query
      556 T-bounds not supported

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   The query command submits a block of SQL queries to the SNQP server.
   Each SQL query must be terminated with a semi-colon, and the entire
   block is terminated with a line containing a single period.  Special
   characters in query string constants can be included using the C
   language conventions, e.g. "\n" is the newline character.

   Since a variety of cached information can be used in processing the
   SQL queries, the user may ask for answers that are more recent than
   &lt;TIME&gt;.  The SNQP server will endeavor to provide this information.
   Accepting requests to improve a t-bound is optional for SNQP servers.

   If a query command is already in process, the entire block is
   refused.  If multiple SQL queries are submitted in one block to a
   server that does not support multi-query blocks, an error is
   returned.  If &lt;TIME&gt; is submitted when t-bounds are not supported, an
   error is returned.

   Responses are returned in blocks as they arrive from data
   repositories.  Reply 351 begins a response block.  Response blocks
   are terminated with periods.  Tuples are sent within the block as a
   list of attribute name and value pairs:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   &lt;attribute-name&gt;: &lt;attribute-value&gt;
                   : &lt;attribute-value&gt;

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Only the first line of a multi-line attribute returns the
   &lt;attribute-name&gt;.  Successive tuples are separated with blank lines.
   Attributes with null or blank values are suppressed at the option of
   the SNQP server.

   In between response blocks, error replies can be reported.  Replies
   653, 660 and 761 are examples of such errors.  Reply 653 reports a
   communication error with the data repository identified by the source
   location and described by the associated string. Reply 660 reports an
   error returned by a data repository.  Reply 761 reports a known
   requirement of the data repository that the query failed to satisfy.
   Reply 761 reflects comparison of the query with known characteristics
   of the data repository by the SNQP server.  For example, some data
   repositories refuse queries that do not contain a specific subset of
   attributes in the relation.  Other replies are possible.  It is best
   to check the the type and severity of the reply against the theory of
   reply codes in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   When an SQL query in a block is successfully completed, the SNQP
   server sends Reply 352 to indicate that the next query is being
   started.  Reply 352 reports the t-bound of the previous query if it
   is available. Reply 352 is sent even if the previous query terminated
   due to permanent errors.   The one exception is that permanent errors
   generated by the next or stop command supersede Reply 352.

   When all SQL queries are complete, the SNQP server sends Reply 250 to
   indicate that all queries have been processed.  A query block
   containing one query that has no responses will only return Reply
   250.  Reply 250 reports the t-bound of the last SQL query in the
   block if it is available.  Reply 250 is sent even if the last query
   in the block terminated due to permanent errors.   The one exception
   is that permanent errors generated by the stop command supersede
   Reply 352.

   Note that this command follows the convention that "intermediate"
   reply codes, as defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>, are used until the SQL query is
   complete.  Final query completion error codes abort the processing of
   the SQL query.  Examples of these errors include parsing errors
   (Reply 700) and semantic errors (Reply 750) in the SQL query.  The
   SNQP server will attempt to continue with the next query if possible.
   The block of queries will be terminated with Reply 250 or 251 (from
   the stop command) to indicate that another query will be accepted.
   Indicating the t-bound of a query response is optional for SNQP
   servers.

   Different kinds of advice are returned in different blocks.  Basic
   advice about the number, n, of data repositories that will be
   searched is returned with Reply 354.  Subsequent lines list location
   and location description for the data repositories that will be
   searched.  The data repository locations can be supplied to the SNQP
   server using the "source" attribute.  Each location is followed by a
   blank and a descriptive phrase for the data repository.

   Basic advice about the attributes that may constrain the query is
   returned with reply code 355.  The first line of the reply includes
   the number, n, of attributes.  Subsequent lines list the names of the
   attributes.  The specific values of the attribute will determine
   whether the query is constrained further.

   Advice for a particular attribute has two forms.  First, the advice
   may list the n possible values for the attribute in reply 356.  The
   list is complete; no other values for the attribute exist within the
   context of the query.  Second, the advice may list the n values for
   the attribute that are known to constrain the query.  The list is
   incomplete; other values of the attribute may exist within the
   context of the query.

   When advice for an SQL query in a block is successfully completed,
   the SNQP server sends reply 352 to indicate that the next query is
   being started.  Reply 352 reports the t-bound of the advice for the
   previous query if it is available. Reply 352 is sent even if the
   previous query terminated due to permanent errors.   The one
   exception is that permanent errors generated by the next or stop
   command supersede Reply 352.

   When all SQL queries are complete, the SNQP server sends Reply 250 to
   indicate that all queries have been processed.  Reply 250 reports the
   t-bound of the last SQL query in the block if it is available.  Reply
   250 is sent even if the last query in the block terminated due to
   permanent errors.   The one exception is that permanent errors
   generated by the stop command supersede Reply 352.

   Final query completion error codes abort the processing of the SQL

   In some cases commands or replies may be long, so these
   commands/replies use the '.'-terminated block structure that is used
   for message bodies in SMTP. Blocks are comprised of lines of text
   that constitute the command/reply.  Blocks are terminated with a
   period on a line by itself.

   The theory of reply codes explained for SMTP in <a href="rfc821.html">RFC-821</a> is used here.
   Table 2 defines the reply code structure.  Reply codes are three
   digits, xyz.  The x digit indicates the command status.  The y digit
   indicates the component of the system that generated the reply.  The
   z digit allows for further distinctions within replies from the same
   component.

   The GUI-related reply codes are only used if the server has been
   informed that it is communicating with a graphical user interface,
   via the imagui command.   For such codes in the x3z space, digit "z"
   takes on the role of digit "y" in other codes. I.e. 735 are permanent
   negative intermediate replies about the query resolver.

   Table 4 lists the defined GUI reply codes.  Text messages for the
   reply codes may vary.  The codes are sorted numerically.  An
   explanation of the codes follows the table.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

      331 nnnnnnn! &lt;message&gt;
      331 nnnnnnn.mmmmmm &lt;message&gt;
      331 nnnnnnn-mmmmmm &lt;message&gt;

      735 nnnnnnnammmmmm e &lt;semantic error message&gt;
      340 &lt;status&gt;

                        Table 4: GUI Reply Codes

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   In Table 4, nnnnnnn is the line number in a query block, and mmmmmm
   is the column in the line.  Both numbers begin counting with 1.  The
   exclamation point response directs the program to list information
   after line n.  The period response directs the program to break line
   n at column m.  The hyphen response directs the program to flag line
   n at column m.  Replies 730 and 735 direct the GUI to indicate the
   parsing or semantic error at line n, column m.  Response 340 provides
   status information that can be displayed immediately in the GUI's
   status line.  A sample status message is one that indicates which
   data repository is being contacted.

   SQL queries may often have more functionality then a server supports
   or an application demands.  Moreover, query blocks larger than one
   SQL query, advice on query costs, some types of comparison operations
   or t-bounds need not be supported by a particular server.  SNQP
   defines a minimal subset of functionality for a working SNQP
   protocol.  Functionality beyond this subset is optional.  Servers
   that do not support optional functionality must return replies that
   indicate this to the user.

   Table 5 lists the minimum functionality for an SNQP server.

      Command       Limitations
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      advice        Not supported.
      attributes    List the attributes for a relation.
      compare       List type of comparison operation.  At least
                    one of CCSO and default comparison types must
                    be supported.  Wildcards in SQL query strings
                    can be rejected by the query command with an
                    appropriate semantic error message.
      help          Explain the available SNQP commands.
      imagui        Not supported.
      next          Not supported.
      noadvice      Supported, but has no effect since advice
                    is not supported.
      noimagui      Supported, but has no effect since imagui
                    is not supported.
      query         Submit a block containing one SQL query statement.
                    The minimum supported SQL query statement is
                    a selection query that performs equality
                    comparisons between attribute values and
                    constant strings.  Conjunctions of such comparisons
                    are supported.  The minimum SQL query does not allow
                    projections, but returns all the attributes
                    for matching tuples.
      relations     List the relations available through the SNQP
                    server.
      stop          End processing of current query.
      quit          Terminate the query session.

   SNQP clients and servers depend on the Domain Name Service.  They are
   subject to all the security issues that arise in that context.  This
   version of the SNQP protocol does not define procedures for
   protecting the information communicated to and from an SNQP server.
