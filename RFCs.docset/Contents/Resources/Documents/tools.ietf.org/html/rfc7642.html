<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document provides the SCIM definitions, overview, concepts,
   flows, scenarios, and use cases.  It also provides a list of the
   requirements derived from the use cases.

   The document's objective is to help with understanding of the design
   and applicability of the SCIM schema [<a href="rfc7643.html" title='"System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Core Schema"'>RFC7643</a>] and SCIM protocol
   [<a href="rfc7644.html" title='"System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Protocol"'>RFC7644</a>].

   Unlike the practice of some protocols like Application Bridging for
   Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) and SAML2 WebSSO, SCIM provides
   provisioning and de-provisioning of resources in a separate context
   from authentication (aka just-in-time provisioning).

   o  SCIM: System for Cross-domain Identity Management

   o  SSO: Single Sign-On

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20SCIM%20User%20Scenarios"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  SCIM User Scenarios</span>

   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
   is designed to manage user identity in cloud-based applications and
   services in a standardized way to enable interoperability, security,
   and scalability.  The specification suite seeks to build upon
   experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific
   emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying
   existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models.  The
   intent of the SCIM specification is to reduce the cost and complexity
   of user management operations by providing a common user schema and
   extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for
   exchanging this schema using standard protocols.  In essence, make it
   fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the
   cloud.

   The SCIM scenarios are overviews of user stories designed to help
   clarify the intended scope of the SCIM effort.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Model%20Concepts"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Model Concepts</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.1.%20%20Triggers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" name="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  Triggers</span>

   Quite simply, triggers are actions or activities that start SCIM
   flows.  Triggers may not be relevant at the protocol level or the
   schema level; they really serve to help identify the type or activity
   that resulted in a SCIM protocol exchange.  Triggers make use of the
   traditional provisioning CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   operations but add additional use-case contexts like SSO (Single-Sign
   On) as it is designed to capture a class of use case that makes sense
   to the actor requesting it rather than to describe a protocol
   operation.

   o  Create SCIM Identity Resource - Service On-boarding Trigger: A
      "create SCIM identity resource" trigger is a service on-boarding
      activity in which a business action such as a new hire or new
      service subscription is initiated by one of the SCIM Actors.  In
      the protocol itself, service on-boarding may well be implemented
      via the same resource PUT method as a service change.  This is
      particular to the implementation, and not to the use cases that
      drive that implementation.

   o  Update SCIM Identity Resource - Service Change Trigger: An "update
      SCIM identity resource" trigger is a service change activity as a
      result of an identity moving or changing its service level.  An
      "update SCIM identity" trigger might be the result of a change in
      a service subscription level or a change to key identity data used
      to denote a service subscription level.  Password changes are
      specifically called out from other more general identity attribute
      changes as they are considered to have specific use-case
      differences.

   o  Delete SCIM Identity Resource - Service Termination Trigger: A
      "delete SCIM identity resource" trigger represents a specific and
      deliberate action to remove an identity from a given SCIM service
      point.  At this stage, it is unclear if the SCIM protocol needs to
      identify a separate protocol exchange for service suspension
      actions.  This may be relevant as target services usually
      differentiate between these results and thus may require separate
      resource representations.

   o  Single Sign-On (SSO) Trigger - Service Access Request: A "Single
      Sign-On" trigger is a special class of activity in which a Create
      or Update trigger is initiated during an SSO operational flow.
      The implication here is that, as the result of a service access
      request by the end user (SSO), defined SCIM protocol exchanges can
      be used to initiate SCIM resource CRUD operations somewhere in the
      service cloud.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.2.%20%20Actors"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2" name="section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  Actors</span>

   Actors are the operating parties that take part in both sides of a
   SCIM protocol exchange and help identify the source of a given
   Trigger.  So far, we have identified the following SCIM Actors:

   o  Cloud Service Provider (CSP): A CSP is the entity operating a
      given cloud service.  In a SaaS scenario, this is simply the
      application provider.  In an IaaS or PaaS scenario, the CSP may be
      the underlying IaaS/PaaS infrastructure provider or the owner of
      the application running on that platform.  In all cases, the CSP
      is the thing that holds the identity information being operated
      upon.  Put another way, the CSP really is the service that the end
      user interacts with.

   o  Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS): An ECS represents a middle tier
      of aggregation for related identity records.  In one of our sample
      enterprise SaaS scenarios, the ECS is "Example.com" that
      subscribes to a cloud-based CRM service "SaaS-CRM Inc." (the CSP)
      for all of its sales staff.  The actual Cloud Service Users (CSUs)
      are the FooBar Inc. sales staff.  The ECS Actor is identified to

      help capture use cases in which a single entity is given
      administrative responsibility for other identity accounts.  SCIM
      may not address the configuration and setup of an ECS within the
      CSP, but it does address use cases in which SCIM identity
      resources are grouped together and administered as part of some
      broader agreement or operational exchange.

   o  Cloud Service User (CSU): A CSU represents the real cloud service
      end user -- i.e., the person logging into and using the cloud
      service.  As described above, and ECS will typically own or manage
      multiple CSU identities, whereas the CSU represents the FooBar
      Inc. employee using the cloud service to manage their CRM process.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.3.%20%20Modes%20and%20Flows"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.3" name="section-2.2.3">2.2.3</a>.  Modes and Flows</span>

   Modes identify the functional intent of a data flow initiated in a
   SCIM scenario.  The modes identified so far are 'Push' and 'Pull'
   referring to pushing data to and pulling data from an authoritative
   identity data store.









<span class="grey">LI, et al.                    Informational                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

   In the SCIM scenarios, modes are often used in the context of a flow
   between two Actors.  For example, one might refer to a Cloud-to-Cloud
   Pull exchange.  Here one Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is pulling
   identity information from another CSP.  Commonly referenced flows
   are:

   o  Cloud Service Provider to Cloud Service Provider (CSP-&gt;CSP)

   o  Enterprise Cloud Subscriber to Cloud Service Provider (ECS-&gt;CSP)

   Modes and flows simply help us understand what is taking place; they
   are likely to be technically meaningless at the protocol level, but
   they help the reader follow the SCIM scenarios and apply them to
   real-world use cases.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.4.%20%20Bulk%20and%20Batch%20Operational%20Semantics"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.4" name="section-2.2.4">2.2.4</a>.  Bulk and Batch Operational Semantics</span>

   It is assumed that each of the trigger actions outlined in this
   document may be part of the larger bulk or batch operation.
   Individual SCIM actions should be able to be collected together to
   create single protocol exchanges.

   The initial focus of SCIM scenarios is on identifying base flows and
   single operations.  The specific complexity of full bulk and batch
   operations is left to a later version of the scenarios or to the main
   specification.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.%20%20Flows%20from%20Cloud%20Service%20Provider%20to%20Cloud%20Service%20Provider"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Flows from Cloud Service Provider to Cloud Service Provider</span>
      (CSP-&gt;CSP)

   These scenarios represent flows between two Cloud Service Providers
   (CSPs).  It is assumed that each CSP maintains an Identity Data Store
   for its Cloud Service Users (CSUs).  These scenarios address various
   joiner, mover, leaver, and JIT triggers, resulting in push and pull
   data exchanges between the CSPs.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.1.%20%20CSP-%3ECSP%3A%20Create%20Identity%20%28Push%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.1" name="section-2.3.1">2.3.1</a>.  CSP-&gt;CSP: Create Identity (Push)</span>

   In this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service
   agreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User
   (CSU) accounts.  CSP-1 receives a Create Identity trigger action from
   its Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1).  CSP-1 creates a local user
   account for the new CSU.  CSP-1 then pushes the new CSU joiner push
   request downstream to CSU-2 and gets confirmation that the account
   was successfully created.  After receiving the confirmation from CSP-
   2, CSP-1 sends an acknowledgment to the requesting ECS.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.2.%20%20CSP-%3ECSP%3A%20Update%20Identity%20%28Push%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.2" name="section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a>.  CSP-&gt;CSP: Update Identity (Push)</span>

   In this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service
   agreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User
   (CSU) accounts.  The Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) has already
   created an account with CSP-1 and supplied a critical attribute
   "department" that is used by CSP-1 to drive service options.  CSP-1
   then receives an Update Identity trigger action from its Enterprise
   Cloud Subscriber (ECS).  CSP-1 updates its local directory account
   with the new department value.  CSP-1 then initiates a separate SCIM
   protocol exchange to push the mover change request downstream to CSP-
   2.  After receiving the confirmation from CSP-2, CSP-1 sends an
   acknowledgment to ECS-1.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.3.%20%20CSP-%3ECSP%3A%20Delete%20Identity%20%28Push%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.3" name="section-2.3.3">2.3.3</a>.  CSP-&gt;CSP: Delete Identity (Push)</span>

   In this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service
   agreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User
   (CSU) accounts.  CSP-1 receives a Delete Identity trigger action from
   its Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1).  CSP-1 suspends the local
   directory account for the specified CSU account.  CSP-1 then pushes a
   termination request for the specified CSU account downstream to CSP-2
   and gets confirmation that the account was successfully removed.
   After receiving the confirmation from CSP-2, CSP-1 finalizes the
   deletion operation and sends an acknowledgment to the requesting ECS.

   This use case highlights how different CSPs may implement different
   operational semantics behind the same SCIM operation.  Note CSP-1
   suspends the account representation for its service, whereas CPS-2
   implements a true delete operation.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.4.%20%20CSP-%3ECSP%3A%20SSO%20Trigger%20%28Push%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.4" name="section-2.3.4">2.3.4</a>.  CSP-&gt;CSP: SSO Trigger (Push)</span>

   In this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service
   agreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User
   (CSU) accounts.  However, rather than pre-provisioning accounts from
   CSP-1 to CSP-2, CSP-1 waits for a service access request from the end
   Cloud Service User (CSU-1) before issuing account creation details to
   CSP-2.  When the CSU completes a SSO transaction from CSP-1 to CSP-2,
   CSP-2 then creates an account for the CSU based on information pushed
   to it from CSP-1.

   At the protocol level, this class of scenarios may result in the use
   of common protocol exchange patterns between CSP-1 and CSP-2.

   In this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service
   agreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User
   (CSU) accounts.  However, rather than pre-provisioning accounts from
   CSP-1 to CSP-2, CSP-2 waits for a service access request from the
   Cloud Service User (CSU-1) before initiating a Pull request to gather
   information about the CSU sufficient to create a local account.

   At the protocol level, this class of scenarios may result in the use
   of common protocol exchange patterns between CSP-2 and CSP-1.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.6.%20%20CSP-%3ECSP%3A%20Password%20Reset%20%28Push%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.6" name="section-2.3.6">2.3.6</a>.  CSP-&gt;CSP: Password Reset (Push)</span>

   In this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service
   agreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User
   (CSU) accounts.  CSP-1 wants to change the password for a specific
   Cloud Service User (CSU-1).  CSP-1 sends a request to CSP-2 to reset
   the password value for CSU-1.

   At the protocol level, this scenario may result in the same protocol
   exchange as any other attribute change request.

Flows from Enterprise Cloud Subscriber to Cloud Service Provider</span>
      (ECS-&gt;CSP)

   These scenarios represent flows between an Enterprise Cloud
   Subscriber (ECS) and a Cloud Service Providers (CSP).  It is assumed
   that the ECS and the CSP each maintain an information access service
   for the relevant Cloud Service Users (CSUs).  These scenarios address
   various joiner, mover, leaver, and JIT triggers, resulting in push
   and pull data exchanges between the ECS and the CSP.

   Many of these scenarios are very similar to those defined in
   <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>.  They are identified separately here so that we may
   explore any differences that might emerge.

   In this scenario, an Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) maintains a
   service with a Cloud Service Provider (CSP-1) that requires the
   sharing of various Cloud Service User (CSU) accounts.  A new user
   joins ECS-1 and so ECS-1 pushes an account creation request to CSP-1,
   supplying all required attribute values for the base SCIM schema and
   additional values for the extended SCIM schema as required.

   In this scenario, an Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) maintains a
   service with Cloud Service Provider (CSP-1) that drives service
   definition from a key account schema attribute called Department.
   ECS-1 wishes to move a given CSU from Department A to Department B
   and so it pushes an attribute update request to the CSP.

   In this scenario, an Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) maintains a
   service with a Cloud Service Provider (CSP-1).  Upon termination of
   one of its employee's employment agreement, ECS-1 sends a suspend
   account request to CSP-1.  One week later, the ECS wishes to complete
   the process by fully removing the Cloud Service User (CSU) account,
   so it sends a terminate account request to CSP-1.

   In this scenario, an Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) maintains a
   service with a Cloud Service Provider (CSP-1).  No accounts are
   created or exchanged in advance.  However, rather than pre-
   provisioning accounts from ECS-1 to CSP-1, CSP-1 waits for a service
   access request from the Cloud Service User (CSU-1) under the control
   domain of ECS-1, before issuing an account Pull request to ECS-1.

   Description:

   A company SomeEnterprise runs an application ManageThem that relies
   on the identity information about its employees (e.g., identifiers,
   attributes).  The identity information is stored at the cloud
   provided by SomeCSP.  SomeEnterprise has decided to move identity
   information to the cloud of a different provider -- AnotherCSP.  In
   addition, SomeEnterprise has purchased a second application
   ManageThemMore, which also relies on the identity information.
   SomeEnterprise is able to move identity information to AnotherCSP
   without changing the format of identity information.  The application
   ManageThemMore is able to use the identity information.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  SomeCSP is a cloud service provider for SomeEnterprise.

   Description:

   An end user has an account in a directory service A with one or more
   attributes.  That user then visits the website of relying party B,
   and the website requires attributes of the user.  The user selects
   some attributes and authorizes the transfer of data via authorization
   protocols (e.g., OAuth, SAML), so selected attributes of the user are
   transferred from the user's account in directory service A to the
   website of replying party B at the time of the user's first visit to
   that site.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  User has an account in directory service A.

   o  User has one or more attributes.

   o  User visits website of relying party B.

   Post-conditions:

   Selected attributes of the user are transferred from the user's
   account in directory service A to the website of relying party B at
   the time of the user's first visit to that site.

   Requirements:

   o  Relying party B must be able to authenticate the end user.

   o  Relying party B must be able to securely provide the
      authentication results to directory service A.

   o  Directory service A must be able to securely provide end user's

   o  Regulatory requirements shall be met when migrating identity
      information between jurisdictional regions (e.g., countries and
      states may have differing regulations on privacy).

   o  Relying parties have to be aware of changes to their cached copy,
      as these would potentially cause a state change in other relying
      parties.

   o  A maximum period should be set for the relying party to cache the
      information.

   Description:

   An end user has an account in a directory service A with one or more
   attributes.  That user then visits the web site of relying party B.
   The website of relying party B queries directory service A for
   attributes associated with that user, and related resources.

   The attributes of the user change later in directory service A.  For
   example, the attributes might change if the user changes their name,
   has their account disabled, or terminates their relationship with
   directory service A.  Furthermore, other resources and their
   attributes might also change.  The directory service A then wishes to
   notify the website of relying party B of these changes, as relying
   party B might (or might not) have a cache of those attributes, and if
   relying party B were aware of these changes to their cached copy, it
   would potentially cause a state change in relying party B.

   The volume of changes, however, might be substantial, and only some
   of the changes may be of interest to relying party B, so directory
   service A does not wish to "push" all the changes to B.  Instead,
   directory service A wishes to notify B that there are changes
   potentially of interest, such that B can at an appropriate time
   subsequently contact directory service A and retrieve just the subset
   of changes of interest to B.

   Note that the user must authorize directory service A to transfer
   data to the website, and the user must authorize directory service A
   to notify the website.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  User has an account in directory service A.

   o  User has one or more attributes.

   o  User visits the website of relying party B.

   o  The resource being updated is at the website.

   Post-conditions:

   Directory service A is able to notify relying party B that there are
   changes potentially of interest.

   Requirements:

   o  Relying party B must be able to authenticate the end user.

   o  Relying party B must be able to securely provide the
      authentication results to directory service A.

   o  Directory service A must be able to securely provide end user's
      changed identity information (e.g., attributes) to relying party
      B.

   o  Relying party B must be able at an appropriate time to

   Authentication and authorization must be guaranteed for the SCIM
   operations to ensure that only authenticated entities can perform the
   SCIM requests and the requested SCIM operations are authorized.

   SCIM resources (e.g., Users and Groups) can contain sensitive
   information.  Thus, data confidentiality MUST be guaranteed at the
   transport layer.

   There can be privacy issues that go beyond transport security, e.g.,
   moving personally identifying information (PII) offshore between
   CSPs.  Regulatory requirements shall be met when migrating identity
   information between jurisdictional regions (e.g., countries and
   states may have differing regulations on privacy).

   Additionally, privacy-sensitive data elements may be omitted or
   obscured in SCIM transactions or stored records to protect these data
   elements for a user.  For instance, a role-based identifier might be
   used in place of an individual's name.

   Detailed security considerations are specified in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> of the
   SCIM protocol [<a href="rfc7644.html" title='"System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Protocol"'>RFC7644</a>] and <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> of the SCIM schema [<a href="rfc7643.html" title='"System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Core Schema"'>RFC7643</a>].
