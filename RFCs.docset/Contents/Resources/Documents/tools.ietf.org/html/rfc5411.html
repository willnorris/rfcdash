Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the subject of numerous
   specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can be
   difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the set
   of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  This specification serves
   as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It lists a current snapshot of the
   specifications under the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and
   groups them into categories.

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [<a href="rfc3261.html" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] is the subject of
   numerous specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can
   be difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the
   set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  "Don't Panic!"  [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>]
   This specification serves as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It is a
   current snapshot of the specifications under the SIP umbrella at the
   time of publication.  It is anticipated that this document itself
   will be regularly updated as SIP specifications mature.  Furthermore,
   it references many specifications, which, at the time of publication
   of this document, were not yet finalized, and may eventually be
   completed or abandoned.  Therefore, the enumeration of specifications
   here is a work-in-progress and subject to change.

   For each specification, a paragraph or so description is included
   that summarizes the purpose of the specification.  Each specification
   also includes a letter that designates its category in the Standards
   Track [<a href="rfc2026.html" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>].  These values are:

   S: Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or Standard)

   E: Experimental

   B: Best Current Practice

   I: Informational

   The specifications are grouped together by topic.  The topics are:

   Core:  The SIP specifications that are expected to be utilized for
      each session or registration an endpoint participates in.

   Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Interop:  Specifications
      related to interworking with the telephone network.

   General Purpose Infrastructure:  General purpose extensions to SIP,
      SDP (Session Description Protocol), and MIME, but ones that are
      not expected to always be used.

   NAT Traversal:  Specifications to deal with firewall and NAT
      traversal.

   Call Control Primitives:  Specifications for manipulating SIP dialogs
      and calls.

   Event Framework:  Definitions of the core specifications for the SIP
      event framework, providing for pub/sub capability.

   Event Packages:  Packages that utilize the SIP event framework.

   Quality of Service:  Specifications related to multimedia quality of
      service (QoS).

   Operations and Management:  Specifications related to configuration
      and monitoring of SIP deployments.

   SIP Compression:  Specifications to facilitate usage of SIP with the
      Signaling Compression (Sigcomp) framework.

   SIP Service URIs:  Specifications on how to use SIP URIs to address
      multimedia services.

   Minor Extensions:  Specifications that solve a narrow problem space
      or provide an optimization.

   Security Mechanisms:  Specifications providing security functionality
      for SIP.

   Conferencing:  Specifications for multimedia conferencing.

   Instant Messaging, Presence, and Multimedia:  SIP extensions related
      to IM, presence, and multimedia.  This covers only the SIP
      extensions related to these topics.  See [<a href="#ref-SIMPLE" title='"SIMPLE made Simple: An Overview of the IETF Specifications for Instant Messaging and Presence using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>SIMPLE</a>] for a full
      treatment of SIP for IM and Presence (SIMPLE).

   Emergency Services:  SIP extensions related to emergency services.
      See [<a href="#ref-ECRIT-FRAME" title='"Framework for Emergency Calling using Internet Multimedia"'>ECRIT-FRAME</a>] for a more complete treatment of additional
      functionality related to emergency services.

   Typically, SIP extensions fit naturally into topic areas, and
   implementors interested in a particular topic often implement many or
   all of the specifications in that area.  There are some
   specifications that fall into multiple topic areas, in which case
   they are listed more than once.

   Do not print all the specs cited here at once, as they might share
   the fate of the rules of Brockian Ultracricket when bound together:
   collapse under their own gravity and form a black hole [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>].

   This document itself is not an update to <a href="rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a> or an extension to
   SIP.  It is an informational document, meant to guide newcomers,
   implementors, and deployers to the many specifications associated
   with SIP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Scope%20of%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Scope of This Document</span>

   It is very difficult to enumerate the set of SIP specifications.
   This is because there are many protocols that are intimately related
   to SIP and used by nearly all SIP implementations, but are not
   formally SIP extensions.  As such, this document formally defines a
   "SIP specification" as:

   o  <a href="rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a> and any specification that defines an extension to it,
      where an extension is a mechanism that changes or updates in some
      way a behavior specified there.

   o  The basic SDP specification [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] and any specification that
      defines an extension to SDP whose primary purpose is to support
      SIP.

   o  Any specification that defines a MIME object whose primary purpose
      is to support SIP.

   Practices are included when they normatively define mechanisms for
   accomplishing a task, or provide significant description of the usage
   of the normative specifications, such as call flows.

   The SIP change process [<a href="rfc3427.html" title='"Change Process for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3427</a>] defines two types of extensions to
   SIP: normal extensions and the so-called P-headers (where P stands
   for "preliminary", "private", or "proprietary", and the "P-" prefix
   is included in the header field name), which are meant to be used in
   areas of limited applicability.  P-headers cannot be defined in the
   Standards Track.  For the most part, P-headers are not included in
   the listing here, with the exception of those that have seen general
   usage despite their P-header status.

   This document includes specifications, which have already been
   approved by the IETF and granted an RFC number, in addition to
   Internet Drafts, which are still under development within the IETF
   and will eventually finish and get an RFC number.  Inclusion of
   Internet Drafts here helps encourage early implementation and
   demonstrations of interoperability of the protocol, and thus aids in
   the standards-setting process.  Inclusion of these also identifies
   where the IETF is targeting a solution at a particular problem space.
   Note that final IANA assignment of codepoints (such as option tags
   and header field names) does not take place until shortly before
   publication as an RFC, and thus codepoint assignments may change.

   The core SIP specifications represent the set of specifications whose
   functionality is broadly applicable.  An extension is broadly
   applicable if it fits into one of the following categories:

   o  For specifications that impact SIP session management, the
      extension would be used for almost every session initiated by a
      user agent.

   o  For specifications that impact SIP registrations, the extension
      would be used for almost every registration initiated by a user
      agent.

   o  For specifications that impact SIP subscriptions, the extension
      would be used for almost every subscription initiated by a user
      agent.

   In other words, these are not specifications that are used just for
   some requests and not others; they are specifications that would
   apply to each and every request for which the extension is relevant.
   In the galaxy of SIP, these specifications are like towels [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>].

   <a href="rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a>, The Session Initiation Protocol (S):  [<a href="rfc3261.html" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] is the core

      president of the galaxy [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>] as far as the suite of SIP
      specifications is concerned.

   <a href="rfc3263.html">RFC 3263</a>, Locating SIP Servers (S):  [<a href="rfc3263.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP Servers"'>RFC3263</a>] provides DNS
      procedures for taking a SIP URI and determining a SIP server that
      is associated with that SIP URI.  <a href="rfc3263.html">RFC 3263</a> is essential for any
      implementation using SIP with DNS.  <a href="rfc3263.html">RFC 3263</a> makes use of both DNS
      SRV records [<a href="rfc2782.html" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC2782</a>] and NAPTR records [<a href="rfc3401.html" title='"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS"'>RFC3401</a>].

   <a href="rfc3264.html">RFC 3264</a>, An Offer/Answer Model with the Session Description Protocol
      (S):  [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] defines how the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
      [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] is used with SIP to negotiate the parameters of a media
      session.  It is in widespread usage and an integral part of the
      behavior of <a href="rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a>.

   <a href="rfc3265.html">RFC 3265</a>, SIP-Specific Event Notification (S):  [<a href="rfc3265.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)- Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>] defines the
      SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods.  These two methods provide a general
      event notification framework for SIP.  To actually use the
      framework, extensions need to be defined for specific event
      packages.  An event package defines a schema for the event data
      and describes other aspects of event processing specific to that
      schema.  An <a href="rfc3265.html">RFC 3265</a> implementation is required when any event
      package is used.

   <a href="rfc3325.html">RFC 3325</a>, Private Extensions to SIP for Asserted Identity within
      Trusted Networks (I):  Though its P-header status implies that it
      has limited applicability, [<a href="rfc3325.html" title='"Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks"'>RFC3325</a>], which defines the
      P-Asserted-Identity header field, has been widely deployed.  It is
      used as the basic mechanism for providing network-asserted caller
      ID services.  Its intended update, [<a href="#ref-UPDATE-PAI" title='"Updates to Asserted Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>UPDATE-PAI</a>], clarifies its
      usage for connected party identification as well.

   <a href="rfc3327.html">RFC 3327</a>, SIP Extension Header Field for Registering Non-Adjacent
      Contacts (S):  [<a href="rfc3327.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension Header Field for Registering Non-Adjacent Contacts"'>RFC3327</a>] defines the Path header field.  This
      field is inserted by proxies between a client and their registrar.
      It allows inbound requests towards that client to traverse these
      proxies prior to being delivered to the user agent.  It is
      essential in any SIP deployment that has edge proxies, which are
      proxies between the client and the home proxy or SIP registrar.

      [<a href="rfc3581.html" title='"An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Symmetric Response Routing"'>RFC3581</a>] defines the rport parameter of the Via header.  It
      allows SIP responses to traverse NAT.  It is one of several
      specifications that are utilized for NAT traversal (see

      defines a mechanism for carrying capability information about a
      user agent in REGISTER requests and in dialog-forming requests
      like INVITE.  It has found use with conferencing (the isfocus
      parameter declares that a user agent is a conference server) and
      with applications like push-to-talk.

   <a href="rfc4320.html">RFC 4320</a>, Actions Addressing Issues Identified with the Non-INVITE
      Transaction in SIP (S):  [<a href="rfc4320.html" title="&quot;Actions Addressing Identified Issues with the Session Initiation Protocol's (SIP) Non- INVITE Transaction&quot;">RFC4320</a>] formally updates <a href="rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a> and
      modifies some of the behaviors associated with non-INVITE
      transactions.  This addresses some problems found in timeout and
      failure cases.

   <a href="rfc4474.html">RFC 4474</a>, Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in SIP
      (S):  [<a href="rfc4474.html" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>] defines a mechanism for providing a
      cryptographically verifiable identity of the calling party in a
      SIP request.  Known as "SIP Identity", this mechanism provides an
      alternative to <a href="rfc3325.html">RFC 3325</a>.  It has seen little deployment so far,
      but its importance as a key construct for anti-spam techniques and
      new security mechanisms makes it a core part of the SIP
      specifications.

   GRUU, Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent Identifiers
      (GRUU) in SIP (S):  [<a href="#ref-GRUU" title='"Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>GRUU</a>] defines a mechanism for directing
      requests towards a specific UA instance.  GRUU is essential for

      traversal story.

   OUTBOUND, Managing Client Initiated Connections through SIP (S):
      [<a href="#ref-OUTBOUND" title='"Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>OUTBOUND</a>], also known as SIP outbound, defines important changes
      to the SIP registration mechanism that enable delivery of SIP

      is the cornerstone of the SIP NAT traversal strategy.

   <a href="rfc4566.html">RFC 4566</a>, Session Description Protocol (S):  [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] defines a

      model, are used to negotiate the media characteristics of a
      session between users.

   SDP-CAP, SDP Capability Negotiation (S):  [<a href="#ref-SDP-CAP" title='"SDP Capability Negotiation"'>SDP-CAP</a>] defines a set of
      extensions to SDP that allows for capability negotiation within
      SDP.  Capability negotiation can be used to select between
      different profiles of RTP (secure vs. unsecure) or to negotiate
      codecs such that an agent has to select one amongst a set of
      supported codecs.

   ICE, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) (S):  [<a href="#ref-ICE" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>ICE</a>] defines
      a technique for NAT traversal of media sessions for protocols that
      make use of the offer/answer model.  This specification is the
      IETF-recommended mechanism for NAT traversal for SIP media
      streams, and is meant to be used even by endpoints that are
      themselves never behind a NAT.  A SIP option tag and media feature
      tag [<a href="#ref-OPTION-TAG" title='"Indicating Support for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>OPTION-TAG</a>] (also a core specification) have been defined for
      use with ICE.

   <a href="rfc3605.html">RFC 3605</a>, Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) Attribute in the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP) (S):  [<a href="rfc3605.html" title='"Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) attribute in Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3605</a>] defines a way to
      explicitly signal, within an SDP message, the IP address and port
      for RTCP, rather than using the port+1 rule in the Real Time
      Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  It is needed for devices
      behind NAT, and the specification is required by ICE.

   <a href="rfc4916.html">RFC 4916</a>, Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
      (S):  [<a href="rfc4916.html" title='"Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4916</a>] formally updates <a href="rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a>.  It defines an
      extension to SIP that allows a calling user to determine the
      identity of the final called user (connected party).  Due to
      forwarding and retargeting services, this may not be the same as
      the user that the caller was originally trying to reach.  The
      mechanism works in tandem with the SIP identity specification
      [<a href="rfc4474.html" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>] to provide signatures over the connected party identity.
      It can also be used if a party identity changes mid-call due to
      third-party call control actions or PSTN behavior.

      method for SIP.  This method is meant as a means for updating
      session information prior to the completion of the initial INVITE
      transaction.  It can also be used to update other information,
      such as the identity of the participant [<a href="rfc4916.html" title='"Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4916</a>], without
      involving an updated offer/answer exchange.  It was developed
      initially to support [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>], but has found other uses.  In
      particular, its usage with <a href="rfc4916.html">RFC 4916</a> means it will typically be
      used as part of every session, to convey a secure, connected
      identity.

      It revises the processing of the SIPS URI, originally defined in

   Numerous extensions and usages of SIP are related to interoperability
   and communications with or through the PSTN.

   <a href="rfc2848.html">RFC 2848</a>, The PINT Service Protocol (S):  [<a href="rfc2848.html" title='"The PINT Service Protocol: Extensions to SIP and SDP for IP Access to Telephone Call Services"'>RFC2848</a>] is one of the
      earliest extensions to SIP.  It defines procedures for using SIP
      to invoke services that actually execute on the PSTN.  Its main
      application is for third-party call control, allowing an IP host
      to set up a call between two PSTN endpoints.  PINT (PSTN/Internet
      Interworking) has a relatively narrow focus and has not seen
      widespread deployment.

   <a href="rfc3910.html">RFC 3910</a>, The SPIRITS Protocol (S):  Continuing the trend of naming
      PSTN-related extensions with alcohol references, SPIRITS (Services
      in PSTN Requesting Internet Services) [<a href="rfc3910.html" title='"The SPIRITS (Services in PSTN requesting Internet Services) Protocol"'>RFC3910</a>] defines the
      inverse of PINT.  It allows a switch in the PSTN to ask an IP
      element how to proceed with call waiting.  It was developed
      primarily to support Internet Call Waiting (ICW).  Perhaps the
      next specification will be called the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster
      [<a href="#ref-HGTTG" title="&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;">HGTTG</a>].

   <a href="rfc3372.html">RFC 3372</a>, SIP for Telephones (SIP-T): Context and Architectures (I):
      SIP-T [<a href="rfc3372.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol for Telephones (SIP-T): Context and Architectures"'>RFC3372</a>] defines a mechanism for using SIP between pairs of
      PSTN gateways.  Its essential idea is to tunnel ISDN User Part
      (ISUP) signaling between the gateways in the body of SIP messages.
      SIP-T motivated the development of INFO [<a href="rfc2976.html" title='"The SIP INFO Method"'>RFC2976</a>].  SIP-T has seen
      widespread implementation for the limited deployment model that it
      addresses.  As ISUP endpoints disappear from the network, the need
      for this mechanism will decrease.

      protocol mapping from the SS7 ISDN User Part (ISUP) signaling to
      SIP.  It is widely used in SS7 to SIP gateways and is part of the
      SIP-T framework.

      and QSIG (B):  [<a href="rfc4497.html" title='"Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and QSIG"'>RFC4497</a>] defines how to do protocol mapping from

      defines a mechanism to map overlap dialing into SIP.  This
      specification is widely regarded as the ugliest SIP specification,
      as the introduction to the specification itself advises that it
      has many problems.  Overlap signaling (the practice of sending
      digits into the network as dialed instead of waiting for complete
      collection of the called party number) is largely incompatible
      with SIP at some fairly fundamental levels.  That said, <a href="rfc3578.html">RFC 3578</a>
      is mostly harmless and has seen some usage.

      defines some guidelines for handling early media -- the practice
      of sending media from the called party or an application server
      towards the caller prior to acceptance of the call.  Early media
      is often generated from the PSTN.  Early media is a complex topic,
      and this specification does not fully address the problems
      associated with it.

   <a href="rfc3959.html">RFC 3959</a>, Early Session Disposition Type for the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP) (S):  [<a href="rfc3959.html" title='"The Early Session Disposition Type for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3959</a>] defines a new session disposition
      type for use with early media.  It indicates that the SDP in the
      body is for a special early media session.  This has seen little
      usage.

   <a href="rfc3204.html">RFC 3204</a>, MIME Media Types for ISUP and QSIG Objects (S):  [<a href="rfc3204.html" title='"MIME media types for ISUP and QSIG Objects"'>RFC3204</a>]

      messages.  SS7 signaling messages are carried in the body of SIP
      messages when SIP-T is used.  QSIG signaling messages can be
      carried in a similar way.

   These extensions are general purpose enhancements to SIP, SDP, and

   used for every session or registration, as the core specifications
   are.

   <a href="rfc3262.html">RFC 3262</a>, Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP (S):  SIP
      defines two types of responses to a request: final and
      provisional.  Provisional responses are numbered from 100 to 199.
      In SIP, these responses are not sent reliably.  This choice was
      made in <a href="rfc2543.html">RFC 2543</a> since the messages were meant to just be truly
      informational and rendered to the user.  However, subsequent work

      [<a href="rfc3262.html" title='"Reliability of Provisional Responses in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3262</a>] was developed to allow reliability of provisional
      responses.  The specification defines the PRACK method, used for
      indicating that a provisional response was received.  Though it
      provides a generic capability for SIP, <a href="rfc3262.html">RFC 3262</a> implementations
      have been most common in PSTN interworking devices.  However,
      PRACK brings a great deal of complication for relatively small
      benefit.  As such, it has seen only moderate levels of deployment.

      (SIP) (S):  [<a href="rfc3323.html" title='"A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3323</a>] defines the Privacy header field, used by
      clients to request anonymity for their requests.  Though it
      defines several privacy services, the only one broadly used is the
      one that supports privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity header field
      [<a href="rfc3325.html" title='"Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks"'>RFC3325</a>].

   UA-PRIVACY, UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP (S):  [<a href="#ref-UA-PRIVACY" title='"UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP"'>UA-PRIVACY</a>]
      defines a mechanism for achieving anonymous calls in SIP.  It is
      an alternative to [<a href="rfc3323.html" title='"A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3323</a>], and instead places more intelligence
      in the endpoint to craft anonymous messages by directly accessing

   <a href="rfc2976.html">RFC 2976</a>, The INFO Method (S):  [<a href="rfc2976.html" title='"The SIP INFO Method"'>RFC2976</a>] was defined as an extension
      to <a href="rfc2543.html">RFC 2543</a>.  It defines a method, INFO, used to transport mid-
      dialog information that has no impact on SIP itself.  Its driving
      application was the transport of PSTN-related information when
      using SIP between a pair of gateways.  Though originally conceived
      for broader use, it only found standardized usage with SIP-T
      [<a href="rfc3372.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol for Telephones (SIP-T): Context and Architectures"'>RFC3372</a>].  It has been used to support numerous proprietary and
      non-interoperable extensions due to its poorly defined scope.

      from a REGISTER response, a path of proxies to use in requests it
      sends outside of a dialog.  It can also be used by proxies to
      verify the Route header in client-initiated requests.  In many
      respects, it is the inverse of the Path header field, but has seen
      less usage since default outbound proxies have been sufficient in
      many deployments.

      way to clean up old state in proxies that are holding call state
      for calls from failed endpoints that were never terminated
      normally.  Despite its name, the session timer is not a mechanism
      for detecting a network failure mid-call.  Session timers
      introduce a fair bit of complexity for relatively little gain, and

      a technique for NAT traversal of media sessions for protocols that
      make use of the offer/answer model.  This specification is the
      IETF-recommended mechanism for NAT traversal for SIP media
      streams, and is meant to be used even by endpoints that are
      themselves never behind a NAT.  A SIP option tag and media feature

   Several specifications concern themselves with the interactions of
   SIP with network Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms.

   <a href="rfc3312.html">RFC 3312</a>, Integration of Resource Management and SIP (S):  [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>],

      the called party doesn't ring until a QoS reservation has been
      installed in the network.  It does so by defining a general
      preconditions framework, which defines conditions that must be
      true in order for a SIP session to proceed.

   QoS-ID, Quality of Service (QoS) Mechanism Selection in the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP) (S):  [<a href="#ref-QoS-ID" title='"Quality of Service (QoS) Mechanism Selection in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>QoS-ID</a>] defines a way for user
      agents to negotiate what type of end-to-end QoS mechanism to use
      for a session.  At this time, there are two that can be used: the
      Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) and Next Steps in Signaling
      (NSIS).  This negotiation is done through an SDP extension.  Due
      to limited deployment of RSVP and even more limited deployment of
      NSIS, this extension has not been widely used.

      provider's network.  This specification is sometimes referred to
      as the SIP walled-garden specification by the truly paranoid
      androids in the SIP community.  This is because it requires
      coupling of signaling and the underlying IP network.

   <a href="rfc3524.html">RFC 3524</a>, Mapping of Media Streams to Resource Reservation Flows
      (S):  [<a href="rfc3524.html" title='"Mapping of Media Streams to Resource Reservation Flows"'>RFC3524</a>] defines a usage of the SDP grouping framework for

   Several specifications have been defined to support operations and
   management of SIP systems.  These include mechanisms for
   configuration and network diagnostics.

   CONFIG-FRAME, A Framework for SIP User Agent Profile Delivery (S):
      [<a href="#ref-CONFIG-FRAME" title='"A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol User Agent Profile Delivery"'>CONFIG-FRAME</a>] defines a mechanism that allows a SIP user agent to
      bootstrap its configuration from the network and receive updates
      to its configuration, should it change.  This is considered an
      essential piece of deploying a usable SIP network.

   RTCP-SUM, SIP Event Package for Voice Quality Reporting  (S):
      [<a href="#ref-RTCP-SUM" title='"Session Initiation Protocol Package for Voice Quality Reporting Event"'>RTCP-SUM</a>] defines a SIP event package that enables the collection
      and reporting of metrics that measure the quality for Voice over

   messages over low bandwidth links.  Sigcomp is not formally part of
   SIP.  However, usage of Sigcomp with SIP has required extensions to
   SIP.

   <a href="rfc3486.html">RFC 3486</a>, Compressing SIP (S):  [<a href="rfc3486.html" title='"Compressing the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3486</a>] defines a SIP URI parameter

      [<a href="rfc4662.html" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>] defines a resource called a Resource List Server (RLS).
      A client can send a subscribe to this server.  The server will
      generate a series of subscriptions, compile the resulting
      information, and send it back to the subscriber.  The set of
      resources that the RLS will subscribe to is a property of the
      request URI in the SUBSCRIBE request.

      in SIP.  In this framework, a UA can include an XML list object in
      the body of various requests and the server will provide list-
      oriented services as a consequence.  For example, a SUBSCRIBE with
      a list subscribes to the URI in the list.

   These SIP extensions don't fit easily into a single specific use
   case.  They have somewhat general applicability, but they solve a
   relatively small problem or provide an optimization.

   <a href="rfc4488.html">RFC 4488</a>, Suppression of the SIP REFER Implicit Subscription (S):
      [<a href="rfc4488.html" title='"Suppression of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER Method Implicit Subscription"'>RFC4488</a>] defines an enhancement to REFER.  REFER normally creates
      an implicit subscription to the target of the REFER.  This
      subscription is used to pass back updates on the progress of the
      referral.  This extension allows that implicit subscription to be
      bypassed as an optimization.

   <a href="rfc4538.html">RFC 4538</a>, Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in SIP
      (S):  [<a href="rfc4538.html" title='"Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4538</a>] provides a mechanism that allows a UAS to
      authorize a request because the requestor proves it knows a dialog
      that is in progress with the UAS.  The specification is useful in
      conjunction with the SIP application interaction framework
      [<a href="#ref-INTERACT-FRAME" title='"A Framework for Application Interaction in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>INTERACT-FRAME</a>].

      a mechanism for a called party to indicate to the calling party
      that a call was rejected since the caller was anonymous.  This is
      needed for implementation of the Anonymous Call Rejection (ACR)
      feature in SIP.

   <a href="rfc5368.html">RFC 5368</a>, Referring to Multiple Resources in SIP (S):  [<a href="rfc5368.html" title='"Referring to Multiple Resources in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5368</a>]
      allows a UA sending a REFER to ask the recipient of the REFER to
      generate multiple SIP requests, not just one.  This is useful for
      conferencing, where a client would like to ask a conference server
      to eject multiple users.

   CONNECT-PRECON, Connectivity Preconditions for Session Description
      Protocol Media Streams (S):  [<a href="#ref-CONNECT-PRECON" title='"Connectivity Preconditions for Session Description Protocol Media Streams"'>CONNECT-PRECON</a>] defines a usage of
      the precondition framework [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>].  The connectivity
      precondition makes sure that the session doesn't get established

   CONNECT-REUSE, Connection Reuse in the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP) (S):  [<a href="#ref-CONNECT-REUSE" title='"Connection Reuse in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>CONNECT-REUSE</a>] defines an extension to SIP that
      allows a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection between servers
      to be reused for requests in both directions.  Normally, two
      connections are set up between a pair of servers, one for requests
      in each direction.

      extension to SIP that allows a calling user to determine the
      identity of the final called user (connected party).  Due to
      forwarding and retargeting services, this may not be the same as
      the user that the caller was originally trying to reach.  The
      mechanism works in tandem with the SIP identity specification
      [<a href="rfc4474.html" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>] to provide signatures over the connected party identity.
      It can also be used if a party identity changes mid call due to
      third party call control actions or PSTN behavior.

      for SIP, with DTLS-SRTP [<a href="#ref-SRTP-FRAME" title='"Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using DTLS"'>SRTP-FRAME</a>] having been selected as the
      final solution.

      SIP (S):  [<a href="rfc3853.html" title='"S/MIME Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Requirement for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3853</a>] formally updates <a href="rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a>.  It is a brief
      specification that updates the cryptography mechanisms used in SIP
      S/MIME.  However, SIP S/MIME has seen very little deployment.

   CERTS, Certificate Management Service for the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP) (S):  [<a href="#ref-CERTS" title='"Certificate Management Service for The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>CERTS</a>] defines a certificate service for SIP
      whose purpose is to facilitate the deployment of S/MIME.  The
      certificate service allows clients to store and retrieve their own
      certificates, in addition to obtaining the certificates for other
      users.

      that can be signed in order to provide an authenticated identity
      over a request.  It was an early predecessor to [<a href="rfc4474.html" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>], and
      consequently AIB has seen no deployment.

   SAML, SIP SAML Profile and Binding (S):  [<a href="#ref-SAML" title='"SIP SAML Profile and Binding"'>SAML</a>] defines the usage of
      the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) within SIP, and
      describes how to use it in conjunction with SIP identity [<a href="rfc4474.html" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>]
      to provide authenticated assertions about a user's role or

      extensions to SIP, including the Trigger-Consent and Permission-
      Missing header fields.  These header fields, in addition to the
      other procedures defined in the document, define a way to manage
      membership on "SIP mailing lists" used for instant messaging or
      conferencing.  In particular, it helps avoid the problem of using
      such amplification services for the purposes of an attack on the
      network by making sure a user authorizes the addition of their
      address onto such a service.

   Numerous SIP and SDP extensions are aimed at conferencing as their
   primary application.

   <a href="rfc4574.html">RFC 4574</a>, The SDP (Session Description Protocol) Label Attribute
      (S):  [<a href="rfc4574.html" title='"The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Label Attribute"'>RFC4574</a>] defines an SDP attribute for providing an opaque
      label for media streams.  These labels can be referred to by
      external documents, and in particular, by conference policy
      documents.  This allows a UA to tie together documents it may
      obtain through conferencing mechanisms to media streams to which
      they refer.

   <a href="rfc3911.html">RFC 3911</a>, The SIP Join Header Field (S):  [<a href="rfc3911.html" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "'>RFC3911</a>] defines the Join
      header field.  When sent in an INVITE, it causes the recipient to
      join the resulting dialog into a conference with another dialog in
      progress.

   <a href="rfc4575.html">RFC 4575</a>, A SIP Event Package for Conference State (S):  [<a href="rfc4575.html" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State"'>RFC4575</a>]
      defines a mechanism for learning about changes in conference
      state, including conference membership.

      allows a UA sending a REFER to ask the recipient of the REFER to
      generate multiple SIP requests, not just one.  This is useful for
      conferencing, where a client would like to ask a conference server
      to eject multiple users.

   <a href="rfc5366.html">RFC 5366</a>, Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in
      SIP (S):  [<a href="rfc5366.html" title='"Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5366</a>] is similar to [<a href="rfc5367.html" title='"Subscriptions to Request-Contained Resource Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC5367</a>].  However, instead of
      subscribing to the resource, an INVITE request is sent to the
      resource, and it will act as a conference focus and generate an
      invitation to each recipient in the list.

      [<a href="rfc3857.html" title='"A Watcher Information Event Template-Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3857</a>], also known as winfo, provides a mechanism for a user
      agent to find out what subscriptions are in place for a particular
      event package.  Its primary usage is with presence, but it can be
      used with any event package.

   TRANSFER-MECH, A Session Description Protocol (SDP)  Offer/Answer
      Mechanism to Enable File Transfer (S):  [<a href="#ref-TRANSFER-MECH" title='"A Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Mechanism to Enable File Transfer"'>TRANSFER-MECH</a>] defines a
