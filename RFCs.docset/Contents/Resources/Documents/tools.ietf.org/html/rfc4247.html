<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Voice over IP (VoIP) typically uses the encapsulation
   voice/RTP/UDP/IP.  When MPLS labels [<a href="#ref-MPLS-ARCH" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>MPLS-ARCH</a>] are added, this
   becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels.  For an MPLS Virtual Private
   Network (VPN) (e.g., [<a href="#ref-MPLS-VPN" title='"BGP/MPLS VPNs"'>MPLS-VPN</a>]), the packet header is at least 48
   bytes, while the voice payload is often no more than 30 bytes, for
   example.  The interest in header compression (HC) is to exploit the
   possibility of significantly reducing the overhead through various
   compression mechanisms, such as with enhanced compressed RTP [<a href="#ref-ECRTP" title='"Enhanced Compressed RTP (CRTP) for Links with High Delay, Packet Loss and Reordering"'>ECRTP</a>]
   or robust header compression [<a href="#ref-ROHC" title='"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): Framework and four profiles: RTP, UDP, ESP, and uncompressed "'>ROHC</a>], and also to increase scalability
   of HC.  We consider using MPLS to route compressed packets over an
   MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) without compression/decompression
   cycles at each router.  Such an HC over MPLS capability can increase
   bandwidth efficiency as well as the processing scalability of the
   maximum number of simultaneous flows that use HC at each router.

   To implement HC over MPLS, the ingress router/gateway would have to
   apply the HC algorithm to the IP packet, the compressed packet routed
   on an MPLS LSP using MPLS labels, and the compressed header would be
   decompressed at the egress router/gateway where the HC session
   terminates.  Figure 1 illustrates an HC over MPLS session established
   on an LSP that crosses several routers, from R1/HC --&gt; R2 --&gt; R3 --&gt;
   R4/HD, where R1/HC is the ingress router where HC is performed, and
   R4/HD is the egress router where header decompression (HD) is done.
   HC of the RTP/UDP/IP header is performed at R1/HC, and the compressed
   packets are routed using MPLS labels from R1/HC to R2, to R3, and
   finally to R4/HD, without further decompression/recompression cycles.
   The RTP/UDP/IP header is decompressed at R4/HD and can be forwarded
   to other routers, as needed.

            Figure 1.  Example of Header Compression over MPLS
                           over Routers R1--&gt;R4

   In the example scenario, HC therefore takes place between R1 and R4,
   and the MPLS path transports voice/compressed-header/MPLS-labels
   instead of voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels, typically saving 30 octets
   or more per packet.  The MPLS label stack and link-layer headers are
   not compressed.  A signaling method is needed to set up a
   correspondence between the ingress and egress routers of the HC over
   MPLS session.

   In <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> we give a problem statement, in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> we give goals
   and requirements, and in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> we give an example scenario.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Problem%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Problem Statement</span>

   As described in the introduction, HC over MPLS can significantly
   reduce the header overhead through HC mechanisms.  The need for HC
   may be important on low-speed links where bandwidth is more scarce,
   but it could also be important on backbone facilities, especially
   where costs are high (e.g., some global cross-sections).  VoIP
   typically will use voice compression mechanisms (e.g., G.729) on



<span class="grey">Ash, et al.                  Informational                      [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-4" id="page-4" name="page-4"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4247.html">RFC 4247</a>     Requirements for Header Compression over MPLS November 2005</span>


   low-speed and international routes, in order to conserve bandwidth.
   With HC, significantly more bandwidth could be saved.  For example,
   carrying uncompressed headers for the entire voice load of a large
   domestic network with 300 million or more calls per day could consume
   on the order of about 20-40 gigabits per second on the backbone
   network for headers alone.  This overhead could translate into
   considerable bandwidth capacity.

   The claim is often made that once fiber is in place, increasing the
   bandwidth capacity is inexpensive, nearly 'free'.  This may be true
   in some cases; however, on some international cross-sections,
   especially, facility/transport costs are very high and saving
   bandwidth on such backbone links is very worthwhile.  Decreasing the
   backbone bandwidth is needed in some areas of the world where
   bandwidth is very expensive.  It is also important in almost all
   locations to decrease the bandwidth consumption on low-speed links.
   So although bandwidth is getting cheaper, the value of compression
   does not go away.  It should be further noted that IPv6 will increase
   the size of headers, and therefore increase the importance of HC for
   RTP flows.

   Although hop-by-hop HC could be applied to decrease bandwidth
   requirements, that implies a processing requirement for compression-
   decompression cycles at every router hop, which does not scale well
   for large voice traffic loads.  The maximum number of compressed RTP
   (cRTP) flows is about 30-50 for a typical customer premise router,
   depending upon its uplink speed and processing power, while the need
   may exceed 300-500 for a high-end case.  Therefore, HC over MPLS
   seems to be a viable alternative to get the compression benefits
   without introducing costly processing demands on the intermediate
   nodes.  By using HC over MPLS, routers merely forward compressed
   packets without doing a decompression/recompression cycle, thereby
   increasing the maximum number of simultaneous compressed flows that
   routers can handle.

   Therefore, the proposal is to use existing HC techniques, together
   with MPLS labels, to make the transport of the RTP/UDP/IP headers
   more efficient over an MPLS network.  However, at this time, there
   are no standards for HC over MPLS, and vendors have not implemented
   such techniques.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Goals%20and%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Goals and Requirements</span>

   The goals of HC over MPLS are as follows:

   a. provide more efficient voice transport over MPLS networks,
   b. increase the scalability of HC to a large number of flows,
   c. not significantly increase packet delay, delay variation, or loss
      probability, and
   d. leverage existing work through use of standard protocols as much
      as possible.

   Therefore the requirements for HC over MPLS are as follows:

   a. MUST use existing protocols (e.g., [<a href="#ref-ECRTP" title='"Enhanced Compressed RTP (CRTP) for Links with High Delay, Packet Loss and Reordering"'>ECRTP</a>], [<a href="#ref-ROHC" title='"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): Framework and four profiles: RTP, UDP, ESP, and uncompressed "'>ROHC</a>]) to compress
      RTP/UDP/IP headers, in order to provide for efficient transport,
      tolerance to packet loss, and resistance to loss of session
      context.
   b. MUST allow HC over an MPLS LSP, and thereby avoid hop-by-hop
      compression/decompression cycles (e.g., [<a href="#ref-HC-MPLS-PROTO" title='"Protocol Extensions for Header Compression over MPLS"'>HC-MPLS-PROTO</a>]).
   c. MUST minimize incremental performance degradation due to increased
      delay, packet loss, and jitter.
   d. MUST use standard protocols to signal context identification and
      control information (e.g., [<a href="#ref-RSVP" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1 Functional Specification"'>RSVP</a>], [<a href="#ref-RSVP-TE" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RSVP-TE</a>], [<a href="#ref-LDP" title='"LDP Specification"'>LDP</a>]).
   e. Packet reordering MUST NOT cause incorrectly decompressed packets
      to be forwarded from the decompressor.

   It is necessary that the HC method be able to handle out-of-sequence
   packets.  MPLS [<a href="#ref-MPLS-ARCH" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>MPLS-ARCH</a>] enables 4-byte labels to be appended to IP
   packets to allow switching from the ingress Label Switching Router
   (LSR) to the egress LSP on an LSP through an MPLS network.  However,
   MPLS does not guarantee that packets will arrive in order at the
   egress LSR, since a number of things could cause packets to be
   delivered out of sequence.  For example, a link failure could cause
   the LSP routing to change, due perhaps to an MPLS fast reroute taking
   place, or to the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) and Label
   Distribution Protocol (LDP) converging to another route, among other
   possible reasons.  Other causes could include IGP reroutes due to
   'loose hops' in the LSP, or BGP route changes reflecting back into
   IGP reroutes.  HC algorithms may be able to handle reordering
   magnitudes on the order of about 10 packets, which may make the time
   required for IGP reconvergence (typically on the order of seconds)
   untenable for the HC algorithm.  On the other hand, MPLS fast reroute
   may be fast enough (on the order of 50 ms or less) for the HC
   algorithm to handle packet reordering.  The issue of reordering needs
   to be further considered in the development of the HC over MPLS
   solution.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4247.html">RFC 4247</a>     Requirements for Header Compression over MPLS November 2005</span>


   Resynchronization and performance also needs to be considered, since
   HC over MPLS can sometimes have multiple routers in the LSP.
   Tunneling an HC session over an MPLS LSP with multiple routers in the
   path will increase the round-trip delay and the chance of packet
   loss, and HC contexts may be invalidated due to packet loss.  The HC
   error recovery mechanism can compound the problem when long round-
   trip delays are involved.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Candidate%20Solution%20Methods%20and%20Needs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Candidate Solution Methods and Needs</span>

   [<a id="ref-cRTP" name="ref-cRTP">cRTP</a>] performs best with very low packet error rates on all hops of
   the path.  When the cRTP decompressor context state gets out of synch
   with the compressor, it will drop packets associated with the context
   until the two states are resynchronized.  To resynchronize context
   state at the two ends, the decompressor transmits the CONTEXT_STATE
   packet to the compressor, and the compressor transmits a FULL_HEADER
   packet to the decompressor.

   [<a id="ref-ECRTP" name="ref-ECRTP">ECRTP</a>] uses mechanisms that make cRTP more tolerant to packet loss,
   and ECRTP thereby helps to minimize the use of feedback-based error
   recovery (CONTEXT_STATE packets).  ECRTP is therefore a candidate
   method to make HC over MPLS more tolerant of packet loss and to guard
   against frequent resynchronizations.  ECRTP may need some
   implementation adaptations to address the reordering requirement in
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> (requirement e), since a default implementation will
   probably not meet the requirement.  ECRTP protocol extensions may be
   required to identify FULL_HEADER, CONTEXT_STATE, and compressed
   packet types.  [<a href="#ref-cRTP-ENCAP" title='"IP Header Compression over PPP"'>cRTP-ENCAP</a>] specifies a separate link-layer packet
   type defined for HC.  Using a separate link-layer packet type avoids
   the need to add extra bits to the compression header to identify the
   packet type.  However, this approach does not extend well to MPLS
   encapsulation conventions [<a href="#ref-MPLS-ENCAP" title='"MPLS Label Stack Encoding"'>MPLS-ENCAP</a>], in which a separate link-
   layer packet type translates into a separate LSP for each packet
   type.  In order to extend ECRTP to HC over MPLS, each packet type
   defined in [<a href="#ref-ECRTP" title='"Enhanced Compressed RTP (CRTP) for Links with High Delay, Packet Loss and Reordering"'>ECRTP</a>] would need to be identified in an appended packet
   type field in the ECRTP header.

   [<a id="ref-ROHC" name="ref-ROHC">ROHC</a>] is also very tolerant of packet loss, and therefore is a
   candidate method to guard against frequent resynchronizations.  ROHC
   also achieves a somewhat better level of compression as compared to
   ECRTP.  ROHC may need some implementation adaptations to address the
   reordering requirement in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> (requirement e), since a default
   implementation will probably not meet the requirement (see
   [<a href="#ref-ROHC-REORD" title='"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): ROHC over Channels that can Reorder Packets"'>ROHC-REORD</a>]).  ROHC already has the capability to identify the
   packet type in the compression header, so no further extension is
   needed to identify packet type.

   Extensions to MPLS signaling may be needed to identify the LSP from
   HC to HD egress point, negotiate the HC algorithm used and protocol
   parameters, and negotiate the Session Context IDs (SCIDs) space
   between the ingress and egress routers on the MPLS LSP.  For example,
   new objects may need to be defined for [<a href="#ref-RSVP-TE" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RSVP-TE</a>] to signal the SCID
   spaces between the ingress and egress routers, and the HC algorithm
   used to determine the context; these HC packets then contain the SCID
   identified by using the RSVP-TE objects.  It is also desirable to
   signal HC over MPLS tunnels with the Label Distribution Protocol
   [<a href="#ref-LDP" title='"LDP Specification"'>LDP</a>], since many <a href="rfc2547.html">RFC 2547</a> VPN [<a href="#ref-MPLS-VPN" title='"BGP/MPLS VPNs"'>MPLS-VPN</a>] implementations use LDP as
   the underlying LSP signaling mechanism, and LDP is very scalable.
   However, extensions to LDP may be needed to signal SCIDs between
   ingress and egress routers on HC over MPLS LSPs.  For example,
   'targeted LDP sessions' might be established for signaling SCIDs, or
   perhaps methods described in [<a href="#ref-LDP-PWE3" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance using the Label Distribution Protocol"'>LDP-PWE3</a>] to signal pseudo-wires and
   multipoint-to-point LSPs might be extended to support signaling of
   SCIDs for HC over MPLS LSPs.  The specific MPLS signaling protocol
   extensions to support these approved requirements need to be
   developed as a well-coordinated separate document in the appropriate
   IETF working groups.  The IETF needs to support a coordinated process
   for the two solution documents, though they are in separate areas.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Example%20Scenario"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Example Scenario</span>

   As illustrated in Figure 2, many VoIP flows are originated from
   customer sites, which are served by routers R1, R2, and R3, and
   terminated at several large customer call centers, which are served
   by R5, R6, and R7.  R4 is a service-provider router, and all VoIP
   flows traverse R4.  It is essential that the R4-R5, R4-R6, and R4-R7
   low-speed links all use HC to allow a maximum number of simultaneous
   VoIP flows.  To allow processing at R4 to handle the volume of
   simultaneous VoIP flows, it is desired to use HC over MPLS for these
   flows.  With HC over MPLS, R4 does not need to do HC/HD for the flows
   to the call centers, enabling more scalability of the number of
   simultaneous VoIP flows with HC at R4.

   The high processing load of HC makes HC a target for denial-of-
   service attacks.  For example, an attacker could send a high-
   bandwidth data stream through a network, with the headers in the data
   stream marked appropriately to cause HC to be applied.  This would
   use large amounts of processing resources on the routers performing
   compression and decompression, and these processing resources might
   then be unavailable for other important functions on the router.
   This threat is not a new threat for HC, but is addressed and
   mitigated by HC over MPLS.  That is, by reducing the need for
   performing compression and decompression cycles, as proposed in this
   document, the risk of this type of denial-of-service attack is
   reduced.
