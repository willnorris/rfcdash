<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines that serves
   as the basis for establishing a liaison relationship between the
   Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. and the Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF).  This cooperation framework is intended to secure
   timely development of technical specifications that facilitate
   maximum interoperability with existing Internet systems, devices, and
   protocols.

   CableLabs is a non-profit research and development consortium that is
   dedicated to pursuing new cable telecommunications technologies and
   to helping its cable operator members integrate those technical
   advancements into their business objectives.  Within CableLabs,
   specification activities are organized into projects such as
   DOCSIS(r), PacketCable(tm), and OpenCable(tm), and technical work is
   conducted in focus teams.  Product vendors, manufacturers, and cable
   operator members are invited to join the focus teams that create
   technical specifications.  From time to time, individuals involved
   with CableLabs focus teams submit CableLabs technical requirements or
   requirement specifications to IETF in order to seek expert reviews
   and solicit comments to create solutions that foster product
   interoperability beyond cable.  The submissions related to CableLabs
   specifications may, for example, include use cases, protocol
   requirements, draft MIB modules, and proposed solutions such as new
   DHCP options.  CableLabs also references the work of IETF and Request
   For Comments in its specifications.  The list of CableLabs projects
   and specifications available publicly can be found at the CableLabs
   Web site, <a href="http://www.cablelabs.com/">http://www.cablelabs.com</a>.

   Within the IETF, activities are undertaken within a framework of
   Areas, with specific activities being undertaken by working groups
   that are chartered within each Area.  Working group output is
   reviewed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and
   published by the RFC Editor.  IETF activities are based on a
   principle of open contribution and participation by any interested
   party.  Details on the Internet Standards Process followed by the
   IETF can be found in [<a href="rfc2026.html" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>].  Information on IETF working groups,
   current work item drafts, meeting schedules, and mailing lists are
   published on the IETF Web site, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org</a>.

   The IETF and CableLabs are forming a liaison relationship with a
   mutual desire to support the integrity of specifications developed by
   each body.  CableLabs does not develop standards other than through
   its participation with Standards Defining Organizations (SDOs) like
   the IETF.





<span class="grey">Mule &amp; Townsley              Informational                      [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-3" id="page-3" name="page-3"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4965.html">RFC 4965</a>              CableLabs-IETF Collaboration        September 2007</span>


   The preferred approach is that CableLabs uses the IETF specifications
   unchanged, if feasible, and communicates requirements for change to
   the IETF, as needed.  The parties intend to work together in an
   effort to avoid duplication of work.

   Within the framework of this liaison relationship, each organization
   will operate according to its own rules and procedures, including
   rules governing Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), specification
   elaboration, approval, and maintenance.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Basis%20of%20Collaboration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Basis of Collaboration</span>

   In the further development of CableLabs specifications, the benefit
   of adopting IETF specifications has been identified.  Although this
   document recognizes the importance of interoperability of the
   CableLabs specifications with the existing Internet and hence the use
   of IETF standards, CableLabs recognizes that additions or
   modifications might be needed in order to make the IETF
   specifications meet the needs of CableLabs.  In such cases, a
   CableLabs individual or a vendor participant working on a CableLabs
   specification may take its concerns directly to the appropriate IETF
   working groups for resolution.  When no appropriate working group can
   be found or it is not known where to direct the communication, or in
   the case of resolution of consequent matters, the issue will be
   raised through the CableLabs designated liaison manager to the IETF
   liaison manager.

   The IETF may also need to ask questions of CableLabs in order to
   refine its understanding of CableLabs requirements or may wish to
   offer guidance to CableLabs on the effective use of IETF
   specifications.  Where possible, these communications will occur in
   the context of a discussion between CableLabs and an IETF working
   group.  In the event that a working-group-level discussion is deemed
   inappropriate for the desired communication, the matter will be
   raised through the IETF's designated liaison manager to CableLabs.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Document%20Sharing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Document Sharing</span>

   Both CableLabs and the IETF encourage the sharing of specification
   documents and draft requirements that are of mutual interest.

   All IETF documents are publicly available from the IETF Web site, and
   discussion of documents is hosted on open mailing lists.

   CableLabs documents intended for public consumption include CableLabs
   Technical Reports and CableLabs Specifications that are in an
   approved and published status.  These documents have the CableLabs

   ISSUED status and are published for open access on CableLabs' Web
   site, <a href="http://www.cablelabs.com/">http://www.cablelabs.com</a>, or
   <a href="http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/archives/">http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/archives/</a>.

   In order for the IETF to make any reference (informative or
   normative), the document must be in an approved and published state,
   and publicly available.  It is expected that CableLabs will share
   relevant information with IETF participants via individual IETF
   Contributions, as described in [<a href="rfc3978.html" title='"IETF Rights in Contributions"'>RFC3978</a>], and without requiring a
   non-disclosure agreement.

   CableLabs and the IETF will work to update and exchange, when
   appropriate and on a regular basis, a list of dependencies between
   each organization's specifications and work in progress.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Participation%20in%20the%20IETF%20Process"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Participation in the IETF Process</span>

   The Internet Standards Process is described in [<a href="rfc2026.html" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>].
   Participation in the IETF process is open to any individual willing
   to contribute.  This naturally includes individuals who also
   represent or otherwise contribute to the development of CableLabs
   specifications.  Such individuals may freely participate in IETF
   mailing list discussions, submit and review Internet Drafts, and
   attend IETF meetings in order to assist the IETF in refining its
   understanding of CableLabs requirements as well as offering CableLabs
   an opportunity to receive informal guidance on CableLabs' use of IETF
   specifications.  The vast majority of technical discussions and
   decision making within the IETF is undertaken on open mailing lists.
   Interested individuals should subscribe to and participate on these
   lists.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Designated%20Liaison%20Managers%20and%20Responsibilities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Designated Liaison Managers and Responsibilities</span>

   When the informal working group level of interaction is insufficient,
   matters can be raised through a liaison channel.  CableLabs and the
   IETF shall each establish liaison functions for communication with

   announcing new work (new-work).

   The preferred way for organizations to work with IETF is through the
   working groups.  However, IETF has a limited number of liaison
   relationships and liaison managers with other organizations when
   conditions warrant the appointment of a specific person.

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) shall appoint a specific person
   to serve as the IETF liaison manager to CableLabs.  The role and
   responsibilities of the IETF liaison manager to CableLabs are
   described below.  In particular, it is expected that the designated
   liaison manager will act as an initial contact point in IETF for
   administrative aspects of this collaboration that cannot easily be
   handled in other ways (e.g., at a technical level by interactions
   with IETF Working Groups or Area Directors).  It is agreed that the
   role does not carry the expectation of attendance at CableLabs
   meetings or participation in CableLabs specification development
   processes, and it is anticipated that all liaison efforts assigned to
   this individual will be carried out by electronic mail.  It is
   understood that the IETF liaison manager does not have the ability to
   make exceptions to, or special provisions for, IETF policies and
   procedures.

   It is expected that the individual appointed to the liaison manager
   role would:

   o  perform all tasks as defined in [<a href="rfc4052.html" title='"IAB Processes for Management of IETF Liaison Relationships"'>RFC4052</a>] and [<a href="rfc4691.html" title='"Guidelines for Acting as an IETF Liaison to Another Organization"'>RFC4691</a>],

   o  be informed by CableLabs, when appropriate, of CableLabs
      activities within the IETF, including new work proposals, and be
      able to report those using appropriate channels within the IETF,

   o  convey liaison statements from the IETF to CableLabs as described
      in [<a href="rfc4053.html" title='"Procedures for Handling Liaison Statements to and from the IETF"'>RFC4053</a>], and be responsible for shepherding CableLabs
      communication to the relevant parts of the IETF,

   o  be able to raise issues with CableLabs technical leadership as
      well as the IAB members and IETF Area Directors, as required.

   CableLabs meetings are normally only open to delegates from CableLabs
   members or those manufacturers who have signed the appropriate
   agreements to participate in CableLabs projects or meetings.

   CableLabs shall establish an IETF liaison function and name an
   individual to be the CableLabs liaison Manager to IETF for matters
   pertaining to the CableLabs-IETF cooperation.  The CableLabs liaison
   manager to IETF is expected to work with the concerned IETF and
   CableLabs projects and focus teams and to support the interaction
   between CableLabs and the IETF.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Formal%20Liaison%20Statements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Formal Liaison Statements</span>

   Whenever possible, and as the preferred primary method of
   communication and coordination of activity, communication at the
   working group level is strongly encouraged.

   When deemed necessary, formal communication between CableLabs and
   IETF is also permitted.  These communications are to be recorded in
   the form of Liaison Statements, and the IETF will use the CableLabs
   liaison manager to convey these statements between the IETF and
   CableLabs.  The procedure for proper handling of incoming liaison
   statements defined in [<a href="rfc4053.html" title='"Procedures for Handling Liaison Statements to and from the IETF"'>RFC4053</a>] must be followed by both the liaison
   manager named by IETF and the liaison manager designated by
   CableLabs.  It is important to note that all liaison statements made
   by the IETF or directed to the IETF shall be published by the IETF as
   public documents.  All liaison statements made by the IETF will
   comply with the IETF IPR policy as documented in [<a href="rfc3978.html" title='"IETF Rights in Contributions"'>RFC3978</a>],
   [<a href="rfc3979.html" title='"Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology"'>RFC3979</a>], [<a href="rfc4748.html" title='"RFC 3978 Update to Recognize the IETF Trust"'>RFC4748</a>], [<a href="rfc4371.html" title='"BCP 101 Update for IPR Trust"'>RFC4371</a>] and any updates.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Contributions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Contributions</span>

   Individuals who are involved in CableLabs' projects and are willing
   to contribute to IETF may make contributions to the IETF in their
   capacity as IETF participants, under the IETF's IPR policy, as
   documented in [<a href="rfc3978.html" title='"IETF Rights in Contributions"'>RFC3978</a>] and [<a href="rfc3979.html" title='"Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology"'>RFC3979</a>].

   IETF participants whose companies are CableLabs members or have
   signed the appropriate agreements with CableLabs may also make
   contributions to CableLabs' projects and specifications.

   CableLabs mailing lists are not open to the general public.  It is
   recommended that work of mutual interest be discussed on the relevant
   IETF mailing lists.

   The IETF and CableLabs will not co-develop any documents or material.

   This section provides some guidelines for IANA to consider when
   adding references to a CableLabs specification in its registries.
   CableLabs maintains a specification repository with a stable URL for
   each published document under
   <a href="http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/">http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/</a>.  A stable document URL is
   one following the format:
   <a href="http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/CableLabs_docname.pdf">http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/CableLabs_docname.pdf</a>, where
   'CableLabs_docname' is the CableLabs document name.

   IANA is requested to use the above document URL format when
   referencing CableLabs specifications in its registries.
