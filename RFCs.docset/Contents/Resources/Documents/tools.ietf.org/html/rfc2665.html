Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   This memo obsoletes <a href="rfc2358.html">RFC 2358</a>, "Definitions of Managed Objects for the
   Ethernet-like Interface Types".  This memo extends that specification
   by including management information useful for the management of 1000
   Mb/s and full-duplex Ethernet interfaces.

   Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the
   IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new
   types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.  This evolution
   may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this
   new functionality.  This document, as with other documents issued by
   this working group, reflects a certain stage in the evolution of
   Ethernet technology.  In the future, this document might be revised,
   or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet
   technology.

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing Ethernet-like
   interfaces.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module extends the
   list of managed objects specified in the earlier version of this MIB:
   <a href="rfc2358.html">RFC 2358</a> [<a href="#ref-23" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>23</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-26" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirements Levels"'>26</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2665.html">RFC 2665</a>                   Ethernet-Like MIB                 August 1999</span>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in <a href="rfc2571.html">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>1</a>].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
       16, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>2</a>], STD 16, <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>3</a>] and <a href="rfc1215.html">RFC 1215</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>4</a>]. The
       second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a>
       [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>5</a>], STD 58, <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>6</a>] and STD 58, <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>7</a>].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>8</a>]. A second version of the SNMP
       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="rfc1901.html">RFC 1901</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>9</a>] and <a href="rfc1906.html">RFC</a>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface
   to an ethernet-like communications medium.  At present, ethernet-like
   media are identified by the following values of the ifType object in
   the Interfaces MIB [<a href="#ref-25" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>25</a>]:

            ethernetCsmacd(6)
            iso88023Csmacd(7)
            starLan(11)

   The definitions presented here are based on <a href="#section-30">Section 30</a>, "10 Mb/s, 100
   Mb/s and 1000 Mb/s Management", and Annex 30A, "GDMO Specification
   for 802.3 managed object classes" of IEEE Std. 802.3, 1998 Edition
   [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications"'>16</a>], as originally interpreted by Frank Kastenholz then of Interlan
   in [<a href="#ref-17" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks"'>17</a>].  Implementors of these MIB objects should note that IEEE
   Std. 802.3 [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications"'>16</a>] explicitly describes (in the form of Pascal
   pseudocode) when, where, and how various MAC attributes are measured.
   The IEEE document also describes the effects of MAC actions that may
   be invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB objects defined here.

   To the extent that some of the attributes defined in [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications"'>16</a>] are
   represented by previously defined objects in MIB-2 [<a href="#ref-24" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>24</a>] or in the
   Interfaces MIB [<a href="#ref-25" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>25</a>], such attributes are not redundantly represented
   by objects defined in this memo.  Among the attributes represented by
   objects defined in other memos are the number of octets transmitted
   or received on a particular interface, the number of frames
   transmitted or received on a particular interface, the promiscuous
   status of an interface, the MAC address of an interface, and
   multicast information associated with an interface.

   This section applies only when this MIB is used in conjunction with
   the "old" (<a href="rfc1213.html">RFC 1213</a>) [<a href="#ref-24" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>24</a>] interface group.

   The relationship between an ethernet-like interface and an interface
   in the context of MIB-2 is one-to-one.  As such, the value of an
   ifIndex object instance can be directly used to identify
   corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.

   For agents which implement the (now deprecated) ifSpecific object, an
   instance of that object that is associated with an ethernet-like
   interface has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

         dot3    OBJECT IDENTIFER ::= { transmission 7 }

   The Interface MIB [<a href="#ref-25" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>25</a>] requires that any MIB which is an adjunct of
   the Interface MIB clarify specific areas within the Interface MIB.
   These areas were intentionally left vague in the Interface MIB to
   avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of
   certain media-types.

   Section 3.3 of [<a href="#ref-25" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>25</a>] enumerates several areas which a media-specific
   MIB must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in a following
   subsection.  The implementor is referred to [<a href="#ref-25" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>25</a>] in order to
   understand the general intent of these areas.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.1.%20%20Layering%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1" name="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Layering Model</span>

   This MIB does not provide for layering.  There are no sublayers.

   EDITOR'S NOTE:

   One could foresee the development of an 802.2 and enet-transceiver
   MIB.  They could be higher and lower sublayers, respectively.  All
   that THIS document should do is allude to the possibilities and urge
   the implementor to be aware of the possibility and that they may have
   requirements which supersede the requirements in this document.

   This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not
   applicable to this MIB.

   This MIB defines two tests for media which are instrumented with this
   MIB; TDR and Loopback.  Implementation of these tests is not
   required.  Many common interface chips do not support one or both of
   these tests.

   These two tests are provided as a convenience, allowing a common
   method to invoke the test.

   Standard MIBs do not include objects in which to return the results
   of the TDR test.  Any needed objects MUST be provided in the vendor
   specific MIB.

   Note that the ifTestTable is now deprecated.  Work is underway to
   define a replacement MIB for system and interface testing.  It is
   expected that the tests defined in this document will be usable in
   this replacement MIB.

   This table contains all IEEE 802.3 addresses, unicast, multicast, and
   broadcast, for which this interface will receive packets and forward
   them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.  The format
   of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for
   ifPhysAddress.

   In the event that the interface is part of a MAC bridge, this table
   does not include unicast addresses which are accepted for possible
   forwarding out some other port.  This table is explicitly not
   intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.5.%20%20ifPhysAddress"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.5" name="section-3.2.5">3.2.5</a>.  ifPhysAddress</span>

   This object contains the IEEE 802.3 address which is placed in the
   source-address field of any Ethernet, Starlan, or IEEE 802.3 frames
   that originate at this interface.  Usually this will be kept in ROM
   on the interface hardware.  Some systems may set this address via
   software.

   In a system where there are several such addresses the designer has a
   tougher choice.  The address chosen should be the one most likely to
   be of use to network management (e.g.  the address placed in ARP
   responses for systems which are primarily IP systems).

   If the designer truly can not chose, use of the factory- provided ROM
   address is suggested.

   If the address can not be determined, an octet string of zero length
   should be returned.

   The address is stored in binary in this object.  The address is
   stored in "canonical" bit order, that is, the Group Bit is positioned
   as the low-order bit of the first octet.  Thus, the first byte of a
   multicast address would have the bit 0x01 set.

   This MIB applies to interfaces which have any of the following ifType
   values:

            ethernetCsmacd(6)
            iso88023Csmacd(7)

   It is RECOMMENDED that all Ethernet-like interfaces use an ifType of
   ethernetCsmacd(6) regardless of the speed that the interface is
   running or the link-layer encapsulation in use.  iso88023Csmacd(7)
   and starLan(11) are supported for backwards compatability.

   There are three other interface types defined in the IANAifType-MIB
   for Ethernet.  They are fastEther(62), fastEtherFX(69), and
   gigabitEthernet(117).  This document takes the position that an
   Ethernet is an Ethernet, and Ethernet interfaces SHOULD always have
   the same value of ifType.  Information on the particular flavor of
   Ethernet that an interface is running is available from ifSpeed in
   the Interfaces MIB, and ifMauType in the 802.3 MAU MIB.  An
   Ethernet-like interface SHOULD NOT use the fastEther(62),
   fastEtherFX(69), or gigabitEthernet(117) ifTypes.

   Interfaces with any of the supported ifType values map to the
   EtherLike-MIB in the same manner.  There are no implementation
   differences.

   Support for the mauModIfCompl2 compliance statement of the MAU-MIB
   [<a href="#ref-27" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs)"'>27</a>] is REQUIRED for Ethernet-like interfaces.  This MIB is needed in
   order to allow applications to determine the current MAU type in use
   by the interface, and to control autonegotiation and duplex mode for
   the interface.  Implementing this MIB module without implementing the
   MAU-MIB would leave applications with no standard way to determine
   the media type in use, and no standard way to control the duplex mode
   of the interface.

   that list as part of this document has proven to be problematic, so
   the OID assignments contained in prevous versions of this document
   have now been moved to a separate document [<a href="#ref-28" title='"Definitions of Object Identifiers for Identifying Ethernet Chip Sets"'>28</a>].

   The dot3StatsEtherChipSet object has now been deprecated.
   Implementation feedback indicates that this object is much more
   useful in theory than in practice.  The object's utility in debugging
   network problems in the field appears to be limited.  In those cases
   where it may be useful, it is not sufficient, since it identifies
   only the MAC chip, and not the PHY, PMD, or driver.  The
   administrative overhead involved in maintaining a central registry of
   chipset OIDs cannot be justified for an object whose usefulness is
   questionable at best.

   Implementations which continue to support this object for the purpose
   of backwards compatability may continue to use the values defined in
   [<a href="#ref-28" title='"Definitions of Object Identifiers for Identifying Ethernet Chip Sets"'>28</a>].  For chipsets not listed in [<a href="#ref-28" title='"Definitions of Object Identifiers for Identifying Ethernet Chip Sets"'>28</a>], implementors should assign
   OBJECT IDENTIFIERS within that part of the registration tree
   delegated to individual enterprises.

   * Note that the octet counters in IF-MIB do not exactly match the
   definition of the octet counters in IEEE 802.3.  aOctetsTransmittedOK
   and aOctetsReceivedOK count only the octets in the clientData and Pad
   fields, whereas ifInOctets and ifOutOctets include the entire MAC
   frame, including MAC header and FCS.  However, the IF-MIB counters
   can be derived from the IEEE 802.3 counters as follows:

     ifInOctets = aOctetsReceivedOK + (18 * aFramesReceivedOK)

     ifOutOctets = aOctetsTransmittedOK + (18 * aFramesTransmittedOK)

   Also note that the packet counters in the IF-MIB do not exactly match
   the definition of the frame counters in IEEE 802.3.
   aFramesTransmittedOK counts the number of frames successfully
   transmitted on the interface, whereas ifOutUcastPkts,
   ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts count the number of
   transmit requests made from a higher layer, whether or not the
   transmit attempt was successful.  This means that packets counted by
   ifOutErrors or ifOutDiscards are also be counted by ifOut*castPkts,
   but are not be counted by aFramesTransmittedOK.  This also means

   that, since MAC Control frames are generated by a sublayer internal
   to the interface layer rather than by a higher layer, they are not
   counted by ifOut*castPkts, but are counted by aFramesTransmittedOK.

   Similarly, aFramesReceivedOK counts the number of frames received
   successfully by the interface, whether or not they are passed to a
   higher layer, whereas ifInUcastPkts, ifInMulticastPkts and
   ifInBroadcastPkts count only the number of packets passed to a higher
   layer.  This means that packets counted by ifInDiscards or
   ifInUnknownProtos are also counted by aFramesReceivedOK, but are not
   counted by ifIn*castPkts.  This also menas that, since MAC Control
   frames are consumed by a sublayer internal to the interface layer and
   not passed to a higher layer, they are not counted by ifIn*castPkts,
   but are counted by aFramesReceivedOK.

   Another difference to keep in mind between the IF-MIB counters and
   IEEE 802.3 counters is that in the IEEE 802.3 document, the frame
   counters and octet counters are always incremented together.
   aOctetsTransmittedOK counts the number of octets in frames that were
   counted by aFramesTransmittedOK.  aOctetsReceivedOK counts the number
   of octets in frames that were counted by aFramesReceivedOK.  This is
   not the case with the IF-MIB counters.  The IF-MIB octet counters
   count the number of octets sent to or received from the layer below
   this interface, whereas the packet counters count the number of
   packets sent to or received from the layer above.  Therefore,
   received MAC Control frames, ifInDiscards, and ifInUnknownProtos are
   counted by ifInOctets, but not ifIn*castPkts.  Transmitted MAC
   Control frames are counted by ifOutOctets, but not ifOut*castPkts.
   ifOutDiscards and ifOutErrors are counted by ifOut*castPkts, but not
   ifOutOctets.

                       Management control of the duplex mode is
                       accomplished through the MAU MIB.  When
                       an interface does not support autonegotiation,
                       or when autonegotiation is not enabled, the
                       duplex mode is controlled using
                       ifMauDefaultType.  When autonegotiation is
                       supported and enabled, duplex mode is controlled
                       using ifMauAutoNegAdvertisedBits.  In either
                       case, the currently operating duplex mode is
                       reflected both in this object and in ifMauType.

                       Note that this object provides redundant
                       information with ifMauType.  Normally, redundant
                       objects are discouraged.  However, in this
                       instance, it allows a management application to
                       determine the duplex status of an interface
                       without having to know every possible value of
                       ifMauType.  This was felt to be sufficiently
                       valuable to justify the redundancy."

                       specific to ethernet-like interfaces of type
                       10Base5 and 10Base2.  The TDR value may be
                       useful in determining the approximate distance
                       to a cable fault.  It is advisable to repeat
                       this test to check for a consistent resulting
                       TDR value, to verify that there is a fault.

                       A TDR test returns as its result the time
                       interval, measured in 10 MHz ticks or 100 nsec
                       units, between the start of TDR test
                       transmission and the subsequent detection of a
                       collision or deassertion of carrier.  On
                       successful completion of a TDR test, the result
                       is stored as the value of an appropriate
                       instance of an appropriate vendor specific MIB
                       object, and the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of that

   This document was produced by the IETF Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, whose efforts were greatly advanced by the
   contributions of the following people:

      Lynn Kubinec
      Steve McRobert
      Dan Romascanu
      Andrew Smith
      Geoff Thompson

   This document is based on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB, <a href="rfc2358.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2358.html">2358</a> [<a href="#ref-23" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>23</a>], edited by John Flick of Hewlett-Packard and Jeffrey
   Johnson of RedBack Networks and produced by the 802.3 Hub MIB Working
   Group.  It extends that document by providing support for full-duplex
   Ethernet interfaces and 1000 Mb/sec Ethernet interfaces as outlined
   in [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications"'>16</a>].

   <a href="rfc2358.html">RFC 2358</a>, in turn, is almost completely based on both the Standard
   Ethernet MIB, <a href="rfc1643.html">RFC 1643</a> [<a href="#ref-21" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>21</a>], and the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB
   using the SNMPv2 SMI, <a href="rfc1650.html">RFC 1650</a> [<a href="#ref-22" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types using SMIv2"'>22</a>], both of which were edited by
   Frank Kastenholz of FTP Software and produced by the Interfaces MIB
   Working Group.  <a href="rfc2358.html">RFC 2358</a> extends those documents by providing support
   for 100 Mb/sec ethernet interfaces.

   <a href="rfc1643.html">RFC 1643</a> and <a href="rfc1650.html">RFC 1650</a>, in turn, are based on the Draft Standard

   produced by the Ethernet MIB Working Group.

   <a href="rfc1284.html">RFC 1284</a> [<a href="#ref-18" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Ethernet-Like Interface Types"'>18</a>], which was edited by John Cook of Chipcom and produced
   by the Transmission MIB Working Group.  The Ethernet MIB Working
   Group gathered implementation experience of the variables specified
   in <a href="rfc1284.html">RFC 1284</a>, documented that experience in <a href="rfc1369.html">RFC 1369</a> [<a href="#ref-19" title='"Implementation Notes and Experience for The Internet Ethernet MIB"'>19</a>], and used
   that information to develop this revised MIB.

   <a href="rfc1284.html">RFC 1284</a>, in turn, is based on a document written by Frank
   Kastenholz, then of Interlan, entitled IEEE 802.3 Layer Management
   Draft M compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks [<a href="#ref-17" title='"IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks"'>17</a>].  This document was
   modestly reworked, initially by the SNMP Working Group, and then by
   the Transmission Working Group, to reflect the current conventions
   for defining objects for MIB interfaces.  James Davin, of the MIT

   There are two management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support
   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be
   considered to contain sensitive information.  In particular, the
   dot3StatsEtherChipSet object may be considered sensitive in many
   environments, since it would allow an intruder to obtain information
   about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.  Note that
   this object has been deprecated.  However, some implementors may
   still choose to implement it for backwards compatability.

   Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all
   versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>12</a>] and the View-based
   Access Control Model <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="#ref-15" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>15</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

       (4)  REFERENCE clauses have been updated to reflect the
            actual IEEE 802.3 managed object that each MIB object
            is based on.

       (5)  The following object DESCRIPTION clauses have been
            updated to reflect that they do not increment in

            full-duplex mode: dot3StatsSingleCollisionFrames,
            dot3StatsMultipleCollisionFrames, dot3StatsSQETestErrors,
            dot3StatsDeferredTransmissions, dot3StatsLateCollisions,
            dot3StatsExcessiveCollisions, dot3StatsCarrierSenseErrors,
            dot3CollFrequencies.

       (6)  The following object DESCRIPTION clauses have been
            updated to reflect behaviour on full-duplex and
            1000 Mb/s interfaces: dot3StatsAlignmentErrors,
            dot3StatsFCSErrors, dot3StatsSQETestErrors,
            dot3StatsLateCollisions, dot3StatsSymbolErrors.

       (7)  Two new tables, dot3ControlTable and dot3PauseTable,
            have been added.

       (8)  A new object, dot3StatsDuplexStatus, has been added.

       (9)  The object groups and compliances have been restructured.

      (10)  The dot3StatsEtherChipSet object has been deprecated.

      (11)  The dot3ChipSets have been moved to a separate document.
