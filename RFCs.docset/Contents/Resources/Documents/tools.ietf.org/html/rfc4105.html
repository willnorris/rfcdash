   The set of MPLS Traffic Engineering components, defined in [<a href="#ref-RSVP-TE" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RSVP-TE</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-OSPF-TE" title='"Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2"'>OSPF-TE</a>], and [<a href="#ref-ISIS-TE" title='"Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Extensions for Traffic Engineering (TE)"'>ISIS-TE</a>], which supports the requirements defined in
   [<a href="#ref-TE-REQ" title='"Requirements for Traffic Engineering Over MPLS"'>TE-REQ</a>], is used today by many network operators to achieve major
   Traffic Engineering objectives defined in [<a href="#ref-TE-OVW" title='"Overview and Principles of Internet Traffic Engineering"'>TE-OVW</a>].  These objectives
   include:

      - Aggregated Traffic measurement
      - Optimization of network resources utilization
      - Support for services requiring end-to-end QoS guarantees
      - Fast recovery against link/node/Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)
        failures

   Furthermore, the applicability of MPLS to traffic engineering in IP
   networks is discussed in [<a href="#ref-TE-APP" title='"Applicability Statement for Traffic Engineering with MPLS"'>TE-APP</a>].

   The set of MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms, to date, has been
   limited to use within a single Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4105.html">RFC 4105</a>                Inter-Area MPLS TE Reqs                June 2005</span>


   This document discusses the requirements for an inter-area MPLS
   Traffic Engineering mechanism that may be used to achieve the same
   set of objectives across multiple IGP areas.

   Basically, it would be useful to extend MPLS TE capabilities across
   IGP areas to support inter-area resources optimization, to provide
   strict QoS guarantees between two edge routers located within
   distinct areas, and to protect inter-area traffic against Area Border
   Router (ABR) failures.

   First, this document addresses current uses of MPLS Traffic
   Engineering within a single IGP area.  Then, it discusses a set of
   functional requirements that a solution must or should satisfy in
   order to support inter-area MPLS Traffic Engineering.  Because the
   scope of requirements will vary between operators, some requirements
   will be mandatory (MUST), whereas others will be optional (SHOULD).

   This section addresses architecture, capabilities, and uses of MPLS
   TE within a single IGP area.  It first summarizes the current MPLS-TE
   architecture, then addresses various MPLS-TE capabilities, and
   finally lists various approaches to integrate MPLS TE into routing.
   This section is intended to help define the requirements for MPLS-TE
   extensions across multiple IGP areas.

   The MPLS-TE control plane allows establishing explicitly routed MPLS
   LSPs whose paths follow a set of TE constraints.  It is used to
   achieve major TE objectives such as resource usage optimization, QoS
   guarantee and fast failure recovery.  It consists of three main
   components:

   - The routing component, responsible for the discovery of the TE
     topology.  This is ensured thanks to extensions of link state IGP:
     [<a href="#ref-ISIS-TE" title='"Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Extensions for Traffic Engineering (TE)"'>ISIS-TE</a>], [<a href="#ref-OSPF-TE" title='"Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2"'>OSPF-TE</a>].
   - The path computation component, responsible for the placement of
     the LSP.  It is performed on the head-end LSR thanks to a CSPF
     algorithm, which takes TE topology and LSP constraints as input.
   - The signaling component, responsible for the establishment of the
     LSP (explicit routing, label distribution, and resources
     reservation) along the computed path.  This is ensured thanks to
     RSVP-TE [<a href="#ref-RSVP-TE" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RSVP-TE</a>].

   MPLS TE can be used within an area to redirect paths of aggregated
   flows away from over-utilized resources within a network.  In a small
   scale, this may be done by explicitly configuring a path to be used
   between two routers.  On a grander scale, a mesh of LSPs can be
   established between central points in a network.  LSPs paths can be
   defined statically in configuration or arrived at by an algorithm
   that determines the shortest path given administrative constraints
   such as bandwidth.  In this way, MPLS TE allows for greater control
   over how traffic demands are routed over a network topology and
   utilize a network's resources.

   Note also that TE LSPs allow measuring traffic matrix in a simple and
   scalable manner.  The aggregated traffic rate between two LSRs is
   easily measured by accounting of traffic sent onto a TE LSP
   provisioned between the two LSRs in question.

   The DiffServ IETF working group has defined a set of mechanisms
   described in [<a href="#ref-DIFF-ARCH" title='"An Architecture for Differentiated Service"'>DIFF-ARCH</a>], [<a href="#ref-DIFF-AF" title='"Assured Forwarding PHB Group"'>DIFF-AF</a>], and [<a href="#ref-DIFF-EF" title='"An Expedited Forwarding PHB (Per-Hop Behavior)"'>DIFF-EF</a>] or [<a href="#ref-MPLS-DIFF" title='"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services"'>MPLS-DIFF</a>],
   that can be activated at the edge of or over a DiffServ domain to
   contribute to the enforcement of a QoS policy (or set of policies),
   which can be expressed in terms of maximum one-way transit delay,
   inter-packet delay variation, loss rate, etc.  Many Operators have
   some or full deployment of DiffServ implementations in their networks
   today, either across the entire network or at least at its edge.

   In situations where strict QoS bounds are required, admission control
   inside the backbone of a network is in some cases required in
   addition to current DiffServ mechanisms.  When the propagation delay
   can be bounded, the performance targets, such as maximum one-way
   transit delay, may be guaranteed by providing bandwidth guarantees
   along the DiffServ-enabled path.

   MPLS TE can be simply used with DiffServ: in that case, it only
   ensures aggregate QoS guarantees for the whole traffic.  It can also
   be more intimately combined with DiffServ to perform per-class of
   service admission control and resource reservation.  This requires
   extensions to MPLS TE called DiffServ-Aware TE, which are defined in
   [<a href="#ref-DSTE-PROTO" title='"Protocol Extensions for Support of Differentiated-Service-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering"'>DSTE-PROTO</a>].  DS-TE allows ensuring strict end-to-end QoS
   guarantees.  For instance, an EF DS-TE LSP may be provisioned between
   voice gateways within the same area to ensure strict QoS to VoIP
   traffic.

   MPLS TE allows computing intra-area shortest paths, which satisfy
   various constraints, including bandwidth.  For the sake of
   illustration, if the IGP metrics reflects the propagation delay, it
   allows finding a minimum propagation delay path, which satisfies
   various constraints, such as bandwidth.

   As quality-sensitive applications are deployed, one of the key
   requirements is to provide fast recovery mechanisms, allowing traffic
   recovery to be guaranteed on the order of tens of msecs, in case of
   network element failure.  Note that this cannot be achieved by
   relying only on classical IGP rerouting.

   Various recovery mechanisms can be used to protect traffic carried
   onto TE LSPs.  They are defined in [<a href="#ref-MPLS-RECOV" title='"Framework for Multi- Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)-based Recovery"'>MPLS-RECOV</a>].  Protection
   mechanisms are based on the provisioning of backup LSPs that are used
   to recover traffic in case of failure of protected LSPs.  Among those
   protection mechanisms, local protection (also called Fast Reroute) is
   intended to achieve sub-50ms recovery in case of link/node/SRLG

   failure along the LSP path [<a href="#ref-FAST-REROUTE" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>FAST-REROUTE</a>].  Fast Reroute is currently
   used by many operators to protect sensitive traffic inside an IGP
   area.

   [<a id="ref-FAST-REROUTE" name="ref-FAST-REROUTE">FAST-REROUTE</a>] defines two modes for backup LSPs.  The first, called
   one-to-one backup, consists of setting up one detour LSP per
   protected LSP and per element to protect.  The second, called
   facility backup, consists of setting up one or several bypass LSPs to
   protect a given facility (link or node).  In case of failure, all
   protected LSPs are nested into the bypass LSPs (benefiting from the
   MPLS label stacking property).

   There are several possibilities for directing traffic into intra-area
   TE LSPs:

   1) Static routing to the LSP destination address or any other
      addresses.
   2) IGP routes beyond the LSP destination, from an IGP SPF perspective
      (IGP shortcuts).
   3) BGP routes announced by a BGP peer (or an MP-BGP peer) that is
      reachable through the TE LSP by means of a single static route to
      the corresponding BGP next-hop address (option 1) or by means of
      IGP shortcuts (option 2).  This is often called BGP recursive
      routing.
   4) The LSP can be advertised as a link into the IGP to become part of
      IGP database for all nodes, and thus can be taken into account
      during SPF for all nodes.  Note that, even if similar in concept,
      this is different from the notion of Forwarding-Adjacency, as
      defined in [<a href="#ref-LSP-HIER" title='"LSP Hierarchy with Generalized MPLS TE"'>LSP-HIER</a>].  Forwarding-Adjacency is when the LSP is
      advertised as a TE-link into the IGP-TE to become part of the TE
      database and taken into account in CSPF.

   As described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>, MPLS TE is deployed today by many
   operators to optimize network bandwidth usage, to provide strict QoS
   guarantees, and to ensure sub-50ms recovery in case of link/node/SRLG
   failure.

   However, MPLS-TE mechanisms are currently limited to a single IGP
   area.  The limitation comes more from the Routing and Path
   computation components than from the signaling component.  This is
   basically because the hierarchy limits topology visibility of head-

   end LSRs to their IGP area, and consequently head-end LSRs can no
   longer run a CSPF algorithm to compute the shortest constrained path
   to the tail-end, as CSPF requires the whole topology to compute an
   end-to-end shortest constrained path.

   Several operators have multi-area networks, and many operators that
   are still using a single IGP area may have to migrate to a multi-area
   environment, as their network grows and single area scalability
   limits are approached.

   Thus, those operators may require inter-area traffic engineering to:

   - Perform inter-area resource optimization.
   - Provide inter-area QoS guarantees for traffic between edge nodes
     located in different areas.
   - Provide fast recovery across areas, to protect inter-area traffic
     in case of link or node failure, including ABR node failures.

   For instance, an operator running a multi-area IGP may have voice
   gateways located in different areas.  Such VoIP transport requires
   inter-area QoS guarantees and inter-area fast protection.

   One possible approach for inter-area traffic engineering could
   consist of deploying MPLS TE on a per-area basis, but such an
   approach has several limitations:

   - Traffic aggregation at the ABR levels implies some constraints that
     do not lead to efficient traffic engineering.  Actually, this per-
     area TE approach might lead to sub-optimal resource utilization, by
     optimizing resources independently in each area.  What many
     operators want is to optimize their resources as a whole; in other
     words, as if there was only one area (flat network).
   - This does not allow computing an inter-area constrained shortest
     path and thus does not ensure end-to-end QoS guarantees across
     areas.
   - Inter-area traffic cannot be protected with local protection
     mechanisms such as [<a href="#ref-FAST-REROUTE" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>FAST-REROUTE</a>] in case of ABR failure.

   Therefore, existing MPLS TE mechanisms have to be enhanced to support
   inter-area TE LSPs.

   For the reasons mentioned above, it is highly desired to extend the
   current set of MPLS-TE mechanisms across multiple IGP areas in order
   to support the intra-area applications described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> across
   areas.

   The solution MUST allow setting up inter-area TE LSPs; i.e., LSPs
   whose path crosses at least two IGP areas.

   Inter-area MPLS-TE extensions are highly desired in order to provide:

   - Inter-area resources optimization.
   - Strict inter-area QoS guarantees.
   - Fast recovery across areas, particularly to protect inter-area
     traffic against ABR failures.

   It may be desired to compute inter-area shortest paths that satisfy
   some bandwidth constraints or any other constraints, as is currently
   possible within a single IGP area.  For the sake of illustration, if
   the IGP metrics reflects the propagation delay, it may be necessary
   to be able to find the optimal (shortest) path satisfying some
   constraints (e.g., bandwidth) across multiple IGP areas.  Such a path
   would be the inter-area path offering the minimal propagation delay.

   Thus, the solution SHOULD provide the ability to compute inter-area
   shortest paths satisfying a set of constraints (i.e., bandwidth).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20Key%20Objectives%20for%20an%20Inter-Area%20MPLS-TE%20Solution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Key Objectives for an Inter-Area MPLS-TE Solution</span>

   Any solution for inter-area MPLS TE should be designed with
   preserving IGP hierarchy concept, and preserving routing and
   signaling scalability as key objectives.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.1.%20%20Preserving%20the%20IGP%20Hierarchy%20Concept"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.1" name="section-5.3.1">5.3.1</a>.  Preserving the IGP Hierarchy Concept</span>

   The absence of a full link-state topology database makes the
   computation of an end-to-end optimal path by the head-end LSR not
   possible without further signaling and routing extensions.  There are
   several reasons that network operators choose to break up their
   network into different areas.  These often include scalability and
   containment of routing information.  The latter can help isolate most
   of a network from receiving and processing updates that are of no
   consequence to its routing decisions.  Containment of routing
   information MUST not be compromised to allow inter-area traffic
   engineering.  Information propagation for path-selection MUST
   continue to be localized.  In other words, the solution MUST entirely
   preserve the concept of IGP hierarchy.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.2.%20%20Preserving%20Scalability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.2" name="section-5.3.2">5.3.2</a>.  Preserving Scalability</span>

   Achieving the requirements listed in this document MUST be performed
   while preserving the IGP scalability, which is of the utmost
   importance.  The hierarchy preservation objective addressed in the
   above section is actually an element to preserve IGP scalability.

   The solution also MUST not increase IGP load unreasonably, which
   could compromise IGP scalability.  In particular, a solution
   satisfying those requirements MUST not require the IGP to carry some
   unreasonable amount of extra information and MUST not unreasonably
   increase the IGP flooding frequency.

   Likewise, the solution MUST also preserve scalability of RSVP-TE
   ([<a href="#ref-RSVP-TE" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RSVP-TE</a>]).

   Additionally, the base specification of MPLS TE is architecturally
   structured and relatively devoid of excessive state propagation in
   terms of routing or signaling.  Its strength in extensibility can
   also be seen as an Achilles heel, as there is no real limit to what
   is possible with extensions.  It is paramount to maintain
   architectural vision and discretion when adapting it for use for
   inter-area MPLS TE.  Additional information carried within an area or
   propagated outside of an area (via routing or signaling) should be
   neither excessive, patchwork, nor non-relevant.

   Particularly, as mentioned in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>, it may be desired for some
   inter-area TE LSP carrying highly sensitive traffic to compute a
   shortest inter-area path, satisfying a set of constraints such as
   bandwidth.  This may require an additional routing mechanism, as base
   CSPF at head-end can no longer be used due to the lack of topology
   and resource information.  Such a routing mechanism MUST not
   compromise the scalability of the overall system.

   Typically, an inter-area TE LSP will be set up between R0 and R4,
   where both LSRs belong to different IGP areas.  Note that the
   solution MUST support the capability to protect such an inter-area TE
   LSP from the failure on any Link/SRLG/Node within any area and the
   failure of any traversed ABR.  For instance, if the TE LSP R0-&gt;R4
   goes through R1-&gt;ABR1-&gt;R2, then it can be protected against ABR1
   failure, thanks to a backup LSP (detour or bypass) that may follow
   the alternate path R1-&gt;ABR2-&gt;R2.

   For instance, R0 and R4 may be two voice gateways located in distinct
   areas.  An inter-area DS-TE LSP with class-type EF is set up from R1
   to R4 to route VoIP traffic classified as EF.  Per-class inter-area
   constraint-based routing allows the DS-TE LSP to be routed over a
   path that will ensure strict QoS guarantees for VoIP traffic.

   In another application, R0 and R4 may be two pseudo wire gateways
   residing in different areas.  An inter-area LSP may be set up to
   carry pseudo wires.

   In some cases, it might also be possible to have an inter-area TE LSP
   from R0 to R5 transiting via the backbone area (or any other levels
   with IS-IS).  There may be cases where there are no longer enough
   resources on any intra area path R0-to-R5, and where there is a
   feasible inter-area path through the backbone area.

   discussed in [<a href="#ref-TE-REQ" title='"Requirements for Traffic Engineering Over MPLS"'>TE-REQ</a>], and the derived solution MUST interoperate
   seamlessly with current intra-area MPLS TE mechanisms and inherit its

   The proposed solution MUST allow provisioning at the head-end with
   end-to-end RSVP signaling (potentially with loose paths) traversing
   across the interconnected ABRs, without further provisioning required
   along the transit path.

   The solution MUST allow for the signaling of inter-area TE LSPs,
   using RSVP-TE.

   In addition to the signaling of classical TE constraints (bandwidth,
   admin-groups), the proposed solution MUST allow the head-end LSR to
   specify a set of LSRs explicitly, including ABRs, by means of strict
   or loose hops for the inter-area TE LSP.

   In the context of this requirement document, an optimal path is
   defined as the shortest path across multiple areas, taking into
   account either the IGP or TE metric [<a href="#ref-METRIC" title='"Use of Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Metric as a second MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric"'>METRIC</a>].  In other words, such a
   path is the path that would have been computed by making use of some
   CSPF algorithm in the absence of multiple IGP areas.

   As mentioned in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>, the solution SHOULD provide the
   capability to compute an optimal path dynamically, satisfying a set
   of specified constraints (defined in [<a href="#ref-TE-REQ" title='"Requirements for Traffic Engineering Over MPLS"'>TE-REQ</a>]) across multiple IGP
   areas.  Note that this requirement document does not mandate that all
   inter-area TE LSPs require the computation of an optimal (shortest)
   inter-area path.  Some inter-area TE-LSP paths may be computed via
   some mechanisms that do not guarantee an optimal end-to-end path,
   whereas some other inter-area TE-LSP paths carrying sensitive traffic
   could be computed by making use of mechanisms allowing an optimal
   end-to-end path to be computed dynamically.  Note that regular
   constraints such as bandwidth, affinities, IGP/TE metric
   optimization, path diversity, etc., MUST be taken into account in the
   computation of an optimal end-to-end path.

   As mentioned in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>, IGP hierarchy does not allow the head-
   end LSR to compute an end-to-end optimal path.  Additional mechanisms
   are required to compute an optimal path.  These mechanisms MUST not
   alter the IGP hierarchy principles.  Particularly, in order to
   maintain containment of routing information and to preserve the
   overall IGP scalability, the solution SHOULD avoid any dynamic-TE-
   topology-related information from leaking across areas, even in a
   summarized form.

   Conversely, this does not preclude the leaking of non-topology-
   related information that is not taken into account during path
   selection, such as static TE Node information (TE router ids or TE
   node capabilities).

   Several methods may be used for path computation, including the
   following:

   - Per-area path computation based on ERO expansion on the head-end
     LSR and on ABRs, with two options for ABR selection:

         1) Static configuration of ABRs as loose hops at the head-end
            LSR.
         2) Dynamic ABR selection.

   - Inter-area end-to-end path computation, which may be based on (for
     instance) a recursive constraint-based searching thanks to
     collaboration between ABRs.

   Note that any path computation method may be used provided that it
   respect key objectives pointed out in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>.

   If a solution supports more than one method, it should allow the
   operator to select by configuration, and on a per-LSP basis, the
   desired option.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.6.%20%20Inter-Area%20Crankback%20Routing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.6" name="section-7.6">7.6</a>.  Inter-Area Crankback Routing</span>

   Crankback routing, as defined in [<a href="#ref-CRANKBACK" title='"Crankback Signaling Extensions for MPLS Signaling"'>CRANKBACK</a>], may be used for inter-
   area TE LSPs.  For paths computed thanks to ERO expansions with a
   dynamic selection of downstream ABRs, crankback routing can be used
   when there is no feasible path from a selected downstream ABR to the
   destination.  The upstream ABR or head-end LSR selects another
   downstream ABR and performs ERO expansion.

   Note that this method does not allow computing an optimal path but
   just a feasible path.  Note also that there can be 0(N^2) LSP setup
   failures before finding a feasible path, where N is the average
   number of ABR between two areas.  This may have a non-negligible
   impact on the LSP setup delay.

   Crankback may also be used for inter-area LSP recovery.  If a
   link/node/SRLG failure occurs in the backbone or tail-end area, the
   ABR upstream to the failure computes an alternate path and reroutes
   the LSP locally.

   An inter-area MPLS-TE solution MAY support [<a href="#ref-CRANKBACK" title='"Crankback Signaling Extensions for MPLS Signaling"'>CRANKBACK</a>].  A solution
   that does, MUST allow [<a href="#ref-CRANKBACK" title='"Crankback Signaling Extensions for MPLS Signaling"'>CRANKBACK</a>] to be activated/deactivated via
   signaling, on a per-LSP basis.

   There are several cases where the ability to compute diversely-routed
   TE-LSP paths may be desirable.  For instance, in the case of LSP
   protection, primary and backup LSPs should be diversely routed.
   Another example is the requirement to set up multiple diversely-
   routed TE LSPs between a pair of LSRs residing in different IGP
   areas.  For instance, when a single TE LSP satisfying the bandwidth
   constraint cannot be found between two end-points, a solution would
   consist of setting up multiple TE LSPs so that the sum of their
   bandwidth satisfy the bandwidth requirement.  In this case, it may be
   desirable to have these TE LSPs diversely routed in order to minimize
   the impact of a failure, on the traffic between the two end-points.

   Thus, the solution MUST be able to establish diversely-routed inter-
   area TE LSPs when diverse paths exist.  It MUST support all kinds of
   diversity (link, node, SRLG).

   The solution SHOULD allow computing an optimal placement of
   diversely-routed LSPs.  There may be various criteria to determine an
   optimal placement.  For instance, the placement of two diversely
   routed LSPs for load-balancing purposes may consist of minimizing
   their cumulative cost.  The placement of two diversely-routed LSPs
   for protection purposes may consist of minimizing the cost of the
   primary LSP while bounding the cost or hop count of the backup LSP.

   For inter-area TE LSPs whose head-end and tail-end LSRs reside in the
   same IGP area, there may be intra-area and inter-area feasible paths.
   If the shortest path is an inter-area path, an operator either may
   want to avoid, as far as possible, crossing area and thus may prefer
   selecting a sub-optimal intra-area path or, conversely, may prefer to
   use a shortest path, even if it crosses areas.  Thus, the solution
   should allow IGP area crossing to be enabled/disabled, on a per-LSP
   basis, for TE LSPs whose head-end and tail-end reside in the same IGP
   area.

   The solution MUST provide the ability to reoptimize in a minimally
   disruptive manner (make before break) an inter-area TE LSP, should a
   more optimal path appear in any traversed IGP area.  The operator
   should be able to parameterize such a reoptimization according to a
   timer or event-driven basis.  It should also be possible to trigger
   such a reoptimization manually.

   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to reoptimize an inter-area
   TE LSP locally within an area; i.e., while retaining the same set of
   transit ABRs.  The reoptimization process in that case MAY be
   controlled by the head-end LSR of the inter-area LSP, or by an ABR.
   The ABR should check for local optimality of the inter-area TE LSPs
   established through it on a timer or event driven basis.  The option
   of a manual trigger to check for optimality should also be provided.

   In some cases it is important to restrict the control of
   reoptimization to the Head-End LSR only.  Thus, the solution MUST
   allow for activating/deactivating ABR control of reoptimization, via
   signaling on a per LSP-basis.

   The solution SHOULD also provide the ability to perform an end-to-end
   reoptimization, potentially resulting in a change on the set of
   transit ABRs.  Such reoptimization can only be controlled by the
   Head-End LSR.

   In the case of head-end control of reoptimization, the solution
   SHOULD provide the ability for the inter-area head-end LSR to be
   informed of the existence of a more optimal path in a downstream area
   and keep a strict control over the reoptimization process.  Thus, the
   inter-area head-end LSR, once informed of a more optimal path in some
   downstream IGP areas, could decide to perform a make-before-break
   reoptimization gracefully (or not to), according to the inter-area
   TE-LSP characteristics.

   that different protection techniques SHOULD be usable in different
   parts of the network to protect an inter-area TE LSP.  This is of the
   utmost importance, particularly in the case of an ABR node failure,
   as this node typically carries a great deal of inter-area traffic.
   Moreover, the solution SHOULD allow computing and setting up a backup
   tunnel following an optimal path that offers bandwidth guarantees

   during failure, along with other potential constraints (such as
   bounded propagation delay increase along the backup path).

   The solution SHOULD allow ABRs to be protected, while providing the
   same level of performances (recovery delay, bandwidth consumption) as
   provided today within an area.

   Note that some signaling approaches may have an impact on FRR
   performances (recovery delay, bandwidth consumption).  Typically,
   when some intra-area LSPs (LSP-Segment, FA-LSPs) are used to support
   the inter-area TE LSP, the protection of ABR using [<a href="#ref-FAST-REROUTE" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>FAST-REROUTE</a>] may
   lead to higher bandwidth consumption and higher recovery delays.  The
   use of [<a href="#ref-FAST-REROUTE" title='"Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"'>FAST-REROUTE</a>] to protect ABRs, although ensuring the same
   level of performances, currently requires a single end-to-end RSVP
   session (contiguous LSP) to be used, without any intra-area LSP.
   Thus, the solution MUST provide the ability, via signalling on a
   per-LSP basis, to allow or preclude the use of intra-area LSPs to
   support the inter-area LSPs.

   In the case of a large inter-area MPLS deployment, potentially

   introduce some level of hierarchy in order to reduce the number of
   states on LSRs (such a solution implies other challenges).  Thus, the
   proposed solution SHOULD allow inter-area TE-LSP aggregation (also
   referred to as LSP nesting) so that individual TE LSPs can be carried
   onto one or more aggregating LSPs.  One such mechanism, for example,
   is described in [<a href="#ref-LSP-HIER" title='"LSP Hierarchy with Generalized MPLS TE"'>LSP-HIER</a>].

   This document does not introduce new security issues beyond those
   inherent in MPLS TE [<a href="#ref-RSVP-TE" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RSVP-TE</a>] and an inter-area MPLS-TE solution may
   use the same mechanisms proposed for that technology.  It is,
   however, specifically important that manipulation of administratively
   configurable parameters be executed in a secure manner by authorized
   entities.
