Abstract

   This document defines requirements for a baseline time-stamp policy
   for Time-Stamping Authorities (TSAs) issuing time-stamp tokens,
   supported by public key certificates, with an accuracy of one second
   or better.  A TSA may define its own policy which enhances the policy
   defined in this document.  Such a policy shall incorporate or further
   constrain the requirements identified in this document.

   The contents of this Informational RFC is technically equivalent to
   ETSI TS 102 023 V 1.2.1 (2002-06) [TS 102023].  The ETSI TS is under

   In creating reliable and manageable digital evidence it is necessary
   to have an agreed upon method of associating time data to transaction
   so that they might be compared to each other at a later time.  The
   quality of this evidence is based on creating and managing the data
   structure that represent the events and the quality of the parametric
   data points that anchor them to the real world.  In this instance
   this being the time data and how it was applied.

   A typical transaction is a digitally signed document, where it is
   necessary to prove that the digital signature from the signer was
   applied when the signer's certificate was valid.

   A timestamp or a time mark (which is an audit record kept in a secure
   audit trail from a trusted third party) applied to a digital
   signature value proves that the digital signature was created before
   the date included in the time-stamp or time mark.

   To prove the digital signature was generated while the signer's
   certificate was valid, the digital signature must be verified and the
   following conditions satisfied:

      1. the time-stamp (or time mark) was applied before the end of the
         validity period of the signer's certificate,

      2. the time-stamp (or time mark) was applied either while the
         signer's certificate was not revoked or before the revocation
         date of the certificate.

   Thus a time-stamp (or time mark) applied in this manner proves that
   the digital signature was created while the signer's certificate was
   valid. This concept proves the validity of a digital signature over
   the whole of any certificate chain.

   Policy requirements to cover that case is the primary reason of this
   document.  However, it should be observed that these policy
   requirements can be used to address other needs.

   The electronic time stamp is gaining interest from the business
   sector as an important component of electronic signatures.  It is
   also featured by the ETSI Electronic Signature Format standard [TS
   101733] or Electronic Signature Formats for long term electronic
   signatures [<a href="rfc3126.html">RFC 3126</a>], built upon the Time-Stamp Protocol [<a href="rfc3161.html">RFC 3161</a>].
   Agreed minimum security and quality requirements are necessary in
   order to ensure trustworthy validation of long-term electronic
   signatures.

   The European Directive 1999/93/EC [Dir 99/93/EC] defines
   certification service provider as "an entity or a legal or natural
   person who issues certificates or provides other services related to
   electronic signatures".  One example of a certification-service-
   provider is a Time-Stamping Authority.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>
   [<a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

   These policy requirements are aimed at time-stamping services used in
   support of qualified electronic signatures (i.e., in line with
   article 5.1 of the European Directive on a community framework for
   electronic signatures) but may be applied to any application
   requiring to prove that a datum existed before a particular time.

   These policy requirements are based on the use of public key
   cryptography, public key certificates and reliable time sources. The
   present document may be used by independent bodies as the basis for
   confirming that a TSA may be trusted for providing time-stamping
   services.

   This document addresses requirements for synchronizing TSAs issuing
   time-stamp tokens with Coordinated universal time (UTC) and digitally
   signed by TSUs.

   Subscriber and relying parties should consult the TSA's practice
   statement to obtain further details of precisely how this time-stamp
   policy is implemented by the particular TSA (e.g., protocols used in
   providing this service).

   This document does not specify:

      - protocols used to access the TSUs;

   time-stamp policy: named set of rules that indicates the
         applicability of a time-stamp token to a particular community
         and/or class of application with common security requirements.

   time-stamping unit: set of hardware and software which is managed as
         a unit and has a single time-stamp token signing key active at
         a time.

   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): Time scale based on the second as
         defined in ITU-R Recommendation TF.460-5 [<a href="#ref-TF.460-5">TF.460-5</a>].

         NOTE: For most practical purposes UTC is equivalent to mean
         solar time at the prime meridian.  More specifically, UTC is a
         compromise between the highly stable atomic time (Temps
         Atomique International
          - TAI) and solar time derived from the irregular Earth
         rotation (related to the Greenwich mean sidereal time (GMST) by
         a conventional relationship).  (See annex A for more details).

   UTC(k): Time-scale realized by the laboratory "k" and kept in close
         agreement with UTC, with the goal to reach plus or minus 100
         ns. (See ITU-R Recommendation TF.536-1 [<a href="#ref-TF.536-1">TF.536-1</a>]).

   The provision of time-stamping services is broken down into the
   following component services for the purposes of classifying
   requirements:

   -  Time-stamping provision: This service component generates
      time-stamp tokens.




<span class="grey">Pinkas, et al.               Informational                      [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3628.html">RFC 3628</a>       Requirements for Time-Stamping Authorities  November 2003</span>


   -  Time-stamping management: The service component that monitors and
      controls the operation of the time-stamping services to ensure
      that the service is provided as specified by the TSA.  This
      service component is responsibile  for the installation and
      de-installation of the time-stamping provision service. For
      example, time-stamping management ensures that the clock used for
      time-stamping is correctly synchronized with UTC.

   This subdivision of services is only for the purposes of clarifying
   the requirements specified in the current document and places no
   restrictions on any subdivision of an implementation of time-stamping
   services.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Time-Stamping%20Authority"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Time-Stamping Authority</span>

   The authority to issue time-stamp tokens, trusted by the users of the
   time-stamping services, i.e., subscribers and relying parties, is
   called the Time-Stamping Authority (TSA).  TSA has overall
   responsibility for time-stamping services identified in clause 4.1.
   The TSA has responsibility for the operation of one or more TSU's
   which creates and signs on behalf of the TSA.  The TSA responsible
   for issuing a time-stamp token is identifiable (see 7.3.1 h).

   The TSA may use other parties to provide parts of the Time-Stamping
   Services.  However, the TSA always maintains overall responsibility
   and ensures that the policy requirements identified in the present
   document are met.  For example, a TSA may sub-contract all the
   component services, including the services which generate time-stamp
   tokens using the TSU's keys.  However, the private key or keys used
   to generate the time-stamp tokens belong to the TSA which maintains
   overall responsibility for meeting the requirements in this document.

   A TSA may operate several identifiable time-stamping units.  Each
   unit has a different key.  See Annex B for possible implementations.

   A TSA is a certification-service-provider, as defined in the EU
   Directive on Electronic Signatures (see article 2(11)), which issues
   time-stamp tokens.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Subscriber"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Subscriber</span>

   The subscriber may be an organization comprising several end-users or
   an individual end-user.

   When the subscriber is an organization, some of the obligations that
   apply to that organization will have to apply as well to the end-
   users. In any case the organization will be held responsible if the

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3628.html">RFC 3628</a>       Requirements for Time-Stamping Authorities  November 2003</span>


   obligations from the end-users are not correctly fulfilled and
   therefore the organization is expected to suitably inform its end
   users.

   When the subscriber is an end-user, the end-user will be held
   directly responsible if its obligations are not correctly fulfilled.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20Time-Stamp%20Policy%20and%20TSA%20Practice%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Time-Stamp Policy and TSA Practice Statement</span>

   This section explains the relative roles of Time-stamp policy and TSA
   practice statement.  It places no restriction on the form of a time-
   stamp policy or practice statement specification.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.1.%20%20Purpose"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.1" name="section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  Purpose</span>

   In general, the time-stamp policy states "what is to be adhered to,"
   while a TSA practice statement states "how it is adhered to", i.e.,
   the processes it will use in creating time-stamps and maintaining the
   accuracy of its clock.  The relationship between the time-stamp
   policy and TSA practice statement is similar in nature to the
   relationship of other business policies which state the requirements
   of the business, while operational units define the practices and
   procedures of how these policies are to be carried out.

   The present document specifies a time-stamp policy to meet general
   requirements for trusted time-stamping services.  TSAs specify in TSA
   practice statements how these requirements are met.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.2.%20%20Level%20of%20Specificity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.2" name="section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>.  Level of Specificity</span>

   The TSA practice statement is more specific than a time-stamp policy.
   A TSA practice statement is a more detailed description of the terms
   and conditions as well as business and operational practices of a TSA
   in issuing and otherwise managing time-stamping services.  The TSA
   practice statement of a TSA enforces the rules established by a
   time-stamp policy.  A TSA practice statement defines how a specific
   TSA meets the technical, organizational and procedural requirements
   identified in a time-stamp policy.

   NOTE: Even lower-level internal documentation may be appropriate for
   a TSA detailing the specific procedures necessary to complete the
   practices identified in the TSA practice statement.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.3.%20%20Approach"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.3" name="section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.  Approach</span>

   The approach of a time-stamp policy is significantly different from a
   TSA practice statement.  A time-stamp policy is defined independently
   of the specific details of the specific operating environment of a



<span class="grey">Pinkas, et al.               Informational                      [Page 8]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3628.html">RFC 3628</a>       Requirements for Time-Stamping Authorities  November 2003</span>


   TSA, whereas a TSA practice statement is tailored to the
   organizational structure, operating procedures, facilities, and
   computing environment of a TSA.  A time-stamp policy may be defined
   by the user of times-stamp services, whereas the TSA practice
   statement is always defined by the provider.

   A time-stamp policy is a "named set of rules that indicates the
   applicability of a time-stamp token to a particular community and/or
   class of application with common security requirements" (see clauses
   3.1 and 4.4).

   The present document defines requirements for a baseline time-stamp
   policy for TSAs issuing time-stamp tokens, supported by public key
   certificates, with an accuracy of 1 second or better.

   NOTE 1: Without additional measures the relying party may not be able
   to ensure the validity of a time-stamp token beyond the end of the
   validity period of the supporting certificate.  See Annex C on
   verification of the validity of a time-stamp token beyond the
   validity period of the TSU's certificate.

   A TSA may define its own policy which enhances the policy defined in
   this document.  Such a policy shall incorporate or further constrain
   the requirements identified in this document.

   If an accuracy of better than 1 second is provided by a TSA and if
   all the TSUs have that same characteristics, then the accuracy shall
   be indicated in the TSA's disclosure statement (see <a href="#section-7.1.2">section 7.1.2</a>)
   that  each time-stamp token is issued with an accuracy of better than
   1 second.

   NOTE 2: It is required that a time-stamp token includes an identifier
   for the applicable policy (see <a href="#section-7.3.1">section 7.3.1</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Identification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Identification</span>

   The object-identifier [<a href="#ref-X.208">X.208</a>] of the baseline time-stamp policy is:
   itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) time-stamp-policy(2023)
   policy-identifiers(1) baseline-ts-policy (1)

   In the TSA disclosure statement made available to subscribers and
   relying parties, a TSA shall also include the identifier for the
   time-stamp policy to indicate its conformance.

   This policy is aimed at meeting the requirements of time-stamping
   qualified electronic signatures (see European Directive on Electronic
   Signatures) for long term validity (e.g., as defined in TS 101 733
   [TS 101733]), but is generally applicable to any requirement for an

   The TSA shall use the identifier for the time-stamp policy in time-
   stamp tokens as given in <a href="#section-5.2">section 5.2</a>, or define its own time-stamp
   policy that incorporates or further constrains the requirements
   identified in the present document:

   a) if the TSA claims conformance to the identified time-stamp policy
      and makes available to subscribers and relying parties on request
      the evidence to support the claim of conformance; or

   b) if the TSA has been assessed to conform to the identified time-
      stamp policy by an independent party.

   A conformant TSA must demonstrate that:

   a) it meets its obligations as defined in <a href="#section-6.1">section 6.1</a>;

   objective will be met.

      NOTE: The details of controls required to meet an objective is a
      balance between achieving the necessary confidence whilst
      minimizing the restrictions on the techniques that a TSA may
      employ in issuing time-stamp tokens.  In the case of <a href="#section-7.4">section 7.4</a>
      (TSA management and operation), a reference is made to a source of
      more detailed control requirements.  Due to these factors the
      specificity of the requirements given under a given topic may
      vary.

   The provision of a time-stamp token in response to a request is at
   the discretion of the TSA depending on any service level agreements

   The TSA shall ensure that any cryptographic keys are generated in
   under controlled circumstances.

   In particular:

   a) The generation of the TSU's signing key(s) shall be undertaken in
      a physically secured environment (see <a href="#section-7.4.4">section 7.4.4</a>) by personnel
      in trusted roles (see <a href="#section-7.4.3">section 7.4.3</a>) under, at least, dual

      shall be limited to those requiring to do so under the TSA's
      practices.

   b) The generation of the TSU's signing key(s) shall be carried out
      within a cryptographic module(s) which either:

      -  meets the requirements identified in FIPS 140-1 [FIPS 140-1]
         level 3 or higher, or

      -  meets the requirements identified in CEN Workshop Agreement
         14167-2 [CWA 14167-2], or

         which meets the requirements of the current document, based on
         a risk analysis and taking into account physical and other
         non-technical security measures.

      NOTE: Backup of TSU private keys is deprecated in order to
      minimize risk of key compromise.

   b) If TSU private keys are backed up, they shall be copied, stored
      and recovered only by personnel in trusted roles using, at least,
      dual control in a physically secured environment. (see <a href="#section-7.4.4">section</a>
      <a href="#section-7.4.4">7.4.4</a>).  The personnel authorized to carry out this function shall
      be limited to those requiring to do so under the TSA's practices.

   c) Any backup copies of the TSU private signing keys shall be
      protected to ensure its confidentiality by the cryptographic
      module before being stored outside that device.

   are maintained during its distribution to relying parties.

   In particular:

   a) TSU signature verification (public) keys shall be made available
      to relying parties in a public key certificate.

      NOTE: For example, TSU's certificates may be issued by a
      certification authority operated by the same organization as the
      TSA, or issued by another authority.

   b) The TSU's signature verification (public) key certificate shall be
      issued by a certification authority operating under a certificate
      policy which provides a level of security equivalent to, or higher
      than, this time-stamping policy.

   period of time that the chosen algorithm and key length is recognized
   as being fit for purpose (see <a href="#section-7.2.1">section 7.2.1</a>c)).

   NOTE 1: The following additional considerations apply when limiting
   that lifetime:

   -  <a href="#section-7.4.10">Section 7.4.10</a> requires that records concerning time-stamping
      services shall be held for a period of time,as appropriate, for at
      least 1 year after the expiration of the validity of the TSU's
      signing keys.  The longer the validity period of the TSU
      certificates will be, the longer the size of the records to be
      kept will be.

   -  Should a TSU private key be compromised, then the longer the
      life-time, the more affected time-stamp tokens there will be.

   NOTE 2: TSU key compromise does not only depend on the
   characteristics of the cryptographic module being used but also on
   the procedures being used at system initialization and key export
   (when that function is supported).

   The TSA shall ensure that TSU private signing keys are not used
   beyond the end of their life cycle.

   In particular:

   a) Operational or technical procedures shall be in place to ensure
      that a new key is put in place when a TSU's key expires.

   b) The TSU private signing keys, or any key part, including any
      copies shall be destroyed such that the private keys cannot be

   The TSA shall ensure in the case of events which affect the security
   of the TSA's services, including compromise of TSU's private signing
   keys or detected loss of calibration, that relevant information is
   made available to subscribers and relying parties.

   In particular:

   a) The TSA's disaster recovery plan shall address the compromise or
      suspected compromise of TSU's private signing keys or loss of
      calibration of a TSU clock, which may have affected time-stamp
      tokens which have been issued.

   b) In the case of a compromise, or suspected compromise or loss of
      calibration the TSA shall make available to all subscribers and
      relying parties a description of compromise that occurred.

   c) In the case of compromise to a TSU's operation (e.g., TSU key
      compromise), suspected compromise or loss of calibration the TSU
      shall not issue time-stamp tokens until steps are taken to recover
      from the compromise

   d) In case of major compromise of the TSA's operation or loss of
      calibration, wherever possible, the TSA shall make available to
      all subscribers and relying parties information which may be used
      to identify the time-stamp tokens which may have been affected,
      unless this breaches the privacy of the TSAs users or the security
      of the TSA services.

      NOTE:  In case the private key does become compromised, an audit
      trail of all tokens generated by the TSA may provide a means to
      discriminate between genuine and false backdated tokens.  Two
      time-stamp tokens from two different TSAs may be another way to
      address this issue.

   When verifying time-stamp tokens it is necessary for the verifier to
   ensure that the TSU certificate is trusted and not revoked.  This
   means that the security is dependent upon the security of the CA that
   has issued the TSU certificate for both issuing the certificate and
   providing accurate revocation status information for that
   certificate.

   When a time-stamp is verified as valid at a given point of time, this
   does not mean that it will necessarily remain valid later on.  Every
   time, a time-stamp token is verified during the validity period of
   the TSU certificate, it must be verified again against the current
   revocation status information, since in case of compromise of a TSU

   private key, all the time-stamp tokens generated by that TSU become
   invalid.  Annex C provides guidance about the long term verification
   of time-stamp tokens.

   In applying time-stamping to applications, consideration also needs
   to be given to the security of the application.  In particular, when
   applying time-stamps it is necessary to ensure that the integrity of
   data is maintained before the time-stamp is applied.  The requester
   ought to really make sure that the hash value included in the time-
   stamp token matches with the hash of the data.

Annex A (informative): Coordinated Universal Time

   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the international time standard
   that became effective on January 1, 1972.  UTC has superseded
   Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but in practice they are never more than 1
   second different.  Hence many people continue to refer to GMT when in
   fact they operate to UTC.

   Zero (0) hours UTC is midnight in Greenwich, England, which lies on
   the zero longitudinal meridian.  Universal time is based on a 24 hour
   clock, therefore, afternoon hours such as 4 pm UTC are expressed as
   16:00 UTC (sixteen hours, zero minutes).

   International Atomic Time (TAI) is calculated by the Bureau
   International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) from the readings of more
   than 200 atomic clocks located in metrology institutes and
   observatories in more than 30 countries around the world.
   Information on TAI is made available every month in the BIPM Circular
   T (<a href="ftp://62.161.69.5/pub/tai/publication">ftp://62.161.69.5/pub/tai/publication</a>).  It is that TAI does not
   lose or gain with respect to an imaginary perfect clock by more than
   about one tenth of a microsecond (0.0000001 second) per year.

   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): Time scale, based on the second, as
   defined and recommended by the International Telecommunications Radio
   Committee (ITU-R), and maintained by the Bureau International des
   Poids et Mesures (BIPM).  The maintenance by BIPM includes
   cooperation among various national laboratories around the world.
   The full definition of UTC is contained in ITU-R Recommendation
   TF.460-4.

   Atomic Time, with the unit of duration the Systeme International (SI)
   second defined as the duration of 9 192 631 770 cycles of radiation,
   corresponds to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the
   ground state of caesium 133.  TAI is the International Atomic Time
   scale, a statistical timescale based on a large number of atomic
   clocks.

   Universal Time (UT) is counted from 0 hours at midnight, with unit of
   duration the mean solar day, defined to be as uniform as possible
   despite variations in the rotation of the Earth.

      -  UT0 is the rotational time of a particular place of
         observation. It is observed as the diurnal motion of stars or
         extraterrestrial radio sources.

      -  UT1 is computed by correcting UT0 for the effect of polar
         motion on the longitude of the observing site.  It varies from
         uniformity because of the irregularities in the Earth's



<span class="grey">Pinkas, et al.               Informational                     [Page 35]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-36" id="page-36" name="page-36"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3628.html">RFC 3628</a>       Requirements for Time-Stamping Authorities  November 2003</span>


         rotation. UT1, is based on the somewhat irregular rotation of
         the Earth. Rotational irregularities usually result in a net
         decrease in the Earth's average rotational velocity, and
         ensuing lags of UT1 with respect to UTC.

   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the basis for international
   time-keeping and follows TAI exactly except for an integral number of
   seconds, 32 in year 2001.  These leap seconds are inserted on the
   advice of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS)
   (<a href="http://hpiers.obspm.fr/">http://hpiers.obspm.fr/</a>) to ensure that, having taken into account
   irregularities, the Sun is overhead within 0,9 seconds of 12:00:00
   UTC on the meridian of Greenwich.  UTC is thus the modern successor
   of Greenwich Mean Time, GMT, which was used when the unit of time was
   the mean solar day.

   Adjustments to the atomic, i.e., UTC, time scale consist of an
   occasional addition or deletion of one full second, which is called a
   leap second.  Twice yearly, during the last minute of the day of June
   30 and December 31, Universal Time, adjustments may be made to ensure
   that the accumulated difference between UTC and UT1 will not exceed
   0,9 s before the next scheduled adjustment.  Historically,
   adjustments, when necessary, have usually consisted of adding an
   extra second to the UTC time scale in order to allow the rotation of
   the Earth to "catch up". Therefore, the last minute of the UTC time
   scale, on the day when an adjustment is made, will have 61 seconds.
   Adjustments dates are typically announced several months in advance
   in IERS Bulletin C:
   <a href="ftp://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat">ftp://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat</a>.

   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) differs thus from TAI by an integral
   number of seconds.  UTC is kept within 0,9 s of UT1 by the
   introduction of one-second steps to UTC, the "leap second".  To date
   these steps have always been positive.

Annex B (informative): Possible for Implementation Architectures
        and Time-Stamping Services

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.1.%20%20Managed%20Time-Stamping%20Service"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.1" name="appendix-B.1">B.1</a>.  Managed Time-Stamping Service</span>

   Some organizations may be willing to host one or more Time-Stamping
   Units in order to take advantage of both the proximity and the
   quality of the Time-Stamping Service, without being responsible for
   the installation, operation and management of these Time-Stamping
   Units.

   This can be achieved by using units that are installed in the
   premises from the hosting organization and then remotely managed by a
   Time-Stamping Authority that takes the overall responsibility of the
   quality of the service delivered to the hosting organization.

               Figure B.1: Managed Time-stamping Service

   The requirements for time-stamping services described in the current
   document includes requirements on both the time-stamping management
   and for the operation of the unit which issues the time-stamp tokens.
   The TSA, as identified in the time-stamp token, has the
   responsibility to ensure that these requirements are met (for example
   through contractual obligations).

   It should be clear that the hosting organization will generally want
   to be able to monitor the use of the service and, at a minimum, know
   whether the service is working or not and even be able to measure the
   performances of the service, e.g., the number of time-stamps
   generated during some period of time.  Such monitoring can be
   considered to be outside of TSA's time-stamping authority.

   Therefore the description of the management operation described in
   the main body of the document is not limitative.  Monitoring
   operations, if performed directly on the unit, may be permitted by
   the Time-Stamping service provider.

   Some relying parties may be willing to take advantage of particular
   characteristics from a time-stamp token such as a specific signature
   algorithm and/or key length or a specific accuracy for the time
   contained in the time stamp token.  These parameters can be
   considered as specifying a "quality" for the time stamp token.

   Time stamp tokens with various qualities may be issued by different
   time-stamping units operated by the same or different TSAs.

   A particular time-stamping unit will only provide one combination of
   algorithm and key length (since a time-stamping unit is a set of
   hardware and software which is managed as a unit and has a single
   time-stamp token signing key).  In order to obtain different
   combinations of algorithm and key length, different time-stamping
   units shall be used.

   A particular time-stamping unit may provide a fixed accuracy for the
   time contained in the time stamp token or different accuracy if
   instructed to do so either by using a specific mode of access (e.g.,
   e-mail or http) or by using specific parameters in the request.

Annex C (informative): Long Term Verification of Time-Stamp Tokens

   Usually, a time-stamp token becomes unverifiable beyond the end of
   the validity period of the certificate from the TSU, because the CA
   that has issued the certificate does not warrant any more that it
   will publish revocation data, including data about revocations due to
   key compromises.  However, verification of a time-stamp token might
   still be performed beyond the end of the validity period of the
   certificate from the TSU, if, at the time of verification, it can be
   known that:

      - the TSU private key has not been compromised at any time up to
        the time that a relying part verifies a time-stamp token;

      - the hash algorithms used in the time-stamp token exhibits no
        collisions at the time of verification;

      - the signature algorithm and signature key size under which the
        time-stamp token has been signed is still beyond the reach of
        cryptographic attacks at the time of verification.

   If these conditions cannot be met, then the validity may be
   maintained by applying an additional time-stamp to protect the
   integrity of the previous one.

   The present document does not specify the details of how such
   protection may be obtained.  For the time being, and until some
   enhancements are defined to support these features, the information
   may be obtained using-out-of bands means or alternatively in the
   context of closed environments.  As an example, should a CA guaranty
   to maintain the revocation status of TSU certificates after the end
   of its validity period, this would fulfill the first requirement.

   NOTE 1: An alternative to Time-Stamping is for a Trusted Service
   Provider to record a representation of a datum bound to a particular
   time in an audit trail, thus establishing evidence that the datum
   existed before that time.  This technique, which is called Time-
   Marking, can be a valuable alternative for checking the long term
   validity of signatures.

   NOTE 2: The TSA or other trusted third party service provider may
   support the verification of time-stamp tokens.

Annex D (informative): Model TSA Disclosure Statement Structure.

   The TSA disclosure statement contains a section for each defined
   statement type.  Each section of a TSA disclosure statement contains
   a descriptive statement, which MAY include hyperlinks to the relevant
   certificate policy/certification practice statement sections.

   D.1.  STATEMENT TYPE: Entire agreement

         STATEMENT DESCRIPTION: A statement indicating that the
         disclosure statement is not the entire agreement, but only a
         part of it.

   D.2.  STATEMENT TYPE: TSA contact info

         STATEMENT DESCRIPTION: The name, location and relevant contact
         information for the TSA.

   D.3.  STATEMENT TYPE: time-stamp token types and usage

         STATEMENT DESCRIPTION: A description of each class/type of
         time-stamp tokens issued by the TSA (in accordance with each

         SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT: Indication of the policy being applied,
         including the contexts for which the time-stamp token can be
         used (e.g., only for use with electronic signatures), the
         hashing algorithms, the expected life time of the time-stamp
         token signature, any limitations on the use of the time-stamp
         token and information on how to verify the time-stamp token.
