Summary

   This RFC is a near-verbatim copy of a document, known as NADF-123,
   which has been produced by the North American Directory Forum (NADF).
   The NADF is a collection of organizations which offer, or plan to
   offer, public Directory services in North America, based on the CCITT
   X.500 Recommendations.  As a part of its charter, the NADF must reach
   agreement as to how entries are named in the public portions of the
   North American Directory.  NADF-123 is a scheme proposed for this
   purpose.  The NADF is circulating NADF-123 widely, expressly for the
   purpose of gathering comments.  The next meeting of the NADF is in
   mid-July, and it is important for comments to be received prior to
   the meeting, so that the scheme may receive adequate review.

   Computer networks form the infrastructure between the users they
   interconnect.  For example, the electronic mail service offered by
   computer networks provides a means for users to collaborate towards
   some common goal.  In the simplest cases, this collaboration may be
   solely for the dissemination of information.  In other cases, two

   users may work on a joint research project, using electronic mail as
   their primary means of communication.

   However, networks themselves are built on an underlying naming and
   numbering infrastructure, usually in the form of names and addresses.
   For example, some authority must exist to assign network addresses to
   ensure that numbering collisions do not occur.  This is of paramount
   importance for an environment which consists of multiple service
   providers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Approach"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Approach</span>

   It should be observed that there are several different naming
   universes that can be realized in the Directory Information Tree
   (DIT).  For example, geographical naming, community naming, political
   naming, organizational naming, and so on.  The choice of naming
   universe largely determines the difficulty in mapping a user's query
   into a series of Directory operations.  Although it is possible to
   simultaneously support multiple naming universes with the DIT, this
   is likely to be unnatural.  As such, this proposal focuses on a
   single naming universe.

   The naming universe in this proposal is based on civil authority.
   That is, it uses the existing civil naming infrastructure and
   suggests a (nearly) straight-forward mapping on the DIT.  There are
   four components to the naming architecture:

   (1)  civil naming and optimized civil naming, which reflects
        names assigned by civil authority;

   (2)  organizational naming, which reflects names assigned
        within organizations;

   (3)  ADDMD naming, which reflects names assigned to public
        providers within the Directory service; and,

   (4)  application naming, which reflects names assigned to OSI
        entities.

   An important characteristic is that entries should be listed wherever
   searches for them are likely to occur.  This implies that a single
   object may be listed under several entries.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Names%20and%20User-Friendliness"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Names and User-Friendliness</span>

   It must be emphasized that there are three distinct concepts which
   are often confused when discussing a naming scheme:




<span class="grey">NADF                                                            [Page 2]</span></pre>

   (1)  user-friendly naming: a property of a Directory which
        allows users to easily identity objects;

   (2)  user-friendly name: a technique for naming an object
        which exhibits "friendliness" according to an arbitrary
        set of user-criteria; and,

   (3)  Distinguished Name: the administratively assigned name
        for an entry in the OSI Directory.

   It must be emphasized that Distinguished Names are not necessarily
   user-friendly names, and further, that user-friendly naming in the
   Directory is a property of the Directory Service, not of
   Distinguished Names.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Choice%20of%20RDN%20Names"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Choice of RDN Names</span>

   The key aspect to appreciate for choice of RDNs is that they should
   provide a large name space to avoid collisions: the naming strategy
   must provide enough "real estate" to accommodate a large demand for
   entries.  This is the primary requirement for RDNs.  A secondary
   requirement is that RDNs should be meaningful (friendly to people)
   and should not impede searching.

   However, it is important to understand that this second requirement
   can be achieved by using additional (non-distinguished) attribute
   values.  For example, if the RDN of an entry is

                organizationName is Performance Systems International

   then it is perfectly acceptable (and indeed desirable) to have other
   values for the organizationName attribute, e.g.,

                organizationName is PSI

   The use of these abbreviated names greatly aids searching whilst
   avoiding unnecessary Distinguished Name conflicts.

   In order to appreciate the naming scheme which follows, it is
   important to understand that it leverages, wherever possible,
   existing naming infrastructure.  That is, it relies heavily on non-
   OSI naming authorities which already exist.  Note that inasmuch as it
   relies on existing naming authorities, there is little chance that
   any "final" national decision could obsolete it.  [Footnote: Any
   naming scheme may be subject to the jurisdiction of certain national
   agencies.  For example, the US State Department is concerned with any
   impact on US telecommunications treaty obligations.] (To do so would
   require a national decision that disregards existing national and

   different national naming infrastructure.)

   Civil naming occurs at three levels:

   (1)  the national level, which contains objects that are
        recognized throughout a country;

   (2)  the regional level, which contains objects that are
        recognized throughout a state or state-equivalent; and,

   (3)  the local level, which contains objects that are
        recognized within a populated place.

   At the national-level (at least) three kinds of names may be listed:

   (1)  The States and State-Equivalents

   (2)  Organizations with National Standing

   (3)  ADDMD Operators

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.%20%20The%20States%20and%20State-Equivalents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" name="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  The States and State-Equivalents</span>

   For each state or state-equivalent (the District of Columbia and the
   eight outlying areas [Footnote: i.e., American Samoa, Federated
   States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana
   Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands of the US.]), an
   instance of an

               usStateOrEquivalent

          object is used.  The RDN is formed as

               localityName is &lt;FIPS 5 name&gt;

          e.g.,

               localityName is California

   provides the RDN for the State of California.  In addition, this
   entry would contain attributes identifying both the FIPS 5 alpha and
   numeric code for the State, e.g.,

                fipsStateNumericCode is 06
                fipsStateAlphaCode is CA

   Of course, this entry could contain many other attributes such as

   There is no authority in the United States which unambiguously
   registers the alphanumeric names of organizations with national
   standing.  It is proposed that ANSI provide this registry and that

   accurately reflects their place of residence.

   For each person (wishing to have an entry in the Directory), an
   instance of a residentialperson

          object is used.  The RDN is usually multi-valued, formed with

               commonName is &lt;person's full name&gt;

   and some other attribute, such as postalCode, streetAddress, etc.
   However, because streetAddress is often considered private
   information, based on agreement with the entity managing the DMD and
   the listed person, some other, distinguishing attribute may be used,
   including a "serial number" (having no other purpose).  It should be
   noted however that this is non-helpful in regards to searching,
   unless other attribute values containing meaningful information are
   added to the entry and made available for public access.

   Consider how an interrogation algorithm might locate a residential

   (1)  a string denoting the person's real-world name;

   (2)  a string denoting the real-world name of the populated
        place in which the person lives; and,

   (3)  the Distinguished Name of the state or state-equivalent.

   A straight-forward approach is to initiate a single-level search to
   locate the desired populated place.  The search results in zero or
   more Distinguished Names being returned which correspond to the
   string provided by the user.  Then, for each populated place, a
   subtree search might be initiated to locate the desired residential
   person.  If the number of populated places returned by the first
   search is large, then this strategy is inefficient.

   A better approach would be to initiate a single search, with a filter
   combining the strings for both the person's real-world name and the
   place's real-world name.  Unfortunately, such a search would have to
   involve the whole-subtree anchored at the Distinguished Name for the
   state or state-equivalent, which would be inefficient.

   As such, it may be desirable to optimize the civil naming component
   by listing some entries at a higher level.  This is accomplished by
   using a multi-valued RDN formed by combining the RDNs of the entry
   and its superior.

   There are three cases in civil naming:

   (1)  listing an organization with regional standing at the
        national level;

   (2)  listing an organization with local standing at the
        regional level; and,

   (3)  listing a person with local standing at the regional
        level.

   Hence, under the optimized civil naming component, a single-level
   search, anchored at the Distinguished Name for the state or state-
   equivalent, could be used.  Further, the implementation of a DSA
   supporting this optimization would highly-index the attributes used
   for searching, in order to achieve high-performance.

   In order to clearly indicate that optimized civil naming is in
   effect, a new attribute type, nadfSearchGuide, is introduced.  An
   attribute value of this type is placed in an entry to indicate which
   optimizations are in effect.  Using the residential example above,
   the entry for the state or state-equivalent would contain an
   nadfSearchGuide value indicating that when searching for entries of
   type residentialPerson, a single-level search should be performed
   with a filter containing the logical-and of two terms, one involving
   the commonName attribute, and the other involving the localityName
   attribute.  The nadfSearchGuide is a refinement of the X.500

   searchGuide in that it indicates the depth of the search which should
   be performed, and always contains an indication of the object class
   for which the optimization exists.

   Finally, note that for naming within organizations, this technique
   might also be used.

Appendix A:  Naming Architecture

   There are two aspects to the naming architecture: a DIT structure and
   a set of related Schema definitions.  These are shown on pages 17 and
   18, respectively.

Appendix B:  Revision History of this Scheme

   The first version of this scheme (NADF-71) was contributed to the
   North American Directory Forum at its November 27--30, 1990 meeting.
   The (mis)features were:

   (1)  Because of the lack of confidence in ANSI registration
        procedures, it was proposed that the US trademarks be
        used as the basis for RDNs of organizations with
        national-standing.

        This proved unworkable since the same trademark may be
        issued to different organizations in different
        industries.

   (2)  There was no pre-existing registry used for populated
        places.

        This proved unworkable since the effort to define a new
        registry is problematic.

   The second version of this scheme was contributed to the ANSI
   Registration Authority Committee at its January 30, 1991 meeting, and
   the IETF OSI Directory Services Working Group at its February 12--13,

   (1)  The ANSI numeric name form registry was used as the basis
        for RDNs of organizations with national standings.

   (2)  The FIPS 5 state numeric code was used as the basis for
        RDNs of states and state-equivalents.

   (3)  The FIPS 55 place numeric code was used as the basis for
        RDNs of populated places.

   The choice of numeric rather than alphanumeric name forms was
   unpopular, but was motivated by the desire to avoid using the ANSI
   alphanumeric name form registry, which was perceived as unstable.

   The third version of this scheme was contributed to US State
   Department Study Group D's MHS-MD subcommittee at its March 7--8 1991
   meeting.  That version used alphanumeric name forms for all objects,
   under the perception that the ANSI alphanumeric name form registry
   will prove stable.  If the ANSI alphanumeric name form registry
   proves unstable, then two alternatives are possible:

   (1)  disallow organizations with national-standing in the US
        portion of the DIT; or,

   (2)  use the ANSI numeric name form registry instead.

   Hopefully neither of these two undesirable alternatives will prove
   necessary.

   The fourth version of this scheme (NADF-103) was contributed to the
   North American Directory Forum at its March 18--22, 1990 meeting.
   This version introduced the notion of organizations with regional
   standing being listed at the national level through the use of alias
   names and multi-valued RDNs.

   The current (fifth) version of this scheme (NADF-123) generalized the
   listing concept by introducing the notion of optimized civil naming.
   Further, the document was edited to clearly note the different naming
   components and the relation between them.
