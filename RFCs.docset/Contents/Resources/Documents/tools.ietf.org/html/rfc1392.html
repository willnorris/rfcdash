   unlimited.


Abstract

   There are many networking glossaries in existence.  This glossary
   concentrates on terms which are specific to the Internet.  Naturally,
   there are entries for some basic terms and acronyms because other
   entries refer to them.


Acknowledgements

   User Services Area of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
   Special thanks go to Jon Postel for his definitive definition of
   "datagram".

Glossary

   10BaseT
      A variant of Ethernet which allows stations to be attached via
      twisted pair cable.  See also: Ethernet, twisted pair.

   802.x
      The set of IEEE standards for the definition of LAN protocols.
      See also: IEEE.

   822
      See: <a href="rfc822.html">RFC 822</a>

   :-)
      This odd symbol is one of the ways a person can portray "mood" in
      the very flat medium of computers--by using "smiley faces".  This
      is "metacommunication", and there are literally hundreds of such
      symbols, from the obvious to the obscure.  This particular example
      expresses "happiness".  Don't see it?  Tilt your head to the left
      90 degrees.  Smiles are also used to denote sarcasm.
      [Source: ZEN]

   abstract syntax
      A description of a data structure that is independent of machine-
      oriented structures and encodings.
      [Source: <a href="rfc1208.html">RFC1208</a>]

   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
      The language used by the OSI protocols for describing abstract
      syntax.  This language is also used to encode SNMP packets.  ASN.1
      is defined in ISO documents 8824.2 and 8825.2.  See also: Basic
      Encoding Rules.

   Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
      Many transit networks have policies which restrict the use to
      which the network may be put.  A well known example is NSFNET's
      AUP which does not allow commercial use.  Enforcement of AUPs
      varies with the network.  See also: National Science Foundation.

   Access Control List (ACL)
      Most network security systems operate by allowing selective use of
      services.  An Access Control List is the usual means by which
      access to, and denial of, services is controlled.  It is simply a
      list of the services available, each with a list of the hosts
      permitted to use the service.

   ACK
      See: Acknowledgment

   acknowledgment (ACK)
      A type of message sent to indicate that a block of data arrived at
      its destination without error.  See also: Negative
      Acknowledgement.
      [Source: NNSC]

   ACL
      See: Access Control List

   AD
      See: Administrative Domain

   address
      There are three types of addresses in common use within the
      Internet.  They are email address; IP, internet or Internet
      address; and hardware or MAC address.  See also: email address, IP
      address, internet address, MAC address.

   address mask
      A bit mask used to identify which bits in an IP address correspond
      to the network and subnet portions of the address.  This mask is
      often referred to as the subnet mask because the network portion
      of the address can be determined by the encoding inherent in an IP
      address.

   address resolution
      Conversion of an internet address into the corresponding physical
      address.

   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
      Used to dynamically discover the low level physical network
      hardware address that corresponds to the high level IP address for
      a given host.  ARP is limited to physical network systems that
      support broadcast packets that can be heard by all hosts on the
      network.  It is defined in <a href="rfc826.html">RFC 826</a>.  See also: proxy ARP.

   Administrative Domain (AD)
      A collection of hosts and routers, and the interconnecting
      network(s), managed by a single administrative authority.

   Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)
      A pioneering longhaul network funded by ARPA (now DARPA).  It
      served as the basis for early networking research, as well as a
      central backbone during the development of the Internet.  The
      ARPANET consisted of individual packet switching computers
      interconnected by leased lines.  See also: Defense Advanced
      Research Projects Agency.

   agent
      In the client-server model, the part of the system that performs
      information preparation and exchange on behalf of a client or
      server application.
      [Source: <a href="rfc1208.html">RFC1208</a>]

   alias
      A name, usually short and easy to remember, that is translated
      into another name, usually long and difficult to remember.

   American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
      This organization is responsible for approving U.S. standards in
      many areas, including computers and communications.  Standards
      approved by this organization are often called ANSI standards
      (e.g., ANSI C is the version of the C language approved by ANSI).
      ANSI is a member of ISO.  See also: International Organization for
      Standardization.
      [Source: NNSC]

   American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
      A standard character-to-number encoding widely used in the
      computer industry.  See also: EBCDIC.

   anonymous FTP
      Anonymous FTP allows a user to retrieve documents, files,
      programs, and other archived data from anywhere in the Internet
      without having to establish a userid and password.  By using the
      special userid of "anonymous" the network user will bypass local
      security checks and will have access to publicly accessible files
      on the remote system.  See also: archive site, File Transfer
      Protocol.

   ANSI
      See: American National Standards Institute

   API
      See: Application Program Interface

   Appletalk
      A networking protocol developed by Apple Computer for
      communication between Apple Computer products and other computers.
      This protocol is independent of the network layer on which it is
      run.  Current implementations exist for Localtalk, a 235Kb/s local
      area network; and Ethertalk, a 10Mb/s local area network.
      [Source: NNSC]

   application layer
      The top layer of the network protocol stack.  The application
      layer is concerned with the semantics of work (e.g., formatting
      electronic mail messages).  How to represent that data and how to
      reach the foreign node are issues for lower layers of the network.

   checksum
      A computed value which is dependent upon the contents of a packet.
      This value is sent along with the packet when it is transmitted.
      The receiving system computes a new checksum based upon the
      received data and compares this value with the one sent with the
      packet.  If the two values are the same, the receiver has a high
      degree of confidence that the data was received correctly.

   Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
      The CERT was formed by DARPA in November 1988 in response to the
      needs exhibited during the Internet worm incident.  The CERT
      charter is to work with the Internet community to facilitate its
      response to computer security events involving Internet hosts, to
      take proactive steps to raise the community's awareness of
      computer security issues, and to conduct research targeted at
      improving the security of existing systems.  CERT products and
      services include 24-hour technical assistance for responding to
      computer security incidents, product vulnerability assistance,
      technical documents, and tutorials.  In addition, the team
      maintains a number of mailing lists (including one for CERT
      Advisories), and provides an anonymous FTP server, at "cert.org",
      where security-related documents and tools are archived.  The CERT
      may be reached by email at "cert@cert.org" and by telephone at

      and server functionalities (e.g., naming, distributed file system,
      remote procedure call) for distributing applications transparently
      across networks of heterogeneous computers.  Promoted and
      controlled by the Open Software Foundation (OSF), a consortium led
      by Digital, IBM and Hewlett Packard.

   distributed database
      A collection of several different data repositories that looks
      like a single database to the user.  A prime example in the
      Internet is the Domain Name System.

   DIX Ethernet
      See: Ethernet

   DNS
      See: Domain Name System

   domain
      "Domain" is a heavily overused term in the Internet.  It can be
      used in the Administrative Domain context, or the Domain Name
      context.  See also: Administrative Domain, Domain Name System.

   Domain Name System (DNS)
      The DNS is a general purpose distributed, replicated, data query
      service.  The principal use is the lookup of host IP addresses
      based on host names.  The style of host names now used in the
      Internet is called "domain name", because they are the style of
      names used to look up anything in the DNS.  Some important domains
      are: .COM (commercial), .EDU (educational), .NET (network
      operations), .GOV (U.S. government), and .MIL (U.S. military).
      Most countries also have a domain.  For example, .US (United
      States), .UK (United Kingdom), .AU (Australia).  It is defined in
      STD 13, RFCs 1034 and 1035.  See also: Fully Qualified Domain
      Name.

   dot address (dotted decimal notation)
      Dot address refers to the common notation for IP addresses of the
      form A.B.C.D; where each letter represents, in decimal, one byte
      of a four byte IP address.  See also: IP address.

   encapsulation
      The technique used by layered protocols in which a layer adds
      header information to the protocol data unit (PDU) from the layer
      above.  As an example, in Internet terminology, a packet would
      contain a header from the physical layer, followed by a header
      from the network layer (IP), followed by a header from the
      transport layer (TCP), followed by the application protocol data.

   fragment
      A piece of a packet.  When a router is forwarding an IP packet to
      a network that has a maximum packet size smaller than the packet
      size, it is forced to break up that packet into multiple
      fragments.  These fragments will be reassembled by the IP layer at
      the destination host.

   fragmentation

      Pronounced "gate-dee".  See also: Exterior Gateway Protocol, Open
      Shortest Path First..., Routing Information Protocol, routed.

   gateway
      The term "router" is now used in place of the original definition
      of "gateway".  Currently, a gateway is a communications
      device/program which passes data between networks having similar
      functions but dissimilar implementations.  This should not be
      confused with a protocol converter.  By this definition, a router
      is a layer 3 (network layer) gateway, and a mail gateway is a

   hierarchical routing
      The complex problem of routing on large networks can be simplified
      by reducing the size of the networks.  This is accomplished by
      breaking a network into a hierarchy of networks, where each level
      is responsible for its own routing.  The Internet has, basically,
      three levels: the backbones, the mid-levels, and the stub
      networks.  The backbones know how to route between the mid-levels,
      the mid-levels know how to route between the sites, and each site
      (being an autonomous system) knows how to route internally.  See
      also: Autonomous System, Exterior Gateway Protocol, Interior
      Gateway Protocol, stub network, transit network.

   layer
      Communication networks for computers may be organized as a set of
      more or less independent protocols, each in a different layer
      (also called level).  The lowest layer governs direct host-to-host
      communication between the hardware at different hosts; the highest
      consists of user applications.  Each layer builds on the layer
      beneath it.  For each layer, programs at different hosts use
      protocols appropriate to the layer to communicate with each other.
      TCP/IP has five layers of protocols; OSI has seven.  The
      advantages of different layers of protocols is that the methods of
      passing information from one layer to another are specified
      clearly as part of the protocol suite, and changes within a
      protocol layer are prevented from affecting the other layers.
      This greatly simplifies the task of designing and maintaining
      communication programs.  See also: Open Systems Interconnection,
      TCP/IP Protocol Suite.

      common shorthand which refers to the suite of transport and
      application protocols which runs over IP.  See also: IP, ICMP,
      TCP, UDP, FTP, Telnet, SMTP, SNMP.

   TELENET
      A public packet switched network using the CCITT X.25 protocols.
      It should not be confused with Telnet.

   Telnet
      Telnet is the Internet standard protocol for remote terminal
      connection service.  It is defined in STD 8, <a href="rfc854.html">RFC 854</a> and extended
      with options by many other RFCs.

   Terminal Access Controller (TAC)
      A device which connects terminals to the Internet, usually using
      dialup modem connections and the TACACS protocol.

   terminal emulator
      A program that allows a computer to emulate a terminal.  The
      workstation thus appears as a terminal to the remote host.
      [Source: MALAMUD]

   terminal server
      A device which connects many terminals to a LAN through one
      network connection.  A terminal server can also connect many
      network users to its asynchronous ports for dial-out capabilities
      and printer access.  See also: Local Area Network.

   Three Letter Acronym (TLA)
      A tribute to the use of acronyms in the computer field.  See also:
      Extended Four Letter Acronym.

   Time to Live (TTL)
      A field in the IP header which indicates how long this packet
      should be allowed to survive before being discarded.  It is
      primarily used as a hop count.  See also: Internet Protocol.
      [Source: MALAMUD]

   TLA
      See: Three Letter Acronym

   TN3270
      A variant of the Telnet program that allows one to attach to IBM
      mainframes and use the mainframe as if you had a 3270 or similar
      terminal.

   token ring
      A token ring is a type of LAN with nodes wired into a ring.  Each
      node constantly passes a control message (token) on to the next;
      whichever node has the token can send a message.  Often, "Token
      Ring" is used to refer to the IEEE 802.5 token ring standard,
      which is the most common type of token ring.  See also: 802.x,
      Local Area Network.

   topology
      A network topology shows the computers and the links between them.
      A network layer must stay abreast of the current network topology
      to be able to route packets to their final destination.
      [Source: MALAMUD]

   transceiver
      Transmitter-receiver.  The physical device that connects a host
      interface to a local area network, such as Ethernet.  Ethernet
      transceivers contain electronics that apply signals to the cable
      and sense collisions.
      [Source: <a href="rfc1208.html">RFC1208</a>]

   transit network
      A transit network passes traffic between networks in addition to
      carrying traffic for its own hosts.  It must have paths to at
      least two other networks.  See also: backbone, stub network.

   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
      An Internet Standard transport layer protocol defined in STD 7,
      <a href="rfc793.html">RFC 793</a>.  It is connection-oriented and stream-oriented, as
      opposed to UDP.  See also: connection-oriented, stream-oriented,
      User Datagram Protocol.

   Trojan Horse
      A computer program which carries within itself a means to allow
      the creator of the program access to the system using it.  See
      also: virus, worm.  See <a href="rfc1135.html">RFC 1135</a>.

   TTFN

   TTL
      See: Time to Live

   tunnelling
      Tunnelling refers to encapsulation of protocol A within protocol
      B, such that A treats B as though it were a datalink layer.
      Tunnelling is used to get data between administrative domains
      which use a protocol that is not supported by the internet

   UNIX-to-UNIX CoPy (UUCP)
      This was initially a program run under the UNIX operating system
      that allowed one UNIX system to send files to another UNIX system
      via dial-up phone lines.  Today, the term is more commonly used to
      describe the large international network which uses the UUCP
      protocol to pass news and electronic mail.  See also: Electronic
      Mail, Usenet.

   urban legend
      A story, which may have started with a grain of truth, that has
      been embroidered and retold until it has passed into the realm of
      myth.  It is an interesting phenonmenon that these stories get
      spread so far, so fast and so often.  Urban legends never die,
      they just end up on the Internet!  Some legends that periodically
      make their rounds include "The Infamous Modem Tax," "Craig
      Shergold/Brain Tumor/Get Well Cards," and "The $250 Cookie
      Recipe".
      [Source: LAQUEY]

   Usenet
      A collection of thousands of topically named newsgroups, the
      computers which run the protocols, and the people who read and
      submit Usenet news.  Not all Internet hosts subscribe to Usenet
      and not all Usenet hosts are on the Internet.  See also: Network
      News Transfer Protocol, UNIX-to-UNIX CoPy.

   User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
      An Internet Standard transport layer protocol defined in STD 6,
      <a href="rfc768.html">RFC 768</a>.  It is a connectionless protocol which adds a level of
      reliability and multiplexing to IP.  See also: connectionless,

   white pages
      The Internet supports several databases that contain basic
      information about users, such as email addresses, telephone
      numbers, and postal addresses.  These databases can be searched to
      get information about particular individuals.  Because they serve
      a function akin to the telephone book, these databases are often
      referred to as "white pages.  See also: Knowbot, WHOIS, X.500.

   WHOIS
      An Internet program which allows users to query a database of
      people and other Internet entities, such as domains, networks, and
      hosts, kept at the DDN NIC.  The information for people shows a
      person's company name, address, phone number and email address.
      See also: Defense Data Network Network ..., white pages, Knowbot,
      X.500.

   Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS)
      A distributed information service which offers simple natural
      language input, indexed searching for fast retrieval, and a
      "relevance feedback" mechanism which allows the results of initial
      searches to influence future searches.  Public domain
      implementations are available.  See also: archie, Gopher,

   worm
      A computer program which replicates itself and is self-
      propagating.  Worms, as opposed to viruses, are meant to spawn in
      network environments.  Network worms were first defined by Shoch &amp;
      Hupp of Xerox in ACM Communications (March 1982).  The Internet
      worm of November 1988 is perhaps the most famous; it successfully
      propagated itself on over 6,000 systems across the Internet.  See
