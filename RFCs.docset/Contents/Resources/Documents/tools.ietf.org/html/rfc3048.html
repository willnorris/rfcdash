Abstract

   This document describes a framework for the standardization of bulk-
   data reliable multicast transport.  It builds upon the experience
   gained during the deployment of several classes of contemporary
   reliable multicast transport, and attempts to pull out the
   commonalities between these classes of protocols into a number of
   building blocks.  To that end, this document recommends that certain
   components that are common to multiple protocol classes be
   standardized as "building blocks".  The remaining parts of the
   protocols, consisting of highly protocol specific, tightly
   intertwined functions, shall be designated as "protocol cores".
   Thus, each protocol can then be constructed by merging a "protocol
   core" with a number of "building blocks" which can be re-used across
   multiple protocols.

   <a href="rfc2357.html">RFC 2357</a> lays out the requirements for reliable multicast protocols
   that are to be considered for standardization by the IETF.  They
   include:

   o  Congestion Control.  The protocol must be safe to deploy in the
      widespread Internet.  Specifically, it must adhere to three
      mandates:  a) it must achieve good throughput (i.e., it must not
      consistently overload links with excess data or repair traffic),
      b) it must achieve good link utilization, and c) it must not
      starve competing flows.

   o  Scalability.  The protocol should be able to work under a variety
      of conditions that include multiple network topologies, link
      speeds, and the receiver set size.  It is more important to have a
      good understanding of how and when a protocol breaks than when it
      works.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3048.html">RFC 3048</a>                  RMT Building Blocks               January 2001</span>


   o  Security.  The protocol must be analyzed to show what is necessary
      to allow it to cope with security and privacy issues.  This
      includes understanding the role of the protocol in data
      confidentiality and sender authentication, as well as how the
      protocol will provide defenses against denial of service attacks.

   These requirements are primarily directed towards making sure that
   any standards will be safe for widespread Internet deployment.  The
   advancing maturity of current work on reliable multicast congestion
   control (RMCC) [<a href="#ref-HFW99" title='"Strawman Specification for TCP Friendly (Reliable) Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC),"'>HFW99</a>] in the IRTF Reliable Multicast Research Group
   (RMRG) has been one of the events that has allowed the IETF to
   charter the RMT working group.  RMCC only addresses a subset of the
   design space for reliable multicast.  Fortuitously, the requirements
   it addresses are also the most pressing application and market
   requirements.

   A protocol's ability to meet the requirements of congestion control,
   scalability, and security is affected by a number of secondary
   requirements that are described in a separate document [<a href="rfc2887.html" title='"The Reliable Multicast Design Space for Bulk Data Transfer"'>RFC2887</a>].  In
   summary, these are:

   o  Ordering Guarantees.  A protocol must offer at least one of either
      source ordered or unordered delivery guarantees.  Support for
      total ordering across multiple senders is not recommended, as it
      makes it more difficult to scale the protocol, and can more easily
      be implemented at a higher level.

   o  Receiver Scalability.  A protocol should be able to support a
      "large" number of simultaneous receivers per transport group.  A
      typical receiver set could be on the order of at least 1,000 -
      10,000 simultaneous receivers per group, or could even eventually
      scale up to millions of receivers in the large Internet.

   o  Real-Time Feedback.  Some versions of RMCC may require soft real-
      time feedback, so a protocol may provide some means for this
      information to be measured and returned to the sender.  While this
      does not require that a protocol deliver data in soft real-time,
      it is an important application requirement that can be provided
      easily given real-time feedback.

   o  Delivery Guarantees.  In many applications, a logically defined
      unit or units of data is to be delivered to multiple clients,
      e.g., a file or a set of files, a software package, a stock quote
      or package of stock quotes, an event notification, a set of
      slides, a frame or block from a video.  An application data unit
      is defined to be a logically separable unit of data that is useful
      to the application.  In some cases, an application data unit may
      be short enough to fit into a single packet (e.g., an event

      notification or a stock quote), whereas in other cases an
      application data unit may be much longer than a packet (e.g., a
      software package).  A protocol must provide good throughput of
      application data units to receivers.  This means that most data
      that is delivered to receivers is useful in recovering the
      application data unit that they are trying to receive.  A protocol
      may optionally provide delivery confirmation, i.e., a mechanism
      for receivers to inform the sender when data has been delivered.
      There are two types of confirmation, at the application data unit
      level and at the packet level.  Application data unit confirmation
      is useful at the application level, e.g., to inform the
      application about receiver progress and to decide when to stop
      sending packets about a particular application data unit.  Packet
      confirmation is useful at the transport level, e.g., to inform the
      transport level when it can release buffer space being used for
      storing packets for which delivery has been confirmed.  Packet
      level confirmation may also aid in application data unit
      confirmation.

   o  Network Topologies.  A protocol must not break the network when
      deployed in the full Internet.  However, we recognize that
      intranets will be where the first wave of deployments happen, and
      so are also very important to support.  Thus, support for
      satellite networks (including those with terrestrial return paths
      or no return paths at all) is encouraged, but not required.

   o  Group Membership.  The group membership algorithms must be
      scalable.  Membership can be anonymous (where the sender does not
      know the list of receivers), or fully distributed (where the
      sender receives a count of the number of receivers, and optionally
      a list of failures).

   o  Example Applications.  Some of the applications that a RM protocol
      could be designed to support include multimedia broadcasts, real
      time financial market data distribution, multicast file transfer,
      and server replication.

   In the rest of this document the following terms will be used with a
   specific connotation: "protocol family", "protocol component",
   "building block", "protocol core", and "protocol instantiation".  A
   "protocol family" is a broad class of RM protocols which share a
   common characteristic.  In our classification, this characteristic is
   the mechanism used to achieve reliability.  A "protocol component" is
   a logical part of the protocol that addresses a particular
   functionality.  A "building block" is a constituent of a protocol
   that implements one, more than one or a part of a component.  A
   "protocol core" is the set of functionality required for the

   instantiation of a complete protocol, that is not specified by any
   building block.  Finally a "protocol instantiation" is an actual RM
   protocol defined in term of building blocks and a protocol core.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Protocol%20Families"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Protocol Families</span>

   The design-space document [<a href="rfc2887.html" title='"The Reliable Multicast Design Space for Bulk Data Transfer"'>RFC2887</a>] also provides a taxonomy of the
   most popular approaches that have been proposed over the last ten
   years.  After congestion control, the primary challenge has been that
   of meeting the requirement for ensuring good throughput in a way that
   scales to a large number of receivers.  For protocols that include a
   back-channel for recovery of lost packets, the ability to take
   advantage of support of elements in the network has been found to be
   very beneficial for supporting good throughput for a large numbers of
   receivers.  Other protocols have found it very beneficial to transmit
   coded data to achieve good throughput for large numbers of receivers.

   This taxonomy breaks proposed protocols into four families.  Some
   protocols in the family provide packet level delivery confirmation
   that may be useful to the transport level.  All protocols in all
   families can be supplemented with higher level protocols that provide
   delivery confirmation of application data units.

   1  NACK only.  Protocols such as SRM [<a href="#ref-FJM95" title='"A Reliable Multicast Framework for Light-weight Sessions and Application Level Framing,"'>FJM95</a>] and MDP2 [<a href="#ref-MA99" title='"Multicast Dissemination Protocol version 2 (MDPv2),"'>MA99</a>] attempt
      to limit traffic by only using NACKs for requesting packet
      retransmission.  They do not require network infrastructure.

   2  Tree based ACK.  Protocols such as RMTP [<a href="#ref-LP96" title='"RMTP: A Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol,"'>LP96</a>, PSLM97], RMTP-II
      [<a href="#ref-WBPM98" title='"THE RMTP-II PROTOCOL,"'>WBPM98</a>] and TRAM [<a href="#ref-KCW98" title='"Tree-based reliable multicast (TRAM),"'>KCW98</a>], use positive acknowledgments (ACKs).
      ACK based protocols reduce the need for supplementary protocols
      that provide delivery confirmation, as the ACKS can be used for
      this purpose.  In order to avoid ACK implosion in scaled up
      deployments, the protocol can use servers placed in the network.

   3  Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC).  These protocols (examples
      include [<a href="#ref-RV97" title='"A Reliable Multicast Data Distribution Protocol Based on Software FEC Techniques,"'>RV97</a>] and [<a href="#ref-BLMR98" title='"A Digital Fountain Approach to Reliable Distribution of Bulk Data,"'>BLMR98</a>]) use sender-based Forward Error
      Correction (FEC) methods with no feedback from receivers or the
      network to ensure good throughput.  These protocols also used
      sender-based layered multicast and receiver-driven protocols to
      join and leave these layers with no feedback to the sender to
      achieve scalable congestion control.

   4  Router assist.  Like SRM, protocols such as PGM [<a href="#ref-FLST98" title='"PGM reliable transport protocol specification,"'>FLST98</a>] and
      [<a href="#ref-LG97" title='"Improving Internet Multicast Routing with Routing Labels,"'>LG97</a>] also use negative acknowledgments for packet recovery.
      These protocols take advantage of new router software to do
      constrained negative acknowledgments and retransmissions.  Router
      assist protocols can also provide other functionality more
      efficiently than end to end protocols.  For example, [<a href="#ref-LVS99" title='"Heterogeneous multicast congestion control based on router packet filtering"'>LVS99</a>] shows



<span class="grey">Whetten, et al.              Informational                      [Page 5]</span></pre>

      how router assist can provide fine grained congestion control for
      ALC protocols.  Router assist protocols can be designed to
      complement all protocol families described above.

   Note that the distinction in protocol families in not necessarily
   precise and mutually exclusive.  Actual protocols may use a
   combination of the mechanisms belonging to different classes.  For
   example, hybrid NACK/ACK based protocols (such as [<a href="#ref-WBPM98" title='"THE RMTP-II PROTOCOL,"'>WBPM98</a>]) are
   possible.  Other examples are protocols belonging to class 1 through
   3 that take advantage of router support.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Building%20Blocks%20Rationale"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Building Blocks Rationale</span>

   As specified in <a href="rfc2357.html">RFC 2357</a> [<a href="#ref-MRBP98" title='"IETF Criteria for Evaluating Reliable Multicast Transport and Application Protocols"'>MRBP98</a>], no single reliable multicast
   protocol will likely meet the needs of all applications.  Therefore,
   the IETF expects to standardize a number of protocols that are
   tailored to application and network specific needs.  This document
   concentrates on the requirements for "one-to-many bulk-data
   transfer", but in the future, additional protocols and building-
   blocks are expected that will address the needs of other types of
   applications, including "many-to- many" applications.  Note that
   bulk-data transfer does not refer to the timeliness of the data,
   rather it states that there is a large amount of data to be
   transferred in a session.  The scope and approach taken for the
   development of protocols for these additional scenarios will depend
   upon large part on the success of the "building-block" approach put
   forward in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Building%20Blocks%20Advantages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Building Blocks Advantages</span>

   Building a large piece of software out of smaller modular components
   is a well understood technique of software engineering.  Some of the
   advantages that can come from this include:

   o  Specification Reuse.  Modules can be used in multiple protocols,
      which reduces the amount of development time required.

   o  Reduced Complexity.  To the extent that each module can be easily
      defined with a simple API, breaking a large protocol in to smaller
      pieces typically reduces the total complexity of the system.

   o  Reduced Verification and Debugging Time.  Reduced complexity
      results in reduced time to debug the modules.  It is also usually
      faster to verify a set of smaller modules than a single larger
      module.

   o  Easier Future Upgrades.  There is still ongoing research in
      reliable multicast, and we expect the state of the art to continue
      to evolve.  Building protocols with smaller modules allows them to
      be more easily upgraded to reflect future research.

   o  Common Diagnostics.  To the extent that multiple protocols share
      common packet headers, packet analyzers and other diagnostic tools
      can be built which work with multiple protocols.

   o  Reduces Effort for New Protocols.  As new application requirements
      drive the need for new standards, some existing modules may be
      reused in these protocols.

   o  Parallelism of Development.  If the APIs are defined clearly, the
      development of each module can proceed in parallel.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Building%20Block%20Risks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Building Block Risks</span>

   Like most software specification, this technique of breaking down a
   protocol in to smaller components also brings tradeoffs.  After a
   certain point, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, and it is
   not worthwhile to further subdivide a problem.  These risks include:

   o  Delaying Development.  Defining the API for how each two modules
      inter-operate takes time and effort.  As the number of modules
      increases, the number of APIs can increase at more than a linear
      rate.  The more tightly coupled and complex a component is, the
      more difficult it is to define a simple API, and the less
      opportunity there is for reuse.  In particular, the problem of how
      to build and standardize fine grained building blocks for a
      transport protocol is a difficult one, and in some cases requires
      fundamental research.

   o  Increased Complexity.  If there are too many modules, the total
      complexity of the system actually increases, due to the
      preponderance of interfaces between modules.

   o  Reduced Performance.  Each extra API adds some level of processing
      overhead.  If an API is inserted in to the "common case" of packet
      processing, this risks degrading total protocol performance.

   o  Abandoning Prior Work.  The development of robust transport
      protocols is a long and time intensive process, which is heavily
      dependent on feedback from real deployments.  A great deal of work
      has been done over the past five years on components of protocols
      such as RMTP-II, SRM, and PGM.  Attempting to dramatically re-
      engineer these components risks losing the benefit of this prior
      work.

   Given these tradeoffs, we propose that a building block must meet the
   following requirements:

   o  Wide Applicability.  In order to have confidence that the
      component can be reused, it should apply across multiple protocol
      families and allow for the component's evolution.

   o  Simplicity.  In order to have confidence that the specification of
      the component APIs will not dramatically slow down the standards
      process, APIs must be simple and straight forward to define.  No
      new fundamental research should be done in defining these APIs.

   o  Performance.  To the extent possible, the building blocks should
      attempt to avoid breaking up the "fast track", or common case
      packet processing.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Protocol%20Components"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Protocol Components</span>

   This section proposes a functional decomposition of RM bulk-data
   protocols from the perspective of the functional components provided
   to an application by a transport protocol.  It also covers some
   components that while not necessarily part of the transport protocol,
   are directly impacted by the specific requirements of a reliable
   multicast transport.  The next section then specifies recommended
   building blocks that can implement these components.

   Although this list tries to cover all the most common transport-
   related needs of one-to-many bulk-data transfer applications, new
   application requirements may arise during the process of
   standardization, hence this list must not be interpreted as a
   statement of what the transport layer should provide and what it
   should not.  Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that some
   functional components have been deliberately omitted since they have
   been deemed irrelevant to the type of application considered (i.e.,
   one-to-many bulk-data transfer).  Among these are advanced message
   ordering (i.e., those which cannot be implemented through a simple
   sequence number) and atomic delivery.

   It is also worth mentioning that some of the functional components
   listed below may be required by other functional components and not
   directly by the application (e.g., membership knowledge is usually
   required to implement ACK-based reliability).

   The following list covers various transport functional components and
   splits them in sub-components.

                          | - Session Configuration/Monitoring

   o  Tree Configuration

   Note that not all components are required by all protocols, depending
   upon the fully defined service that is being provided by the
   protocol.  In particular, some minimal service models do not require
   many of these functions, including loss notification, loss recovery,
   and group membership.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Sub-Components%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Sub-Components Definition</span>

   Loss Detection/Notification.  This includes how missing packets are
   detected during transmission and how knowledge of these events are
   propagated to one or more agents which are designated to recover from
   the transmission error.  This task raises major scalability issues
   and can lead to feedback implosion and poor throughput if not
   properly handled.  Mechanisms based on TRACKs (tree-based positive
   acknowledgements) or NACKs (negative acknowledgements) are the most
   widely used to perform this function.  Mechanisms based on a
   combination of TRACKs and NACKs are also possible.

   Loss Recovery.  This function responds to loss notification events
   through the transmission of additional packets, either in the form of
   copies of those packets lost or in the form of FEC packets.  The
   manner in which this function is implemented can significantly affect
   the scalability of a protocol.

   Loss Protection.  This function attempts to mask packet-losses so
   that they don't become Loss Notification events.  This function can
   be realized through the pro-active transmission of FEC packets.  Each
   FEC packet is created from an entire application data unit [<a href="#ref-LMSSS97" title='"Practical Loss-Resilient Codes"'>LMSSS97</a>]
   or a portion of an application data unit [<a href="#ref-RV97" title='"A Reliable Multicast Data Distribution Protocol Based on Software FEC Techniques,"'>RV97</a>], [<a href="#ref-BKKKLZ95" title='"An XOR-based Erasure Resilient Coding Scheme,"'>BKKKLZ95</a>], a fact
   that allows a receiver to recover from some packet loss without
   further retransmissions.  The number of losses that can be recovered
   from without requiring retransmission depends on the amount of FEC
   packets sent in the first place.  Loss protection can also be pushed
   to the extreme when good throughput is achieved without any Loss
   Detection/Notification and Loss Recovery functionality, as in the ALC
   family of protocols defined above.

   Congestion Feedback.  For sender driven congestion control protocols,
   the receiver must provide some type of feedback on congestion to the
   sender.  This typically involves loss rate and round trip time
   measurements.

   Rate Regulation.  Given the congestion feedback, the sender then must
   adjust its rate in a way that is fair to the network.  One proposal
   that defines this notion of fairness and other congestion control
   requirements is [<a href="#ref-Whetten99" title='"A Proposal for Reliable Multicast Congestion Control Requirements,"'>Whetten99</a>].

   Receiver Controls.  In order to avoid allowing a receiver that has an
   extremely slow connection to the sender to stop all progress within
   single rate schemes, a congestion control algorithm will often
   require receivers to leave groups.  For multiple rate approaches,
   receivers of all connection speeds can have data delivered to them
   according to the rate of their connection without slowing down other
   receivers.

   Security.  Security for reliable multicast contains a number of
   complex and tricky issues that stem in large part from the IP
   multicast service model.  In this service model, hosts do not send
   traffic to another host, but instead elect to receive traffic from a
   multicast group. This means that any host may join a group and
   receive its traffic.  Conversely, hosts may also leave a group at any
   time.  Therefore, the protocol must address how it impacts the
   following security issues:

   o  Sender Authentication (since any host can send to a group),

   o  Data Encryption (since any host can join a group)

   o  Transport Protection (denial of service attacks, through
      corruption of transport state, or requests for unauthorized
      resources)

   o  Group Key Management (since hosts may join and leave a group at
      any time) [<a href="#ref-WHA98" title='"Key Management for Multicast: Issues and Architectures,"'>WHA98</a>]

   In particular, a transport protocol needs to pay particular attention
   to how it protects itself from denial of service attacks, through
   mechanisms such as lightweight authentication of control packets
   [<a href="#ref-HW99" title='"Security Requirements for RMTP-II,"'>HW99</a>].

   With Source Specific Multicast service model (SSM), a host joins
   specifically to a sender and group pair.  Thus, SSM offers more
   security against hosts receiving traffic from a denial of service
   attack where an arbitrary sender sends packets that hosts did not
   specifically request to receive.  Nevertheless, it is recommended
   that additional protections against such attacks should be provided
   when using SSM, because the protection offered by SSM against such
   attacks may not be enough.

   Sender Authentication, Data Encryption, and Group Key Management.
   While these functions are not typically part of the transport layer
   per se, a protocol needs to understand what ramifications it has on
   data security, and may need to have special interfaces to the
   security layer in order to accommodate these ramifications.

   Transport Protection.  The primary security task for a transport
   layer is that of protecting the transport layer itself from attack.
   The most important function for this is typically lightweight
   authentication of control packets in order to prevent corruption of
   state and other denial of service attacks.

   Membership Notification.  This is the function through which the data
   source--or upper level agent in a possible hierarchical
   organization--learns about the identity and/or number of receivers or
   lower level agents.  To be scalable, this typically will not provide
   total knowledge of the identity of each receiver.

   Membership Management.  This implements the mechanisms for members to
   join and leave the group, to accept/refuse new members, or to
   terminate the membership of existing members.

   Group Membership Tracking.  As an optional feature, a protocol may
   interface with a component which tracks the identity of each receiver
   in a large group.  If so, this feature will typically be implemented
   out of band, and may be implemented by an upper level protocol.  This
   may be useful for services that require tracking of usage of the
   system, billing, and usage reports.

   Session Advertisement.  This publishes the session name/contents and
   the parameters needed for its reception. This function is usually
   performed by an upper layer protocol (e.g., [<a href="#ref-HPW99" title='"Session Announcement Protocol,"'>HPW99</a>] and [<a href="#ref-HJ98" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>HJ98</a>]).

   Session Start/Stop.  These functions determine the start/stop time of
   sender and/or receivers.  In many cases this is implicit or performed
   by an upper level application or protocol.  In some protocols,
   however, this is a task best performed by the transport layer due to
   scalability requirements.

   Session Configuration/Monitoring.  Due to the potentially far
   reaching scope of a multicast session, it is particularly important
   for a protocol to include tools for configuring and monitoring the
   protocol's operation.

   Tree Configuration.  For protocols which include hierarchical
   elements (such as PGM and RMTP-II), it is important to configure
   these elements in a way that has approximate congruence with the
   multicast routing topology.  While tree configuration could be
   included as part of the session configuration tools, it is clearly
   better if this configuration can be made automatic.

   The families of protocols introduced in <a href="#section-1.1">section 1.1</a> generally use
   different mechanisms to implement the protocol functional components
   described in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>.  This section tries to group these mechanisms
   in macro components that define protocol building blocks.

   A building block is defined as
      "a logical protocol component that results in explicit APIs for use
      by other building blocks or by the protocol client."

   Building blocks are generally specified in terms of the set of
   algorithms and packet formats that implement protocol functional
   components.  A building block may also have API's through which it
   communicates to applications and/or other building blocks.  Most
   building blocks should also have a management API, through which it
   communicates to SNMP and/or other management protocols.

   In the following section we will list a number of building blocks
   which, at this stage, seem to cover most of the functional components
   needed to implement the protocol families presented in <a href="#section-1.1">section 1.1</a>.
   Nevertheless this list represents the "best current guess", and as
   such it is not meant to be exhaustive.  The actual building block
   decomposition, i.e., the division of functional components into
   building blocks, may also have to be revised in the future.

   This building block defines NACK-based loss detection/notification
   and recovery.  The major issues it addresses are implosion prevention
   (suppression) and NACK semantics (i.e., how packets to be
   retransmitted should be specified, both in the case of selective and
   FEC loss repair).  Suppression mechanisms to be considered are:

   o  Multicast NACKs
   o  Unicast NACKs and Multicast confirmation

   These suppression mechanisms primarily need to both minimize delay
   while also minimizing redundant messages.  They may also need to have
   special weighting to work with Congestion Feedback.

   This building block is concerned with packet level FEC information
   when FEC codes are used either proactively or as repairs in reaction
   to lost packets.  It specifies the FEC codec selection and the FEC
   packet naming (indexing) for both reactive FEC repair and pro-active
   FEC.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Congestion%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Congestion Control</span>

   There will likely be multiple versions of this building block,
   corresponding to different design policies in addressing congestion
   control.  Two main approaches are considered for the time being: a
   source-based rate regulation with a single rate provided to all the
   receivers in the session, and a multiple rate receiver-driven
   approach with different receivers receiving at different rates in the
   same session.  The multiple rate approach may use multiple layers of
   multicast traffic [<a href="#ref-VRC98" title='"TCP-Like Congestion Control for Layered Multicast Data Transfer"'>VRC98</a>] or router filtering of a single layer
   [<a href="#ref-LVS99" title='"Heterogeneous multicast congestion control based on router packet filtering"'>LVS99</a>].  The multiple rate approach is most applicable for ALC
   protocols.

   Both approaches are still in the phase of study, however the first
   seems to be mature enough [<a href="#ref-HFW99" title='"Strawman Specification for TCP Friendly (Reliable) Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC),"'>HFW99</a>] to allow the standardization
   process to begin.

   At the time of writing this document, a third class of congestion
   control algorithm based on router support is beginning to emerge in
   the IRTF RMRG [<a href="#ref-LVS99" title='"Heterogeneous multicast congestion control based on router packet filtering"'>LVS99</a>].  This work may lead to the future
   standardization of one or more additional building blocks for
   congestion control.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20Generic%20Router%20Support"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Generic Router Support</span>

   The task of designing RM protocols can be made much easier by the
   presence of some specific support in routers.  In some application-
   specific cases, the increased benefits afforded by the addition of
   special router support can justify the resulting additional
   complexity and expense [<a href="#ref-FLST98" title='"PGM reliable transport protocol specification,"'>FLST98</a>].

   Functional components which can take advantage of router support
   include feedback aggregation/suppression (both for loss notification
   and congestion control) and constrained retransmission of repair
   packets.  Another component that can take advantage of router support
   is intentional packet filtering to provide different rates of
   delivery of packets to different receivers from the same multicast
   packet stream.  This could be most advantageous when combined with
   ALC protocols [<a href="#ref-LVS99" title='"Heterogeneous multicast congestion control based on router packet filtering"'>LVS99</a>].

   The process of designing and deploying these mechanisms inside
   routers can be much slower than the one required for end-host
   protocol mechanisms.  Therefore, it would be highly advantageous to
   define these mechanisms in a generic way that multiple protocols can
   use if it is available, but do not necessarily need to depend on.

   This component has two halves, a signaling protocol and actual router
   algorithms.  The signaling protocol allows the transport protocol to
   request from the router the functions that it wishes to perform, and
   the router algorithms actually perform these functions.  It is more
   urgent to define the signaling protocol, since it will likely impact
   the common case protocol headers.

   An important component of the signaling protocol is some level of
   commonality between the packet headers of multiple protocols, which
   allows the router to recognize and interpret the headers.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.5.%20%20Tree%20Configuration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" name="section-4.5">4.5</a>.  Tree Configuration</span>

   It has been shown that the scalability of RM protocols can be greatly
   enhanced by the insertion of some kind of retransmission or feedback
   aggregation agents between the source and receivers.  These agents
   are then used to form a tree with the source at (or near) the root,
   the receivers at the leaves of the tree, and the aggregation/local
   repair nodes in the middle.  The internal nodes can either be
   dedicated software for this task, or they may be receivers that are
   performing dual duty.

   The effectiveness of these agents to assist in the delivery of data
   is highly dependent upon how well the logical tree they use to
   communicate matches the underlying routing topology.  The purpose of

   this building block would be to construct and manage the logical tree
   connecting the agents.  Ideally, this building block would perform
   these functions in a manner that adapts to changes in session
   membership, routing topology, and network availability.

   At the time of writing, the security issues are the subject of
   research within the IRTF Secure Multicast Group (SMuG).  Solutions
   for these requirements will be standardized within the IETF when
   ready.

   As pointed out in the generic router support section, it is important
   to have some level of commonality across packet headers.  It may also
   be useful to have common data header formats for other reasons.  This
   building block would consist of recommendations on fields in their
   packet headers that protocols should make common across themselves.

   The above building blocks consist of the functional components listed
   in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> that appear to meet the requirements for being
   implemented as building blocks presented in <a href="#section-2">section 2</a>.

   The other functions from <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>, which are not covered above,

   block works in progress must examine the denial-of-service attacks
   that can be made upon building blocks and affected by building blocks
   upon the Internet at large.  This requirement is in addition to any
   discussions regarding data-security, that is the manipulation of or

   In this document, we briefly described a number of building blocks
   that may be used for the generation of reliable multicast protocols
   to be used in the application space of one-to-many reliable bulk-data
   transfer.  The list of building blocks presented was derived from
   considering the functions that a protocol in this space must perform
   and how these functions should be grouped.  This list is not intended
   to be all-inclusive but instead to act as guide as to which building
   blocks are considered during the standardization process within the
   Reliable Multicast Transport WG.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20%20Acknowledgements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>.  Acknowledgements</span>

   This document represents an overview of a number of building blocks
   for one to many bulk data transfer that may be ready for
   standardization within the RMT working group.  The ideas presented
   are not those of the authors, rather they are a summarization of many
   years of research into multicast transport combined with the varied
   presentations and discussions in the IRTF Reliable Multicast Research
   Group.  Although they are too numerous to list here, we thank
   everyone who has participated in these discussions for their
