   Today, more and more managed devices contain batteries that supply
   them with power when disconnected from electrical power distribution
   grids.  Common examples are nomadic and mobile devices, such as
   notebook computers, netbooks, and smartphones.  The status of
   batteries in such a device, particularly the charging status, is
   typically controlled by automatic functions that act locally on the
   device and manually by users of the device.

   In addition to this, there is a need to monitor battery status of
   these devices by network management systems.  This document defines a
   portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) that provides a
   means for monitoring batteries in or attached to managed devices.
   The Battery MIB module defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> meets the requirements
   for monitoring the status of batteries specified in <a href="rfc6988.html">RFC 6988</a>
   [<a href="rfc6988.html" title='"Requirements for Energy Management"'>RFC6988</a>].

   The Battery MIB module provides for monitoring the battery status.
   According to the framework for energy management [<a href="rfc7326.html" title='"Energy Management Framework"'>RFC7326</a>], it is an
   Energy Managed Object; thus, MIB modules such as the Power and Energy
   Monitoring MIB [<a href="rfc7460.html" title='"Monitoring and Control MIB for Power and Energy"'>RFC7460</a>] could, in principle, be implemented for
   batteries.  The Battery MIB extends the more generic aspects of
   energy management by adding battery-specific information.  Amongst
   other things, the Battery MIB enables the monitoring of:

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7577.html">RFC 7577</a>                       Battery MIB                     July 2015</span>


   o  the current charge of a battery,

   o  the age of a battery (charging cycles),

   o  the state of a battery (e.g., being recharged),

   o  last usage of a battery, and

   o  maximum energy provided by a battery (remaining and total
      capacity).

   Further, means are provided for battery-powered devices to send
   notifications to inform the management system of needed replacement
   when the current battery charge has dropped below a certain
   threshold.  The same applies to the age of a battery.

   Many battery-driven devices have existing instrumentation for
   monitoring the battery status because this is already needed for
   local control of the battery by the device.  This reduces the effort
   for implementing the managed objects defined in this document.  For
   many devices, only additional software will be needed; no additional
   hardware instrumentation for battery monitoring is necessary.

   Since there are a lot of devices in use that contain more than one
   battery, means for battery monitoring defined in this document
   support addressing multiple batteries within a single device.  Also,
   batteries today often come in packages that can include
   identification and might contain additional hardware and firmware.
   The former allows tracing a battery and allows continuous monitoring
   even if the battery is installed in another device.  The firmware
   version is useful information as the battery behavior might be
   different for different firmware versions.

   Not explicitly in the scope of definitions in this document are very
   small backup batteries, for example, batteries used on a PC
   motherboard to run the clock circuit and retain configuration memory
   while the system is turned off.  Other means may be required for
   reporting on these batteries.  However, the MIB module defined in
   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> can be used for this purpose.

   A traditional type of managed device containing batteries is an
   Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system; these supply other devices
   with electrical energy when the main power supply fails.  There is
   already a MIB module for managing UPS systems defined in <a href="rfc1628.html">RFC 1628</a>
   [<a href="rfc1628.html" title='"UPS Management Information Base"'>RFC1628</a>].  The UPS MIB module includes managed objects for
   monitoring the batteries contained in a UPS system.  However, the
   information provided by the UPS MIB objects is limited and tailored
   to the particular needs of UPS systems.

   A huge variety of battery technologies are available, and they are
   evolving over time.  For different applications, different battery
   technologies are preferable, for example, because of different
   weight, cost, robustness, charging time, etc.  Some technologies,
   such as lead-acid batteries, are continuously in use for decades,
   while others, such as nickel-based battery technologies (nickel-
   cadmium and nickel-metal hydride), have, to a wide extent, been
   replaced by lithium-based battery technologies (lithium-ion and
   lithium polymer).

   The Battery MIB module uses a generic abstraction of batteries that
   is independent of particular battery technologies and expected to be
   applicable to future technologies as well.  While identification of a
   particular battery technology is supported by an extensible list of
   battery technology identifiers (see <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>), individual
   properties of the technologies are not modeled by the abstraction.
   In particular, methods for charging a battery, and the parameters of
   those methods, which vary greatly between different technologies are
   not individually modeled.

   Instead, the Battery MIB module uses a simple common charging model
   with batteries being in one of the following states: 'charging',
   'maintaining charge', 'not charging', and 'discharging'.  Control of
   the charging process is limited to requests for transitions between
   these states.  For charging controllers that use charging state
   engines with more states, implementations of the Battery MIB module
   need to map those states to the four listed above.

   For energy management systems that require finer-grained control of
   the battery charging process, additional means need to be developed;
   for example, MIB modules that model richer sets of charging states
   and parameters for charging states.

   All use cases sketched above assume that the batteries are contained
   in a managed entity.  In a typical case, this entity also hosts the
   SNMP applications (command responder and notification generator) and
   the charging controller for contained batteries.  For definitions in
   this document, it is not strictly required that batteries be
   contained in the same managed entity, even though the Battery MIB
   module (defined further below) uses the containment tree of the
   Entity MIB module [<a href="rfc6933.html" title='"Entity MIB (Version 4)"'>RFC6933</a>] for battery indexing.

   External batteries can be supported as long as the charging
   controller for these batteries is connected to the SNMP applications
   that implement the Battery MIB module.  An example with an external
   battery is shown in the figure below.  It illustrates that the
   Battery MIB module is designed as an interface between the management
   system and battery charging controller.  Out of scope of this

   The Battery MIB module defined in this document defines objects for
   reporting information about batteries.  All managed objects providing
   information on the status of a battery are contained in a single
   table called "batteryTable".  The batteryTable contains one
   conceptual row per battery.

   Batteries are indexed by the entPhysicalIndex of the
   entPhysicalTable defined in the Entity MIB module [<a href="rfc6933.html" title='"Entity MIB (Version 4)"'>RFC6933</a>].  An
   implementation of the Entity MIB module complying with the
   entity4CRCompliance MODULE-COMPLIANCE statement is required for
   compliant implementations of the Battery MIB module.

   If a battery is replaced, and the replacing battery uses the same
   physical connector as the replaced battery, then the replacing
   battery MUST be indexed with the same value of object
   entPhysicalIndex as the replaced battery.

   The kind of entity in the entPhysicalTable of the Entity MIB module
   is indicated by the value of enumeration object entPhysicalClass.
   All batteries SHOULD have the value of object entPhysicalClass set to
   battery(14) in their row of the entPhysicalTable.

   The batteryTable contains three groups of objects.  The first group
   (OIDs ending with 1-9) provides information on static properties of
   the battery.  The second group of objects (OIDs ending with 10-18)
   provides information on the current battery state, if it is charging
   or discharging, how much it is charged, its remaining capacity, the
   number of experienced charging cycles, etc.

   The third group of objects in this table (OIDs ending with 19-25) is
   used for notifications.  Threshold objects (OIDs ending with 19-24)
   indicate thresholds that can be used to raise an alarm if a property
   of the battery exceeds one of them.  Raising an alarm may include
   sending a notification.

   The Battery MIB defines seven notifications for indicating:

   1.  a battery-charging state change that was not triggered by writing
       to object batteryChargingAdminState,

   2.  a low-battery charging state,

   3.  a critical-battery state in which it cannot be used for power
       supply,

   4.  an aged battery that may need to be replaced,

   5.  a battery that has exceeded a temperature threshold,

   Static information in the batteryTable includes battery type and
   technology.  The battery type distinguishes primary (not
   rechargeable) batteries from rechargeable (secondary) batteries and
   capacitors.  The battery technology describes the actual technology
   of a battery, which typically is a chemical technology.

   Since battery technologies are the subject of intensive research and
   widely used technologies are often replaced by successor technologies
   within a few years, the list of battery technologies was not chosen
   as a fixed list.  Instead, IANA has created a registry for battery
   technologies at &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/battery-technologies">http://www.iana.org/assignments/battery-</a>
   <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/battery-technologies">technologies</a>&gt; where numbers are assigned to battery technologies.

   The table below shows battery technologies known today that are in
   commercial use with the numbers assigned to them by IANA.  New
   entries can be added to the IANA registry if new technologies are
   developed or if missing technologies are identified.  Note that there
   exists a huge number of battery types that are not listed in the IANA
   registry.  Many of them are experimental or cannot be used in an
   economically useful way.  New entries should be added to the IANA
   registry only if the respective technologies are in commercial use
   and relevant to standardized battery monitoring over the Internet.

   There are two identifiers to be used: the entPhysicalUUID defined in
   the Entity MIB [<a href="rfc6933.html" title='"Entity MIB (Version 4)"'>RFC6933</a>] module and the batteryIdentifier defined in
   this module.  A battery is linked to an entPhysicalUUID through the
   shared entPhysicalIndex.

   The batteryIdentifier uniquely identifies the battery itself while
   the entPhysicalUUID identifies the slot of the device in which the
   battery is (currently) contained.  For a non-replaceable battery,
   both identifiers are always linked to the same physical battery.  But



<span class="grey">Quittek, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 9]</span></pre>

   for batteries that can be replaced, the identifiers have different
   functions.

   The entPhysicalUUID is always the same for a certain battery slot of
   a containing device even if the contained battery is replaced by
   another.  The batteryIdentifier is a representation of the battery
   identifier set by the battery manufacturer.  It is tied to the
   battery and usually cannot be changed.

   Many manufacturers deliver not just plain batteries but battery
   packages including additional hardware and firmware.  Typically,
   these modules include a battery identifier that can by retrieved by a
   device in which a battery has been installed.  The value of the
   object batteryIdentifier is an exact representation of this
   identifier.  The batteryIdentifier is useful when batteries are
   removed and reinstalled in the same device or in other devices.
   Then, the device or the network management system can trace batteries
   and achieve continuity of battery monitoring.

   The lifetime of a battery can be approximated using the measure of
   charging cycles.  A commonly used definition of a charging cycle is
   the amount of discharge equal to the design (or nominal) capacity of
   the battery [<a href="#ref-SBS" title='"Smart Battery Data Specification"'>SBS</a>].  This means that a single charging cycle may
   include several steps of partial charging and discharging until the
   amount of discharging has reached the design capacity of the battery.
   After that, the next charging cycle immediately starts.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.%20%20Charge%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" name="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Charge Control</span>

   Managed object batteryChargingOperState indicates the current
   operational charging state of a battery and is a read-only object.
   For controlling the charging state, object batteryChargingAdminState
   can be used.  Writing to this object initiates a request to adapt the
   operational state according to the value that has been written.

   By default, the batteryChargingAdminState object is set to notSet(1).
   In this state, the charging controller is using its predefined
   policies to decide which operational state is suitable in the current
   situation.

   Setting the value of object batteryChargingAdminState may result in
   not changing the state of the battery to this value or even in
   setting the charging state to another value than the requested one.
   Due to operational conditions and limitations of the implementation
   of the Battery MIB module, changing the battery status according to a
   set value of object batteryChargingAdminState might not be possible.

   For example, the charging controller might, at any time, decide to
   enter state discharging(5), if there is an operational need to use
   the battery for supplying power.

   The object batteryChargingAdminState will not automatically change
   when the object batteryChargingOperState changes.  If the operational
   state is changed, e.g., to the state discharging(5) due to
   operational conditions, the admin state will remain in its current
   state.  The charging controller SHOULD change the operational state
   to the state indicated by the object batteryChargingAdminState as
   soon as operational conditions allow this change.

   If a state change of the object batteryChargingAdminState is desired
   upon change of the operational state, the object
   batteryChargingOperState must be polled or the notification
   batteryChargingStateNotification must be used to get notified about
   the state change.  This could be used, e.g., if maintaining charge is
   not desired after fully charging a battery even if the charging
   controller and battery support it.  The object
   batteryChargingAdminState can then be set to doNotCharge(3) when the
   object batteryChargingOperState changes from charging(2) to
   maintainingCharge(3).  Another use case would be when performing
   several charge and discharge cycles for battery maintenance.

      DESCRIPTION
          "This object contains an identifier for the battery.

          Many manufacturers deliver not only simple batteries but
          battery packages including additional hardware and firmware.
          Typically, these modules include an identifier that can be
          retrieved by a device in which a battery has been installed.
          The identifier is useful when batteries are removed and
          reinstalled in the same or other devices.  Then, the device
          or the network management system can trace batteries and
          achieve continuity of battery monitoring.

          If the battery is identified by more than one value,
          for example, by a model number and a serial number,
          then the value of this object is a concatenation of these

          values, separated by the colon symbol ':'.  The values
          should be ordered so that a more significant value comes
          before a less significant one.  In the example above, the
          (more significant) model number would be first, and the serial
          number would follow: '&lt;model number&gt;:&lt;serial number&gt;'.

          If the battery identifier cannot be represented using the
          ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set, then a hexadecimal
          encoding of a binary representation of the entire battery
          identifier must be used.

          suitable.

          Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value charge(2)
          is a request to enter the operational state charging(2) until
          the battery is fully charged.  When the battery is fully
          charged, or if the battery was already fully charged or
          almost fully charged at the time of the request, the
          operational state will change to maintainingCharge(3) if the
          charging controller and the battery support the functionality
          of maintaining the charge, or it will change to noCharging(4)
          otherwise.

          Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value
          doNotCharge(3) is a request for entering operational
          state noCharging(4).

          Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value
          discharge(4) is a request for entering operational
          state discharging(5).  Discharging can be accomplished
          by ordinary use, applying a dedicated load, or any other
          means.  An example for applying this state is battery
          maintenance.  If the battery is empty or almost empty, the
          operational state will change to noCharging(4).
          The charging controller will decide which charge condition
          will be considered empty dependent on the battery
          technology used.  This is done to avoid damage on the
          battery due to deep discharge.

          Due to operational conditions and limitations of the
          implementation of the BATTERY-MIB module, changing the
          battery status according to a set value of object
          batteryChargingAdminState may not be possible.
          Setting the value of object batteryChargingAdminState
          may result in not changing the state of the battery
          to this value or even in setting the charging state
          to another value than the requested one.  For example,
          the charging controller might at any time decide to
          enter state discharging(5), if there is an operational need
          to use the battery for supplying power."

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection opens devices to attack.  These are the tables and objects
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  batteryChargingAdminState:
      Setting the battery charging state can be beneficial for an
      operator for various reasons such as charging batteries when the



<span class="grey">Quittek, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 33]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-34" id="page-34" name="page-34"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7577.html">RFC 7577</a>                       Battery MIB                     July 2015</span>


      price of electricity is low.  However, setting the charging state
      can be used by an attacker to discharge batteries of devices and
      thereby switching these devices off if they are powered solely by
      batteries.  In particular, if the batteryAlarmLowCharge and
      batteryAlarmLowVoltage can also be set, this attack will go
      unnoticed (i.e., no notifications are sent).

   o  batteryAlarmLowCharge and batteryAlarmLowVoltage:
      These objects set the threshold for an alarm to be raised when the
      battery charge or voltage falls below the corresponding one of
      them.  An attacker setting one of these alarm values can switch
      off the alarm by setting it to the 'off' value 0, or it can modify
      the alarm behavior by setting it to any other value.  The result
      may be loss of data if the battery runs empty without warning to a
      recipient expecting such a notification.

   o  batteryAlarmLowCapacity and batteryAlarmHighCycleCount:
      These objects set the threshold for an alarm to be raised when the
      battery becomes older and less performant than required for stable
      operation.  An attacker setting this alarm value can switch off
      the alarm by setting it to the 'off' value 0 or modify the alarm
      behavior by setting it to any other value.  This may lead to
      either a costly replacement of a working battery or use of
      batteries that are too old or too weak.  The consequence of the
      latter could be that, e.g., a battery cannot provide power long
      enough between two scheduled charging actions causing the powered
      device to shut down and potentially lose data.

   o  batteryAlarmHighTemperature and batteryAlarmLowTemperature:
      These objects set thresholds for an alarm to be raised when the
      battery rises above / falls below them.  An attacker setting one
      of these alarm values can switch off these alarms by setting them
      to the 'off' value '7fffffff'H, or it can modify the alarm
      behavior by setting them to any other value.  The result may be,
      e.g., an unnecessary shutdown of a device if
      batteryAlarmHighTemperature is set too low, there is damage to the
      device by temperatures that are too high if switched off or set to
      values that are too high, or there is damage to the battery when,
      e.g., it is being charged.  Batteries can also be damaged, e.g.,
      in an attempt to charge them at temperatures that are too low.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   All potentially sensible or vulnerable objects of this MIB module are
   in the batteryTable.  In general, there are no serious operational
   vulnerabilities foreseen in case of an unauthorized read access to
   this table.  However, corporate confidentiality issues need to be
   considered.  The following information or parts of it might be a
   trade secret:

   o  the number of batteries installed in a managed node (batteryIndex)

   o  properties of these batteries (batteryActualCapacity and
      batteryChargingCycleCount)

   o  the time at which the next replacement cycle for batteries can be
      expected (batteryAlarmLowCapacity and batteryAlarmHighCycleCount)

   o  the types of batteries in use and their firmware versions
      (batteryIdentifier, batteryFirmwareVersion, batteryType, and
      batteryTechnology)

   For any battery-powered device whose use can be correlated to an
   individual or a small group of individuals, the following objects
   have the potential to reveal information about those individuals'
   activities or habits (e.g., if they are near a power outlet, if they
   have been using their devices heavily, etc.):

   o  batteryChargingCycleCount

   o  batteryLastChargingCycleTime

   o  batteryChargingOperState

   o  batteryActualCharge

   o  batteryActualCurrent

   o  batteryTemperature

   o  batteryAlarmLowVoltage

   o  batteryAlarmLowCapacity

   o  batteryAlarmHighCycleCount

   o  batteryAlarmLowTemperature

   Implementers of this specification should use appropriate privacy
   protections as discussed in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> of "Requirements for Energy
   Management" [<a href="rfc6988.html" title='"Requirements for Energy Management"'>RFC6988</a>].  Battery monitoring of devices used by
   individuals or in homes should only occur with proper authorization.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [<a href="rfc3410.html" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [<a href="rfc3414.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC3414</a>] with the AES cipher algorithm [<a href="rfc3826.html" title='"The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Cipher Algorithm in the SNMP User-based Security Model"'>RFC3826</a>].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [<a href="rfc5591.html" title='"Transport Security Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5591</a>] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [<a href="rfc5592.html" title='"Secure Shell Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5592</a>] or TLS/DTLS [<a href="rfc6353.html" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC6353</a>].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   For ensuring extensibility of this list, IANA has created a registry
   for battery technologies at &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/battery-technologies">http://www.iana.org/assignments/battery-</a>
   <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/battery-technologies">technologies</a>&gt; and filled it with the initial list given in
   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.

   New assignments of numbers for battery technologies will be
   administered by IANA through Expert Review [<a href="rfc5226.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>RFC5226</a>].  Experts must
   check for sufficient relevance of a battery technology to be added
   according to the guidelines in <a href="#section-3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a>.
