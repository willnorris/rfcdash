Status of this Memo

   This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
   community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

IESG Note

   This document defines an Experimental protocol for the Internet
   community.  The IESG expects that a revised version of this protocol
   will be published as Proposed Standard protocol.  The Proposed
   Standard, when published, is expected to change from the protocol
   defined in this memo.  In particular, it is expected that the
   standards-track version of the protocol will incorporate strong
   authentication and privacy features, and that an "ipp:" URL type will
   be defined which supports those security measures.  Other changes to
   the protocol are also possible.  Implementors are warned that future
   versions of this protocol may not interoperate with the version of
   IPP defined in this document, or if they do interoperate, that some
   protocol features may not be available.

   The IESG encourages experimentation with this protocol, especially in
   combination with Transport Layer Security (TLS) [<a href="rfc2246.html">RFC 2246</a>], to help
   determine how TLS may effectively be used as a security layer for
   IPP.

Abstract

   This document is one of a set of documents, which together describe
   all aspects of a new Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP is an
   application level protocol that can be used for distributed printing
   using Internet tools and technologies. This document gives some
   advice to implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer
   Daemon). This document describes the mapping between (1) the commands
   and operands of the 'Line Printer Daemon (LPD) Protocol' specified in
   <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> and (2) the operations, operation attributes and job
   template attributes of the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP).  One
   of the purposes of this document is to compare the functionality of
   the two protocols.  Another purpose is to facilitate implementation
   of gateways between LPD and IPP.

   WARNING: <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> was not on the IETF standards track.  While <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc1179.html">1179</a> was intended to record existing practice, it fell short in some
   areas.  However, this specification maps between (1) the actual
   current practice of <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> and (2) IPP.  This document does not
   attempt to map the numerous divergent extensions to the LPD protocol
   that have been made by many implementers.

   The full set of IPP documents includes:

      Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol [<a href="rfc2567.html" title='"Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol"'>RFC2567</a>]
      Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the
      Internet Printing Protocol [<a href="rfc2568.html" title='"Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the Internet Printing Protocol"'>RFC2568</a>]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics [<a href="rfc2566.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2566</a>]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and Transport [<a href="rfc2565.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2565</a>]

      Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols (this document)

   The document, "Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol", takes
   a broad look at distributed printing functionality, and it enumerates
   real-life scenarios that help to clarify the features that need to be
   included in a printing protocol for the Internet. It identifies
   requirements for three types of users: end users, operators, and
   administrators. It calls out a subset of end user requirements that
   are satisfied in IPP/1.0. Operator and administrator requirements are
   out of scope for version 1.0.

   The document, "Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for
   the Internet Printing Protocol", describes IPP from a high level
   view, defines a roadmap for the various documents that form the suite
   of IPP specifications, and gives background and rationale for the
   IETF working group's major decisions.

   The document, "Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics",
   describes a simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes,
   and their operations. It introduces a Printer and a Job object. The
   Job object supports multiple documents per Job. It also addresses
   security, internationalization, and directory issues.

   The document, "Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and
   Transport", is a formal mapping of the abstract operations and
   attributes defined in the model document onto HTTP/1.1. It defines
   the encoding rules for a new Internet media type called '
   application/ipp'.

   This document "Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Implementer's Guide",
   gives advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP objects.

   The reader of this specification is expected to be familiar with the
   IPP Model and Semantics specification [<a href="rfc2566.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2566</a>], the IPP Encoding and
   Transport [RF2565], and the Line Printer Daemon (LPD) protocol
   specification [<a href="rfc1179.html" title='"Line Printer Daemon Protocol"'>RFC1179</a>] as described in <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a>.

   <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> was written in 1990 in an attempt to document existing LPD
   protocol implementations.  Since then, a number of undocumented
   extensions have been made by vendors to support functionality
   specific to their printing solutions.  All of these extensions
   consist of additional control file commands.  This document does not
   address any of these vendor extensions.  Rather it addresses existing
   practice within the context of the features described by <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a>.
   Deviations of existing practice from <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> are so indicated.

   Other LPD control file commands in <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> are obsolete. They are
   intended to work on "text" only formats and are inappropriate for
   many contemporary document formats that completely specify each page.
   This document does not address the support of these obsolete
   features.

   In the area of document formats, also known as page description
   languages (PDL), <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> defines a fixed set with no capability for
   extension.  Consequently, some new PDL's are not supported, and some
   of those that are supported are sufficiently unimportant now that
   they have not been registered for use with the Printer MIB [<a href="rfc1759.html" title='"Printer MIB"'>RFC1759</a>]
   and IPP [<a href="rfc2566.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2566</a>] [<a href="rfc2565.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2565</a>], though they could be registered if
   desired.  See the Printer MIB specification [<a href="rfc1759.html" title='"Printer MIB"'>RFC1759</a>] and/or the IPP
   Model specification [<a href="rfc2566.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2566</a>] for instructions for registration of
   document-formats with IANA.  IANA lists the registered document-
   formats as "printer languages".

   This document addresses the protocol mapping for both directions:
   mapping of the LPD protocol to the IPP protocol and mapping of the
   IPP protocol to the LPD protocol. The former is called the "LPD-to-
   IPP mapper" and the latter is called the "IPP-to-LPD mapper".

   This document is an informational document that is not on the
   standards track.  It is intended to help implementers of gateways
   between IPP and LPD.  It also provides an example, which gives
   additional insight into IPP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> uses the word "command" in two contexts: for over-the-wire
   operations and for command file functions. This document SHALL use
   the word "command" for the former and the phrase "functions" for the
   latter.  The syntax of the LPD commands is given using ABNF
   [<a href="rfc2234.html" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC2234</a>].

   The following tokens are used in order to make the syntax more
   readable:

      LF stands for %x0A (linefeed)
      SP stands for %x20.  (space)
      DIGIT stands for %x30-39 ("0" to "9")

   This section describes the mapping from LPD commands to IPP
   operations.  Each of the following sub-sections appear as sub-
   sections of <a href="rfc1179.html#section-5">section 5 of RFC 1179</a>.

   The following table summarizes the IPP operation that the mapper uses
   when it receives an LPD command. Each section below gives more
   detail:

   Command syntax:

     print-waiting-jobs = %x01 printer-name LF

   This command causes the LPD daemon check its queue and print any
   waiting jobs. An IPP printer handles waiting jobs without such a
   nudge.

   If the  mapper receives this LPD command, it SHALL ignore it and send
   no IPP operation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2%20Receive%20a%20printer%20job"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a> Receive a printer job</span>

   Command syntax:

     receive-job = %x02 printer-name LF

   The control file and data files mentioned in the following paragraphs
   are received via LPD sub-commands that follow this command. Their
   mapping to IPP commands and attributes is described later in this
   section.

   The mapper maps the 'Receive a printer job' command to either:

      - the Print-Job operation which includes a single data file or
      - the Create-Job operation followed by one Send-Document operation
        for each data file.

   If the IPP printer supports both Create-Job and Send-Document, and if
   a job consists of:

      - a single data file, the mapper SHOULD use the Print-Job
        operation, but MAY use the Create-Job and Send-Document
        operations.
      - more than one data file, the mapper SHALL use Create-Job
        followed by one Send-Document for each received LPD data file.

   If the IPP printer does not support both Create-Job and Send-
   Document, and if a job consists of:

      - a single data file, the mapper SHALL use the PrintJob
        operation.
      - more than one data file, the mapper SHALL submit each received
        LPD data file as a separate Print-Job operation (thereby
        converting a single LPD job into multiple IPP jobs).

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2569.html">RFC 2569</a>         Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols        April 1999</span>


   If the mapper uses Create-Job and Send-Document, it MUST send the
   Create-Job operation before it sends any Send-Document operations
   whether the LPD control file, which supplies attributes for Create-
   Job, arrives before or after all LPD data files.

   NOTE: This specification does not specify how the mapper maps: the
   LPD Printer-name operand to the IPP "printer-uri" operation
   attribute.

   The following three sub-sections gives further details about the
   mapping from LPD receive-a-printer-job sub-commands.  Each of the
   following subsections appear as sub-sections of section 6 of <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc1179.html">1179</a>.

   Sub-command syntax:

      abort-job = %x1 LF

   This sub-command of receive-a-printer-job is intended to abort any
   job transfer in process.

   If the mapper receives this sub-command, it SHALL cancel the job that
   it is in the process of transmitting.

   If the mapper is in the process of sending a Print-Job or Create-Job
   operation, it terminates the job either by closing the connection, or
   performing the Cancel-Job operation with the job-uri that it received
   from the Print-Job or Create-Job operation.

   NOTE: This sub-command is implied if at any time the connection
   between the LPD client and server is terminated before an entire
   print job has been transferred via an LPD Receive-a-printer-job
   request.

   Sub-command syntax:

   number-of-bytes = 1*DIGIT

   This sub-command is roughly equivalent to the IPP Create-Job
   operation.

   The mapper SHALL use the contents of the received LPD control file to
   create IPP operation attribute and job template attribute values to
   transmit with the Print-Job or Create-Job operation.

   job-number = 3DIGIT
   client-host-name = &lt;a host name&gt;

   This sub-command is roughly equivalent to the IPP Send-Document
   operation.

   The mapper SHALL use the contents of the received LPD data file as
   the data to transmit with the IPP Print-Job or Send-Document
   operation.

   Although <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> alludes to a method for passing an unspecified
   length data file by using an octet-count of zero, no implementations
   support this feature. The mapper SHALL reject a job that has a value
   of 0 in the number-of-bytes field.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3%20Send%20queue%20state%20%28short%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a> Send queue state (short)</span>

   Command syntax:

send-queue-short  = %x03 printer-name *(SP(user-name / job-number)) LF

   The mapper's response to this command includes information about the
   printer and its jobs. <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> specifies neither the information nor
   the format of its response. This document requires the mapper to
   follow existing practice as specified in this document.

   The mapper SHALL produce a response in the following format which
   consists of a printer-status line optionally followed by a heading
   line, and a list of jobs. This format is defined by examples below.
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> contains the ABNF syntax.

   A mapper SHOULD use the job attribute number-of-intervening-jobs
   rather than the job's position in a list of jobs to determine 'rank'
   because a Printer may omit jobs that it wants to keep secret. If a
   printer doesn't support the job attribute number-of-intervening-jobs,
   a mapper MAY use the job's position.

   Note: a Printer may set the value of job-originating-user-name to the
   authenticated user or to the value of "requesting-user-name",
   depending on the implementation and configuration. For a gateway, the
   authenticated user is the user-id of the gateway, but the
   "requesting-user-name" may contain the name of the user who is the
   gateway's client.

   In order to obtain the information specified above, The LPD-to-IPP
   mapper SHALL use the Get-Printer-Attributes operation to get
   printer-status and SHOULD use the Get-Jobs operation to get
   information about all of the jobs. If the LPD command contains job-
   numbers or user-names, the mapper MAY handle the filtering of the
   response. If the LPD command contains job-numbers but no user-names,
   the mapper MAY use Get-Job-Attributes on each converted job-number
   rather than Get-Jobs. If the LPD command contains a single user-name
   but no job-numbers, the mapper MAY use Get-Jobs with the my-jobs
   option if the server supports this option and if the server allows
   the client to be a proxy for the LPD user.

   NOTE: This specification does not define how the mapper maps the LPD
   Printer-name operand to the IPP "printer-uri" operation attribute.

   and host fields which are only in the long form, and b) the "size"
   field contains the single copy size of each file.  Thus the sum of
   the file sizes in the "size" field times the value of the "copies"
   field produces the value for the "Total Size" field in the short
   form. For fields other than the host and copies fields, see the
   preceding section.  For the host field see the table below.

   Command syntax:

      remove-jobs = %x05 printer-name SP agent
                          *(SP(user-name / job-number)) LF

   The agent operand is the user-name of the user initiating the
   remove-jobs command. The special user-name 'root' indicates a
   privileged user who can remove jobs whose user-name differs from the
   agent.

   The mapper SHALL issue one Cancel-Job operation for each job
   referenced by the remove-jobs command. Each job-number in the
   remove-jobs command references a single job. Each user-name in the
   remove-jobs command implicitly references all jobs owned by the
   specified user. The active job is implicitly referenced when the
   remove-jobs command contains neither job-numbers nor user-names. The
   mapper MAY use Get-Jobs to determine the job-uri of implicitly
   referenced jobs.

   The mapper SHALL not use the agent name of 'root' when end-users
   cancel their own jobs.  Violation of this rule creates a potential
   security violation, and it may cause the printer to issue a
   notification that misleads a user into thinking that some other
   person canceled the job.

   If the agent of a remove-jobs command for a job J is the same as the
   user name specified with the 'P' function in the control file for job
   J, then the mapper SHALL ensure that the initiator of the Cancel-Job
   command for job J is the same as job-originating-user for job J.

   Note: This requirement means that a mapper must be consistent in who
   the receiver perceives as the initiator of IPP operations. The mapper
   either acts as itself or acts on behalf of another user. The latter
   is preferable if it is possible. This consistency is necessary
   between Print-Job/Create-Job and Cancel-Job in order for Cancel-Job
   to work, but it is also desirable for other operations. For example,
   Get-Jobs may give more information about job submitted by the
   initiator of this operation.

   NOTE: This specification does not define how the mapper maps: (1) the
   LPD printer-name to the IPP "printer-uri" or (2) the LPD job-number
   to the IPP "job-uri".

   NOTE: This specification does not specify how the mapper maps the LPD
   user-name to the IPP job-originating-user because the mapper may use
   its own user-name with jobs.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20Mapping%20of%20LPD%20Control%20File%20Lines%20to%20IPP%20Operation%20and%20Job%20Template"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>. Mapping of LPD Control File Lines to IPP Operation and Job Template</span>
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Attributes"></a>   Attributes</span>

   This section describes the mapping from LPD control file lines
   (called 'functions') to IPP operation attributes and job template
   attributes.  The mapper receives the control file lines via the LPD
   receive-control-file sub-command.  Each of the LPD functions appear
   as sub-sections of <a href="rfc1179.html#section-7">section 7 of RFC 1179</a>.

   In LPD control file lines, the text operands have a maximum length of
   31 or 99 while IPP operation attribute and job template attribute
   values have a maximum of 255 or 1023 octets, depending on the
   attribute syntax.  Therefore, no data is lost.

   The mapper converts each supported LPD function to its corresponding
   IPP operation or job template attribute as defined by tables in the
   subsections that follow. These subsections group functions according
   to whether they are:

      - required with a job,
      - optional with a job
      - required with each document.

   In the tables below, each LPD value is given a name, such as 'h'. If
   an IPP value uses the LPD value, then the IPP value column contains
   the LPD name, such as 'h' to denote this.  Otherwise, the IPP value
   column specifies the literal value.

   The following LPD functions MUST be in a received LPD job. The mapper
   SHALL receive each of the following LPD functions and SHALL include
   the information as a operation or job template attribute with each
   IPP job.  The functions SHOULD be in the order 'H', 'P' and they
   SHOULD be the first two functions in the control file, but they MAY
   be anywhere in the control file and in any order:

   A mapper MAY send its own host rather than the client's host, and a
   mapper MAY send its own user-name as user identification rather than
   the client user. But in any case, the values sent SHALL be compatible
   with the Cancel-Job operation. The IPP operation MAY have no way to
   specify an originating host-name.

   The mapper SHALL include ipp-attribute-fidelity = true so that it
   doesn't have to determine which attributes a printer supports.

   The following LPD functions MAY be present in a received job. These
   functions SHOULD follow the required job functions and precede the

   If the mapper receives such an LPD function, the mapper SHALL include
   the corresponding IPP attribute with the value converted as specified

   attribute, the mapper SHALL NOT include the corresponding IPP

   Note: In practice, the 'f' LPD function is often overloaded. It is
   often used with any format of document data including PostScript and
   PCL data.

   Note: In practice, the 'l' LPD function is often used as a rough
   equivalent to the 'f' function.

   Note: When <a href="rfc1179.html">RFC 1179</a> was written, no implementation supported the 'o'
   function; instead 'f' was used for PostScript. Windows NT now sends '
   o' function for a PostScript file.

   Note: the value 'fff' of the 'f', 'l' and 'o' functions is the name
   of the data file as transferred, e.g. "dfA123woden".

   If the mapper receives any other lower case letter, the mapper SHALL
   reject the job because the document contains a format that the mapper
   does not support.

   The mapper determines the number of copies by counting the number of
   occurrences of each 'fff' file with one of the lower-case functions
   above. For example, if 'f dfA123woden' occurs 4 times, then copies
   has a value of 4. Although the LPD protocol allows the value of
   copies to be different for each document, the commands and the
   receiving print systems don't support this.

   Note: it is recommended that the order of the receive-control-file
   subcommand and the receive-data-file sub-command be configurable
   because either order fails for some print systems. Some print systems
   assume that the control file follows all data files and start
   printing immediately on receipt of the control file. When such a
   print system tries to print a data file that has not arrived, it
   produces an error.  Other print systems assume that the control file
   arrives before the data files and start printing when the first data
   file arrives. Such a system ignores the control information, such as
   banner page or copies.

   NOTE: This specification does not define the mapping between the IPP
   printer-uri and the LPD printer-name.

   The mapper SHALL send the IPP operation attributes and job template
   attributes received from the operation to the LPD printer by using
   the LPD receive-control-file sub-command. The mapper SHALL create the
   LPD job-number for use in the control file name, but the receiving
   printer MAY, in some circumstances, assign a different job-number to
   the job.  The mapper SHALL create the IPP job-id and IPP job-uri
   returned in the Print-Job response.

   NOTE: This specification does not specify how the mapper determines
   the LPD job-number, the IPP job-id or the IPP job-uri of a job that
   it creates nor does it specify the relationship between the IPP job-
   uri, IPP the job-id and the LPD job-number, both of which the mapper
   creates.  However, it is likely that the mapper will use the same
   integer value for both the LPD job-number and the IPP job-id, and
   that the IPP Job-uri is the printer's URI with the job-id
   concatenated on the end.

   The mapper SHALL send data received in the IPP operation to the LPD
   printer by using the LPD receive-data-file sub-command. The mapper
   SHALL specify the exact number of bytes being transmitted in the
   number-of-bytes field of the receive-data-file sub-command. It SHALL
   NOT use a value of 0 in this field.

   If the mapper, while it is transmitting a receive-a-printer-job
   command or sub-command, either detects that its IPP connection has
   closed or receives a Cancel-Job operation, the mapper SHALL terminate
   the LPD job either with the abort sub-command or the remove-jobs
   command.

   This document does not address error code conversion.

      - the mapper SHALL send the control file after it has received the

        file contains all the document-name and document-format values
        specified in the Send-Document and Send-URI operations.

      - the mapper SHALL send the control file either before all data

   LPD severely limits the set of attributes that the mapper is able to
   return in its response for this operation. The mapper SHALL support,
   at most, the following printer attributes:

      - printer-state
      - printer-state-reasons

   The mapper uses either the long or short form of the "send queue
   state" command.

   The mapper SHALL assume that the LPD response that it receives has
   the format and information specified in <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a> "Send queue state
   (short)" and <a href="#section-3.4">section 3.4</a> "Send queue state (long)".  The mapper SHALL
   determine the value of each requested attribute by using the inverse
   of the mapping specified in the two aforementioned sections.

   Note: the mapper can determine the response from the printer-status
   line without examining the rest of the LPD response.

   LPD severely limits the set of attributes that the mapper is able to
   return in its response for this operation. The mapper SHALL support,
   at most, the following job attributes:

      - number-of-intervening-jobs
      - job-originating-user-name
      - job-id
      - document-name
      - job-k-octets
      - copies

   The mapper uses either the long or short form of the "send queue
   state" command. If it receives a request for the "job-k-octets" or
   "copies" and supports the attribute it SHALL use the long form;
   otherwise, it SHALL use the short form.

   Note: the value of job-k-octets is the value in the short form
   divided by the number of "copies" which is on the long form only. Its
   value can also be determined by adding the "size" field values for
   each document in the job in the long form.

   The mapper SHALL assume that the LPD response that it receives has

   determine the value of each requested attribute by using the inverse
   of the mapping specified in the two aforementioned sections.

   Note: when the mapper uses the LPD short form, it can determine the
   response from the single LPD line that pertains to the job specified
   by the Get-Job-Attributes operation.

   Note: the mapper can use its correspondence between the IPP job-id,
   job-uri and the LPD job-number.

   The mapper SHALL perform this operation in the same way as Get-Job-
   Attributes except that the mapper converts all the LPD job-lines, and
   the IPP response contains one job object for each job-line in the LPD
   response.

   This section describes the mapping from IPP operation attributes and
   job template attributes to LPD control file lines (called '
   functions'). The mapper receives the IPP operation attributes and job
   template atributes via the IPP operation.  Each of the IPP operation
   attributes and job template attributes appear as sub-sections of
   <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> and 4.2 in the IPP model document [<a href="rfc2566.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2566</a>].

   In the context of LPD control file lines, the text operands have a
   maximum length of 31 or 99 while IPP operation attributes and job
   template attributes have a maximum of 255 or 1023 octets, depending
   on the attribute syntax.  Therefore, there may be some data loss if
   the IPP operation attribute and job template attribute values exceed
   the maximum length of the LPD equivalent operands.

   The mapper converts each supported IPP operation attribute and job
   template attribute to its corresponding LPD function as defined by
   tables in the subsections that follow. These subsections group
   functions according to whether they are:

   A mapper SHALL sends its own host rather than the client's host,
