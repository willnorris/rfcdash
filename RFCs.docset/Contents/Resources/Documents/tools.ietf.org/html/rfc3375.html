   The advent of shared domain name registration systems illustrates the
   utility of a common, generic protocol for registry-registrar
   interaction.  A standard generic protocol will allow registrars to
   communicate with multiple registries through a common interface,
   reducing operational complexity.  This document describes high level
   functional and interface requirements for a generic provisioning
   protocol suitable for registry-registrar operations.  Detailed
   technical requirements are not addressed in this document.

   IANA: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority

   IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

   IP Address: Either or both IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4

   IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6

   RRP: Registry-Registrar Protocol

   TLD: Top Level Domain.  A generic term used to describe both gTLDs
   and ccTLDs that exist under the top-level root of the domain name
   hierarchy.

   Exclusive Registration System: A domain name registration system in
   which registry services are limited to a single registrar.  Exclusive
   Registration Systems are either loosely coupled (in which case the
   separation between registry and registrar systems is readily
   evident), or tightly coupled (in which case the separation between
   registry and registrar systems is obscure).

   Name Space: The range of values that can be assigned within a
   particular node of the domain name hierarchy.

   Object: A generic term used to describe entities that are created,
   updated, deleted, and otherwise managed by a generic registry-
   registrar protocol.

   Registrant: An entity that registers domain names in a registry
   through the services provided by a registrar.  Registrants include
   individuals, organizations, and corporations.

   Registrar: An entity that provides front-end domain name registration
   services to registrants, providing a public interface to registry
   services.

   Registry: An entity that provides back-end domain name registration
   services to registrars, managing a central repository of information
   associated with domain name delegations.  A registry is typically
   responsible for publication and distribution of zone files used by
   the Domain Name System.

   Shared Registration System: A domain name registration system in
   which registry services are shared among multiple independent
   registrars.  Shared Registration Systems require a loose coupling
   between registrars and a registry.

   Thick Registry: A registry in which all of the information associated
   with registered entities, including both technical information
   (information needed to produce zone files) and social information
   (information needed to implement operational, business, or legal
   practices), is stored within the registry repository.

   Thin Registry: A registry in which all elements of the social
   information associated with registered entities is distributed
   between a shared registry and the registrars served by the registry.

   Zone: The complete set of information for a particular "pruned"
   subtree of the domain space.  The zone concept is described fully in
   [<a href="rfc1035.html" title='"Domain Names - Implementation and Specification"'>RFC1035</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20General%20Description"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. General Description</span>

   A basic understanding of domain name registration systems provides
   focus for the enumeration of functional and interface requirements of
   a protocol to serve those systems.  This section provides a high-
   level description of domain name registration systems to provide
   context for the requirements identified later in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20System%20Perspective"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a> System Perspective</span>

   A domain name registration system consists of a protocol and
   associated software and hardware that permits registrars to provide
   Internet domain name registration services within the name spaces
   administered by a registry.  A registration system can be shared
   among multiple competing registrars, or it can be served by a single
   registrar that is either tightly or loosely coupled with back-end
   registry services.  The system providing registration services for
   the .com, .net, and .org gTLDs is an example of a shared registration
   system serving multiple competing registrars.  The systems providing
   registration services for some ccTLDs and the .gov and .mil gTLDs are
   examples of registration systems served by a single registrar.

   Registrars access a registry through a protocol to register objects
   and perform object management functions.  Required functions include
   session management; object creation, update, renewal, and deletion;
   object query; and object transfer.

   A registry generates DNS zone files for the name spaces it serves.
   Zone files are created and distributed to a series of name servers
   that provide the foundation for the domain name system.

   Protocol users fall into two broad categories: entities that use
   protocol client implementations and entities that use protocol server
   implementations, though an entity can provide both client and server
   services if it provides intermediate services.  A protocol provides a
   loose coupling between these communicating entities.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4%20Assumptions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" name="section-2.4">2.4</a> Assumptions</span>

   There is one and only one registry that is authoritative for a given
   name space and zone.

   A registry can be authoritative for more than one name space and
   zone.  Some registry operations can be billable.  The impact of a
   billable operation can be mitigated through the specification of
   non-billable operations that allow a registrar to make informed
   decisions before executing billable operations.

   A registry can choose to implement a subset of the features provided
   by a generic registry-registrar protocol.  A thin registry, for
   example, might not provide services to register social information.
   Specification of minimal implementation compliance requirements is
   thus an exercise left for a formal protocol definition document that
   addresses the functional requirements specified here.

   A protocol that meets the requirements described here can be called
   something other than "Generic Registry Registrar Protocol".

   The requirements described in this document are not intended to limit
   the set of objects that can be managed by a generic registry-
   registrar protocol.

   Some objects, such as name servers and contacts, have utility in
   multiple registries.  However, maintaining disjoint copies of object
   information in multiple registries can lead to inconsistencies that
   have adverse consequences for the Internet.  For example, changing a
   name server name in one registry, but not in a second registry that
   refers to the server for domain name delegation, can produce
   unexpected DNS query results.

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] The protocol MUST provide services to associate an object

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] The protocol MUST provide services to register Internet domain
   names.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] The protocol MUST permit a starting and ending time for a domain
   name registration to be negotiated, thereby allowing a registry to
   implement policies allowing a range of registration validity periods
   (the start and end points in time during which one normally assumes
   that an object will be active), and enabling registrars to select a
   period for each registration they submit from within the valid range
   based on out-of-band negotiation between the registrar and the
   registrant.  Registries SHOULD be allowed to accept indefinitely
   valid registrations if the policy that they are implementing permits,
   and to specify a default validity period if one is not selected by a
   registrar.  Registries MUST be allowed to specify minimal validity
   periods consistent with prevailing or preferred practices for fee-
   for-service recovery.  The protocol MUST provide features to ensure
   that both registry and registrar have a mutual understanding of the
   validity period at the conclusion of a successful registration event.

   [<a id="ref-3" name="ref-3">3</a>] The protocol MUST provide services to register name servers.
   Name server registration MUST NOT be limited to a specific period of
   time.  Name servers MUST be registered with a valid IPv4 or IPv6
   address when a "glue record" is required for delegation.  A name
   server MAY be registered with multiple IP addresses.  Multiple name
   servers using distinct server names MAY share an IP address.

   [<a id="ref-4" name="ref-4">4</a>] The protocol MUST provide services to manage delegation of zone

   describing human and organizational entities.  Registration of social
   information MUST NOT be limited to a specific period of time.  Social

   (if applicable), postal code, and country), voice telephone number,
   email address, and facsimile telephone number.

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] The protocol MUST provide services to associate name servers with
   domain names to delegate authority for zones.  A domain name MAY have
   multiple authoritative name servers.  Name servers MAY be
   authoritative for multiple zones.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] The protocol MUST provide services to associate IP addresses with
   name servers.  A name server MAY have multiple IP addresses.  An IP
   address MAY be associated with multiple name server registrations.

   [<a id="ref-3" name="ref-3">3</a>] The protocol MUST provide services to associate social
   information with other objects.  Social information associations MUST
   be identified by type.  "Registrant" is an example social information
   type that might be associated with an object such as a domain name.

   [<a id="ref-4" name="ref-4">4</a>] The protocol MUST provide services to associate object management
   capabilities on a per-registrar basis.

   [<a id="ref-5" name="ref-5">5</a>] Some managed objects represent shared resources that might be
   referenced by multiple registrars.  The protocol MUST provide
   services that allow a registrar to associate an existing shared
   resource object with other registered objects sponsored by a second
   registrar.  For example, authority for the example.tld zone
   (example.tld domain object managed by registrar X) and authority for
   the test.tld zone (test.tld domain object managed by registrar Y)
   might be delegated to server ns1.example.tld (managed by registrar
   X).  Registrar X maintains administrative control over domain object
   example.tld and server object ns1.example.tld, and registrar Y
   maintains administrative control over domain object test.tld.
   Registrar Y does not have administrative control over server object
   ns1.example.tld.

   [<a id="ref-5" name="ref-5">5</a>] The protocol MUST provide services to confirm registrar
   authorization to transfer an object.

   [<a id="ref-6" name="ref-6">6</a>] The protocol MUST provide services that allow the requesting
   registrar to cancel a requested object transfer before the request
   has been approved or rejected by the original sponsoring registrar.
   Requests to cancel the transfer of registered objects MUST be limited
   to the registrar that requested transfer of the registered object.
   Unauthorized attempts to cancel the transfer of a registered object
   MUST be explicitly rejected.

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] The protocol MUST provide status indicators that identify the
   operational state of a domain name.  Indicators MAY be provided to
   identify a newly created state (the domain has been registered but
   has not yet appeared in a zone), a normal active state (the domain
   can be modified and is published in a zone), an inactive state (the
   domain can be modified but is not published in a zone because it has
   no authoritative name servers), a hold state (the domain can not be
   modified and is not published in a zone), a lock state (the domain
   can not be modified and is published in a zone), a pending transfer
   state, and a pending removal state.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] If provided, protocol indicators for hold and lock status MUST
   allow independent setting by both registry and registrar.

   [<a id="ref-3" name="ref-3">3</a>] A domain MAY have multiple statuses at any given time.  Some
   statuses MAY be mutually exclusive.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.6%20Transaction%20Completion%20Status"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6" name="section-3.6">3.6</a> Transaction Completion Status</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] The protocol MUST provide services that unambiguously note the
   success or failure of every transaction.  Individual success and
   error conditions MUST be noted distinctly.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20External%20Interface%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>. External Interface Requirements</span>

   External interfaces define the interaction points between a system
   and entities that communicate with the system.  Specific areas of
   interest include user interfaces, hardware interfaces, software
   interfaces, and communications interfaces.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1%20User%2C%20Hardware%2C%20and%20Software%20Interfaces"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a> User, Hardware, and Software Interfaces</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] The protocol MUST define a wire format for data exchange, not an
   application design for user, hardware, or software interfaces so that
   any application able to create the same bits on the wire, and to
   maintain the image of the same integrity constraints, is a valid
   implementation of the protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2%20Communications%20Interfaces"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a> Communications Interfaces</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Registries, registrars, and registrants interact using a wide
   spectrum of communications interfaces built upon multiple protocols,
   including transport layer protocols such as TCP and application layer
   protocols such as SMTP.  The protocol MUST only be run over IETF
   approved protocols that feature congestion control, such as TCP and
   SCTP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20Performance%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>. Performance Requirements</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Run-time performance is an absolutely critical aspect of protocol
   usability.  While performance is very heavily dependent on the
   hardware and software architecture that implements a protocol,
   protocol features can have a direct impact on the ability of the
   underlying architecture to provide optimal performance.  The protocol
   MUST be usable in both high volume and low volume operating
   environments.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20Design%20Constraints"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>. Design Constraints</span>

   Protocol designers need to be aware of issues beyond functional and
   interface requirements when balancing protocol design decisions.
   This section describes additional factors that might have an impact
   on protocol design, including standards compliance and hardware
   limitations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1%20Standards%20Compliance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a> Standards Compliance</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] The protocol MUST conform to current IETF standards.  Standards
   for domain and host name syntax, IP address syntax, security, and
   transport are particularly relevant.  Emerging standards for the
   Domain Name System MUST be considered as they approach maturity.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] The protocol MUST NOT reinvent services offered by lower layer
   protocol standards.  For example, the use of a transport that
   provides reliability is to be chosen over use of a non-reliable
   transport with the protocol itself using retransmission to achieve
   reliability.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2%20Hardware%20Limitations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" name="section-6.2">6.2</a> Hardware Limitations</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] The protocol MUST NOT define any features that preclude hardware
   independence.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20Service%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>. Service Attributes</span>

   Elements of service beyond functional and interface requirements are
   essential factors to consider as part of a protocol design effort.
   This section describes several important service elements to be
   addressed by protocol designers, including reliability, availability,
   scalability, maintainability, extensibility, and security.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1%20Reliability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a> Reliability</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Reliability is a measure of the extent to which a protocol
   provides a consistent, dependable level of service.  Reliability is
   an important attribute for a domain name management protocol.  An
   unreliable protocol increases the risk of data exchange errors, which
   at one extreme can have a direct impact on protocol usability and at
   the other extreme can introduce discontinuity between registry and
   registrar data stores.  The protocol MUST include features that
   maximize reliability at the application protocol layer. Services
   provided by underlying transport, session, and presentation protocols
   SHOULD also be considered when addressing application protocol
   reliability.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] The protocol MUST be run over the most reliable transport option
   available in a given environment.  The protocol MUST NOT implement a
   service that is otherwise available in an applicable standard
   transport.

   [<a id="ref-3" name="ref-3">3</a>] Default protocol actions for when a request or event times out
   MUST be well defined.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2%20Availability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" name="section-7.2">7.2</a> Availability</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Availability is a measure of the extent to which the services
   provided by a protocol are accessible for an intended use.
   Availability of an application layer protocol is primarily dependent
   on the software and hardware systems that implement the protocol.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3375.html">RFC 3375</a>                Generic RRP Requirements          September 2002</span>


   The protocol MUST NOT include any features that impinge on the
   underlying availability of the software and hardware systems needed
   to service the protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.3%20Scalability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3" name="section-7.3">7.3</a> Scalability</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Scalability is a measure of the extent to which a protocol can
   accommodate use growth while preserving acceptable operational
   characteristics.  The protocol MUST be capable of operating at an
   acceptable level as the load on registry and registrar systems
   increases.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.4%20Maintainability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.4" name="section-7.4">7.4</a> Maintainability</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Maintainability is a measure of the extent to which a protocol
   can be adapted or modified to address unforeseen operational needs or
   defects.  The protocol SHOULD be developed under the nominal working
   group processes of the IETF to provide a well-known mechanism for
   ongoing maintenance.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.5%20Extensibility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.5" name="section-7.5">7.5</a> Extensibility</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Extensibility is a measure of the extent to which a protocol can
   be adapted for future uses that were not readily evident when the
   protocol was originally designed.  The protocol SHOULD provide
   features that at a minimum allow for the management of new object
   types without requiring revisions to the protocol itself.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] The requirements described in this document are not intended to
   limit the set of objects that might be managed by the protocol.  The
   protocol MUST include features that allow extension to object types
   that are not described in this document.

   [<a id="ref-3" name="ref-3">3</a>] The protocol MUST provide an optional field within all commands
   whose format and use will be controlled by individual registry
   policy.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.6%20Security"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.6" name="section-7.6">7.6</a> Security</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Transactional privacy and integrity services MUST be available at
   some protocol layer.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] This document describes requirements for basic user
   identification and authentication services.  A generic protocol MAY
   include additional security services to protect against the attacks
   described here.  A generic protocol MUST depend on other-layered
   protocols to provide security services that are not provided in the
   generic protocol itself.  A generic protocol that relies on security

   services from other-layered protocols MUST specify the protocol
   layers needed to provide security services.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20Other%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>. Other Requirements</span>

   Certain aspects of anticipated operational environments have to be
   considered when designing a generic registry-registrar protocol.
   Areas of concern include database operations, operations, site
   adaptation, and data collection.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1%20Database%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" name="section-8.1">8.1</a> Database Requirements</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] The protocol MUST NOT have any database dependencies.  However,
   efficient use of database operations and resources has to be
   considered as part of the protocol design effort.  The protocol
   SHOULD provide atomic features that can be efficiently implemented to
   minimize database load.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2%20Operational%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" name="section-8.2">8.2</a> Operational Requirements</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Registry-registrar interactions at the protocol level SHOULD
   operate without human intervention.  However, intermediate services
   that preserve the integrity of the protocol MAY be provided.  For
   example, an intermediate service that determines if a registrant is
   authorized to register a name in a name space can be provided.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] The protocol MUST provide services that allow clients and servers
   to maintain a consistent understanding of the current date and time
   to effectively manage objects with temporal properties.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.3%20Site%20Adaptation%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.3" name="section-8.3">8.3</a> Site Adaptation Requirements</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Registries and registrars have varying business and operational
   requirements.  Several factors, including governance standards, local
   laws, customs, and business practices all play roles in determining
   how registries and registrars are operated.  The protocol MUST be
   flexible enough to operate in diverse registry-registrar
   environments.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.4%20Data%20Collection%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.4" name="section-8.4">8.4</a> Data Collection Requirements</span>

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] Some of the data exchanged between a registrar and registry might
   be considered personal, private, or otherwise sensitive.  Disclosure
   of such information might be restricted by laws and/or business
   practices.  The protocol MUST provide services to identify data
   collection policies.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] Some of the social information exchanged between a registrar and
   registry might be required to create, manage, or operate Internet or
   DNS infrastructure facilities, such as zone files.  Such information
   is subject to public disclosure per relevant IETF standards.

   [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] [<a href="rfc1035.html" title='"Domain Names - Implementation and Specification"'>RFC1035</a>] describes Internet host and domain names using
   characters traditionally found in a subset of the 7-bit US-ASCII
   character set.  More recent standards, such as [<a href="rfc2130.html" title='"The Report of the IAB Character Set Workshop"'>RFC2130</a>] and
   [<a href="rfc2277.html" title='"IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages"'>RFC2277</a>], describe the need to develop protocols for an
   international Internet.  These and other standards MUST be considered
   during the protocol design process to ensure world-wide usability of
   a generic registry registrar protocol.

   [<a id="ref-2" name="ref-2">2</a>] The protocol MUST allow exchange of data in formats consistent
   with current international agreements for the representation of such
   objects.  In particular, this means that addresses MUST include
   country, that telephone numbers MUST start with the international
   prefix "+", and that appropriate thought be given to the usability of
   information in both local and international contexts.  This means
   that some elements (like names and addresses) might need to be
   represented multiple times, or formatted for different contexts (for
   instance English/French in Canada, or Latin/ideographic in Japan).

   [<a id="ref-3" name="ref-3">3</a>] All date and time values specified in a generic registry-
   registrar protocol MUST be expressed in Universal Coordinated Time.
   Dates and times MUST include information to represent a four-digit
   calendar year, a calendar month, a calendar day, hours, minutes,
   seconds, fractional seconds, and the time zone for Universal
   Coordinated Time.  Calendars apart from the Gregorian calendar MUST
   NOT be used
