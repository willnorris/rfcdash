<meta content='This document describes the "Bump-In-the-Host" (BIH), a host based
protocol translation mechanism that allows a subset of applications
supporting only one IP address family to communicate with peers that
are reachable or supporting only the other address family.  This
specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided dual stack
or IPv6 only network connectivity. In the dual stack network case,
single address family applications in the host sometime will
communicate directly with other hosts using the different address
family. In the case of IPv6 only network or IPv6 only destination,
IPv4 originated communications have to be translated into IPv6. The
BIH makes the IPv4 applications think they talk to IPv4 peers and
hence hides the IPv6 from those applications.' name="DC.Description.Abstract"/>

            <span class="h1">Dual-Stack Hosts Using "Bump-in-the-Host" (BIH)</span>

Abstract

   Bump-in-the-Host (BIH) is a host-based IPv4 to IPv6 protocol
   translation mechanism that allows a class of IPv4-only applications
   that work through NATs to communicate with IPv6-only peers.  The host
   on which applications are running may be connected to IPv6-only or
   dual-stack access networks.  BIH hides IPv6 and makes the IPv4-only
   applications think they are talking with IPv4 peers by local
   synthesis of IPv4 addresses.  This document obsoletes <a href="rfc2767.html">RFC 2767</a> and
   <a href="rfc3338.html">RFC 3338</a>.

   This document describes Bump-in-the-Host (BIH), a successor and
   combination of the Bump-in-the-Stack (BIS)[<a href="rfc2767.html" title='"Dual Stack Hosts using the "'>RFC2767</a>] and Bump-in-the-
   API (BIA) [<a href="rfc3338.html" title='"Dual Stack Hosts Using "'>RFC3338</a>] technologies, which enable IPv4-only legacy
   applications to communicate with IPv6-only servers by synthesizing
   IPv4 addresses from AAAA records.  <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> describes the reasons
   for making <a href="rfc2767.html">RFC 2767</a> and <a href="rfc3338.html">RFC 3338</a> obsolete.

   The supported class of applications includes those that use DNS for
   IP address resolution and that do not embed IP address literals in
   application-protocol payloads.  This includes legacy client-server
   applications using the DNS that are agnostic to the IP address family
   used by the destination and that are able to do NAT traversal.  The
   synthetic IPv4 addresses shown to applications are taken from the
   private address pool of [<a href="rfc1918.html" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>] in order to ensure that possible
   NAT traversal techniques will be initiated.

   The IETF recommends using solutions based on dual stack or tunneling
   for IPv6 transition and specifically recommends against deployments
   utilizing double protocol translation.  Use of BIH together with a
   NAT64 is NOT RECOMMENDED [<a href="rfc6180.html" title='"Guidelines for Using IPv6 Transition Mechanisms during IPv6 Deployment"'>RFC6180</a>].

   BIH includes two major implementation alternatives: a protocol
   translator between the IPv4 and the IPv6 stacks of a host or an API
   translator between the IPv4 socket API module and the TCP/IP module.
   Essentially, IPv4 is translated into IPv6 at the socket API layer or
   at the IP layer, the former of which is the recommended
   implementation alternative.

   When BIH is implemented at the socket API layer, the translator
   intercepts IPv4 socket API function calls and invokes corresponding
   IPv6 socket API function calls to communicate with IPv6 hosts.

   When BIH is implemented at the network layer, the IPv4 packets are
   intercepted and converted to IPv6 using the IP conversion mechanism
   defined in the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT)
   [<a href="rfc6145.html" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>].  The protocol translation has the same benefits and
   drawbacks as SIIT.

   The location of the BIH refers to the location of the protocol
   translation function.  The location of the IPv4 address and DNS A
   record synthesis function is orthogonal to the location of the
   protocol translation and may or may not happen at the same location.

   BIH can be used whenever an IPv4-only application needs to

        Figure 2: Architecture of a dual-stack host using protocol
                     translation at the network layer

   Dual-stack hosts, defined in [<a href="rfc4213.html" title='"Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers"'>RFC4213</a>], need applications, TCP/IP
   modules, and addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6.  The proposed hosts in
   this document have an API or network-layer translator to allow legacy
   IPv4 applications to communicate with IPv6-only peers.  The BIH
   architecture consists of an Extension Name Resolver, an address
   mapper, and depending on implementation either a function mapper or a
   protocol translator.  It is worth noting that the Extension Name
   Resolver's placement is orthogonal to the placement of protocol
   translation.  For example, the Extension Name Resolver may reside in
   the socket API while protocol translation takes place at the network
   layer.

   The choice between the socket API- and network-layer architectures
   varies case by case.  While the socket API architecture alternative
   is the recommended one, it may not always be possible to choose.
   This may be the case, for example, when the used operating system
   does not allow modifications to be done for API implementations, but
   does allow the addition of virtual network interfaces and related
   software modules.  On the other hand, sometimes it may not be
   possible to introduce protocol translators inside the operating
   system, but it may be easy to modify implementations behind the API
   provided for applications.  The choice of architecture also depends
   on who is creating implementation of BIH.  For example, an

   application framework provider, an operating system provider, and a
   device vendor may all choose different approaches due their different
   positions.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Function%20Mapper"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Function Mapper</span>

   The function mapper translates an IPv4 socket API function into an
   IPv6 socket API function.

   When detecting IPv4 socket API function calls from IPv4 applications,
   the function mapper MUST intercept the function calls and invoke IPv6
   socket API functions that correspond to the IPv4 socket API
   functions.

   The function mapper MUST NOT perform function mapping when the
   application is initiating communications to the address range used by
   local synthesis and the address mapping table does not have an entry
   matching the address.

   See <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> for an informational list of functions that would be
   appropriate to intercept by the function mapper.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Protocol%20Translator"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Protocol Translator</span>

   The protocol translator translates IPv4 into IPv6, and vice versa,
   using the IP conversion mechanism defined in SIIT [<a href="rfc6145.html" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>].  To
   avoid unnecessary fragmentation, the host's IPv4 module SHOULD be
   configured with a small enough MTU (MTU of the IPv6 enabled link - 20
   bytes).

   Protocol translation cannot be performed for IPv4 packets sent to the
   IPv4 address range used by local synthesis and for which a mapping
   table entry does not exist.  The implementation SHOULD attempt to
   route such packets via IPv4 interfaces instead.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.%20%20Extension%20Name%20Resolver"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Extension Name Resolver</span>

   The Extension Name Resolver (ENR) returns an answer in response to
   the IPv4 application's name resolution request.

   In the case of the socket API-layer implementation alternative, when
   an IPv4 application tries to do a forward lookup to resolve names via
   the resolver library (e.g., gethostbyname()), BIH intercepts the
   function call and instead calls the IPv6 equivalent functions (e.g.,
   getaddrinfo()) that will resolve both A and AAAA records.  This
   implementation alternative is name resolution protocol agnostic;
   hence, it supports techniques such as "hosts-file", NetBIOS, mDNS,
   and anything else the underlying operating system uses.

   In the case of the network-layer implementation alternative, the ENR
   intercepts the A query and creates an additional AAAA query with
   similar content.  The ENR will then collect replies to both A and
   AAAA queries and, depending on results, either return an A reply
   unmodified or synthesize a new A reply.  If no reply for the A query
   is received after ENR-implementation-specific timeout, after
   reception of positive AAAA response, the ENR MAY choose to proceed as
   if there were only a AAAA record available for the destination.

   The network-layer implementation alternative will only be able to
   catch applications' name resolution requests that result in actual
   DNS queries; hence, it is more limited when compared to the socket
   API-layer implementation alternative.  Hence, the socket API-layer
   alternative is RECOMMENDED.

   In either implementation alternative, if a DNS A record reply
   contains non-excluded real IPv4 addresses, the ENR MUST NOT
   synthesize IPv4 addresses.

   The ENR asks the address mapper to assign a synthetic IPv4 address
   corresponding to each received IPv6 address if the A record query
   resulted in a negative response, all received real IPv4 addresses
   were excluded, or the A query timed out.  The timeout value is
   implementation specific and may be short in order to provide a good
   user experience.

   In the case of the API-layer implementation alternative, the ENR will
   simply make the API (e.g., gethostbyname) return the synthetic IPv4
   address.  In the case of the network-layer implementation
   alternative, the ENR synthesizes an A record for the assigned
   synthetic IPv4 address and delivers it up the stack.  If the response
   contains a CNAME or a DNAME record, then the CNAME or DNAME chain is
   followed until the first terminating A or AAAA record is reached.

   those that should not appear in the DNS or on the wire (see <a href="rfc6147.html#section-5.1.4">Section</a>

   When the ENR is implemented at the network layer, the A record
   synthesis can cause similar issues as are described in <a href="rfc6147.html#section-3">[RFC6147]
   section 3</a>.  While running BIH, the main resolver of the host SHOULD
   NOT perform validation of A records, as synthetic A records created
   by ENR would fail in validation.  While not running BIH, a host's
   resolver can use DNS Security (DNSSEC) in the same way that any other
   resolver can.  The ENR MAY support DNSSEC, in which case the (stub)
   resolver on a host can be configured to trust validations done by the
   ENR located at the network layer.  In some cases, the host's
   validating stub resolver can implement the ENR by itself.

   When the ENR is implemented at the socket API level, there are no
   issues with DNSSEC use, as the ENR itself uses socket APIs for DNS
   resolution.  This approach is RECOMMENDED.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.3.%20%20Reverse%20DNS%20Lookup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.3" name="section-2.3.3">2.3.3</a>.  Reverse DNS Lookup</span>

   When an application requests a reverse lookup (PTR query) for an IPv4
   address, the ENR MUST check whether the queried IPv4 address can be
   found in the address mapper's mapping table and if it is a synthetic
   IPv4 address.  If an entry is found and the queried IPv4 address is
   synthetic, the ENR MUST initiate a corresponding reverse lookup for
   the real IPv6 address.  In the case where the application requested a
   reverse lookup for an address not part of the synthetic IPv4 address
   pool, e.g., a global address, the request MUST be passed on
   unmodified.

   For example, when an application requests a reverse lookup for a
   synthetic IPv4 address, the ENR needs to intercept that query.  The
   ENR asks the address mapper for the real IPv6 address that
   corresponds to the synthetic IPv4 address.  The ENR shall perform a
   reverse lookup procedure for the destination's IPv6 address and
   return the name received as a response to the application that
   initiated the IPv4 query.

   When BIH shuts down or address mapping table entries are cleared for
   any reason, DNS cache entries for synthetic IPv4 addresses MUST be
   flushed.  There may be a DNS cache in the network-layer ENR itself
   and at the host's stub resolver.

   The address mapper maintains an IPv4 address pool that can be used
   for IPv4 address synthesis.  The pool consists of the IPv4 addresses
   of [<a href="rfc1918.html" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>] as per <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>.  Also, the address mapper maintains
   a table consisting of pairs of synthetic IPv4 addresses and
   destinations' real IPv6 addresses.

   When the ENR, translator, or the function mapper requests the address
   mapper to assign a synthetic IPv4 address corresponding to an IPv6
   address, the address mapper selects and returns an IPv4 address out
   of the local pool and registers a new entry into the table.  The
   registration occurs in the following three cases:

   1.  When the ENR gets only IPv6 addresses for the target host name
       and there is no existing mapping entry for the IPv6 addresses.
       One or more synthetic IPv4 addresses will be returned to the
       application and mappings for synthetic IPv4 addresses to real
       IPv6 addresses are created.

   2.  When the ENR gets both real IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but the real
       IPv4 addresses contain only excluded IPv4 addresses
       (e.g., 127.0.0.1).  The behavior will follow case (1).

   3.  When the function mapper is triggered by a received IPv6 packet
       and there is no existing mapping entry for the IPv6 source
       address (for example, the client sent a UDP request to an anycast
       address, but a response was received from a unicast address).

   Other possible combinations are outside of BIH.

   Figure 4 illustrates a very basic network scenario.  An IPv4-only
   application is running on a host attached to the IPv6-only Internet

   Figure 5 illustrates a possible network scenario where an IPv4-only
   application is running on a host attached to a dual-stack network,
   but the destination server is running on a private site that is
   numbered with public IPv6 addresses and not globally reachable IPv4
   addresses, such as the addresses of [<a href="rfc1918.html" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>], without port
   forwarding set up on the NAT44.  The only means to contact the server
   is to use IPv6.

   IPv4 socket API functions are translated into IPv6 socket API
   functions that are semantically as identical as possible, and vice
   versa.  See <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> for the API list intercepted by BIH.  However,
   some IPv4 socket API functions are not fully compatible with IPv6
   since IPv4 supports features that are not present in IPv6, such as
   SO_BROADCAST.

   BIH SHOULD select a source address for a socket from the recommended
   source address pool if a socket used for communications has not been
   explicitly bound to any IPv4 address.

   The binding of an explicitly bound socket MUST NOT be changed by the
   BIH.

   ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 messages MUST be translated as defined by SIIT
   [<a href="rfc6145.html" title='"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"'>RFC6145</a>].  In the network-layer implementation alternative, the
   protocol translator MUST translate ICMPv6 packets to ICMPv4 and vice
   versa, and in the socket API implementation alternative, the socket
   API MUST handle conversions in similar fashion.

   The address pool consists of the private IPv4 addresses of [<a href="rfc1918.html" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>].
   This pool can be implemented at different granularities in the node,
   e.g., a single pool per node, or at some finer granularity such as
   per-user or per-process.  In the case of a large number of IPv4
   applications communicating with a large number of IPv6 servers, the

   fine enough.  This should be a rare event and chances will decrease
   as IPv6 support increases.  The applications may use IPv4 addresses
   they learn for a much longer period than DNS time to live indicates.
   Therefore, the mapping table entries should be kept active for a long
   period of time.  For example, a web browser may initiate one DNS
   query and then create multiple TCP sessions over time to the address
   it learns.  When address mapping table clean-up is required, the BIH
   may utilize techniques used by network address translators, such as
   described in [<a href="rfc2663.html" title='"IP Network Address Translator (NAT) Terminology and Considerations"'>RFC2663</a>], [<a href="rfc5382.html" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>], and [<a href="rfc5508.html" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP"'>RFC5508</a>].

   The address space of <a href="rfc1918.html">RFC 1918</a> was chosen because legacy applications
   generally understand it as a private address space.  A new dedicated
   address space would run the risk of not being understood by
   applications as private. 127/8 and 169.254/16 are rejected due to
   possible assumptions applications may make when seeing them.

   The addresses of <a href="rfc1918.html">RFC 1918</a> used by the BIH have a risk of conflicting
   with addresses used in the host's possible IPv4 interfaces and
   corresponding local networks.  The conflicts can be mitigated, but
   not fully avoided, by using less commonly used portions of the
   address space of <a href="rfc1918.html">RFC 1918</a>.  Addresses from 172.16/12 are thought to
   be less likely to be in conflict than addresses from 10/8 or
   192.168/16 spaces.  A source address can usually be selected in a
   non-conflicting manner, but a small possibility exists for
   synthesized destination addresses being in conflict with real
   addresses used in attached IPv4 networks.

   The RECOMMENDED IPv4 addresses are following:

      Primary source addresses: 172.21.112.0/20.

         Source addresses have to be allocated because applications use
         getsockname() calls and, in the network-layer mode, an IP
         address of the IPv4 interface has to be shown (e.g., by
         'ifconfig').  More than one address is allocated to allow
         implementation flexibility, e.g., for cases where a host has
         multiple IPv6 interfaces.  The source addresses are from
         different subnets than destination addresses to ensure
         applications would not make on-link assumptions and would
         instead enable NAT traversal functions.

      Secondary source addresses: 10.170.224.0/20.

         These addresses are recommended if a host has a conflict with
         primary source addresses.

      Primary destination addresses: 10.170.160.0/20.

         The address mapper will select destination addresses primarily

   In the case of dual-stack destinations, BIH MUST NOT do protocol
   translation from IPv4 to IPv6 when the host has any IPv4 interfaces,
   native or tunneled, available for use.

   It is possible that an IPv4 interface is activated during BIH
   operation, for example, if a node moves to a coverage area of an
   IPv4-enabled network.  In such an event, BIH MUST stop initiating
   protocol translation sessions for new connections, and BIH MAY
   disconnect active sessions.  The choice of disconnection is left for
   implementations, and it may depend on whether IPv4 address conflict
   occurs between addresses used by BIH and addresses used by the new
   IPv4 interface.

   Any protocols that protect IP header information are essentially
   incompatible with BIH.  This implies that end-to-end IPsec
   verification will fail when the Authentication Header (AH) is used
   (both transport and tunnel mode) and when ESP is used in transport
   mode.  This is inherent in any network-layer translation mechanism.
   End-to-end IPsec protection can be restored, using UDP encapsulation
   as described in [<a href="rfc3948.html" title='"UDP Encapsulation of IPsec ESP Packets"'>RFC3948</a>].  The actual extensions to support IPsec
   are out of the scope of this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2.%20%20Filtering"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" name="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Filtering</span>

   BIH creates binding state using packets flowing from the IPv4 side to
   the IPv6 side.  In accordance with the procedures defined in this
   document, following the guidelines defined in [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], a BIH
   implementation MUST offer "Endpoint-Independent Mapping".

   Implementations MAY also provide support for "Address-Dependent
   Mapping" following the guidelines defined in [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>].

   The security properties, however, are determined by which packets the
   BIH allows in and which it does not.  The security properties are
   determined by the filtering behavior and by the possible filtering
   configuration in the filtering portions of the BIH, not by the
   address mapping behavior.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.3.%20%20Attacks%20on%20BIH"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" name="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Attacks on BIH</span>

   The BIH implementation itself is a potential victim of different
   types of attacks.  In particular, the BIH can be a victim of Denial-
   of-Service (DoS) attacks.  The BIH implementation has a limited
   number of resources that can be consumed by attackers creating a DoS
   attack.  The BIH has a limited number of IPv4 addresses that it uses
   to create the bindings.  Even though the BIH performs address
   translation, it is possible for an attacker to consume the synthetic
   IPv4 address pool by triggering a host to issue DNS queries for names
   that cause ENR to synthesize A records.  DoS attacks can also affect
   other limited resources available in the host running BIH such as
   memory or link capacity.  For instance, it is possible for an
   attacker to launch a DoS attack on the memory of the BIH running
   device by sending fragments that the BIH will store for a given
   period.  If the number of fragments is large enough, the memory of
   the host could be exhausted.  BIH implementations MUST implement
   proper protection against such attacks, for instance, allocating a
   limited amount of memory for fragmented packet storage.

   Another consideration related to BIH resource depletion is the
   preservation of binding state.  Attackers may try to keep a binding
   state alive forever by sending periodic packets that refresh the
   state.  In order to allow the BIH to defend against such attacks, the
   BIH implementation MAY choose not to extend the session entry
   lifetime for a specific entry upon the reception of packets for that
   entry through the external interface.  However, such an action would
   not allow one-way communication sessions to stay alive.

   BIH operates in combination with the DNS, and it is therefore subject
   to whatever security considerations are appropriate to the DNS mode
   in which the BIH is operating (i.e., recursive or stub-resolver
   mode).

   BIH has the potential to interfere with the functioning of DNSSEC,
   because BIH modifies DNS answers, and DNSSEC is designed to detect
   such modifications and to treat modified answers as bogus.

   This document combines and obsoletes both [<a href="rfc2767.html" title='"Dual Stack Hosts using the "'>RFC2767</a>] and [<a href="rfc3338.html" title='"Dual Stack Hosts Using "'>RFC3338</a>].

   The changes in this document mainly reflect the following:

   1. Addresses of <a href="rfc1918.html">RFC 1918</a> used for synthesis

      <a href="rfc3338.html">RFC 3338</a> used unassigned IPv4 addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.1 -
      0.0.0.255) for synthetic IPv4 addresses.  Those addresses should
      not have been used and that may cause problems with applications.
      It is preferable to use addresses defined in <a href="rfc1918.html">RFC 1918</a> instead, as
      described in <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>.

   2. Support for reverse (PTR) DNS queries

      Neither <a href="rfc2767.html">RFC 2767</a> nor <a href="rfc3338.html">RFC 3338</a> included support for reverse (PTR)
      DNS queries.  This document adds the support in <a href="#section-2.3.3">Section 2.3.3</a>.

   3. DNSSEC support

      <a href="rfc2767.html">RFC 2767</a> did not include DNSSEC considerations, which are now
      included in <a href="#section-2.3.2">Section 2.3.2</a>

   4. Architectural recommendation

      This document recommends the socket API-layer implementation
      option over network layer translation, i.e., it recommends the
      approach introduced in <a href="rfc2767.html">RFC 2767</a> over the approach of <a href="rfc3338.html">RFC 3338</a>.

   5. Standards-Track document

      <a href="rfc2767.html">RFC 2767</a> is classified as an Informational RFC and <a href="rfc3338.html">RFC 3338</a> as an
      Experimental RFC.  It was discussed and decided in the IETF that
      this technology should be on the Standards Track.

   6. Set of other extensions and improvements

      A set of lesser extensions, improvements, and clarifications have
      been introduced.  These include but are not limited to IPv4 and
      IPv6 address exclusion sets at <a href="#section-2.3.1">Section 2.3.1</a>, host's DNS cache
      considerations, ENR behavior updates, updated security
      considerations, example updates, and deployment scenario updates.

   The following informational list includes some of the API functions
   that would be appropriate to intercept by BIH module when implemented
   at the socket API layer.  Please note that this list is not fully
   exhaustive, as the function names and services that are available on
   different APIs vary significantly.

   The functions that the application uses to pass addresses into the
   system are as follows:

      bind()

      connect()

      sendmsg()

      sendto()

      gethostbyaddr()

      getnameinfo()

   The functions that return an address from the system to an
   application are as follows:

      accept()

      recvfrom()

      recvmsg()

      getpeername()

      getsockname()

      gethostbyname()

      getaddrinfo()

   The functions that are related to socket options are as follows:

      getsocketopt()

      setsocketopt()

   As well, raw sockets for IPv4 and IPv6 may be intercepted.

   Most of the socket functions require a pointer to the socket address
   structure as an argument.  Each IPv4 argument is mapped into
   corresponding an IPv6 argument, and vice versa.

   According to [<a href="rfc3493.html" title='"Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6"'>RFC3493</a>], the following new IPv6 basic APIs and
   structures are required.

         IPv4                     new IPv6
         ------------------------------------------------
         AF_INET                  AF_INET6
         sockaddr_in              sockaddr_in6
         gethostbyname()          getaddrinfo()
         gethostbyaddr()          getnameinfo()
         inet_ntoa()/inet_addr()  inet_pton()/inet_ntop()
         INADDR_ANY               in6addr_any

                                 Figure 8

   BIH may intercept inet_ntoa() and inet_addr() and use the address
   mapper for those.  Doing that enables BIH to support literal IP
   addresses.  However, IPv4 address literals can only be used after a
   mapping entry between the IPv4 address and corresponding IPv6 address
   has been created.

   The gethostbyname() and getaddrinfo() calls return a list of
   addresses.  When the name resolver function invokes getaddrinfo(),
   and getaddrinfo() returns multiple IP addresses, whether IPv4 or
   IPv6, they should all be represented in the addresses returned by
   gethostbyname().  Thus, if getaddrinfo() returns multiple IPv6
   addresses, this implies that multiple address mappings will be
   created: one for each IPv6 address.
