            <span class="h1">Multicast in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)</span>

Abstract

   RFCs 4761 and 4762 describe a solution for Virtual Private LAN
   Service (VPLS) multicast that relies on the use of point-to-point or
   multipoint-to-point unicast Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for carrying
   multicast traffic.  This solution has certain limitations for certain
   VPLS multicast traffic profiles.  For example, it may result in
   highly non-optimal bandwidth utilization when a large amount of
   multicast traffic is to be transported.

   This document describes solutions for overcoming a subset of the
   limitations of the existing VPLS multicast solution.  It describes
   procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the
   service provider (SP) network.  The solution described in this
   document allows sharing of one such multicast tree among multiple
   VPLS instances.  Furthermore, the solution described in this document
   allows a single multicast tree in the SP network to carry traffic
   belonging only to a specified set of one or more IP multicast streams
   from one or more VPLS instances.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4761" name="ref-RFC4761">RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="rfc4762.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling"'>RFC4762</a>] describe a solution for VPLS
   multicast/broadcast that relies on the use of pseudowires transported
   over unicast point-to-point (P2P) RSVP Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   or multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LDP Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   ([<a href="rfc3209.html" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>] [<a href="rfc5036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC5036</a>]).  In this document, we refer to this solution
   as "ingress replication".

   With ingress replication, when an ingress Provider Edge (PE) of a
   given VPLS instance receives a multicast/broadcast packet from one of
   the Customer Edges (CEs) that belong to that instance, the ingress PE
   replicates the packet for each egress PE that belong to that
   instance, and it sends the packet to each such egress PE using
   unicast tunnels.

   The solution based on ingress replication has certain limitations for
   certain VPLS multicast/broadcast traffic profiles.  For example, it
   may result in highly non-optimal bandwidth utilization in the MPLS
   network when a large amount of multicast/broadcast traffic is to be
   transported (for more see [<a href="rfc5501.html" title='"Requirements for Multicast Support in Virtual Private LAN Services"'>RFC5501</a>]).

   Ingress replication may be an acceptable model when the bandwidth of
   the multicast/broadcast traffic is low and/or there is a small number
   of replications performed on each outgoing interface for a particular
   VPLS customer multicast stream.  If this is not the case, it is
   desirable to utilize multicast trees in the SP network to transmit
   VPLS multicast and/or broadcast packets [<a href="rfc5501.html" title='"Requirements for Multicast Support in Virtual Private LAN Services"'>RFC5501</a>].

   This document describes procedures for overcoming the limitations of
   existing VPLS multicast solutions.  It describes procedures for using
   MPLS point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs in the SP network to transport
   VPLS multicast and/or broadcast packets, where these LSPs are
   signaled by either P2MP RSVP-TE [<a href="rfc4875.html" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to- Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>] or Multipoint LDP (mLDP)
   [<a href="rfc6388.html" title='"Label Distribution Protocol Extensions for Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>RFC6388</a>].

   The procedures described in this document are applicable to both
   [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="rfc4762.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling"'>RFC4762</a>].

   This document uses terminology described in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="rfc4762.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling"'>RFC4762</a>].

   In this document, we refer to various auto-discovery routes, as "A-D
   routes".

   This document uses the prefix 'C' to refer to the customer control or
   data packets and 'P' to refer to the provider control or data
   packets.  An IP (multicast source, multicast group) tuple is
   abbreviated to (S, G).

   An "Inclusive tree" is a single multicast distribution tree in the SP
   network that carries all the multicast traffic from one VPLS instance
   on a given PE.

   An "Aggregate Inclusive tree" is a single multicast distribution tree
   in the SP network that carries all the multicast traffic from more
   than one VPLS instance on a given PE.

   A "Selective tree" is a single multicast distribution tree in the SP
   network that carries multicast traffic belonging only to a specified
   set of IP multicast streams, and all these streams belong to the same
   VPLS instance on a given PE.  A Selective tree differs from an
   Inclusive tree in that it may reach a subset of the PEs reached by an
   Inclusive tree.

   An "Aggregate Selective tree" is a single multicast distribution tree
   in the SP network that carries multicast traffic belonging only to a
   specified set of IP multicast streams, and all these streams belong
   to more than one VPLS instance on a given PE.

   Procedures described in this document provide mechanisms that allow a
   single multicast distribution tree in the SP network to carry all the
   multicast traffic from one or more VPLS sites connected to a given
   PE, irrespective of whether these sites belong to the same or
   different VPLS instances.  We refer to such a tree as an "Inclusive
   tree" if it carries multicast traffic from one VPLS instance on a
   given PE.  We refer to such a tree as an "Aggregate Inclusive tree"
   if it carries multicast traffic from more than one VPLS instance on a
   given PE.  See the "Inclusive and Selective Multicast Trees" section
   for further discussion on Inclusive trees.

   To further improve bandwidth utilization for IP multicast streams,
   this document also provides procedures by which a single multicast
   distribution tree in the SP network can be used to carry traffic
   belonging only to a specified set of IP multicast streams, originated
   in one or more VPLS sites connected to a given PE, irrespective of
   whether these sites belong to the same or different VPLS instances.
   We refer to such a tree as a "Selective tree" if it carries the IP
   multicast stream(s) that belongs to the same VPLS instance on a given
   PE.  We refer to such a tree as an "Aggregate Selective tree" if it
   carries the IP multicast streams that belong to different VPLS
   instances on a given PE.  Use of Selective and/or Aggregate Selective
   trees allows multicast traffic, by default, to be carried on an
   Inclusive tree, while traffic from some specific IP multicast
   streams, e.g., high-bandwidth streams, could be carried on one of the
   Selective trees.  See the "Inclusive and Selective Multicast Trees"
   section for further discussion on Selective trees.

   Note that this document covers the use of Selective trees only for
   carrying IP multicast streams.  Any other use of such trees is
   outside the scope of this document.

   Unicast packets destined to unknown Media Access Control (MAC)
   addresses (i.e., not learned yet at the ingress PE) in a given VPLS
   instance are flooded to remote PEs participating in the same VPLS
   instance.  This flooding MAY still use ingress replication (as
   specified in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="rfc4762.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling"'>RFC4762</a>]), or MAY use the procedures
   defined in this document to optimize flooding across the SP core.

   While the use of multicast trees in the SP network can be beneficial
   when the bandwidth of the multicast traffic is high, or when it is
   desirable to optimize the number of copies of a multicast packet
   transmitted on a given link, this benefit comes at a cost of state in
   the SP network to build multicast trees and overhead to maintain this
   state.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Inclusive%20and%20Selective%20Multicast%20Trees"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Inclusive and Selective Multicast Trees</span>

   Multicast trees used for VPLS can be of two types:

     + Inclusive trees.  This option supports the use of a single
       multicast distribution tree, referred to as an "Inclusive
       P-multicast tree", in the SP network to carry all the multicast
       traffic from a specified set of VPLS sites connected to a given
       PE.  There is no assumption made with respect to whether or not
       this traffic is IP encapsulated.  A particular P-multicast tree
       can be set up to carry the traffic originated by sites belonging
       to a single VPLS instance or to carry the traffic originated by
       sites belonging to different VPLS instances.  In the context of
       this document, the ability to carry the traffic of more than one
       VPLS instance on the same P-multicast tree is called
       "aggregation".  The tree includes every PE that is a member of
       any of the VPLS instances that are using the tree.  This implies
       that a PE may receive multicast traffic for a multicast stream
       even if it doesn't have any receivers that are interested in
       receiving traffic for that stream.

       An Inclusive P-multicast tree, as defined in this document, is a
       P2MP tree.  Thus, a P2MP tree is used to carry traffic only from
       VPLS sites that are connected to the PE that is the root of the
       tree.

     + Selective trees.  A Selective P-multicast tree is used by a PE to
       send IP multicast traffic for one or more specific IP multicast
       streams, received by the PE over PE-CE interfaces that belong to
       the same or different VPLS instances, to a subset of the PEs that
       belong to those VPLS instances.  Each of the PEs in the subset
       should be on the path to a receiver of one or more multicast
       streams that are mapped onto the tree.  In the context of this
       document, the ability to use the same P-multicast tree for
       multicast streams that belong to different VPLS instances is
       called "aggregation".  The reason for having Selective
       P-multicast trees is to provide a PE the ability to create
       separate SP multicast trees for specific multicast streams, e.g.,
       high-bandwidth multicast streams.  This allows traffic for these

       multicast streams to reach only those PE routers that have
       receivers for these streams.  This avoids flooding other PE
       routers in the VPLS instance.

   An SP can use both Inclusive P-multicast trees and Selective
   P-multicast trees or either of them for a given VPLS on a PE, based
   on local configuration.  Inclusive P-multicast trees can be used for
   both IP and non-IP data multicast traffic, while Selective
   P-multicast trees, as previously stated, must be used only for IP
   multicast data traffic.  The use of Selective P-multicast trees for
   non-IP multicast traffic is outside the scope of this document.

   P-multicast trees in the SP network can be realized via a variety of
   technologies.  For both Inclusive and Selective P-multicast trees,
   these technologies include P2MP LSPs created by RSVP-TE or mLDP.
   This document also describes the data plane encapsulations for
   supporting these technologies.  Other technologies for realizing
   P-multicast trees are outside the scope of this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20BGP-Based%20VPLS%20Membership%20Auto-discovery"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  BGP-Based VPLS Membership Auto-discovery</span>

   Inclusive P-multicast trees may be established for one or more VPLS
   instances.  In this case, aggregation can be performed (using either
   mLDP or P2MP RSVP-TE as the tunneling technology) or simple tunneling
   can be performed (using P2MP RSVP-TE tunneling).  If either of these
   approaches is used, the PE acting as the root of a P2MP LSP must be
   able to discover the other PEs that have membership of each of the
   VPLS instances.  Once the root PE discovers these other PEs, it
   includes them as leaves in the P-multicast tree (i.e., P2MP LSP).
   This document uses the BGP-based procedures described in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>]
   and [<a href="rfc6074.html" title='"Provisioning, Auto-Discovery, and Signaling in Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC6074</a>] for discovering the VPLS membership of all PEs.  For
   more on aggregation, see the "Aggregation Considerations" section.
   When no aggregation is performed and the tunneling technology is
   mLDP, then the root of the P2MP LSP need not discover the other PEs
   that are the leaves of that LSP tree.

   The leaves of the Inclusive P-multicast tree must also be able to
   auto-discover the identifier of the tree (note that this applies when
   the tree is established by either mLDP or P2MP RSVP-TE).  Procedures
   to accomplish this are described in the "Advertising P-Multicast Tree
   to VPLS/C-Multicast Binding" section.

   The setup of a Selective P-multicast tree for one or more IP
   multicast (C-S, C-G)s, requires the ingress PE to learn the PEs that
   have receivers in one or more of these (C-S, C-G)s, in the following
   cases:

     + When aggregation is used (with either mLDP or P2MP RSVP-TE as the
       tunneling technology), OR

     + When the tunneling technology is P2MP RSVP-TE

     + If ingress replication is used and the ingress PE wants to send
       traffic for (C-S, C-G)s to only those PEs that are on the path to
       receivers for the (C-S, C-G)s.

   For more on aggregation, see the "Aggregation Considerations"
   section.

   For discovering the IP multicast group membership, this document
   describes procedures that allow an ingress PE to enable explicit
   tracking of IP multicast membership.  Thus, an ingress PE can request
   the IP multicast membership from egress PEs for one or more
   C-multicast streams.  These procedures are described in the
   "Optimizing Multicast Distribution via Selective Trees" section.

   These procedures are applicable when IGMP ([<a href="rfc2236.html" title='"Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2"'>RFC2236</a>] [<a href="rfc3376.html" title='"Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3"'>RFC3376</a>]) or
   MLD ([<a href="rfc2710.html" title='"Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6"'>RFC2710</a>] [<a href="rfc3810.html" title='"Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6"'>RFC3810</a>]) is used as the multicast signaling protocol
   between the VPLS CEs.  They are also applicable when PIM ([<a href="rfc4601.html" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC4601</a>])
   in either the Any-Source Multicast (ASM) or the Source-Specific
   Multicast (SSM) service model is used as the multicast routing
   protocol between the VPLS CEs, and PIM join suppression is disabled
   on all the CEs.

   However, these procedures do not apply when PIM is used as the
   multicast routing protocol between the VPLS CEs and PIM join
   suppression is not disabled on all the CEs.  This is because when PIM
   join suppression is not disabled on all the CEs, PEs connected to
   these CEs can not rely on PIM to determine IP multicast membership of
   the receivers behind these CEs.  Procedures for this case are outside
   the scope of this document.

   The leaves of the Selective P-multicast trees must also be able to
   discover the identifier of these trees.  Procedures to accomplish
   this are described in the "Advertising P-Multicast Tree to
   VPLS/C-Multicast Binding" section.

   leaves of the tree.  This document uses the Provider Multicast
   Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute defined [<a href="rfc6514.html" title='"BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6514</a>] for this
   purpose.

   Once an ingress PE decides to bind a set of VPLS instances or
   customer multicast groups to an Inclusive P-multicast tree or a
   Selective P-multicast tree, the PE needs to announce this binding to
   other PEs in the network.  This procedure is referred to as
   "Inclusive P-multicast tree binding distribution" or "Selective
   P-multicast tree binding distribution" and is performed using BGP.
   The decision to bind a set of VPLS instances or customer multicast
   groups is a local matter to the ingress, and is controlled via
   provisioning/configuration on that PE.

   When an Aggregated Inclusive P-multicast tree is used by an ingress
   PE, this binding distribution implies that (a) an ingress PE MUST
   announce the binding of all VPLS instances bound to the Inclusive
   P-multicast tree and (b) other PEs that have these instances receive
   these announcements.  The inner label assigned by the ingress PE for
   each VPLS MUST be included if more than one VPLS is bound to the same
   P-multicast tree.  The Inclusive P-multicast tree Identifier MUST be
   included.

   For a Selective P-multicast tree, this binding distribution implies
   announcing all the specific &lt;C-S, C-G&gt; entries bound to this
   P-multicast tree along with the Selective P-multicast tree
   Identifier.  The inner label assigned for each &lt;C-S, C-G&gt; MUST be
   included if &lt;C-S, C-G&gt; from different VPLS instances are bound to the
   same P-multicast tree.  The labels MUST be distinct on a per-VPLS
   basis and MAY be distinct per &lt;C-S, C-G&gt; entry.  The Selective
   P-multicast tree Identifier MUST be included.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.%20%20Aggregation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" name="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Aggregation</span>

   As described earlier in this document, the ability to carry the
   traffic of more than one VPLS on the same P-multicast tree is called
   aggregation.

   Aggregation enables the SP to place a bound on the amount of
   multicast tree forwarding and control plane state that the P-routers
   must have.  Let us call the number of VPLS instances aggregated onto
   a single P-multicast tree the "Aggregation Factor".  When Inclusive
   source P-multicast trees are used, the number of trees that a PE is
   the root of is proportional to the number of VPLS instances on the PE
   divided by the Aggregation Factor.

   In this case, the state maintained by a P-router is proportional to:

        AveVPLS            NPE
        -------    X    --------
          Aggr          AvePTree

      Where:

      AveVPLS is the average number of VPLS instances on a PE

      Aggr is the Aggregation Factor

      NPE is the number of PEs

      AvePTree is the average number of P-multicast that transit a given
      P-router

   Thus, the state does not grow linearly with the number of VPLS
   instances.

   Aggregation requires a mechanism for the egresses of the P-multicast
   tree to demultiplex the multicast traffic received over the
   P-multicast tree.  To enable the egress nodes to perform this
   demultiplexing, upstream-assigned labels [<a href="rfc5331.html" title='"MPLS Upstream Label Assignment and Context-Specific Label Space"'>RFC5331</a>] MUST be assigned
   and distributed by the root of the aggregate P-multicast tree.

   Aggregation procedures would require two MPLS labels in the label
   stack.  This does not introduce any new implications on MTU, as even
   VPLS multicast supported by ingress replication requires two MPLS
   labels in the label stack.

   This document defines four models of inter-AS (Autonomous System)
   VPLS service, referred here as options (a), (b), (c), and (e).
   Options (a), (b), and (c) defined in this document are very similar
   to methods (a), (b), and (c), described in the "Multi-AS VPLS"
   section of [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>], which in turn extends the concepts of [<a href="rfc4364.html" title='"BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4364</a>]
   to inter-AS VPLS.

   For option (a) and option (b) support, this document specifies a
   model where inter-AS VPLS service can be offered without requiring a
   single P-multicast tree to span multiple ASes.  There are two
   variants of this model, and they are described in the "Inter-AS
   Inclusive P-Multicast Tree A-D/Binding" section.

   For option (c) support, this document specifies a model where inter-
   AS VPLS service is offered by requiring a single P-multicast tree to
   span multiple ASes.  This is because in the case of option (c), the
   Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs) do not exchange BGP-VPLS
   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or A-D routes.

   In addition to options (a), (b), and (c), this document also
   specifies option (e), which one may think of as a variant of option
   (a).

   P-Multicast Tree A-D/Binding" section.

   This section specifies procedures for the intra-AS auto-discovery of
   VPLS membership and the distribution of information used to
   instantiate P-multicast Tunnels.

   VPLS auto-discovery/binding consists of two components: intra-AS and
   inter-AS.  The former provides VPLS auto-discovery/binding within a
   single AS.  The latter provides VPLS auto-discovery/binding across
   multiple ASes.  Inter-AS auto-discovery/binding is described in the
   "Inter-AS Inclusive P-Multicast Tree A-D/Binding" section.

   VPLS auto-discovery using BGP, as described in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and
   [<a href="rfc6074.html" title='"Provisioning, Auto-Discovery, and Signaling in Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC6074</a>], enables a PE to learn the VPLS instance membership of
   other PEs.  A PE that belongs to a particular VPLS instance announces
   a BGP NLRI that identifies the Virtual Switch Instance (VSI).  This
   NLRI is constructed from the &lt;Route Distinguisher (RD), VPLS Edge
   Device Identifier (VE-ID)&gt; tuple.  The NLRI defined in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>]
   comprises the &lt;RD, VE-ID&gt; tuple and label blocks for pseudowire (PW)
   signaling.  The VE-ID in this case is a two-octet number encoded in
   the VE-ID of NLRI defined in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>].  The NLRI defined in
   [<a href="rfc6074.html" title='"Provisioning, Auto-Discovery, and Signaling in Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC6074</a>] comprises only the &lt;RD, PE_addr&gt;.  The VE-ID in this case
   is a four-octet number encoded in the PE_addr of the NLRI defined in
   [<a href="rfc6074.html" title='"Provisioning, Auto-Discovery, and Signaling in Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC6074</a>].

   The procedures for constructing Inclusive Intra-AS and Inter-AS
   trees, as specified in this document, require the BGP A-D NLRI to
   carry only the &lt;RD, VE-ID&gt;.  Hence, these procedures can be used for
   both BGP-VPLS and LDP-VPLS with BGP A-D.

   It is to be noted that BGP A-D is an inherent feature of BGP-VPLS.
   However, it is not an inherent feature of LDP-VPLS.  In fact, there
   are deployments and/or implementations of LDP-VPLS that require
   configuration to enable a PE in a particular VPLS to determine other
   PEs in the VPLS and exchange PW labels using Forwarding Equivalence

   To participate in the VPLS auto-discovery/binding, a PE router that
   has a given VSI of a given VPLS instance originates a BGP VPLS Intra-
   AS A-D route and advertises this route in Multiprotocol (MP) IBGP.
   The route is constructed as described in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="rfc6074.html" title='"Provisioning, Auto-Discovery, and Signaling in Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC6074</a>].

   The route carries a single Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN)
   NLRI with the RD set to the RD of the VSI and the VE-ID set to the
   VE-ID of the VSI.  The route also carries one or more Route Targets
   (RTs), as specified in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="rfc6074.html" title='"Provisioning, Auto-Discovery, and Signaling in Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC6074</a>].

   If an Inclusive P-multicast tree is used to instantiate the provider
   tunnel for VPLS multicast on the PE, the advertising PE MUST
   advertise the type and the identity of the P-multicast tree in the
   PMSI Tunnel attribute.  This attribute is described in the "Inclusive
   Tree/Selective Tree Identifier" section.

   A PE that uses an Inclusive P-multicast tree to instantiate the
   provider tunnel MAY aggregate two or more VPLS instances present on
   the PE onto the same tree.  If the PE decides to perform aggregation
   after it has already advertised the intra-AS VPLS A-D routes for
   these VPLS instances, then aggregation requires the PE to
   re-advertise these routes.  The re-advertised routes MUST be the same
   as the original ones, except for the PMSI Tunnel attribute (the
   re-advertised route will replace the previously advertised route).
   If the PE has not previously advertised Intra-AS A-D routes for these
   VPLS instances, then the aggregation requires the PE to advertise
   (new) Intra-AS A-D routes for these VPLS instances.  The PMSI Tunnel
   attribute in the newly advertised/re-advertised routes MUST carry the
   identity of the P-multicast tree that aggregates the VPLS instances
   as well as an MPLS upstream-assigned label [<a href="rfc5331.html" title='"MPLS Upstream Label Assignment and Context-Specific Label Space"'>RFC5331</a>].  Each
   re-advertised or newly advertised route MUST have a label that is
   distinct within the scope of the PE that advertises the route.

   Discovery of PE capabilities in terms of what tunnel types they
   support is outside the scope of this document.  Within a given AS,
   PEs participating in a VPLS are expected to advertise tunnel bindings
   whose tunnel types are supported by all other PEs that are
   participating in this VPLS and are part of the same AS.

   When a PE receives a BGP Update message that carries an Intra-AS A-D
   route such that (a) the route was originated by some other PE within
   the same AS as the local PE, (b) at least one of the RTs of the route
   matches one of the import RTs configured for a particular VSI on the
   local PE, (c) the BGP route selection determines that this is the
   best route with respect to the NLRI carried by the route, and (d) the
   route carries the PMSI Tunnel attribute, the PE performs the
   following:

     + If the Tunnel Type in the PMSI Tunnel attribute is set to LDP
       P2MP LSP, the PE SHOULD join the P-multicast tree whose identity
       is carried in the PMSI Tunnel attribute.

     + If the Tunnel Type in the PMSI Tunnel attribute is set to RSVP-TE
       P2MP LSP, the receiving PE has to establish the appropriate state
       to properly handle the traffic received over that LSP.  The PE
       that originated the route MUST establish an RSVP-TE P2MP LSP with
       the local PE as a leaf.  This LSP MAY have been established
       before the local PE receives the route.

     + If the PMSI Tunnel attribute does not carry a label, then all
       packets that are received on the P-multicast tree, as identified
       by the PMSI Tunnel attribute, are forwarded using the VSIs that
       have at least one of their import RTs that matches one of the RTs
       of the received A-D route.

     + If the PMSI Tunnel attribute has the Tunnel Type set to LDP P2MP
       LSP or RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, and the attribute also carries an MPLS
       label, then the egress PE MUST treat this as an upstream-assigned
       label, and all packets that are received on the P-multicast tree,
       as identified by the PMSI Tunnel attribute, with that upstream
       label are forwarded using the VSIs that have at least one of
       their import RTs that matches one of the RTs of the received
       Intra-AS A-D route.

   Furthermore, if the local PE uses RSVP-TE P2MP LSP for sending
   (multicast) traffic, originated by VPLS sites connected to the PE, to
   the sites attached to other PEs, then the local PE MUST use the
   Originating Router's IP Address information carried in the Intra-AS
   A-D route to add the PE, that originated the route, as a leaf node to
   the LSP.  This MUST be done irrespective of whether or not the
   received Intra-AS A-D route carries the PMSI Tunnel attribute.

   Demultiplexing received VPLS traffic requires the receiving PE to
   determine the VPLS instance to which the packet belongs.  The egress
   PE can then perform a VPLS lookup to further forward the packet.  It
   also requires the egress PE to determine the identity of the ingress
   PE for MAC learning, as described in the "VPLS Data Packet Treatment"
   section.

   When a P-multicast tree is mapped to only one VPLS, determining the
   tree on which the packet is received is sufficient to determine the
   VPLS instance on which the packet is received.  The tree is
   determined based on the tree encapsulation.  If MPLS encapsulation is
   used, e.g., RSVP-TE P2MP LSPs, the outer MPLS label is used to
   determine the tree.  Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) MUST be disabled
   on the MPLS LSP (RSVP-TE P2MP LSP or mLDP P2MP LSP).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20One%20P-Multicast%20Tree%20-%20Many%20VPLS%20Mapping"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  One P-Multicast Tree - Many VPLS Mapping</span>

   As traffic belonging to multiple VPLS instances can be carried over
   the same tree, there is a need to identify the VPLS to which the
   packet belongs.  This is done by using an inner label that determines
   the VPLS for which the packet is intended.  The ingress PE uses this
   label as the inner label while encapsulating a customer multicast
   data packet.  Each of the egress PEs must be able to associate this
   inner label with the same VPLS and use it to demultiplex the traffic
   received over the Aggregate Inclusive tree or the Aggregate Selective
   tree.

   If traffic from multiple VPLS instances is carried on a single tree,
   upstream-assigned labels [<a href="rfc5331.html" title='"MPLS Upstream Label Assignment and Context-Specific Label Space"'>RFC5331</a>] MUST be used.  Hence, the inner
   label is assigned by the ingress PE.  When the egress PE receives a
   packet over an Aggregate tree, the outer encapsulation (in the case
   of MPLS P2MP LSPs, the outer MPLS label) specifies the label space to
   perform the inner-label lookup.  The same label space MUST be used by
   the egress PE for all P-multicast trees that have the same root
   [<a href="rfc5331.html" title='"MPLS Upstream Label Assignment and Context-Specific Label Space"'>RFC5331</a>].

   If the tree uses MPLS encapsulation, as in RSVP-TE P2MP LSPs, the
   outer MPLS label and, optionally, the incoming interface provide the
   label space of the label beneath it.  This assumes that PHP is
   disabled.  The egress PE MUST NOT advertise IMPLICIT NULL or EXPLICIT
   NULL for that tree once it is known to the egress PE that the tree is
   bound to one or more VPLS instances.  Once the label representing the

   tree is popped off the MPLS label stack, the next label is the
   demultiplexing information that allows the proper VPLS instance to be

   The ingress PE informs the egress PEs about the inner label as part

   This document supports only P2MP P-multicast trees wherein it is
   possible for egress PEs to identify the ingress PE to perform MAC
   learning.  Specific procedures are identified only for RSVP-TE P2MP
   LSPs and mLDP P2MP LSPs.  An implementation that supports this
   document MUST support RSVP-TE P2MP LSPs and mLDP P2MP LSPs.

   The following procedures apply to both RSVP-TE P2MP and mLDP P2MP
   LSPs.

   Demultiplexing the C-multicast data packets at the egress PE requires
   that the PE must be able to determine the P2MP LSP on which the
   packets are received.  This enables the egress PE to determine the
   VPLS instances to which the packet belongs.  To achieve this, the LSP
   MUST be signaled with PHP off and a non-special purpose MPLS label
   off as described in the "Demultiplexing P-Multicast Tree Traffic"
   section.  In other words, an egress PE MUST NOT advertise IMPLICIT
   NULL or EXPLICIT NULL for a P2MP LSP that is carrying traffic for one
   or more VPLS instances.  This is because the egress PE needs to rely
   on the MPLS label, that it advertises to its upstream neighbor, to
   determine the P2MP LSP on which a C-multicast data packet is
   received.

   The egress PE also needs to identify the ingress PE to perform MAC
   learning.  When P2MP LSPs are used as P2MP trees, determining the
   P2MP LSP on which the packets are received is sufficient to determine
   the ingress PE.  This is because the ingress PE is the root of the
   P2MP LSP.

   The egress PE relies on receiving the PMSI Tunnel attribute in BGP to
   determine the VPLS instance to P2MP LSP mapping.

   the root of the P2MP LSP discovers the leaves.  The egress PEs are
   discovered using the procedures described in the "Intra-AS Inclusive
   P-Multicast Tree Auto-discovery/Binding" section.  Aggregation, as
   described in this document, is supported.

   P2MP TE LSP to VPLS mapping is learned at the egress PEs using BGP-
   based advertisements of the P2MP TE LSP - VPLS mapping.  They require
   that the root of the tree include in the BGP advertisements the P2MP
   TE LSP identifier as the P-multicast tree identifier.  This
   P-multicast tree identifier contains the following information
   elements:

           - The type of the tunnel is set to RSVP-TE P2MP LSP
           - RSVP-TE P2MP LSP's SESSION Object

   See the "Inclusive Tree/Selective Tree Identifier" section for more
   details on how this tree identifier is carried in BGP advertisements.

   Once the egress PE receives the P2MP TE LSP to VPLS mapping:

     + If the egress PE already has RSVP-TE state for the P2MP TE LSP,
       it MUST begin to assign an MPLS label from the non-special
       purpose label range, for the P2MP TE LSP and signal this to the
       previous hop of the P2MP TE LSP.  Further, it MUST create
       forwarding state to forward packets received on the P2MP LSP.

     + If the egress PE does not have RSVP-TE state for the P2MP TE LSP,
       it MUST retain this mapping.  Subsequently, when the egress PE
       receives the RSVP-TE P2MP signaling message, it creates the RSVP-
       TE P2MP LSP state.  It MUST then assign an MPLS label from the
       non-reserved label range, for the P2MP TE LSP, and signal this to
       the previous hop of the P2MP TE LSP.

       Note that if the signaling to set up an RSVP-TE P2MP LSP is
       completed before a given egress PE learns, via a PMSI Tunnel
       attribute, of the VPLS or set of VPLS instances to which the LSP
       is bound, the PE MUST discard any traffic received on that LSP
       until the binding is received.  In order for the egress PE to be
       able to discard such traffic, it needs to know that the LSP is
       associated with one or more VPLS instances and that the VPLS A-D
       route that binds the LSP to a VPLS has not yet been received.

   As stated earlier, this document defines four models of inter-AS VPLS
   service, referred here as option (a), (b), (c), and (e).  This
   section contains procedures to support these models.

   For supporting option (a), (b), and (e), this section specifies a
   model where inter-AS VPLS service can be offered without requiring a
   single P-multicast tree to span multiple ASes.  This allows
   individual ASes to potentially use different P-tunneling
   technologies.  There are two variants of this model.  One that

   requires MAC lookup on the ASBRs and applies to option (a) and (e).
   The other is one that does not require MAC lookup on the ASBRs, and
   instead it builds segmented Inter-AS Inclusive or Selective trees.
   This applies only to option (b).

   For supporting option (c), this section specifies a model where
   Inter-AS VPLS service is offered by requiring a single Inclusive
   P-multicast tree to span multiple ASes.  This is referred to as a
   "non-segmented P-multicast tree".  This is because in the case of
   option (c), the ASBRs do not exchange BGP-VPLS NLRIs or VPLS A-D
   routes.  Support for Inter-AS Selective trees for option (c) may be
   segmented or non-segmented.

   An implementation MUST support options (a), (b), and (c), and MAY
   support option (e).  When there are multiple ways for implementing
   one of these options, this section specifies which one is mandatory.

   When VSIs are configured on ASBRs, the ASBRs MUST perform a MAC
   lookup, in addition to any MPLS lookups, to determine the forwarding
   decision on a VPLS packet.  The P-multicast trees are confined to an
   AS.  An ASBR on receiving a VPLS packet from another ASBR is required
   to perform a MAC lookup to determine how to forward the packet.
   Thus, an ASBR is required to keep a VSI for the VPLS instance and
   MUST be configured with its own VE-ID for the VPLS instance.  The BGP
   VPLS A-D routes generated by PEs in an AS MUST NOT be propagated
   outside the AS.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.1.%20%20Option%20%28a%29%3A%20VSIs%20on%20the%20ASBRs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.1" name="section-7.1.1">7.1.1</a>.  Option (a): VSIs on the ASBRs</span>

   In option (a), an ASBR acts as a PE for the VPLSs that span the AS of
   the ASBR and an AS to which the ASBR is connected.  The local ASBR
   views the ASBR in the neighboring AS as a CE connected to it by a
   link with separate VLAN sub-interfaces for each such VPLS.
   Similarly, the ASBR in the neighboring AS acts as a PE for such VPLS
   from the neighboring AS's point of view, and views the local ASBR as
   a CE.

   The local ASBR uses a combination of the incoming link and a
   particular VLAN sub-interface on that link to determine the VSI for
   the packets it receives from the ASBR in the neighboring AS.

   In option (a), the ASBRs do not exchange VPLS A-D routes.

   An implementation MUST support option (a).

   The VSIs on the ASBRs scheme can be used such that the interconnect
   between the ASBRs is a PW and MPLS encapsulation is used between the
   ASBRs.  An ASBR in one AS determines the VSI for packets received
   from an adjoining ASBR in another AS based on the incoming MPLS PW
   label.  This is referred to as "option (e)".  The only VPLS A-D
   routes that are propagated outside the AS are the ones originated by
   ASBRs.  This MPLS PW connects the VSIs on the ASBRs and MUST be
   signaled using the procedures defined in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] or [<a href="rfc4762.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling"'>RFC4762</a>].

   The P-multicast trees for a VPLS are confined to each AS and the VPLS
   auto-discovery/binding MUST follow the intra-AS procedures described
   in the "Demultiplexing P-Multicast Tree Traffic" section.

   An implementation MAY support option (e).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.%20%20Option%20%28b%29%20-%20Segmented%20Inter-AS%20Trees"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" name="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Option (b) - Segmented Inter-AS Trees</span>

   In this model, an inter-AS P-multicast tree, rooted at a particular
   PE for a particular VPLS instance, consists of a number of
   "segments", one per AS, which are stitched together at ASBRs.  These
   are known as "segmented inter-AS trees".  Each segment of a segmented
   inter-AS tree may use a different multicast transport technology.  In
   this model, an ASBR is not required to keep a VSI for the VPLS
   instance, and is not required to perform a MAC lookup in order to
   forward the VPLS packet.  This implies that an ASBR is not required
   to be configured with a VE-ID for the VPLS.

   An implementation MUST support option (b) using this model.

   The construction of segmented inter-AS trees requires the BGP-VPLS
   A-D NLRI described in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="rfc6074.html" title='"Provisioning, Auto-Discovery, and Signaling in Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC6074</a>].  A BGP VPLS A-D route
   for an &lt;RD, VE-ID&gt; tuple advertised outside the AS, to which the
   originating PE belongs, will be referred to as an "Inter-AS VPLS A-D
   route" (though this route is originated by a PE as an intra-AS route,
   and is referred to as an "inter-AS route outside the AS").

   In addition to this, segmented inter-AS trees require support for the
   PMSI Tunnel attribute described in the "Inclusive Tree/Selective Tree
   Identifier" section.  They also require additional procedures in BGP
   to signal leaf A-D routes between ASBRs as explained in subsequent
   sections.

   An ASBR must be configured to support a particular VPLS as follows:

     + An ASBR MUST be configured with a set of (import) RTs that
       specify the set of VPLS instances supported by the ASBR.  These
       RTs control acceptance of BGP VPLS auto-discovery routes by the
       ASBR.  Note that instead of being configured, the ASBR MAY obtain
       this set of (import) RTs by using Route Target Constrain
       [<a href="rfc4684.html" title='"Constrained Route Distribution for Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4684</a>].

     + The ASBR MUST be configured with the tunnel types for the intra-
       AS segments of the VPLS instances supported by the ASBR, as well
       as (depending on the tunnel type) the information needed to
       create the PMSI Tunnel attribute for these tunnel types.  Note
       that instead of being configured, the ASBR MAY derive the tunnel
       types from the Intra-AS A-D routes received by the ASBR from the
       PEs in its own AS.

   If an ASBR is configured to support a particular VPLS instance, the
   ASBR MUST participate in the intra-AS VPLS auto-discovery/binding
   procedures for that VPLS instance within the ASBR's own AS, as
   defined in this document.

   Moreover, in addition to the above, the ASBR performs procedures
   specified in the "Propagating BGP VPLS A-D Routes to Other ASes:
   Overview" section.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.2.%20%20Propagating%20BGP%20VPLS%20A-D%20Routes%20to%20Other%20ASes%3A%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2.2" name="section-7.2.2">7.2.2</a>.  Propagating BGP VPLS A-D Routes to Other ASes: Overview</span>

   A BGP VPLS A-D route for a given VPLS, originated by a PE within a
   given AS, is propagated via BGP to other ASes.  The precise rules for
   distributing and processing the Inter-AS A-D routes are given in
   subsequent sections.

   Suppose that an ASBR "A" receives and installs a BGP VPLS A-D route
   for VPLS "X" and VE-ID "V" that originated at a particular PE "PE1"
   that is in the same AS as A.  The BGP next hop of that received route
   becomes A's "upstream neighbor" on a multicast distribution tree for
   (X, V) that is rooted at PE1.  Likewise, when A re-advertises this
   route to ASBRs in A's neighboring ASes, from the perspective of these
   ASBRs A becomes their "upstream neighbor" on the multicast
   distribution tree for (X, V) that is rooted at PE1.

   When the BGP VPLS A-D routes have been distributed to all the
   necessary ASes, they define a "reverse path" from any AS that
   supports VPLS X and VE-ID V back to PE1.  For instance, if AS2
   supports VPLS X, then there will be a reverse path for VPLS X and VE





<span class="grey">Aggarwal, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 21]</span></pre>

   ID V from AS2 to AS1.  This path is a sequence of ASBRs, the first of
   which is in AS2 and the last of which is in AS1.  Each ASBR in the
   sequence is the BGP next hop of the previous ASBR in the sequence.

   This reverse path information can be used to construct a
   unidirectional multicast distribution tree for VPLS X and VE-ID V,
   containing all the ASes that support X, and having PE1 at the root.
   We call such a tree an "inter-AS tree".  Multicast data originating
   in VPLS sites for VPLS X connected to PE1 will travel downstream
   along the tree which is rooted at PE1.

   The path along an inter-AS tree is a sequence of ASBRs.  It is still
   necessary to specify how the multicast data gets from a given ASBR to
   the set of ASBRs that are immediately downstream of the given ASBR
   along the tree.  This is done by creating "segments".  ASBRs in
   adjacent ASes will be connected by inter-AS segments; ASBRs in the
   same AS will be connected by "intra-AS segments".

   For a given inter-AS tree and a given AS, there MUST be only one ASBR
   within that AS that accepts traffic flowing on that tree.  Further,
   for a given inter-AS tree and a given AS, there MUST be only one ASBR
   in that AS that sends the traffic flowing on that tree to a
   particular adjacent AS.  The precise rules for accomplishing this are
   given in subsequent sections.

   An ASBR initiates creation of an intra-AS segment when the ASBR
   receives an Inter-AS A-D route from an External BGP (EBGP) neighbor.
   Creation of the segment is completed as a result of distributing, via
   IBGP, this route within the ASBR's own AS.

   For a given inter-AS tunnel, each of its intra-AS segments could be
   constructed by its own independent mechanism.  Moreover, by using
   upstream-assigned labels within a given AS, multiple intra-AS
   segments of different inter-AS tunnels of either the same or
   different VPLS instances may share the same P-multicast tree.

   If the P-multicast tree instantiating a particular segment of an
   inter-AS tunnel is created by a multicast control protocol that uses
   receiver-initiated joins (e.g, mLDP), and this P-multicast tree does
   not aggregate multiple segments, then all the information needed to
   create that segment will be present in the Inter-AS A-D routes
   received by the ASBR from the neighboring ASBR.  But if the
   P-multicast tree instantiating the segment is created by a protocol
   that does not use receiver-initiated joins (e.g., RSVP-TE, ingress
   unicast replication), or if this P-multicast tree aggregates multiple
   segments (irrespective of the multicast control protocol used to

   create the tree), then the ASBR needs to learn the leaves of the
   segment.  These leaves are learned from A-D routes received from
   other PEs in the AS, for the same VPLS as the one to which the
   segment belongs.

   The following sections specify procedures for propagation of Inter-AS
   A-D routes across ASes in order to construct inter-AS segmented
   trees.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.2.1.%20%20Propagating%20Intra-AS%20VPLS%20A-D%20Routes%20in%20EBGP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2.2.1" name="section-7.2.2.1">7.2.2.1</a>.  Propagating Intra-AS VPLS A-D Routes in EBGP</span>

   For a given VPLS configured on an ASBR when the ASBR receives Intra-
   AS A-D routes originated by PEs in its own AS, the ASBR MUST
   propagate each of these route in EBGP.  This procedure MUST be
   performed for each of the VPLS instances configured on the ASBR.
   Each of these routes is constructed as follows:

     + The route carries a single BGP VPLS A-D NLRI with the RD and
       VE-ID being the same as the NLRI in the received Intra-AS A-D
       route.

     + The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute is set to a
       routable IP address of the ASBR.

     + The route carries the PMSI Tunnel attribute with the Tunnel Type
       set to Ingress Replication; the attribute carries no MPLS labels.

     + The route MUST carry the export RT used by the VPLS.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.2.2.%20%20Inter-AS%20A-D%20Route%20Received%20via%20EBGP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2.2.2" name="section-7.2.2.2">7.2.2.2</a>.  Inter-AS A-D Route Received via EBGP</span>

   When an ASBR receives from one of its EBGP neighbors a BGP Update
   message that carries an Inter-AS A-D route, if (a) at least one of
   the RTs carried in the message matches one of the import RTs
   configured on the ASBR, and (b) the ASBR determines that the received
   route is the best route to the destination carried in the NLRI of the
   route, the ASBR re-advertises this Inter-AS A-D route to other PEs
   and ASBRs within its own AS.  The best route selection procedures
   MUST ensure that for the same destination, all ASBRs in an AS pick
   the same route as the best route.  The best route selection
   procedures are specified in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and clarified in
   [<a href="#ref-MULTI-HOMING">MULTI-HOMING</a>].  The best route procedures ensure that if multiple
   ASBRs, in an AS, receive the same Inter-AS A-D route from their EBGP
   neighbors, only one of these ASBRs propagates this route in Internal
   BGP (IBGP).  This ASBR becomes the root of the intra-AS segment of
   the inter-AS tree and ensures that this is the only ASBR that accepts
   traffic into this AS from the inter-AS tree.

   When re-advertising an Inter-AS A-D route, the ASBR MUST set the Next
   Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute to a routable IP address of
   the ASBR.

   Depending on the type of a P-multicast tunnel used to instantiate the
   intra-AS segment of the inter-AS tunnel, the PMSI Tunnel attribute of
   the re-advertised Inter-AS A-D route is constructed as follows:

     + If the ASBR uses ingress replication to instantiate the intra-AS
       segment of the inter-AS tunnel, the re-advertised route MUST NOT
       carry the PMSI Tunnel attribute.

     + If the ASBR uses a P-multicast tree to instantiate the intra-AS
       segment of the inter-AS tunnel, the PMSI Tunnel attribute MUST
       contain the identity of the tree that is used to instantiate the
       segment (note that the ASBR could create the identity of the tree
       prior to the actual instantiation of the segment).  If, in order
       to instantiate the segment, the ASBR needs to know the leaves of
       the tree, then the ASBR obtains this information from the A-D
       routes received from other PEs/ASBRs in the ASBR's own AS.

     + An ASBR that uses a P-multicast tree to instantiate the intra-AS
       segment of the inter-AS tunnel MAY aggregate two or more VPLS
       instances present on the ASBR onto the same tree.  If the ASBR
       already advertises Inter-AS A-D routes for these VPLS instances,
       then aggregation requires the ASBR to re-advertise these routes.

       The re-advertised routes MUST be the same as the original ones,
       except for the PMSI Tunnel attribute.  If the ASBR has not
       previously advertised Inter-AS A-D routes for these VPLS
       instances, then the aggregation requires the ASBR to advertise
       (new) Inter-AS A-D routes for these VPLS instances.  The PMSI
       Tunnel attribute in the newly advertised/re-advertised routes
       MUST carry the identity of the P-multicast tree that aggregates
       the VPLS instances, as well as an MPLS upstream-assigned label
       [<a href="rfc5331.html" title='"MPLS Upstream Label Assignment and Context-Specific Label Space"'>RFC5331</a>].  Each newly advertised or re-advertised route MUST
       have a label that is distinct within the scope of the ASBR.

   In addition, the ASBR MUST send to the EBGP neighbor, from whom it
   receives the Inter-AS A-D route, a BGP Update message that carries a
   leaf A-D route.  The exact encoding of this route is described in the
   "BGP Extensions" section.  This route contains the following
   information elements:

     + The route carries a single NLRI with the Route Key field set to
       the &lt;RD, VE-ID&gt; tuple of the BGP VPLS A-D NLRI of the Inter-AS
       A-D route received from the EBGP neighbor.  The NLRI also carries
       the IP address of the ASBR (this MUST be a routable IP address).

     + The leaf A-D route MUST include the PMSI Tunnel attribute with
       the Tunnel Type set to Ingress Replication, and the Tunnel
       Identifier set to a routable address of the advertising router.
       The PMSI Tunnel attribute MUST carry a downstream-assigned MPLS
       label that is used to demultiplex the VPLS traffic received over
       a unicast tunnel by the advertising router.

     + The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route
       SHOULD be set to the same IP address as the one carried in the
       Originating Router's IP Address field of the route.

     + To constrain the distribution scope of this route, the route MUST
       carry the NO_ADVERTISE BGP Community ([<a href="rfc1997.html" title='"BGP Communities Attribute"'>RFC1997</a>]).

     + The ASBR constructs an IP-address-specific RT by placing the IP
       address carried in the Next Hop field of the received Inter-AS
       VPLS A-D route in the Global Administrator field of the
       community, with the Local Administrator field of this community
       set to 0.  It also sets the Extended Communities attribute of the
       leaf A-D route to that community.  Note that this RT is the same
       as the ASBR Import RT of the EBGP neighbor from which the ASBR
       received the Inter-AS VPLS A-D route.

   When an ASBR receives, via EBGP, a leaf A-D route, the ASBR accepts
   the route only if (a) at least one of the RTs carried in the message
   matches one of the import RTs configured on the ASBR and (b) the ASBR
   determines that the received route is the best route to the
   destination carried in the NLRI of the route.

   If the ASBR accepts the leaf A-D route, the ASBR looks for an
   existing A-D route whose BGP-VPLS A-D NLRI has the same value as the
   &lt;RD, VE-ID&gt; field of the leaf A-D route just accepted.  If such an
   A-D route is found, then the MPLS label carried in the PMSI Tunnel
   attribute of the leaf A-D route is used to stitch a one hop ASBR-ASBR
   LSP to the tail of the intra-AS tunnel segment associated with the
   found A-D route.

   by only one ASBR, as described above.

   When a PE/ASBR router receives, from one of its IBGP neighbors, a BGP
   Update message that carries an Inter-AS A-D route, if (a) at least
   one of the RTs carried in the message matches one of the import RTs
   configured on the PE/ASBR and (b) the PE/ASBR determines that the
   received route is the best route to the destination carried in the
   NLRI of the route, the PE/ASBR performs the following operations.
   The best route determination is as described in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and
   clarified in [<a href="#ref-MULTI-HOMING">MULTI-HOMING</a>].

   If the router is an ASBR, then the ASBR propagates the route to its
   EBGP neighbors.  When propagating the route to the EBGP neighbors,
   the ASBR MUST set the Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute
   to a routable IP address of the ASBR.

   If the received Inter-AS A-D route carries the PMSI Tunnel attribute
   with the Tunnel Type set to LDP P2MP LSP, the PE/ASBR SHOULD join the
   P-multicast tree whose identity is carried in the PMSI Tunnel
   attribute.

   If the received Inter-AS A-D route carries the PMSI Tunnel attribute
   with the Tunnel Identifier set to RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, then the ASBR
   that originated the route MUST establish an RSVP-TE P2MP LSP with the
   local PE/ASBR as a leaf.  This LSP MAY have been established before
   the local PE/ASBR receives the route, or it MAY be established after
   the local PE receives the route.

   If the received Inter-AS A-D route carries the PMSI Tunnel attribute
   with the Tunnel Type set to LDP P2MP LSP, or RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, but
   the attribute does not carry a label, then the P-multicast tree, as
   identified by the PMSI Tunnel attribute, is an intra-AS LSP segment
   that is part of the inter-AS tunnel for the &lt;VPLS, VE-ID&gt; advertised
   by the Inter-AS A-D route and rooted at the PE that originated the
   A-D route.  If the PMSI Tunnel attribute carries a (upstream-
   assigned) label, then a combination of this tree and the label
   identifies the intra-AS segment.  If the receiving router is an ASBR,
   this intra-AS segment may further be stitched to ASBR-ASBR inter-AS
   segment of the inter-AS tunnel.  If the PE/ASBR has local receivers
   in the VPLS, packets received over the intra-AS segment must be
   forwarded to the local receivers using the local VSI.

   In this model, there is a multi-hop EBGP peering between the PEs (or
   BGP Route Reflector) in one AS and the PEs (or BGP Route Reflector)
   in another AS.  The PEs exchange BGP-VPLS NLRI or BGP-VPLS A-D NLRI,
   along with the PMSI Tunnel attribute, as in the intra-AS case
   described in the "Demultiplexing P-Multicast Tree Traffic" section.

   The PEs in different ASes use a non-segmented inter-AS P2MP tunnel
   for VPLS multicast.  A non-segmented inter-AS tunnel is a single
   tunnel that spans AS boundaries.  The tunnel technology cannot change
   from one point in the tunnel to the next, so all ASes through which
   the tunnel passes must support that technology.  In essence, AS
   boundaries are of no significance to a non-segmented inter-AS P2MP
   tunnel.

   This model requires no VPLS A-D routes in the control plane or VPLS
   MAC address learning in the data plane on the ASBRs.  The ASBRs only
   need to participate in the non-segmented P2MP tunnel setup in the
   control plane and do MPLS label forwarding in the data plane.

   When the tunneling technology is P2MP LSP signaled with mLDP, and one
   does not use [<a href="rfc6512.html" title='"Using Multipoint LDP When the Backbone Has No Route to the Root"'>RFC6512</a>], the setup of non-segmented inter-AS P2MP
   tunnels requires the P-routers in one AS to have IP reachability to
   the loopback addresses of the PE routers in another AS.  That is, the
   reachability to the loopback addresses of PE routers in one AS MUST
   be present in the IGP in another AS.

   The data forwarding in this model is the same as in the intra-AS case
   described in the "Demultiplexing P-Multicast Tree Traffic" section.

   An implementation MUST support this model.

   Whenever a particular multicast stream is being sent on an Inclusive
   P-multicast tree, it is likely that the data of that stream is being
   sent to PEs that do not require it, as the sites connected to these
   PEs may have no receivers for the stream.  If a particular stream has
   a significant amount of traffic, it may be beneficial to move it to a
   Selective P-multicast tree that has, at its leaves, only those PEs,
   connected to sites that have receivers for the multicast stream (or
   at least includes fewer PEs that are attached to sites with no
   receivers compared to an Inclusive tree).

   A PE connected to the multicast source of a particular multicast
   stream may be performing explicit tracking; that is, it may know the
   PEs that have receivers in the multicast stream.  The "Receiving
   S-PMSI A-D Routes by PEs" section describes procedures that enable
   explicit tracking.  If this is the case, Selective P-multicast trees
   can also be triggered on other criteria.  For instance, there could
   be a "pseudo-wasted bandwidth" criterion: switching to a Selective
   tree would be done if the bandwidth multiplied by the number of
   "uninterested" PEs (PEs that are receiving the stream but have no
   receivers) is above a specified threshold.  The motivation is that
   (a) the total bandwidth wasted by many sparsely subscribed low-

   bandwidth groups may be large and (b) there's no point to moving a
   high-bandwidth group to a Selective tree if all the PEs have
   receivers for it.

   Switching a (C-S, C-G) stream to a Selective P-multicast tree may
   require the root of the tree to determine the egress PEs that need to
   receive the (C-S, C-G) traffic.  This is true in the following cases:

     + If the tunnel is a P2MP tree, such as an RSVP-TE P2MP Tunnel, the
       PE needs to know the leaves of the tree before it can instantiate
       the Selective tree.

     + If a PE decides to send traffic for multicast streams, belonging
       to different VPLS instances, using one P-multicast Selective
       tree, such a tree is called an "Aggregate tree with a selective
       mapping".  The setting up of such an Aggregate tree requires the
       ingress PE to know all the other PEs that have receivers for
       multicast groups that are mapped onto the tree (see the
       "Aggregation Considerations" section for the rationale).

     + If ingress replication is used and the ingress PE wants to send
       traffic for (C-S, C-G)s to only those PEs that are on the path to
       receivers to the (C-S, C-G)s.

   For discovering the IP multicast group membership, for the above
   cases, this document describes procedures that allow an ingress PE to
   enable explicit tracking.  Thus, an ingress PE can request the IP
   multicast membership from egress PEs for one or more C-multicast
   streams.  These procedures are described in the "Receiving S-PMSI A-D
   Routes by PEs" section.

   The root of the Selective P-multicast tree MAY decide to do explicit
   tracking of the IP multicast stream only after it has decided to move
   the stream to a Selective tree, or it MAY have been doing explicit
   tracking all along.  This document also describes explicit tracking
   for a wildcard source and/or group in the "Receiving S-PMSI A-D
   Routes by PEs" section, which facilitates a Selective P-multicast
   tree only mode in which IP multicast streams are always carried on a
   Selective P-multicast tree.  In the description on Selective
   P-multicast trees, the notation C-S is intended to represent either a
   specific source address or a wildcard.  Similarly, C-G is intended to
   represent either a specific group address or a wildcard.

   The PE at the root of the tree MUST signal the leaves of the tree
   that the (C-S, C-G) stream is now bound to the Selective tree.  Note
   that the PE could create the identity of the P-multicast tree prior
   to the actual instantiation of the tunnel.

   If the Selective tree is instantiated by an RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, the PE
   at the root of the tree MUST establish the P2MP RSVP-TE LSP to the
   leaves.  This LSP MAY have been established before the leaves receive
   the Selective tree binding, or it MAY be established after the leaves
   receive the binding.  A leaf MUST NOT switch to the Selective tree
   until it receives the binding and the RSVP-TE P2MP LSP is set up to
   the leaf.

   Selective trees provide a PE the ability to create separate
   P-multicast trees for certain (C-S, C-G) streams.  The source PE,
   which originates the Selective tree, and the egress PEs MUST use the
   Selective tree for the (C-S, C-G) streams that are mapped to it.
   This may require the source and egress PEs to switch to the Selective
   tree from an Inclusive tree if they were already using an Inclusive
   tree for the (C-S, C-G) streams mapped to the Selective tree.

   Once a source PE decides to set up a Selective tree, it MUST announce
   the mapping of the (C-S, C-G) streams (which may be in different VPLS
   instances) that are mapped to the tree to the other PEs using BGP.
   After the egress PEs receive the announcement, they set up their
   forwarding path to receive traffic on the Selective tree if they have
   one or more receivers interested in the (C-S, C-G) streams mapped to
   the tree.  Setting up the forwarding path requires setting up the
   demultiplexing forwarding entries based on the top MPLS label (if
   there is no inner label) or the inner label (if present) as described
   in the "Establishing P-Multicast Trees" section.

   When the P2MP LSP is established using mLDP, the egress PEs MAY
   perform this switch to the Selective tree once the announcement from
   the ingress PE is received, or they MAY wait for a preconfigured
   timer to do so after receiving the announcement.

   When the P2MP LSP protocol is P2MP RSVP-TE, an egress PE MUST perform
   this switch to the Selective tree only after the announcement from
   the ingress PE is received and the RSVP-TE P2MP LSP has been set up
   to the egress PE.  This switch MAY be done after waiting for a
   preconfigured timer after these two steps have been accomplished.

   A source PE MUST use the following approach to decide when to start
   transmitting data on the Selective tree, if it is currently using an
   Inclusive tree.  After announcing the (C-S, C-G) stream mapping to a
   Selective tree, the source PE MUST wait for a "switchover" delay
   before sending (C-S, C-G) stream on the Selective tree.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to allow this delay to be configurable.  Once the

   "switchover" delay has elapsed, the source PE MUST send (C-S, C-G)
   stream on the Selective tree.  In no case is any (C-S, C-G) packet
   sent on both Selective and Inclusive trees.

   When a (C-S, C-G) stream is switched from an Inclusive to a Selective
   tree, the purpose of running a switchover timer is to minimize packet
   loss without introducing packet duplication.  However, jitter may be
   introduced due to the difference in transit delays between the
   Inclusive and Selective trees.

   For best effect, the switchover timer should be configured to a value
   that is "just long enough" (a) to allow all the PEs to learn about
   the new binding of (C-S, C-G) to a Selective tree and (b) to allow
   the PEs to construct the P-tunnel associated with the Selective tree,
   if it doesn't already exist.

   The ingress PE informs all the PEs that are on the path to receivers
   of the (C-S, C-G) of the binding of the Selective tree to the (C-S,
   C-G), using BGP.  The BGP announcement is done by sending update for
   the MCAST-VPLS address family using what we referred to as an "S-PMSI
   A-D route".  The format of the NLRI of this route is described in the
   "Inclusive Tree/Selective Tree Identifier" section.  The NLRI MUST be
   constructed as follows:

     + The Route Distinguisher (RD) MUST be set to the RD configured
       locally for the VPLS.  This is required to uniquely identify the
       &lt;C-S, C-G&gt; as the addresses could overlap between different VPLS
       instances.  This MUST be the same RD value used in the VPLS auto-
       discovery process.

     + The Multicast Source field MUST contain the source address
       associated with the C-multicast stream, and the Multicast Source
       Length field is set appropriately to reflect this.  If the source
       address is a wildcard, the source address is set to 0.

     + The Multicast Group field MUST contain the group address
       associated with the C-multicast stream, and the Multicast Group
       Length field is set appropriately to reflect this.  If the group
       address is a wildcard, the group address is set to 0.

     + The Originating Router's IP Address field MUST be set to the IP
       address that the (local) PE places in the BGP Next Hop of the
       BGP-VPLS A-D routes.  Note that the &lt;RD, Originating Router's IP
       Address&gt; tuple uniquely identifies a given VPLS instance on a PE.

   The PE constructs the rest of the Selective A-D route as follows.

   Depending on the type of a P-multicast tree used for the P-tunnel,
   the PMSI Tunnel attribute of the S-PMSI A-D route is constructed as
   follows:

     + The PMSI Tunnel attribute MUST contain the identity of the
       P-multicast tree (note that the PE could create the identity of
       the tree prior to the actual instantiation of the tree).

     + If, in order to establish the P-multicast tree, the PE needs to
       know the leaves of the tree within its own AS, then the PE
       obtains this information from the leaf A-D routes received from
       other PEs/ASBRs within its own AS (as other PEs/ASBRs originate
       leaf A-D routes in response to receiving the S-PMSI A-D route) by
       setting the Leaf Information Required flag in the PMSI Tunnel

       stream(s) advertised by the S-PMSI A-D route.

     + If a PE originates S-PMSI A-D routes with the Leaf Information
       Required flag in the PMSI Tunnel attribute set to 1, then the PE
       MUST be (auto-)configured with an import RT, which controls
       acceptance of leaf A-D routes by the PE.  (Procedures for
       originating leaf A-D routes by the PEs that receive the S-PMSI
       A-D route are described in the "Receiving S-PMSI A-D Routes by
       PEs" section.)

       This RT is IP address specific.  The Global Administrator field
       of this RT MUST be set to the IP address carried in the Next Hop
       field of all the S-PMSI A-D routes advertised by this PE (if the
       PE uses different Next Hop fields, then the PE MUST be
       (auto-)configured with multiple import RTs, one per each such
       Next Hop field).  The Local Administrator field of this Route
       Target MUST be set to 0.

       If the PE supports Route Target Constrain [<a href="rfc4684.html" title='"Constrained Route Distribution for Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4684</a>], the PE
       SHOULD advertise this import RT within its own AS using Route
       Target Constrain.  To constrain distribution of the Route Target
       Constrain routes to the AS of the advertising PE these routes
       SHOULD carry the NO_EXPORT Community ([<a href="rfc1997.html" title='"BGP Communities Attribute"'>RFC1997</a>]).

     + A PE MAY aggregate two or more S-PMSIs originated by the PE onto
       the same P-multicast tree.  If the PE already advertises S-PMSI
       A-D routes for these S-PMSIs, then aggregation requires the PE to
       re-advertise these routes.  The re-advertised routes MUST be the
       same as the original ones, except for the PMSI Tunnel attribute.

   Consider a PE that receives an S-PMSI A-D route.  If one or more of
   the VSIs on the PE have their import RTs that contain one or more of
   the RTs carried by the received S-PMSI A-D route, then for each such
   VSI, the PE performs the following.

   Procedures for receiving an S-PMSI A-D route by a PE (both within and
   outside of the AS of the PE that originates the route) are the same
   as specified in the "Inter-AS A-D Route Received via IBGP" section,
   except that (a) instead of Inter-AS A-D routes the procedures apply
   to S-PMSI A-D routes, (b) the rules for determining whether the
   received S-PMSI A-D route is the best route to the destination
   carried in the NLRI of the route are the same as BGP path selection
   rules and may be modified by policy, and (c) a PE performs procedures
   specified in that section only if in addition to the criteria
   specified in that section the following is true:

     + If, as a result of multicast state snooping on the PE-CE
       interfaces, the PE has snooped state for at least one multicast
       join that matches the multicast source and group advertised in
       the S-PMSI A-D route.  Further, the oifs (outgoing interfaces)
       for this state contain one or more interfaces to the locally
       attached CEs.  When the multicast signaling protocol among the
       CEs is IGMP, then snooping and associated procedures are defined
       in [<a href="rfc4541.html" title='"Considerations for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Snooping Switches"'>RFC4541</a>].  The snooped state is determined using these
       procedures.  When the multicast signaling protocol among the CEs
       is PIM, the procedures in [<a href="rfc4541.html" title='"Considerations for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Snooping Switches"'>RFC4541</a>] are not sufficient to
       determine the snooped state.  The additional details required to

       determine the snooped state when CE-CE protocol is PIM are for
       further study.  When such procedures are defined, it is expected
       that the procedures in this section will apply to the snooped
       state created as a result of PIM as PE-CE protocol.

   The snooped state is said to "match" the S-PMSI A-D route if any of
   the following is true:

     + The S-PMSI A-D route carries (C-S, C-G) and the snooped state is
       for (C-S, C-G) or for (C-*, C-G), OR

     + The S-PMSI A-D route carries (C-*, C-G) and (a) the snooped state
       is for (C-*, C-G) OR (b) the snooped state is for at least one
       multicast join with the multicast group address equal to C-G and
       there doesn't exist another S-PMSI A-D route that carries (C-S,
       C-G) where C-S is the source address of the snooped state.

     + The S-PMSI A-D route carries (C-S, C-*) and (a) the snooped state
       is for at least one multicast join with the multicast source
       address equal to C-S, and (b) there doesn't exist another S-PMSI
       A-D route that carries (C-S, C-G) where C-G is the group address
       of the snooped state.

     + The S-PMSI A-D route carries (C-*, C-*) and there is no other
       S-PMSI A-D route that matches the snooped state as per the above
       conditions.

   Note if the above conditions are true, and if the received S-PMSI A-D
   route has a PMSI Tunnel attribute with the Leaf Information Required
   flag set to 1, then the PE originates a leaf A-D route, constructed
   as follows:

     + The route carries a single MCAST-VPLS NLRI with the Route Key
       field set to the MCAST-VPLS NLRI of the received S-PMSI A-D
       route.

     + The Originating Router's IP Address set to the IP address of the
       PE (this MUST be a routable IP address).

     + The PE constructs an IP-address-specific RT by placing the IP
       address carried in the Next Hop field of the received S-PMSI A-D
       route in the Global Administrator field of the Community, with
       the Local Administrator field of this Community set to 0 and
       setting the Extended Communities attribute of the leaf A-D route
       to that Community.

     + The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route
       MUST be set to the same IP address as the one carried in the
       Originating Router's IP Address field of the route.

     + To constrain the distribution scope of this route, the route MUST
       carry the NO_EXPORT Community [<a href="rfc1997.html" title='"BGP Communities Attribute"'>RFC1997</a>], except for the inter-AS
       scenario with option (c).

   Once the leaf A-D route is constructed, the PE advertises this route
   into IBGP.

   In addition to the procedures specified in the "Inter-AS A-D Route
   Received via IBGP" section, the PE MUST set up its forwarding path to
   receive traffic, for each multicast stream in the matching snooped
   state, from the tunnel advertised by the S-PMSI A-D route (the PE
   MUST switch to the Selective tree).

   When a new snooped state is created by a PE, then the PE MUST first
   determine if there is an S-PMSI A-D route that matches the snooped
   state as per the conditions described above.  If such an S-PMSI A-D
   route is found, then the PE MUST follow the procedures described in
   this section, for that particular S-PMSI A-D route.  If later on the
   snooped state ages out and is deleted from the PE, the PE SHOULD
   withdraw the leaf A-D route that it had originated in response to the
   S-PMSI A-D route.

   Inter-AS Selective trees support all three options of inter-AS VPLS
   service, option (a), (b), and (c), that are supported by Inter-AS
   Inclusive trees.  They are constructed in a manner that is very
   similar to Inter-AS Inclusive trees.

   For option (a) and option (b), support Inter-AS Selective trees are
   constructed without requiring a single P-multicast tree to span
   multiple ASes.  This allows individual ASes to potentially use
   different P-tunneling technologies.  There are two variants of this.
   One that requires MAC and IP multicast lookup on the ASBRs and
   another that does not require MAC/IP multicast lookup on the ASBRs
   and instead builds segmented Inter-AS Selective trees.

   Segmented Inter-AS Selective trees can also be used with option (c),
   unlike Segmented Inter-AS Inclusive trees.  This is because the
   S-PMSI A-D routes can be exchanged via ASBRs (even though BGP VPLS
   A-D routes are not exchanged via ASBRs).

   In the case of Option (c), an Inter-AS Selective tree may also be a
   non-segmented P-multicast tree that spans multiple ASes.

   The requirements on ASBRs, when VSIs are present on the ABSRs,
   include the requirements presented in the "Inter-AS Inclusive
   P-Multicast Tree A-D/Binding" section.  The source ASBR (that
   receives traffic from another AS) may independently decide whether or
   not it wishes to use Selective trees.  If it uses Selective trees,
   the source ASBR MUST perform a MAC lookup to determine the Selective
   tree to forward the VPLS packet on.

   The mechanisms for propagating S-PMSI A-D routes are the same as the
   intra-AS case described in the "MCAST-VPLS NLRI" section.  The BGP
   Selective tree A-D routes generated by PEs in an AS MUST NOT be
   propagated outside the AS.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.4.2.%20%20Inter-AS%20Segmented%20Selective%20Trees"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.4.2" name="section-8.4.2">8.4.2</a>.  Inter-AS Segmented Selective Trees</span>

   Inter-AS Segmented Selective trees MUST be implemented when option
   (b) is used to provide the inter-AS VPLS service.  They MAY be used
   when option (c) is implemented to provide the inter-AS VPLS service.

   A Segmented inter-AS Selective Tunnel is constructed similar to an
   inter-AS Segmented Inclusive Tunnel.  Namely, such a tunnel is
   constructed as a concatenation of tunnel segments.  There are two
   types of tunnel segments: an intra-AS tunnel segment (a segment that
   spans ASBRs within the same AS) and inter-AS tunnel segment (a
   segment that spans adjacent ASBRs in adjacent ASes).  ASes that are
   spanned by a tunnel are not required to use the same tunneling
   mechanism to construct the tunnel -- each AS may pick up a tunneling
   mechanism to construct the intra-AS tunnel segment of the tunnel, in
   its AS.

   The PE that decides to set up a Selective tree advertises the
   Selective tree to multicast stream binding using an S-PMSI A-D route,
   as per procedures in the "Advertising (C-S, C-G) Binding to a
   Selective Tree" section, to the routers in its own AS.

   An S-PMSI A-D route advertised outside the AS, to which the
   originating PE belongs, will be referred to as an Inter-AS S-PMSI
   tree A-D route (although this route is originated by a PE as an
   intra-AS S-PMSI A-D route, it is referred to as an Inter-AS route
   outside the AS).

   Procedures for handling an S-PMSI A-D route by ASBRs (both within and
   outside of the AS of the PE that originates the route) are the same
   as specified in the "Propagating BGP VPLS A-D Routes to Other ASes"
   section, except that instead of Inter-AS A-D routes and their NLRI,
   these procedures apply to S-PMSI A-D routes and their NLRI.

   In addition to these procedures, an ASBR advertises a leaf A-D route
   in response to an S-PMSI A-D route only if:

     + The S-PMSI A-D route was received via EBGP from another ASBR and
       the ASBR merges the S-PMSI A-D route into an Inter-AS BGP VPLS
       A-D route as described in the next section.  OR

     + The ASBR receives a leaf A-D route from a downstream PE or ASBR
       in response to the S-PMSI A-D route, received from an upstream PE
       or ASBR, that the ASBR propagated inter-AS to downstream ASBRs
       and PEs.

     + The ASBR has snooped state from local CEs that matches the NLRI
       carried in the S-PMSI A-D route as per the following rules:

      i) The NLRI encodes (C-S, C-G), which is the same as the snooped
         (C-S, C-G)

     ii) The NLRI encodes (*, C-G), there is snooped state for at least
         one (C-S, C-G), and there is no other matching S-PMSI A-D route
         for (C-S, C-G) OR there is snooped state for (*, C-G)

    iii) The NLRI encodes (*, *), there is snooped state for at least
         one (C-S, C-G) or (*, C-G), and there is no other matching
         S-PMSI A-D route for that (C-S, C-G) or (*, C-G), respectively.

   The C-multicast data traffic is sent on the Selective tree by the
   originating PE.  When it reaches an ASBR that is on the inter-AS
   segmented tree, it is delivered to local receivers, if any.  It is
   then forwarded on any inter-AS or intra-AS segments that exist on the
   Inter-AS Selective segmented tree.  If the Inter-AS Selective
   segmented tree is merged onto an Inclusive tree, as described in the
   next section, the data traffic is forwarded onto the Inclusive tree.

   Consider the situation where:

     + An ASBR is receiving (or expecting to receive) inter-AS
       (C-S, C-G) data from upstream via a Selective tree.

     + The ASBR is sending (or expecting to send) the inter-AS
       (C-S, C-G) data downstream via an Inclusive tree.

   This situation may arise if the upstream providers have a policy of
   using Selective trees but the downstream providers have a policy of
   using Inclusive trees.  To support this situation, an ASBR MAY, under
   certain conditions, merge one or more upstream Selective trees into a
   downstream Inclusive tree.  Note that this can be the case only for
   option (b) and not for option (c) as, for option (c), the ASBRs do
   not have Inclusive tree state.

   A Selective tree (corresponding to a particular S-PMSI A-D route) MAY
   be merged by a particular ASBR into an Inclusive tree (corresponding
   to a particular Inter-AS BGP VPLS A-D route) if and only if the
   following conditions all hold:

     + The S-PMSI A-D route and the Inter-AS BGP VPLS A-D route
       originate in the same AS.  The Inter-AS BGP VPLS A-D route
       carries the originating AS in the AS_PATH attribute of the route.
       The S-PMSI A-D route carries the originating AS in the AS_PATH
       attribute of the route.

     + The S-PMSI A-D route and the Inter-AS BGP VPLS A-D route have
       exactly the same set of RTs.

   An ASBR performs merging by stitching the tail end of the P-tunnel,
   as specified in the PMSI Tunnel attribute of the S-PMSI A-D route
   received by the ASBR, to the head of the P-tunnel, as specified in
   the PMSI Tunnel attribute of the Inter-AS BGP VPLS A-D route
   re-advertised by the ASBR.

   An ASBR that merges an S-PMSI A-D route into an Inter-AS BGP VPLS A-D
   route MUST NOT re-advertise the S-PMSI A-D route.

   Inter-AS Non-segmented Selective trees MAY be used in the case of
   option (c).

   In this method, there is a multi-hop EBGP peering between the PEs (or
   a Route Reflector) in one AS and the PEs (or Route Reflector) in
   another AS.  The PEs exchange BGP Selective tree A-D routes, along
   with PMSI Tunnel attribute, as in the intra-AS case described in the
   "Option (c): Non-segmented Tunnels" section.

   The PEs in different ASes use a non-segmented Selective inter-AS P2MP
   tunnel for VPLS multicast.

   This method requires no VPLS information (in either the control or
   the data plane) on the ASBRs.  The ASBRs only need to participate in
   the non-segmented P2MP tunnel setup in the control plane and do MPLS
   label forwarding in the data plane.

   The data forwarding in this model is the same as in the intra-AS case
   described in the "Establishing P-Multicast Trees" section.

   This document defines a new BGP NLRI, called the "MCAST-VPLS NLRI".

   Following is the format of the MCAST-VPLS NLRI:

                +-----------------------------------+
                |    Route Type (1 octet)           |
                +-----------------------------------+
                |     Length (1 octet)              |
                +-----------------------------------+
                |    Route Type specific (variable) |
                +-----------------------------------+

   The Route Type field defines encoding of the Route Type specific
   field of MCAST-VPLS NLRI.

   The Length field indicates the length in octets of the Route Type
   specific field of MCAST-VPLS NLRI.

   This document defines the following route types for A-D routes:

     + 3 - Selective Tree A-D route;
     + 4 - Leaf A-D route.

   The MCAST-VPLS NLRI is carried in BGP using BGP Multiprotocol
   Extensions [<a href="rfc4760.html" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>RFC4760</a>] with an Address Family Identifier (AFI) of 25
   (L2VPN AFI), and a Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) of
   MCAST-VPLS.  The NLRI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI
   attribute contains the MCAST-VPLS NLRI (encoded as specified above).

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange labeled MCAST-VPLS NLRI,
   they must use BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure that they both
   are capable of properly processing such NLRI.  This is done as
   specified in [<a href="rfc4760.html" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>RFC4760</a>], by using capability code 1 (multiprotocol
   BGP) with an AFI of 25 and a SAFI of MCAST-VPLS.

   The following describes the format of the Route Type specific field
   of MCAST-VPLS NLRI for various route types defined in this document.

   The Route Type specific field of MCAST-VPLS NLRI of an S-PMSI A-D
   route consists of the following:

                +-----------------------------------+
                |      RD   (8 octets)              |

                |  Multicast Group   (Variable)     |

                |   Originating Router's IP Addr    |
                +-----------------------------------+

   The RD is encoded as described in [<a href="rfc4364.html" title='"BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4364</a>].

   The Multicast Source field contains the C-S address, i.e., the
   address of the multicast source.  If the Multicast Source field
   contains an IPv4 address, then the value of the Multicast Source
   Length field is 32.  If the Multicast Source field contains an IPv6
   address, then the value of the Multicast Source Length field is 128.
   The value of the Multicast Source Length field may be set to 0 to
   indicate a wildcard.

   The Multicast Group field contains the C-G address, i.e., the address
   of the multicast group.  If the Multicast Group field contains an
   IPv4 address, then the value of the Multicast Group Length field is
   32.  If the Multicast Group field contains an IPv6 address, then the
   value of the Multicast Group Length field is 128.  The Multicast
   Group Length field may be set to 0 to indicate a wildcard.

   Whether the Originating Router's IP Address field carries an IPv4 or
   IPv6 address is determined by the value of the Length field of the
   MCAST-VPLS NLRI.  If the Multicast Source field contains an IPv4
   address and the Multicast Group field contains an IPv4 address, then
   the value of the Length field is 22 bytes if the Originating Router's
   IP Address carries an IPv4 address and 34 bytes if it is an IPv6
   address.  If the Multicast Source and Multicast Group fields contain
   IPv6 addresses, then the value of the Length field is 46 bytes if the
   Originating Router's IP Address carries an IPv4 address and 58 bytes
   if it is an IPv6 address.  The following table summarizes the above.

   The Route Type specific field of MCAST-VPLS NLRI of a leaf A-D route
   consists of the following:

                +-----------------------------------+
                |      Route Key (variable)         |
                +-----------------------------------+
                |   Originating Router's IP Addr    |
                +-----------------------------------+

   Whether the Originating Router's IP Address field carries an IPv4 or
   IPv6 address is determined by the Length field of the MCAST-VPLS NLRI
   and the length of the Route Key field.  From these two length fields,
   one can compute the length of the Originating Router's IP Address.
   If this computed length is 4, then the address is an IPv4 address; if
   its 16, then the address is an IPv6 address.

   Usage of leaf A-D routes is described in the "Inter-AS Inclusive
   P-Multicast Tree A-D/Binding" and "Optimizing Multicast Distribution
   via Selective Trees" sections.

   This document does not specify the mandatory implementation of any
   particular set of rules for determining whether or not the Inclusive
   or Selective trees of two particular VPLS instances are to be
   instantiated by the same Aggregate Inclusive/Selective tree.  This
   determination can be made by implementation-specific heuristics, by
   configuration, or even perhaps by the use of offline tools.

   This section discusses potential methodologies with respect to
   aggregation.







<span class="grey">Aggarwal, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 41]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7117.html">RFC 7117</a>                    Multicast in VPLS              February 2014</span>


   In general, the heuristic used to decide which VPLS instances or
   &lt;C-S, C-G&gt; entries to aggregate is implementation dependent.  It is
   also conceivable that offline tools can be used for this purpose.
   This section discusses some trade-offs with respect to aggregation.

   The "congruency" of aggregation is defined by the amount of overlap
   in the leaves of the client trees that are aggregated on an SP tree.
   For Aggregate Inclusive trees, the congruency depends on the overlap
   in the membership of the VPLS instances that are aggregated on the
   Aggregate Inclusive tree.  If there is complete overlap, aggregation
   is perfectly congruent.  As the overlap between the VPLS instances
   that are aggregated reduces, the congruency reduces.

   From the above definition of "congruency", it follows that in order
   for a given PE to determine the congruency of the client trees that
   this PE could aggregate, the PE has to know the leaves of these
   client trees.  This is irrespective of whether the aggregated SP tree
   is established using mLDP or RSVP-TE.

   If aggregation is done such that it is not perfectly congruent, a PE
   may receive traffic for VPLS instances to which it doesn't belong.
   As the amount of multicast traffic in these unwanted VPLS instances
   increases, aggregation becomes less optimal with respect to delivered
   traffic.  Hence, there is a trade-off between reducing multicast
   state in the core and delivering unwanted traffic.

   An implementation should provide knobs to control aggregation based
   on the congruency of the tree to be aggregated.  This will allow an
   SP to deploy aggregation depending on the VPLS membership and traffic
   profiles in its network.  If different PEs are setting up Aggregate
   Inclusive trees, this will also allow an SP to engineer the maximum
   amount of unwanted VPLS instances for which a particular PE may
   receive traffic.

   The state/bandwidth optimality trade-off can be further improved by
   having a versatile many-to-many association between client trees and
   provider trees.  Thus, a VPLS instance can be mapped to multiple
   Aggregate trees.  The mechanisms for achieving this are for further
   study.  Also, it may be possible to use both ingress replication and
   an Aggregate tree for a particular VPLS.  Mechanisms for achieving
   this are also for further study.

   When an ingress PE receives a packet, the ingress PE using the
   procedures defined in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="rfc4762.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling"'>RFC4762</a>] determines the VPLS
   instance associated with the packet.  If the packet is an IP
   multicast packet, and the ingress PE uses an Aggregate Selective tree
   for the (C-S, C-G) carried in the packet, then the ingress PE pushes
   the VPLS Label associated with the VPLS instance on the ingress PE
   and the MPLS Tree Label associated with the Aggregate Selective tree,
   and it sends the packet over the P2MP LSP associated with the
   Aggregate Selective tree.  Otherwise, if the ingress PE does not use
   an Aggregate Selective tree for the (C-S, C-G), or the packet is
   either non-IP multicast or broadcast, the ingress PE pushes the VPLS
   label associated with the VPLS instance on the ingress PE and the
   MPLS Tree Label associated with the Aggregate Inclusive tree, and it
   sends the packet over the P2MP LSP associated with the Aggregate
   Inclusive tree.

   The egress PE does a lookup on the outer MPLS tree label, and
   determines the MPLS forwarding table in which to look up the inner
   MPLS label (VPLS label).  This table is specific to the tree label

   label) is unique within the context of the root of the tree (as it is

   assigned by the root of the tree, without any coordination with any
   other nodes).  Thus, it is not unique across multiple roots.  So, to
   unambiguously identify a particular VPLS, one has to know the VPLS
   label, and the context within which that label is unique.  The
   context is provided by the outer MPLS label (MPLS Tree Label)
   [<a href="rfc5331.html" title='"MPLS Upstream Label Assignment and Context-Specific Label Space"'>RFC5331</a>].

   The outer MPLS label is popped.  The lookup of the resulting MPLS
   label determines the VSI in which the egress PE needs to do the
   C-multicast data packet lookup.  It then pops the inner MPLS label
   and sends the packet to the VSI for multicast data forwarding.

   The egress PE does a lookup on the MPLS tree label and determines the

   lookup.  It then pops the MPLS label and sends the packet to the VSI
   for multicast data forwarding.

   If the destination MAC address of a VPLS packet received by an
   ingress PE from a VPLS site is a multicast address, a P-multicast
   tree SHOULD be used to transport the packet, if possible.  If the
   packet is an IP multicast packet and a Selective tree exists for that
   multicast stream, the Selective tree MUST be used.  Else, if a
   (C-*, C-*) Selective tree exists for the VPLS it SHOULD be used.
   Else, if an Inclusive tree exists for the VPLS, it SHOULD be used.

   If the destination MAC address of a VPLS packet is a broadcast
   address, it is flooded.  If a (C-*, C-*) Selective tree exists for
   the VPLS, the PE SHOULD flood over it.  Else, if an Inclusive tree
   exists for the VPLS, the PE SHOULD flood over it.  Else, the PE MUST
   flood the packet using the procedures in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] or [<a href="rfc4762.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling"'>RFC4762</a>].

   If the destination MAC address of a packet is a unicast address and
   it has not been learned, the packet MUST be sent to all PEs in the
   VPLS.  Inclusive P-multicast trees or a Selective P-multicast tree
   bound to (C-*, C-*) SHOULD be used for sending unknown unicast MAC
   packets to all PEs.  When this is the case, the receiving PEs MUST
   support the ability to perform MAC address learning for packets
   received on a multicast tree.  In order to perform such learning, the
   receiver PE MUST be able to determine the sender PE when a VPLS
   packet is received on a P-multicast tree.  This further implies that
   the MPLS P-multicast tree technology MUST allow the egress PE to
   determine the sender PE from the received MPLS packet.

   When a receiver PE receives a VPLS packet with a source MAC address,
   which has not yet been learned, on a P-multicast tree, the receiver
   PE determines the PW to the sender PE.  The receiver PE then creates
   forwarding state in the VPLS instance with a destination MAC address
   being the same as the source MAC address being learned, and the PW
   being the PW to the sender PE.

   It should be noted that when a sender PE that is sending packets
   destined to an unknown unicast MAC address over a P-multicast tree
   learns the PW to use for forwarding packets destined to this unicast
   MAC address, it might immediately switch to transport such packets
   over this particular PW.  Since the packets were initially being
   forwarded using a P-multicast tree, this could lead to packet

   instead of multiple PWs based on [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] or [<a href="rfc4762.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling"'>RFC4762</a>].

   An implementation SHOULD support the ability to transport unknown
   unicast traffic over Inclusive P-multicast trees.  Furthermore, an
   implementation MUST support the ability to perform MAC address
   learning for packets received on a P-multicast tree.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/13.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-13" name="section-13">13</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Security considerations discussed in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>] and [<a href="rfc4762.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling"'>RFC4762</a>] apply to
   this document.  This section describes additional considerations.

   As mentioned in [<a href="rfc4761.html" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling"'>RFC4761</a>], there are two aspects to achieving data
   privacy and protecting against denial-of-service attacks in a VPLS:
   securing the control plane and protecting the forwarding path.
   Compromise of the control plane could result in a PE sending
   multicast data belonging to some VPLS to another VPLS, or black-
   holing VPLS multicast data, or even sending it to an eavesdropper;
   none of which are acceptable from a data privacy point of view.  In
   addition, compromise of the control plane could result in black-
   holing VPLS multicast data and could provide opportunities for
   unauthorized VPLS multicast usage (e.g., exploiting traffic
   replication within a multicast tree to amplify a denial-of-service
   attack based on sending large amounts of traffic).

   The mechanisms in this document use BGP for the control plane.
   Hence, techniques such as in [<a href="rfc5925.html" title='"The TCP Authentication Option"'>RFC5925</a>] help authenticate BGP
   messages, making it harder to spoof updates (which can be used to
   divert VPLS traffic to the wrong VPLS) or withdrawals (denial-of-
   service attacks).  In the multi-AS methods (b) and (c) described in
   the "Inter-AS Inclusive P-Multicast Tree A-D/Binding" section, this
   also means protecting the inter-AS BGP sessions, between the ASBRs,
   the PEs, or the Route Reflectors.

   Note that [<a href="rfc5925.html" title='"The TCP Authentication Option"'>RFC5925</a>] will not help in keeping MPLS labels, associated
   with P2MP LSPs or the upstream MPLS labels used for aggregation,
   private -- knowing the labels, one can eavesdrop on VPLS traffic.
   However, this requires access to the data path within an SP network,
   which is assumed to be composed of trusted nodes/links.

   One of the requirements for protecting the data plane is that the
   MPLS labels be accepted only from valid interfaces.  This applies
   both to MPLS labels associated with P2MP LSPs and to the upstream-
   assigned MPLS labels.  For a PE, valid interfaces comprise links from
   other routers in the PE's own AS.  For an ASBR, valid interfaces
   comprise links from other routers in the ASBR's own AS, and links

   from other ASBRs in ASes that have instances of a given VPLS.  It is
   especially important in the case of multi-AS VPLS instances that one
   accept VPLS packets only from valid interfaces.

   This document defines a new NLRI, called "MCAST-VPLS", to be carried
   in BGP using multiprotocol extensions.  IANA has assigned it a SAFI
   value of 8.

   This document defines a BGP-optional transitive attribute called
   "PMSI_TUNNEL".  This is the same attribute as the one defined in
   [<a href="rfc6514.html" title='"BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6514</a>] and the code point for this attribute has already been
   assigned by IANA as 22 [<a href="#ref-BGP-IANA" title='"Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters"'>BGP-IANA</a>].  Hence, no further action is
   required from IANA regarding this attribute.

   Many thanks to Thomas Morin for his support of this work.

   We would also like to thank authors of [<a href="rfc6514.html" title='"BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6514</a>] and [<a href="rfc6513.html" title='"Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6513</a>], as
   the details of the inter-AS segmented tree procedures in this
   document, as well as some text that describes these procedures have
   benefited from those in [<a href="rfc6514.html" title='"BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6514</a>] and [<a href="rfc6513.html" title='"Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>RFC6513</a>].  The same applies to
   the notion of Inclusive and Selective trees, as well as the
   procedures for switching from Inclusive to Selective trees.

   We would also like to thank Nabil Bitar, Stewart Bryant, Wim
   Henderickx, and Eric Rosen for their review and comments.
