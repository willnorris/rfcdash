Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for devices implementing the Network Address Translator (NAT)
   function.  The new MIB module defined in this document, NATV2-MIB, is
   intended to replace module NAT-MIB (<a href="rfc4008.html">RFC 4008</a>).  NATV2-MIB is not
   backwards compatible with NAT-MIB, for reasons given in the text of
   this document.  A companion document deprecates all objects in NAT-
   MIB.  NATV2-MIB can be used for the monitoring of NAT instances on a
   device capable of NAT function.  Compliance levels are defined for
   three application scenarios: basic NAT, pooled NAT, and
   carrier-grade NAT (CGN).

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="rfc2578.html" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="rfc2579.html" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for devices implementing NAT functions.  This MIB module, NATV2-MIB,
   may be used for the monitoring of such devices.  NATV2-MIB supersedes
   NAT-MIB [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>], which did not fit well with existing NAT
   implementations, and hence was not itself much implemented.
   [<a href="rfc7658.html" title='"Deprecation of MIB Module NAT-MIB: Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NATs)"'>RFC7658</a>] provides a detailed analysis of the deficiencies of
   NAT-MIB.

   Relative to [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] and based on the analysis just mentioned, the
   present document introduces the following changes:

   o  removed all writable configuration except that related to control
      of the generation of notifications and the setting of quotas on
      the use of NAT resources;

   o  minimized the read-only exposure of configuration to what is
      needed to provide context for the state and statistical
      information presented by the MIB module;

   o  removed the association between mapping and interfaces, retaining
      only the mapping aspect;

   o  replaced references to NAT types with references to NAT behaviors
      as specified in [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>];

   o  replaced a module-specific enumeration of protocols with the
      standard protocol numbers provided by the IANA Protocol Numbers
      registry.

   This MIB module adds the following features not present in [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>]:

   o  additional writable protective limits on NAT state data;

   o  additional objects to report state, statistics, and notifications;

   o  support for the carrier-grade NAT (CGN) application, including
      subscriber-awareness, support for an arbitrary number of address
      realms, and support for multiple NAT instances running on a single
      device;

   o  expanded support for address pools;

   o  revised indexing of port map entries to simplify traceback from
      externally observable packet parameters to the corresponding
      internal endpoint.

   These features are described in more detail below.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows:

   o  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> provides a verbal description of the content and
      organization of the MIB module.

   o  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> provides the MIB module definition.

   o  <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> discusses operational and management issues relating to
      the deployment of NATV2-MIB.  One of these issues is NAT
      management when both NAT-MIB [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] and NATV2-MIB are deployed.

   o  Sections <a href="#section-6">6</a> and <a href="#section-7">7</a> provide a security discussion and a request to
      IANA for allocation of an object identifier for the module in the
      mib-2 tree, respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   This document uses the following terminology:

   Upper-layer protocol:  The protocol following the outer IP header of
      a packet.  This follows the terminology of [<a href="rfc2460.html" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>], but as that
      document points out, "upper" is not necessarily a correct
      description of the protocol relationships (e.g., where IP is
      encapsulated in IP).  The abbreviated term "protocol" will often
      be used where it is unambiguous.

   Trigger:  With respect to notifications, the logical recognition of
      the event that the notification is intended to report.

   Report:  The actual production of a notification message.  Reporting
      can happen later than triggering, or may never happen for a given
      notification instance, because of the operation of notification
      rate controls.

   Address realm:  A network domain in which the network addresses are
      uniquely assigned to entities such that datagrams can be routed to
      them.  (Definition taken from <a href="rfc2663.html#section-2.1">[RFC2663], Section 2.1</a>.)  The
      abbreviated term "realm" will often be used.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   This section provides a prose description of the contents and
   organization of the NATV2-MIB module.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Content%20Provided%20by%20the%20NATV2-MIB%20Module"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Content Provided by the NATV2-MIB Module</span>

   The content provided by the NATV2-MIB module can be classed under
   four headings: configuration data, notifications, state information,
   and statistics.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.%20%20Configuration%20Data"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" name="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Configuration Data</span>

   As mentioned above, the intent in designing the NATV2-MIB module was
   to minimize the amount of configuration data presented to that needed
   to give a context for interpreting the other types of information
   provided.  Detailed descriptions of the configuration data are
   included with the descriptions of the individual tables.  In general,
   that data is limited to what is needed for indexing and cross-
   referencing between tables.  The two exceptions are the objects
   describing NAT instance behavior in the NAT instance table and the
   detailed enumeration of resources allocated to each address pool in
   the pool table and its extension.

   The NATV2-MIB module provides three sets of read-write objects,
   specifically related to other aspects of the module content.  The
   first set controls the rate at which specific notifications are
   generated.  The second set provides thresholds used to trigger the
   notifications.  These objects are listed in <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a>.

   A third set of read-write objects sets limits on resource consumption
   per NAT instance and per subscriber.  When these limits are reached,
   packets requiring further consumption of the given resource are

   dropped rather than translated.  Statistics described in
   <a href="#section-3.1.4">Section 3.1.4</a> record the numbers of packets dropped.  Limits are
   provided for:

   o  total number of address map entries over the NAT instance.  Limit
      is set by object natv2InstanceLimitAddressMapEntries in table
      natv2InstanceTable.  Dropped packets are counted in
      natv2InstanceAddressMapEntryLimitDrops in that table.

   o  total number of port map entries over the NAT instance.  Limit is
      set by object natv2InstanceLimitPortMapEntries in table
      natv2InstanceTable.  Dropped packets are counted in
      natv2InstancePortMapEntryLimitDrops in that table.

   o  total number of held fragments (applicable only when the NAT
      instance can receive fragments out of order; see <a href="rfc4787.html#section-11">[RFC4787],
      Section 11</a>).  Limit is set by object
      natv2InstanceLimitPendingFragments in table natv2InstanceTable.
      Dropped packets are counted by natv2InstanceFragmentDrops in the
      same table.

   o  total number of active subscribers (i.e., subscribers having at
      least one mapping table entry) over the NAT instance.  Limit is
      set by object natv2InstanceLimitSubscriberActives in table
      natv2InstanceTable.  Dropped packets are counted by
      natv2InstanceSubscriberActiveLimitDrops in the same table.

   o  number of port map entries for an individual subscriber.  Limit is
      set by object natv2SubscriberLimitPortMapEntries in table
      natv2SubscriberTable.  Dropped packets are counted by
      natv2SubscriberPortMapFailureDrops in the same table.  Note that,
      unlike in the instance table, the per-subscriber count is lumped
      in with the count of packets dropped because of failures to
      allocate a port map entry for other reasons to save on storage.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.2.%20%20Notifications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2" name="section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Notifications</span>

   NATV2-MIB provides five notifications, intended to provide warning of
   the need to provision or reallocate NAT resources.  As indicated in
   the previous section, each notification is associated with two read-
   write objects: a control on the rate at which that notification is
   generated and a threshold value used to trigger the notification in
   the first place.  The default setting within the MIB module
   specification is that all notifications are disabled.  The setting of
   threshold values is discussed in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.






<span class="grey">Perreault, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 6]</span></pre>

   The five notifications are as follows:

   o  Two notifications relate to the management of address pools.  One
      indicates that usage equals or exceeds an upper threshold and is
      therefore a warning that the pool may be over-utilized unless more
      addresses are assigned to it.  The other notification indicates
      that usage equals or has fallen below a lower threshold,
      suggesting that some addresses allocated to that pool could be
      reallocated to other pools.  Address pool usage is calculated as
      the percentage of the total number of ports allocated to the
      address pool that are already in use, for the most-mapped protocol
      at the time the notification is generated.  The notifications
      identify that protocol and report the number of port map entries
      for that protocol in the given address pool at the moment the
      notification was triggered.

   o  Two notifications relate to the number of address and port map
      entries, respectively, in total over the whole NAT instance.  In
      both cases, the threshold that triggers the notification is an
      upper threshold.  The notifications return the number of mapping
      entries of the given type, plus a cumulative counter of the number
      of entries created in that mapping table at the moment the
      notification was triggered.  The intent is that the notifications
      provide a warning that the total number of address or port map
      entries is approaching the configured limit.

   o  The final notification is generated on a per-subscriber basis when
      the number of port map entries for that subscriber crosses the
      associated threshold.  The objects returned by this notification
      are similar to those returned for the instance-level mapping
      notifications.  This notification is a warning that the number of
      port map entries for the subscriber is approaching the configured
      limit for that subscriber.

   Here is a detailed specification of the notifications.  A given
   notification can be disabled by setting the threshold to -1
   (default).

   Notification: natv2NotificationPoolUsageLow.  Indicates that address
   pool usage for the most-mapped protocol equals or is less than the
   threshold value.

   Compared value:  natv2PoolNotifiedPortMapEntries as a percentage of
      total available ports in the pool.

   Threshold:  natv2PoolThresholdUsageLow in natv2PoolTable.

   State information provides a snapshot of the content and extent of
   the NAT mapping tables at a given moment of time.  The address and
   port mapping tables are described in detail below.  In addition to
   these tables, two state variables are provided: current number of
   entries in the address mapping table, and current number of entries
   in the port mapping table.  With one exception, these are provided at
   four levels of granularity: per NAT instance, per protocol, per
   address pool, and per subscriber.  Address map entries are not
   tracked per protocol, since address mapping is protocol independent.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.4.%20%20Statistics"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.4" name="section-3.1.4">3.1.4</a>.  Statistics</span>

   NATV2-MIB provides a number of counters, intended to help with both
   the provisioning of the NAT and the debugging of problems.  As with
   the state data, these counters are provided at the four levels of NAT
   instance, protocol, address pool, and subscriber when they make
   sense.  Each counter is cumulative, beginning from a "last
   discontinuity time" recorded by an object that is usually in the
   table containing the counter.

   The basic set of counters, as reflected in the NAT instance table, is
   as follows:

   Translations:  number of packets processed and translated (in this
      case, in total for the NAT instance).

   Address map entry creations:  cumulative number of address map
      entries created, including static mappings.

   Port map entry creations:  cumulative number of port map entries
      created, including static mappings.

   Address map limit drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped rather
      than translated because the packet would have triggered the
      creation of a new address mapping, but the configured limit on
      number of address map entries has already been reached.

   Port map limit drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped rather
      than translated because the packet would have triggered the
      creation of a new port mapping, but the configured limit on number
      of port map entries has already been reached.

   Active subscriber limit drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped
      rather than translated because the packet would have triggered the
      creation of a new address and/or port mapping for a subscriber
      with no existing entries in either table, but the configured limit
      on number of active subscribers has already been reached.

   Address mapping failure drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped
      because the packet would have triggered the creation of a new
      address mapping, but no address could be allocated in the external
      realm concerned because all addresses from the selected address
      pool (or the whole realm, if no address pool has been configured
      for that realm) have already been fully allocated.

   Port mapping failure drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped
      because the packet would have triggered the creation of a new port
      mapping, but no port could be allocated for the protocol
      concerned.  The precise conditions under which these packet drops
      occur depend on the pooling behavior [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>] configured or
      implemented in the NAT instance.  See the DESCRIPTION clause for
      the natv2InstancePortMapFailureDrops object for a detailed
      description of the different cases.  These cases were defined with
      care to ensure that address mapping failure could be distinguished
      from port mapping failure.

   Fragment drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped because the
      packet contains a fragment, and the fragment behavior [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>]
      configured or implemented in the NAT instance indicates that the
      packet should be dropped.  The main case is a NAT instance that
      meets REQ-14 of [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], hence it can receive and process out-
      of-order fragments.  In that case, dropping occurs only when the

      configured limit on pending fragments provided by NATV2-MIB has
      already been reached.  The other cases are detailed in the
      DESCRIPTION clause of the natv2InstanceFragmentBehavior object.

   Other resource drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped because
      of unavailability of some other resource.  The most likely case
      would be packets where the upper-layer protocol is not one
      supported by the NAT instance.

   Figure 1 shows how object identifiers are organized in the NATV2-MIB
   module.  Under the general natv2MIB object identifier in the mib-2
   tree, the objects are classed into four groups:

   natv2MIBNotifications(0):  identifies the five notifications
      described in <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a>.

   natv2MIBDeviceObjects(1):  identifies objects relating to the whole
      device, specifically, the subscriber table.

   natv2MIBInstanceObjects(2):  identifies objects relating to
      individual NAT instances.  These include the NAT instance table,
      the protocol table, the address pool table and its address range
      expansion, the address map table, and the port map table.

   natv2MIBConformance(3):  identifies the group and compliance clauses,

   This section reviews the contents of the NATV2-MIB module.  The table
   descriptions include references to subsections of <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> where
   desirable to avoid repetition of that information.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.1.%20%20Textual%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.1" name="section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  Textual Conventions</span>

   The module defines four key textual conventions: ProtocolNumber,
   Natv2SubscriberIndex, Natv2InstanceIndex, and Natv2PoolIndex.
   ProtocolNumber is based on the IANA registry of protocol numbers and
   hence is potentially reusable by other MIB modules.

   Objects of type Natv2SubscriberIndex identify individual subscribers
   served by the NAT device.  The values of these identifiers are
   administered and, in intent, are permanently associated with their
   respective subscribers.  Reuse of a value after a subscriber has been
   deleted is discouraged.  The scope of the subscriber index was
   defined to be at the device rather than the NAT instance level to
   make it easier to shift subscribers between instances (e.g., for load
   balancing).

   Objects of type Natv2InstanceIndex identify specific NAT instances on
   the device.  Again, these are administered values intended to be
   permanently associated with the NAT instances to which they have been
   assigned.

   Objects of type Natv2PoolIndex identify individual address pools in a
   given NAT instance.  As with the subscriber and instance index
   objects, the pool identifiers are administered and intended to be
   permanently associated with their respective pools.

   Table natv2SubscriberTable is indexed by the subscriber index.  One
   conceptual row contains information relating to a specific
   subscriber: the subscriber's internal address or prefix for
   correlation with other management information; state and statistical
   information as described in Sections <a href="#section-3.1.3">3.1.3</a> and <a href="#section-3.1.4">3.1.4</a>; the per-
   subscriber control objects described in <a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a>; and
   natv2SubscriberDiscontinuityTime, which provides a timestamp of the
   latest time following, which the statistics have accumulated without
   discontinuity.

   Turning back to the address information for a moment: this
   information includes the identity of the address realm in which the
   address is routable.  That enables support of an arbitrary number of
   address realms on the same NAT instance.  Address realm identifiers
   are administered values in the form of a limited-length
   SnmpAdminString.  In the absence of configuration to the contrary,
   the default realm for all internal addresses as recorded in mapping
   entries is "internal".

      The term "address realm" is defined in <a href="rfc2663.html#section-2.1">[RFC2663], Section 2.1</a> and
      reused in subsequent NAT-related documents.

   In the special case of Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) [<a href="rfc6333.html" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>], for
   unique matching of the subscriber data to other information in the
   MIB module, it is necessary that the address information should
   relate to the outer IPv6 header of packets going to or from the host,
   with the address realm being the one in which that IPv6 address is
   routable.  The presentation of address information for other types of
   tunneled access to the NAT is out of scope.

   Table natv2InstanceTable is indexed by an object of type
   Natv2InstanceIndex.  A conceptual row of this table provides
   information relating to a particular NAT instance configured on the
   device.

   Configuration information provided by this table includes an instance
   name of type DisplayString that may have been configured for this
   instance and a set of objects indicating, respectively, the port
   mapping, filtering, pooling, and fragment behaviors configured or
   implemented in the instance.  These behaviors are all defined in
   [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>].  Their values affect the interpretation of some of the
   statistics provided in the instance table.

   Read-write objects listed in <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a> set the notification rate
   for instance-level notifications and set the thresholds that trigger
   them.  Additional read-write objects described in <a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a> set
   limits on the number of address and port mapping entries, number of
   pending fragments, and number of active subscribers for the instance.

   The state and statistical information provided by this table consists
   of the per-instance items described in Sections <a href="#section-3.1.3">3.1.3</a> and <a href="#section-3.1.4">3.1.4</a>,
   respectively. natv2InstanceDiscontinuityTime is a timestamp giving
   the time beyond which all of the statistical counters in
   natv2InstanceTable are guaranteed to have accumulated continuously.

   The protocol table is indexed by the NAT instance number and an
   object of type ProtocolNumber as described in <a href="#section-3.3.1">Section 3.3.1</a> (i.e., an
   IANA-registered protocol number).  The set of protocols supported by
   the NAT instance is implementation dependent, but they MUST include
   ICMP(1), TCP(6), UDP(17), and ICMPv6(58).  Depending on the
   application, it SHOULD include IPv4 encapsulation(4), IPv6
   encapsulation(41), IPsec AH(51), and SCTP(132).  Support of PIM(103)
   is highly desirable.

   This table includes no configuration information.  The state and
   statistical information provided by this table consists of the per-
   protocol items described in Sections <a href="#section-3.1.3">3.1.3</a> and <a href="#section-3.1.4">3.1.4</a>, respectively.
   natv2InstanceDiscontinuityTime in natv2InstanceTable is reused as the
   timestamp giving the time beyond which all of the statistical
   counters in natv2ProtocolTable are guaranteed to have accumulated
   continuously.  The reasoning is that any event affecting the
   continuity of per-protocol statistics will affect the continuity of
   NAT instance statistics, and vice versa.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.6.%20%20The%20Address%20Pool%20Table%3A%20natv2PoolTable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.6" name="section-3.3.6">3.3.6</a>.  The Address Pool Table: natv2PoolTable</span>

   The address pool table is indexed by the NAT instance identifier for
   the instance on which it is provisioned, plus a pool index of type
   Natv2PoolIndex.  Configuration information provided includes the
   address realm for which the pool provides addresses, the type of
   address (IPv4 or IPv6) supported by the realm, plus the port range it
   makes available for allocation.  The same set of port numbers (or, in
   the ICMP case, identifier values) is made available for every
   protocol supported by the NAT instance.  The port range is specified
   in terms of minimum and maximum port number.

   The state and statistical information provided by this table consists
   of the per-pool items described in Sections <a href="#section-3.1.3">3.1.3</a> and <a href="#section-3.1.4">3.1.4</a>
   respectively, plus two additional state objects described below.
   natv2PoolTable provides the pool-specific object
   natv2PoolDiscontinuityTime to indicate the time since the statistical
   counters have accumulated continuously.

   Read-write objects to set high and low thresholds for pool usage
   notifications and for governing the notification rate were identified
   in <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a>.

      Implementation note: the thresholds are defined in terms of
      percentage of available port utilization.  The number of available
      ports in a pool is equal to (max port - min port + 1) (from the
      natv2PoolTable configuration information) multiplied by the number
      of addresses provisioned in the pool (sum of number of addresses
      provided by each natv2PoolRangeTable conceptual row relating to
      that pool).  At configuration time, the thresholds can be
      recalculated in terms of total number of port map entries
      corresponding to the configured percentage, so that runtime
      comparisons to the current number of port map entries require no
      further arithmetic operations.

   natv2PoolTable also provides two state objects that are returned with
   the notifications.  natv2PoolNotifiedPortMapProtocol identifies the
   most-mapped protocol at the time the notification was triggered.

   natv2PoolRangeTable provides configuration information only.  It is
   an expansion of natv2PoolTable giving the address ranges with which a
   given address pool has been configured.  As such, it is indexed by
   the combination of NAT instance index, address pool index, and a
   conceptual row index, where each conceptual row conveys a different
   address range.  The address range is specified in terms of lowest
   address, highest address rather than the usual prefix notation to
   provide maximum flexibility.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.8.%20%20The%20Address%20Map%20Table%3A%20natv2AddressMapTable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.8" name="section-3.3.8">3.3.8</a>.  The Address Map Table: natv2AddressMapTable</span>

   The address map table provides a table of mappings from internal to
   external address at a given moment.  It is indexed by the combination
   of NAT instance index, internal realm, internal address type (IPv4 or
   IPv6) in that realm, the internal address of the local host for which
   the map entry was created, and a conceptual row index to traverse all
   of the entries relating to the same internal address.

   In the special case of DS-Lite [<a href="rfc6333.html" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>], the internal address and
   realm used in the index are those of the IPv6 outer header.  The IPv4
   source address for the inner header, for which [<a href="rfc6333.html" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>] has reserved
   addresses in the 192.0.0.0/29 range, is captured in two additional
   objects in the corresponding conceptual row:
   natv2AddressMapInternalMappedAddressType and
   natv2AddressMapInternalMappedAddress.  In cases other than DS-Lite
   access, these objects have no meaning.  (Other tunneled access is out
   of scope.)

   The additional information provided by natv2AddressMapTable consists
   of the external realm, address type in that realm, and mapped
   external address.  Depending on implementation support, the table
   also provides the index of the address pool from which the external
   address was drawn and the index of the subscriber to which the map
   entry belongs.

   The port map table provides a table of mappings by protocol from
   external port, address, and realm to internal port, address, and

   index, protocol number, external realm identifier, address type in
   that realm, external address, and external port.  The mapping from

   external realm, address, and port to internal realm, address, and
   port is unique, so no conceptual row index is needed.  The indexing
   is designed to make it easy to trace individual sessions back to the
   host, based on the contents of packets observed in the external
   realm.

   Beyond the indexing, the information provided by the port map table
   consists of the internal realm, address type, address, and port
   number, and, depending on implementation support, the index of the
   subscriber to which the map entry belongs.

   As with the address map table, special provision is made for the case
   of DS-Lite [<a href="rfc6333.html" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>].  The realm and outgoing source address are
   those for the outer header, and the address type is IPv6.  Additional
   objects natv2PortMapInternalMappedAddressType and
   natv2PortMapInternalMappedAddress capture the outgoing source address
   in the inner header, which will be in the well-known 192.0.0.0/29
   range.

   The conformance statements in NATV2-MIB provide for three application
   scenarios: basic NAT, NAT supporting address pools, and CGN.

   A basic NAT MAY limit the number of NAT instances it supports to one,
   but it MUST support indexing by NAT instance.  Similarly, a basic NAT
   MAY limit the number of realms it supports to two.  By definition, a
   basic NAT is not required to support the subscriber table, the
   address pool table, or the address pool address range table.  Some
   individual objects in other tables are also not relevant to basic
   NAT.

   A NAT supporting address pools adds the address pool table and the
   address pool address range table to what it implements.  Some
   individual objects in other tables also need to be implemented.  A
   NAT supporting address pools MUST support more than two realms.

   Finally, a CGN MUST support the full contents of the MIB module.
   That includes the subscriber table, but it also includes the special
   provision for DS-Lite access in the address and port map tables.

        "The cumulative number of packets dropped because the
         packet would have triggered the creation of a new
         port mapping, but no port could be allocated for the
         protocol concerned.  The usual case for this will be
         for a NAT instance that supports address pooling and
         the 'Paired' pooling behavior recommended by <a href="rfc4787.html">RFC 4787</a>,
         where the internal endpoint has used up all of the
         ports allocated to it for the address it was mapped to
         in the selected address pool in the external realm
         concerned and cannot be given more ports because
         - policy or implementation prevents it from having a
           second address in the same pool, and
         - policy or unavailability prevents it from acquiring
           more ports at its originally assigned address.

         If the NAT instance supports address pooling but its
         pooling behavior is 'Arbitrary' (meaning that
         the NAT instance can allocate a new port mapping for
         the given internal endpoint on any address in the
         selected address pool and is not bound to what it has
         already mapped for that endpoint), then this counter
         is incremented when all ports for the protocol concerned
         over the whole of the selected address pool are already
         in use.

         As a third case, if no address pools have been configured
         for the external realm concerned, then this counter is
         incremented because all ports for the protocol involved over
         the whole set of addresses available for that external realm
         are already in use.

         Finally, this counter is incremented if the packet would
         have triggered the creation of a new port mapping, but the
         current value of natv2SubscriberPortMapEntries equals or

natv2InstanceTable OBJECT-TYPE

    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Table of NAT instances.  As well as state and counter
         objects, it provides the instance index, instance name, and
         the last discontinuity time object that is applicable to
         the counters.  It also contains writable thresholds for
         reporting of notifications and limits on usage of resources
         at the level of the NAT instance.

         It is assumed that NAT instances can be created and deleted
         dynamically, but this MIB module does not provide the means
         to do so.  For restrictions on assignment and maintenance of
         the NAT index instance, see the description of
         natv2InstanceIndex in the table below.  For the requirements
         on maintenance of the values of the counters in this table,
         see the description of natv2InstanceDiscontinuityTime in
         this table.

         Each NAT instance has its own resources and behavior.  The
         resources include memory as reflected in space for map
         entries, processing power as reflected in the rate of map
         creation and deletion, and mappable addresses in each realm
         that can play the role of an external realm for at least
         some mappings for that instance.  The NAT instance table
         includes limits and notification thresholds that relate to
         memory usage for mapping at the level of the whole instance.
         The limit on number of subscribers with active mappings is a
         limit to some extent on processor usage.

         The mappable 'external' addresses may or may not be
         organized into address pools.  For a definition of address
         pools, see the description of natv2PoolTable.  If the instance
         does support address pools, it also has a pooling behavior.
         Mapping, filtering, and pooling behavior are defined in the
         descriptions of the natv2InstancePortMappingBehavior,
         natv2InstanceFilteringBehavior, and
         natv2InstancePoolingBehavior objects in this table.  The

         but no port could be allocated for the protocol concerned.
         The usual case for this will be for a NAT instance that

         recommended by <a href="rfc4787.html">RFC 4787</a>, where the internal endpoint has
         used up all of the ports allocated to it for the address it

         - policy or unavailability prevents it from acquiring
           more ports at its originally assigned address.

         If the NAT instance supports address pooling but its
         pooling behavior is 'Arbitrary' (meaning that
         the NAT instance can allocate a new port mapping for
         the given internal endpoint on any address in the
         selected address pool and is not bound to what it has
         already mapped for that endpoint), then this counter
         is incremented when all ports for the protocol concerned
         over the whole of the selected address pool are already
         in use.

         Finally, if the NAT instance has no configured address
         pooling, then this counter is incremented because all
         ports for the protocol concerned over the whole of the
         NAT instance for the external realm concerned are already
         in use.

         This value MUST be monotone increasing in the periods

         - policy or implementation prevents it from having a
           second address in the same pool, and
         - policy or unavailability prevents it from acquiring
           more ports at its originally assigned address.

         If the NAT instance pooling behavior is 'Arbitrary' (meaning
         that the NAT instance can allocate a new port mapping for
         the given internal endpoint on any address in the selected
         address pool and is not bound to what it has already mapped

   This section covers two particular areas of operations and
   management: configuration requirements and transition from or
   coexistence with the MIB module in [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>].

   This MIB module assumes that the following information is configured
   on the NAT device by means outside the scope of the present document
   or is imposed by the implementation:

   o  the set of address realms to which the device connects;

   o  for the CGN application, per-subscriber information including
      subscriber index, address realm, assigned prefix or address, and
      (possibly) policies regarding address pool selection in the
      various possible address realms to which the subscriber may
      connect.  In the particular case of DS-Lite [<a href="rfc6333.html" title='"Dual- Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion"'>RFC6333</a>] access, as
      well as the assigned outer-layer (IPv6) prefix or address, the
      subscriber information will include an inner (IPv4) source
      address, usually 192.0.0.2;

   o  the set of NAT instances running on the device, identified by NAT
      instance index and name;

   o  the port mapping, filtering, pooling, and fragment behavior for
      each NAT instance;

   o  the set of protocols supported by each NAT instance;

   o  for the pooled NAT and CGN applications, address pool information
      for each NAT instance, including for each pool the pool index,
      address realm, address type, minimum and maximum port number, the
      address ranges assigned to that pool, and policies for access to
      that pool's resources;

   o  static address and port map entries.

   As described in previous sections, this MIB module does provide read-
   write objects for control of notifications (see especially
   <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a>) and limiting of resource consumption (<a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a>).
   This document is written in advance of any practical experience with
   the setting of these values and can thus provide only general
   principles for how to set them.

   By default, the MIB module definition disables notifications until
   they are explicitly enabled by the operator, using the associated
   threshold value to do so.  To make use of the notifications, the
   operator may wish to take the following considerations into account.

   Except for the low address pool utilization notification, the
   notifications imply that some sort of administrative action is
   required to mitigate an impending shortage of a particular resource.
   The choice of value for the triggering threshold needs to take two
   factors into account: the volatility of usage of the given resource,
   and the amount of time the operator needs to mitigate the potential
   overload situation.  That time could vary from almost immediate to
   several weeks required to order and install new hardware or software.

   To give a numeric example, if average utilization is going up 1% per
   week but can vary 10% around that average in any given hour, and it
   takes two weeks to carry through mitigating measures, the threshold
   should be set to 88% of the corresponding limit (two weeks' growth
   plus 10% volatility margin).  If mitigating measures can be carried
   out immediately, this can rise to 90%.  For this particular example,
   that change is insignificant, but in other cases the difference may
   be large enough to matter in terms of reduced load on the management
   plane.

   The notification rate-limit settings really depend on the operator's
   processes but are a tradeoff between reliably reporting the notified
   condition and not having it overload the management plane.
   Reliability rises in importance with the importance of the resource



<span class="grey">Perreault, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 75]</span></pre>

   involved.  Thus, the default notification intervals defined in this
   MIB module range from 10 seconds (high reliability) for the address
   and port map entry thresholds up to 60 seconds (lower reliability)
   for the per-subscriber port entry thresholds.  Experience may suggest
   better values.

   The limits on number of instance-level address map and port map
   entries and held fragments relate directly to memory allocations for
   these tables.  The relationship between number of map entries or
   number of held fragments and memory required will be implementation-
   specific.  Hence it is up to the implementor to provide specific
   advice on the setting of these limits.

   The limit on simultaneous number of active subscribers is indirectly
   related to memory consumption for map entries, but also to processor
   usage by the NAT instance.  The best strategy for setting this limit
   would seem to be to leave it disabled during an initial period while
   observing device processor utilization, then to implement a trial
   setting while observing the number of blocked packets affected by the
   new limit.  The setting may vary by NAT instance if a suitable

Transition from and Coexistence with NAT-MIB (<a href="rfc4008.html">RFC 4008</a>)</span>

   A manager may have to deal with a mixture of devices supporting the
   NAT-MIB module [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] and the NATV2-MIB module defined in the
   present document.  It is even possible that both modules are
   supported on the same device.  The following discussion brings out
   the limits of comparability between the two MIB modules.  A first
   point to note is that NAT-MIB is primarily focused on configuration,
   while NATV2-MIB is primarily focused on measurements.

   To summarize the model used by [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>]:

   o  The basic unit of NAT configuration is the interface.

   o  An interface connects to a single realm, either "private" or
      "public".  In principle that means there could be multiple
      instances of one type of realm or the other, but the number is
      physically limited by the number of interfaces on the NAT device.

   o  Before the NAT can operate on a given interface, an "address map"
      has to be configured on it.  The address map in [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] is
      equivalent to the pool tables in the present document.  Since just
      one "address map" is configured per interface, this is the
      equivalent of a single address pool per interface.

   o  The address binding and port binding tables are roughly equivalent
      to the address map and port map tables in the present document in
      their content, but they can be either unidirectional or
      bidirectional.  The model in [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] shows the address binding
      and port binding as alternative precursors to session
      establishment, depending on whether the device does address
      translation only or address and port translation.  In contrast,
      NATV2-MIB assumes a model where bidirectional port mappings are
      based on bidirectional address mappings that have conceptually
      been established beforehand.

   o  The equivalent to an [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] session in NATV2-MIB would be a
      pair of port map entries.  The added complexity in [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] is
      due to the modeling of NAT service types as defined in [<a href="rfc3489.html" title='"STUN - Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs)"'>RFC3489</a>]
      (the symmetric NAT in particular) instead of the more granular set
      of behaviors described in [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>].  (Note: [<a href="rfc3489.html" title='"STUN - Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs)"'>RFC3489</a>] has been
      obsoleted by [<a href="rfc5389.html" title='"Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5389</a>].)

   With regard to that last point, the mapping between [<a href="rfc3489.html" title='"STUN - Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs)"'>RFC3489</a>] service
   types and [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>] NAT behaviors is as follows:

   o  A full cone NAT exhibits endpoint-independent port mapping
      behavior and endpoint-independent filtering behavior.

   o  A restricted cone NAT exhibits endpoint-independent port mapping
      behavior, but address-dependent filtering behavior.

   o  A port restricted cone NAT exhibits endpoint-independent port
      mapping behavior, but address-and-port-dependent filtering
      behavior.

   o  A symmetric NAT exhibits address-and-port-dependent port mapping
      and filtering behaviors.

   Note that these NAT types are a subset of the types that could be
   configured according to the [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>] behavioral classification used
   in NATV2-MIB, but they include the two possibilities (full and
   restricted cone NAT) that satisfy requirements REQ-1 and REQ-8 of
   [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>].  Note further that other behaviors defined in [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>]
   are not considered in [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>].

   Having established a context for discussion, we are now in a position
   to compare the outputs provided to management from the [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] and
   NATV2-MIB modules.  This comparison relates to the ability to compare
   results if testing with both MIBs implemented on the same device
   during a transition period.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4008" name="ref-RFC4008">RFC4008</a>] provides three counters: incoming translations, outgoing
   translations, and discarded packets, at the granularities of
   interface, address map, and protocol, and incoming and outgoing
   translations at the levels of individual address bind, address port
   bind, and session entries.  Implementation at the protocol and
   address map levels is optional.  NATV2-MIB provides a single total
   (both directions) translations counter at the instance, protocol
   within instance, and subscriber levels.  Given the differences in
   granularity, it appears that the only comparable measurement of
   translations between the two MIB modules would be through aggregation
   of the [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] interface counters to give a total number of
   translations for the NAT instance.

   NATV2-MIB has broken out the single discard counter into a number of
   different counters reflecting the cause of the discard in more
   detail, to help in troubleshooting.  Again, with the differing levels
   of granularity, the only comparable statistic would be through
   aggregation to a single value of total discards per NAT instance.

   Moving on to state variables, [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] offers counts of number of
   "address map" (i.e., address pool) entries used (excluding static
   entries) at the address map level and number of entries in the
   address bind and address and port bind tables, respectively.
   Finally, [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] provides a count of the number of sessions
   currently using each entry in the address and port bind table.  None
   of these counts are directly comparable with the state values offered
   by NATV2-MIB, because of the exclusion of static entries at the
   address map level, and because of the differing models of the
   translation tables between [<a href="rfc4008.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)"'>RFC4008</a>] and the NATV2-MIB.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection opens devices to attack.  These are the tables and objects
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Limits:  An attacker setting a very low or very high limit can easily
      cause a denial-of-service situation.

      *  natv2InstanceLimitAddressMapEntries;

      *  natv2InstanceLimitPortMapEntries;

      *  natv2InstanceLimitSubscriberActives;

      *  natv2SubscriberLimitPortMapEntries.

   Notification thresholds:  An attacker setting an arbitrarily low
      threshold can cause many useless notifications to be generated
      (subject to the notification interval).  Setting an arbitrarily
      high threshold can effectively disable notifications, which could
      be used to hide another attack.

      *  natv2InstanceThresholdAddressMapEntriesHigh;

      *  natv2InstanceThresholdPortMapEntriesHigh;

      *  natv2PoolThresholdUsageLow;

      *  natv2PoolThresholdUsageHigh;

      *  natv2SubscriberThresholdPortMapEntriesHigh.

   Notification intervals:  An attacker setting a low notification
      interval in combination with a low threshold value can cause many
      useless notifications to be generated.

      *  natv2InstanceNotificationInterval;

      *  natv2PoolNotificationInterval;

      *  natv2SubscriberNotificationInterval.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Objects that reveal host identities:  Various objects can reveal the
      identity of private hosts that are engaged in a session with
      external end nodes.  A curious outsider could monitor these to
      assess the number of private hosts being supported by the NAT
      device.  Further, a disgruntled former employee of an enterprise
      could use the information to break into specific private hosts by
      intercepting the existing sessions or originating new sessions
      into the host.  If nothing else, unauthorized monitoring of these
      objects will violate individual subscribers' privacy.

   Other objects that reveal NAT state:  Other managed objects in this
      MIB may contain information that may be sensitive from a business
      perspective, in that they may represent NAT capabilities, business
      policies, and state information.

      *  natv2InstancePortMapEntries.

   There are no objects that are sensitive in their own right, such as
   passwords or monetary amounts.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [<a href="rfc3410.html" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [<a href="rfc3414.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC3414</a>] with the AES cipher algorithm [<a href="rfc3826.html" title='"The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Cipher Algorithm in the SNMP User-based Security Model"'>RFC3826</a>].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [<a href="rfc5591.html" title='"Transport Security Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5591</a>] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [<a href="rfc5592.html" title='"Secure Shell Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5592</a>] or TLS/DTLS [<a href="rfc6353.html" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC6353</a>].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
