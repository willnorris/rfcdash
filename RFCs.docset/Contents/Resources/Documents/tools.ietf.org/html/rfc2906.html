Abstract

   This document specifies the requirements that Authentication
   Authorization Accounting (AAA) protocols must meet in order to
   support authorization services in the Internet. The requirements have
   been elicited from a study of a range of applications including
   mobile-IP, roamops and others.

   This document is one of a series of three documents under
   consideration by the AAAarch RG dealing with the authorization
   requirements for AAA protocols.  The three documents are:

         AAA Authorization Framework [<a href="#ref-FRMW" title='"AAA Authorization Framework"'>FRMW</a>]
         AAA Authorization Requirements (this document)
         AAA Authorization Application Examples [<a href="#ref-SAMP" title='"AAA Authorization Application Examples"'>SAMP</a>]

   The work for this memo was done by a group that originally was the
   Authorization subgroup of the AAA Working Group of the IETF.  When
   the charter of the AAA working group was changed to focus on MobileIP
   and NAS requirements, the AAAarch Research Group was chartered within
   the IRTF to continue and expand the architectural work started by the
   Authorization subgroup.  This memo is one of four which were created
   by the subgroup.  This memo is a starting point for further work
   within the AAAarch Research Group.  It is still a work in progress
   and is published so that the work will be available for the AAAarch
   subgroup and others working in this area, not as a definitive
   description of architecture or requirements.

   The process followed in producing this document was to analyze the
   requirements from [<a href="#ref-SAMP" title='"AAA Authorization Application Examples"'>SAMP</a>] based on a common understanding of the AAA
   authorization framework [<a href="#ref-FRMW" title='"AAA Authorization Framework"'>FRMW</a>]. This document assumes familiarity
   with both the general issues involved in authorization and, in
   particular, the reader will benefit from a reading of [<a href="#ref-FRMW" title='"AAA Authorization Framework"'>FRMW</a>] where,
   for example, definitions of terms can be found.



<span class="grey">Farrell, et al.              Informational                      [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2906.html">RFC 2906</a>             AAA Authorization Requirements          August 2000</span>


   The key words "MUST", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Requirements</span>

   Requirements are grouped under headings for convenience; this
   grouping is not significant.

   Definitions and explanations of some of the technical terms used in
   this document may be found in [<a href="#ref-FRMW" title='"AAA Authorization Framework"'>FRMW</a>].

   Each requirement is presented as a succinct (usually a sentence or
   two) statement. Most are followed by a paragraph of explanatory
   material, which sometimes contains an example. Fully described
   examples may be found in [<a href="#ref-SAMP" title='"AAA Authorization Application Examples"'>SAMP</a>].

   The requirements presented are not intended to be "orthogonal", that
   is, some of them repeat, or overlap, with others.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20Authorization%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a> Authorization Information</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.1%20%20%20Authorization%20decisions%20MUST%20be%20able%20to%20be%20based%20on%20information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.1" name="section-2.1.1">2.1.1</a>   Authorization decisions MUST be able to be based on information</span>

   environment (authorization information). AAA protocols are required
   to transport this information.

   This simply states the requirement for a protocol and an access
   decision function, which takes inputs, based on the requestor, the
   resource requested and the environment.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.2%20%20%20It%20MUST%20be%20possible%20to%20represent%20authorization%20information%20as"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.2" name="section-2.1.2">2.1.2</a>   It MUST be possible to represent authorization information as</span>

   information as objects.

   This states that authorization information must be decomposable into
   sets of attributes. It is not intended to imply any particular
   mechanism for representing attributes.

   This states that a protocol, which always required separate AAA
   messages/transactions for each service/application, would not meet
   the requirement. For example, it should be possible for a single AAA
   message/transaction to be sufficient to allow both network and
   application access.

   There are many attributes that are used in lots of contexts, and
   these should only be defined once, in order to promote

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.5%20%20%20Authorization%20decisions%20MUST%20NOT%20be%20limited%20to%20being%20based%20on"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.5" name="section-2.1.5">2.1.5</a>   Authorization decisions MUST NOT be limited to being based on</span>

   non-identifying information, e.g. to support role based access
   control (RBAC).

   Authorization based on clearances, roles, groups or other information
   is required to be supported. A AAA protocol that only carried
   identity information would not meet the requirement.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.6%20%20%20Authorization%20data%20MAY%20include%20limits%20in%20addition%20to%20attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.6" name="section-2.1.6">2.1.6</a>   Authorization data MAY include limits in addition to attributes</span>

   This states that some attributes do not simply represent attributes
   of an entity, for example a spending limit of IR 1,000 is not an
   intrinsic attribute of an entity. This also impacts on the access
   decision function, in that the comparison to be made is not a simple
   equality match.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.7%20%20%20It%20MUST%20be%20possible%20for%20other%20%28non-AAA%29%20protocols%20to%20define"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.7" name="section-2.1.7">2.1.7</a>   It MUST be possible for other (non-AAA) protocols to define</span>

   authorization package in a AAA or application protocol.

   This states that the attributes that are significant in an
   authorization decision, may be application protocol dependent. For
   example, many attribute types are defined by [<a href="rfc2138.html" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2138</a>] and support
   for the semantics of these attributes will be required. Of course,
   only AAA entities that are aware of the added attribute types can
   make use of them.

   authorization package in a AAA or application protocol.

   This states that the attributes that are significant in an
   authorization decision, may be dependent on a closed environment.
   For example, many organizations have a well-defined scheme of
   seniority, which can be used to determine access levels. Of course,
   only AAA entities that are aware of the added attribute types can
   make use of them.

   A centralized or distributed registration scheme of some sort is
   needed if collisions in attribute type allocations are to be avoided.
   However a AAA protocol which always requires use of such a
   centralized registration would not meet the requirement. Of course,
   collisions should be avoided where possible.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.10%20%20It%20MUST%20be%20possible%20to%20define%20attribute%20types%20so%20that%20an"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.10" name="section-2.1.10">2.1.10</a>  It MUST be possible to define attribute types so that an</span>

   values.

   This states that a protocol which does not allow multiple instances
   of an attribute in a message/transaction would not meet the
   requirement.  For example it should be possible to have a "group"
   attribute which contains more than one groupname (or number or
   whatever).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.11%20%20If%20MUST%20be%20possible%20to%20distinguish%20different%20instances%20of%20the"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.11" name="section-2.1.11">2.1.11</a>  If MUST be possible to distinguish different instances of the</span>

   domain" or "authority".

   This recognizes that it is important to be able to distinguish
   between attributes based not only on their value. For example, all NT
   domains (which use the English language) have an Administrators
   group, an access decision function has to be able to determine to
   which of these groups the requestor belongs.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.12%20%20AAA%20protocols%20MUST%20specify%20mechanisms%20for%20updating%20the%20rules"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.12" name="section-2.1.12">2.1.12</a>  AAA protocols MUST specify mechanisms for updating the rules</span>

   This states that a AAA protocol that cannot provide a mechanism for
   distributing authorization rules is not sufficient. For example, this
   could be used to download ACLs to a PDP.

   Note that this is not meant to mean that this AAA protocol mechanism
   must always be used, simply that it must be available for use. In
   particular, storing authorization rules in a trusted repository (in
   many cases an LDAP server) will in many cases be used instead of such
   a AAA protocol mechanism.  Neither does this requirement call for a
   standardized format for authorization rules, merely that there be a
   mechanism for transporting these.

   like selective field security mechanisms. For example, information
   required to gain access to a network may have to be in clear, whilst
   information required for access to an application within that network
   may have to be encrypted in the AAA protocol.

   This states that confidentiality, (resp. the other security

   where it is transmitted via other AAA entities. It does allow that
   such a AAA message may also contain non-confidential, resp. the other

   themselves be considered end-points for end-to-end security services
   applied to other parts of the AAA message.

   LAN may be enough to decide).

   This requirement (in a sense the opposite of 2.2.6), indicates the

   protocol useful across a broad range of applications/services.

   defaults unless otherwise configured/administered.

   This states that the out-of-the-box configuration must be "secure",
   for example, authorization decisions should result in denial of
   access until a AAA entity is configured. Note that the interpretation
   of "secure" will vary on a case-by-case basis, though the principle
   remains the same.

   This states that authorization information itself is never to be
   considered valid for all time, every piece of authorization
   information must have associated either an explicit or implicit
   validity period or time-to-live.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.2%20%20%20AAA%20protocols%20MUST%20provide%20mechanisms%20for%20revoking%20authorization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.2" name="section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a>   AAA protocols MUST provide mechanisms for revoking authorization</span>

   Where the validity or time-to-live is long, it may be necessary to
   revoke the authorization information, e.g. where someone leaves a
   company. Note that this requirement does not mandate a particular
   scheme for revocation, so that it is not a requirement for blacklists
   or CRLs.

   This states that explicit validity periods are, in some cases, needed

   For example, an authorization result may be that service should be
   provided for a certain period. In such cases a AAA protocol must be
   able to transport this information, possibly as a specific result of
   the authorization decision, or, as an additional "termination of
   service" AAA message transmitted later.

   This is for some applications such as backup, where actions are

   The PKIX WG is developing a time stamp protocol, which can be used as
   part of a non-repudiation solution. In some environments it may be
   necessary that certain AAA protocol messages are timestamped (by a
   trusted authority) and that the timestamps are forwarded within
   subsequent AAA messages.

   For example, in the mobile IP case, a "foreign" AAA server might pull
   authorization information from a broker, whereas the broker might
   push some authorization information to a "home" AAA server.

   different (security) domains.

   This states that it must be possible for any AAA protocol message to
   cross security or administrative domain boundaries. Typically, higher
   levels of security will be applied when crossing such boundaries, and
   accounting mechanisms may also have to be more stringent.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.4%20%20%20AAA%20protocols%20MUST%20support%20roaming."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.4" name="section-2.4.4">2.4.4</a>   AAA protocols MUST support roaming.</span>

   Roaming here may also be thought of as "away-from-home" operation.
   For example, this is a fundamental requirement for the mobile IP
   case.

   Dynamic mobility here means that a client moves from one domain to

   For example, this means that the requestor can't go anywhere on the
   network to fetch anything and must do requests via an
   application/service or via an intermediate AAA entity. The AAA
   protocol should not overexpose such a server to denial-of-service
   attacks.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.7%20%20%20AAA%20protocols%20MUST%20support%20the%20use%20of%20intermediate%20AAA%20entities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.7" name="section-2.4.7">2.4.7</a>   AAA protocols MUST support the use of intermediate AAA entities</span>

   any of the end entities or authorization data.

   In some environments (e.g. roamops), these entities are termed
   brokers (though these are not the same as bandwidth brokers in the
   QoS environment).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.8%20%20%20AAA%20protocols%20MAY%20support%20cases%20where%20an%20intermediate%20AAA%20entity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.8" name="section-2.4.8">2.4.8</a>   AAA protocols MAY support cases where an intermediate AAA entity</span>

   that the requestor or originating AAA entity can contact another AAA
   entity.

   This requirement recognizes that there will be routing issues with
   AAA servers, and that this requires that AAA protocols are able to
   help with such routing. For example, in the mobile IP case, a broker
   may be required, in part to allow the foreign and home AAA servers to
   get in contact.

   used in this discovery process then the access decision function MUST

   on behalf of the client (C) to a final target (T).  AAA protocols
   MUST be such that the authorization decision made at T, MAY depend on
   the authorization information associated with C and/or with I. This
   "application proxying" must not introduce new security weaknesses in
   the AAA protocols. There MAY be chains of application proxies of any
   length.

   Note that this requirement addresses application layer proxying - not
   chains of AAA servers. For example, a chain of HTTP proxies might
   each want to restrict the content they serve to the "outside".  As
   the HTTP GET message goes from HTTP proxy to HTTP proxy, this
   requirement states that it must be possible that the authorization
   decisions made at each stage can depend on the user at the browser,
   and not say, solely on the previous HTTP proxy's identity. Of course
   there may only be a single AAA server involved, or there may be many.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.5.2%20%20%20Where%20there%20is%20a%20chain%20of%20application%20proxies%2C%20the%20AAA%20protocol"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.2" name="section-2.5.2">2.5.2</a>   Where there is a chain of application proxies, the AAA protocol</span>

   the push model, the second pull, the third the agent model.

   This simply restates a previous requirement (no. 2.4.7), to make it
   clear that this also applies when application proxying is being used.

   This is analogous to a requirement in public key infrastructures:

   in particular, I might trust the issuer for some purposes, but not

   This relates the packaging (no. 2.1.3) and trust (no. 2.6.1)
   requirements. For example, a AAA entity may trust some parts of an
   authorization package but not others.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.6.3%20%20%20A%20confirmation%20of%20authorization%20MAY%20be%20required%20in%20order%20to"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6.3" name="section-2.6.3">2.6.3</a>   A confirmation of authorization MAY be required in order to</span>

   This states that a AAA entity may need to process some AAA protocol
   messages in order to initialize itself. In particular, a AAA entity
   may need to check that a previous AAA message remains "valid", e.g.
   at boot-time.

   This states that for efficiency or organizational reasons, it must be
   possible to set up some AAA servers through which all "external" AAA
   services are handled. It also states that it must be possible to do
   this without over-burdening the "internal-only" AAA servers with
   onerous security mechanisms, just because some AAA servers do handle
   external relations.

   For example, a "parent" AAA server should be able to modify the
   authorization state of sessions managed by a "child" AAA server, say
   by changing the maximum number of simultaneous sessions which are
   allowed.

   This states that AAA protocols need to support cases where the
   authorization depends, (perhaps even only depends), on the current
   state of the system, e.g. only seven sessions allowed, seventh
   decision depends on existence of six current sessions. Since the
   context might involve more than one service, the AAA protocol is
   likely to have to offer some support.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.7.2%20%20%20AAA%20protocols%20SHOULD%20support%20both%20the%20authorization%20of"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7.2" name="section-2.7.2">2.7.2</a>   AAA protocols SHOULD support both the authorization of</span>

   This states, that e.g. a session may have to use initial

   This states that yes and no are not the only outcomes of an
   authorization decision. In particular, if the AAA entity cannot yet
   give a decision, it might have to return such a result. This is
   analogous to how public key certification requests are sometimes
   handled in PKI management protocols.

   The expectation is that AAA protocols will support the ability of a
   AAA entity to signal an application or other AAA entity that an
   authorization (possibly previously granted by a third AAA entity) is
   no longer valid.

   This requirement indicates that administration of AAA has to be
   considered as part of protocol design - a AAA protocol, which
   required all AAA entities act independent of all other AAA entities,
   would not meet the requirement.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.8.2%20%20%20Centralizable%20administration%20of%20all%20features%20SHOULD%20be"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.8.2" name="section-2.8.2">2.8.2</a>   Centralizable administration of all features SHOULD be</span>

   For example, a user might want to control anti-spam measures or

   message to request both authentication and authorization.

   AAA protocols have to allow a split between authentication and
   authorization so that different mechanisms are used for each. This
   states that sometimes both types of information need to be carried in
   the same message.

   This states that the AAA protocol authorization packages must be
   defined so that they can also be carried in other protocols. For
   example, depending on AAA protocol header information in order to
   reference an authorization package could cause a protocol to fail to
   meet the requirement.

   This can be required e.g. to support resiliency in cases where hot

   single-point-of-failure etc even though these are not all specified
   here.

   For example, some form of support for [<a href="rfc2138.html" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2138</a>] as a legacy protocol
   is very likely to be required. Of course, the use of such a gateway
   is almost certain to mean not meeting some other requirements, (e.g.
   end-to-end security), for transactions routed through the gateway.
   There is no implication that such gateway functionality needs to be a
   separate server.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.2%20%20It%20MUST%20be%20possible%20to%20negotiate%20authorization%20packages%20between"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11.2" name="section-2.11.2">2.11.2</a>  It MUST be possible to negotiate authorization packages between</span>

   This states that where, e.g. a broker is involved, the end AAA
   servers might still need to negotiate.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.3%20%20Where%20negotiation%20fails%20to%20produce%20an%20acceptable%20common"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11.3" name="section-2.11.3">2.11.3</a>  Where negotiation fails to produce an acceptable common</span>
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/supported%20set%20then%20access%20MUST%20be%20denied."></a>   supported set then access MUST be denied.</span>

   For example, a server cannot grant access if it cannot understand the
   attributes of the requestor.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.4%20%20Where%20negotiation%20fails%20to%20produce%20an%20acceptable%20common"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11.4" name="section-2.11.4">2.11.4</a>  Where negotiation fails to produce an acceptable common</span>

   indication to be sent to another AAA entity.

   If negotiation fails, then some administrator intervention is often
   required, and protocol support for this should be provided.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.5%20%20It%20MUST%20be%20possible%20to%20pre-provision%20the%20result%20of%20a"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11.5" name="section-2.11.5">2.11.5</a>  It MUST be possible to pre-provision the result of a</span>

   confirmation of the "negotiation result".

   Even if the supported packages of a peer are configured, this must be
   confirmed before assuming both sides are similarly configured.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.6%20%20For%20each%20application%20making%20use%20of%20a%20AAA%20protocol%2C%20there%20MUST%20be"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11.6" name="section-2.11.6">2.11.6</a>  For each application making use of a AAA protocol, there MUST be</span>

   authorization package types that are "mandatory to implement".

   This requirement assures that communicating peers can count on
   finding at least one IETF specified inter-operable AAA protocol
   dialect provided they are doing authorization for a common
   application specific problem domain. This does not preclude the
   negotiation of commonly understood but private AAA protocol
   authorization package types (e.g. vendor specific).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.7%20%20It%20SHOULD%20also%20be%20possible%20to%20rank%20AAA%20negotiation%20options%20in"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11.7" name="section-2.11.7">2.11.7</a>  It SHOULD also be possible to rank AAA negotiation options in</span>
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/order%20of%20preference."></a>   order of preference.</span>

   This states that, when negotiating, peers must be able to indicate
   preferences as well as capabilities.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.8%20%20The%20negotiation%20mechanisms%20used%20by%20AAA%20protocols%20SHOULD%20NOT%20be"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11.8" name="section-2.11.8">2.11.8</a>  The negotiation mechanisms used by AAA protocols SHOULD NOT be</span>
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/vulnerable%20to%20a%20%22bidding-down%22%20attack."></a>   vulnerable to a "bidding-down" attack.</span>

   A "bidding-down" attack is where an attacker forces the negotiating
   parties to choose the "weakest" option available. This is analogous
   to forcing 40-bit encryption on a link. The requirement highlights
   that protocol support is needed to prevent such attacks, for example
   by including the negotiation messages as part of a later MAC
   calculation, if authentication has produced a shared secret.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.9%20%20A%20peer%20MUST%20NOT%20send%20an%20attribute%20within%20an%20authorization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11.9" name="section-2.11.9">2.11.9</a>  A peer MUST NOT send an attribute within an authorization</span>

   negotiation. If this AAA protocol violation occurs, then it MUST be
   possible to send an error indication to the misbehaving peer, and
   generate an error indication to the network operator.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.10%20A%20peer%20MUST%20declare%20all%20of%20the%20sets%20of%20the%20authorization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11.10" name="section-2.11.10">2.11.10</a> A peer MUST declare all of the sets of the authorization</span>

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   This document includes specific security requirements.

   This document does not state any detailed requirements for the
   interplay with authentication, accounting or accountability (audit).
   A AAA protocol, which meets all of the above requirements, may still
   leave vulnerabilities due to such interactions. Such issues must be
   considered as part of AAA protocol design.
