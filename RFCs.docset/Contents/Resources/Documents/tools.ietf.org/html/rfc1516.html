   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
    three components.  They are:

      o STD 16, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
        STD 16, <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> defines a more concise description mechanism,
        which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

      o STD 17, <a href="rfc1213.html">RFC 1213</a> defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
        for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
        network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Object%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Object Definitions</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

   Instances of the object types defined in this memo represent
   attributes of an IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet-like) repeater, as defined by
   <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>, "Repeater Unit for 10 Mb/s Baseband Networks" in the IEEE
   802.3/ISO 8802-3 CSMA/CD standard [<a href="#ref-7" title="2nd edition">7</a>].

   These Repeater MIB objects may be used to manage non-standard
   repeater-like devices, but defining objects to describe

   implementation-specific properties of non-standard repeater-like
   devices is outside the scope of this memo.

   The definitions presented here are based on the IEEE draft standard
   P802.3K, "Layer Management for 10 Mb/s Baseband Repeaters" [<a href="#ref-8" title="Draft 8">8</a>].
   Implementors of these MIB objects should note that [<a href="#ref-8" title="Draft 8">8</a>] explicitly
   describes when, where, and how various repeater attributes are
   measured.  The IEEE document also describes the effects of repeater
   actions that may be invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB
   objects defined here.

   The counters in this document are defined to be the same as those
   counters in the IEEE 802.3 Repeater Management draft, with the
   intention that the same instrumentation can be used to implement both
   the IEEE and IETF management standards.

   In late 1988, the IEEE 802.3 Hub Management task force was chartered
   to define managed objects for both 802.3 repeaters and the proposed
   10BASE-FA synchronous active stars.  The term "hub" was used to cover
   both repeaters and active stars.

   In March, 1991, the active star proposal was dropped from the
   10BASE-F draft.  Subsequently the 802.3 group changed the name of the
   task force to be the IEEE 802.3 Repeater Management Task Force, and
   likewise renamed their draft.

   The use of the term "hub" has led to some confusion, as the terms
   "hub," "intelligent hub," and "concentrator" are often used to
   indicate a modular chassis with plug-in modules that provide
   generalized LAN/WAN connectivity, often with a mix of 802.3 repeater,
   token ring, and FDDI connectivity, internetworked by bridges,
   routers, and terminal servers.

   To be clear that this work covers the management of IEEE 802.3

   An IEEE 802.3 repeater connects "Ethernet-like" media segments
   together to extend the network length and topology beyond what can be
   achieved with a single coax segment.  It can be pictured as a star
   structure with two or more input/output ports.  The diagram below
   illustrates a 6-port repeater:

                           ^      ^
                           |      |

   All the stations on the media segments connected to a given
   repeater's ports participate in a single collision domain.  A packet
   transmitted by any of these stations is seen by all of these
   stations.

   Data coming in on any port in the repeater is transmitted out through
   each of the remaining n-1 ports.  If data comes in to the repeater on
   two or more ports simultaneously or the repeater detects a collision
   on the incoming port, the repeater transmits a jamming signal out on
   all ports for the duration of the collision.

   A repeater is a bit-wise store-and-forward device.  It is
   differentiated from a bridge (a frame store-and-forward device) in
   that it is primarily concerned with carrier sense and data bits, and
   does not make data-handling decisions based on the legality or
   contents of a packet.  A repeater retransmits data bits as they are
   received.  Its data FIFO holds only enough bits to make sure that the
   FIFO does not underflow when the data rate of incoming bits is
   slightly slower than the repeater's transmission rate.

   A repeater is not an end-station on the network, and does not count
   toward the overall limit of 1024 stations.  A repeater has no MAC
   address associated with it, and therefore packets may not be
   addressed to the repeater or to its ports.  (Packets may be addressed
   to the MAC address of a management entity that is monitoring a
   repeater.  This management entity may or may not be connected to the
   network through one of the repeater's ports.  How the management
   entity obtains information about the activity on the repeater is an

   implementation issue, and is not discussed in this memo.)

   A repeater is connected to the network with Medium Attachment Units
   (MAUs), and sometimes through Attachment Unit Interfaces (AUIs) as
   well.  ("MAUs" are also known as transceivers, and an "AUI" is the
   same as a 15-pin Ethernet or DIX connector.)

   The 802.3 standard defines a "repeater set" as the "repeater unit"
   plus its associated MAUs (and AUIs if present).  The "repeater unit"
   is defined as the portion of the repeater set that is inboard of the
   physical media interfaces.  The MAUs may be physically separate from
   the repeater unit, or they may be integrated into the same physical
   package.

   The most commonly-used MAUs are the 10BASE-5 (AUI to thick "yellow"
   coax), 10BASE-2 (BNC to thin coax), 10BASE-T (unshielded twisted-
   pair), and FOIRL (asynchronous fiber optic inter-repeater link, which
   is being combined into the 10BASE-F standard as 10BASE-FL).  The
   draft 10BASE-F standard also includes the definition for a new
   synchronous fiber optic attachment, known as 10BASE-FB.

   It should be stressed that the repeater MIB being defined by the IEEE
   covers only the repeater unit management - it does not include
   management of the MAUs that form the repeater set.  The IEEE
   recognizes that MAU management should be the same for MAUs connected
   to end-stations (DTEs) as it is for MAUs connected to repeaters.
   This memo follows the same strategy; the definition of management
   information for MAUs is being addressed in a separate memo.

   Repeaters are often implemented in modular "concentrators," where a
   card cage holds several field-replaceable cards.  Several cards may
   form a single repeater unit, with each card containing one or more of
   the repeater's ports.  Because of this modular architecture, users
   typically identify these repeater ports with a card number plus the



<span class="grey">McMaster &amp; McCloghrie                                           [Page 5]</span></pre>

   port number relative to the card, e.g., Card 3, Port 11.

   To support this modular numbering scheme, this document follows the
   example of the IEEE Repeater Management draft [<a href="#ref-8" title="Draft 8">8</a>], allowing an
   implementor to separate the ports in a repeater into "groups", if
   desired.  For example, an implementor might choose to represent
   field-replaceable units as groups of ports so that the port numbering
   would match the modular hardware implementation.

   This group mapping is recommended but optional.  An implementor may
   choose to put all of a modular repeater's ports into a single group,
   or to divide the ports into groups that do not match physical
   divisions.

   The object rptrGroupCapacity, which has a maximum value of 1024,
   indicates the maximum number of groups that a given repeater may
   contain.  The value of rptrGroupCapacity must remain constant from
   one management restart to the next.

   Each group within the repeater is uniquely identified by a group
   number in the range 1..rptrGroupCapacity.  Groups may come and go
   without causing a management reset, and may be sparsely numbered
   within the repeater.  For example, in a 12- card cage, cards 3, 5, 6,
   and 7 may together form a single repeater, and the implementor may
   choose to number them as groups 3, 5, 6, and 7, respectively.

   The object rptrGroupPortCapacity, which also has a maximum value of
   1024, indicates the maximum number of ports that a given group may
   contain.  The value of rptrGroupPortCapacity must not change for a
   given group.  However, a group may be deleted from the repeater and
   replaced with a group containing a different number of ports.  The
   value of rptrGroupLastOperStatusChange will indicate that a change
   took place.

   Each port within the repeater is uniquely identified by a combination
   of group number and port number, where port number is an integer in
   the range 1..rptrGroupPortCapacity.  As with groups within a
   repeater, ports within a group may be sparsely numbered.  Likewise,
   ports may come and go within a group without causing a management
   reset.

   Repeater ports may be thought of as sources of traffic into the
   repeater.  In addition to the externally visible ports mentioned
   above, such as those with 10BASE-T MAUs, or AUI ports with external
   transceivers, some implementations may have internal ports that are
   not obvious to the end-user but are nevertheless sources of traffic



<span class="grey">McMaster &amp; McCloghrie                                           [Page 6]</span></pre>

   into the repeater.  Examples include internal management ports,
   through which an agent communicates, and ports connecting to a
   backplane internal to the implementation.

   Some implementations may not manage all of a repeater's ports.  For
   managed ports, there must be entries in the port table; unmanaged
   ports will not show up in the table.

   It is the decision of the implementor to select the appropriate
   group(s) in which to place internal ports.  GroupCapacity for a given
   group always reflects the number of MANAGED ports in that group.

   If some ports are unmanaged such that not all packet sources are
   represented by managed ports, then the sum of the input counters for
   the repeater will not equal the actual output of the repeater.

   The IEEE 802.3 Hub Management draft [<a href="#ref-8" title="Draft 8">8</a>] defines the following seven
   functions and seven signals used to describe precisely when port
   counters are incremented.  The relationship between the functions and
   signals is shown in Figure 3.

   The CollisionEvent, ActivityDuration, CarrierEvent, FramingError,
   OctetCount, FCSError, and SourceAddress output signals defined here
   are not retrievable MIB objects, but rather are concepts used in
   defining the MIB objects.  The inputs are defined in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> of the
   IEEE 802.3 standard [<a href="#ref-7" title="2nd edition">7</a>].

             Figure 3.  Port Functions Relationship

   Collision Event Function:  The collision event function asserts the
   CollisionEvent signal when the CollIn(X) variable has the value
   SQE.  The CollisionEvent signal remains asserted until the assertion
   of any CarrierEvent signal due to the reception of the following
   event.

   Carrier Event Function:  The carrier event function asserts the
   CarrierEvent signal when the repeater exits the IDLE state, Fig 9-2
   [<a href="#ref-7" title="2nd edition">7</a>], and the port has been determined to be port N.  It deasserts
   the CarrierEvent signal when, for a duration of at least Carrier
   Recovery Time (Ref: 9.5.6.5 [<a href="#ref-7" title="2nd edition">7</a>]), both the DataIn(N) variable has
   the value II and the CollIn(N) variable has the value -SQE.  The
   value N is the port assigned at the time of transition from the IDLE
   state.

   Framing Function:  The framing function recognizes the boundaries of
   an incoming frame by monitoring the CarrierEvent signal and the



<span class="grey">McMaster &amp; McCloghrie                                           [Page 8]</span></pre>

   decoded data stream.  Data bits are accepted while the CarrierEvent
   signal is asserted.  The framing function strips preamble and start
   of frame delimiter from the received data stream.  The remaining
   bits are aligned along octet boundaries.  If there is not an
   integral number of octets, then FramingError shall be asserted.  The
   FramingError signal is cleared upon the assertion of the
   CarrierEvent signal due to the reception of the following event.

   Activity Timing Function:  The activity timing function measures the
   duration of the assertion of the CarrierEvent signal.  This duration
   value must be adjusted by removing the value of Carrier Recovery
   Time (Ref: 9.5.6.5 [<a href="#ref-7" title="2nd edition">7</a>]) to obtain the true duration of activity on
   the network.  The output of the Activity Timing function is the
   ActivityDuration value, which represents the duration of the
   CarrierEvent signal as expressed in units of bit times.

   Octet Counting Function:  The octet counting function counts the
   number of complete octets received from the output of the framing
   function.  The output of the octet counting function is the
   OctetCount value.  The OctetCount value is reset to zero upon the
   assertion of the CarrierEvent signal due to the reception of the
   following event.

   Cyclic Redundancy Check Function:  The cyclic redundancy check
   function verifies that the sequence of octets output by the framing
   function contains a valid frame check sequence field.  The frame
   check sequence field is the last four octets received from the
   output of the framing function.  The algorithm for generating an FCS
   from the octet stream is specified in 3.2.8 [<a href="#ref-7" title="2nd edition">7</a>].  If the FCS
   generated according to this algorithm is not the same as the last
   four octets received from the framing function then the FCSError
   signal is asserted.  The FCSError signal is cleared upon the
   assertion of the CarrierEvent signal due to the reception of the
   following event.

   Source Address Function:  The source address function extracts
   octets from the stream output by the framing function.  The seventh
   through twelfth octets shall be extracted from the octet stream and
   output as the SourceAddress variable.  The SourceAddress variable is
   set to an invalid state upon the assertion of the CarrierEvent
   signal due to the reception of the following event.

   It is assumed that a repeater implementing this MIB will also
   implement (at least) the 'system' group defined in MIB-II [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets"'>3</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.1.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20%27system%27%20group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.1" name="section-2.4.1">2.4.1</a>.  Relationship to the 'system' group</span>

   In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
   object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to the
   entity even if the entity's sole functionality is management of a
   repeater.

   In MIB-II, the 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for
   all systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces,
   where each interface is thought of as being attached to a
   the Internet suite of protocols.)

   This Repeater MIB uses the notion of ports on a repeater.  The
   concept of a MIB-II interface has NO specific relationship to a
   repeater's port.  Therefore, the 'interfaces' group applies only to
   the one (or more) network interfaces on which the entity managing
   the repeater sends and receives management protocol operations, and
   does not apply to the repeater's ports.

   This is consistent with the physical-layer nature of a repeater.  A
   repeater is a bitwise store-and-forward device.  It recognizes
   activity and bits, but does not process incoming data based on any
   packet-related information (such as checksum or addresses).  A

   repeater has no MAC address, no MAC implementation, and does not
   pass packets up to higher-level protocol entities for processing.

   (When a network management entity is observing the repeater, it may
   appear as though the repeater is passing packets to a higher-level
   protocol entity.  However, this is only a means of implementing

   The datatype MacAddress is used as a textual convention in this
   document.  This textual convention has NO effect on either the
   syntax nor the semantics of any managed object.  Objects defined
   using this convention are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the
   SNMP are necessary to accommodate this textual convention which is
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

               Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect.
               The agent will always return the value noReset(1)
               when this object is read.

               After receiving a request to set this variable to
               reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset
               for a short period.  For example, the implementor
               may choose to delay the reset long enough to allow
               the SNMP response to be transmitted.  In any
               event, the SNMP response must be transmitted.

               This action does not reset the management counters
               defined in this document nor does it affect the
               portAdminStatus parameters.  Included in this
               action is the execution of a disruptive Self-Test
               with the following characteristics:  a) The nature
               of the tests is not specified.  b) The test resets
               the repeater but without affecting management
               information about the repeater.  c) The test does
               not inject packets onto any segment.  d) Packets
               received during the test may or may not be
               transferred.  e) The test does not interfere with
               management functions.

               After performing this self-test, the agent will
               update the repeater health information (including
               rptrOperStatus and rptrHealthText), and send a

               about the repeater.  c) The test does not inject

               prevent the relay of any packets.  e) The test
               does not interfere with management functions.

        internal ports and clarifies how they may or may not be
        managed.

   (2)  Noted that the failure list for rptrOperStatus is ordered
        highest priority first.

   (3)  Clarified rptrReset description to indicate that the agent
        may briefly delay the reset action.

   (4)  For rptrReset, clarified the actions that the agent should
        take after performing the reset and self-test.

   (5)  For rptrNonDisruptTest, similar change to (3).

   (6)  Clarified that the rptrNonDisruptTest description allows
        returning "ok" after doing only a trivial test.

   (7)  Deprecated rptrAddrTrackLastSourceAddress and defined a

        replacement object that has a zero-length value until the
        first frame is seen on the port.

   (8)  Clarified that rptrHealth trap is sent after
        rptrNonDisruptTest even if repeater health information
        doesn't change as a result of the test.

   (9)  Clarified text on throttling traps.
