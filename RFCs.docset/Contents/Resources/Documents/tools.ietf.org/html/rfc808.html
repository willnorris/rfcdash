Introduction:

   This note is a very belated attempt to document a meeting that was
   held three years ago to discuss the state of computer mail in the
   ARPA community and to reach some conclusions to guide the further
   development of computer mail systems such that a coherent total mail
   service would continue to be provided.

   Some important conclusions were reached at this meeting which limited
   the extent to which mail systems were to incorporate new features in
   the context of the existing service and specifications.
   Unfortunately, this meeting and the conclusions were not documented,
   and the specifications were not revised.  This has led to continuing
   problems in the mail service.

   Due to the passage of time these notes are necessarily quite
   incomplete.  It is thought that there were a number of other
   attendees.  I would like to express my appreciation to those who
   helped provide this information, especially Vint Cerf, Jack Haverty,
   Danny Cohen, Bob Thomas, and Debbie Deutsch.

The Meeting Announcement:

   On 10 January 1979 we are holding a meeting at BBN in Cambridge, MA,
   starting at 0930, to discuss Message Service support on the ARPANET.
   The purpose of the meeting is to provide a basis for any
   standardization of efforts which may be necessary.  We will take
   stock of the various message services currently available on the
   ARPANET, discuss problems which have been encountered between
   different message systems, review current protocols and review
   forthcoming developments.  An agenda is given below.  Each of you
   should be prepared to discuss current problems you are aware of and
   any developments which impact future message service.

Talks:

   1.  Duane Adams opened the meeting.  He indicated that we should be
   concerned about computer mail as a total message service (not just as
   a local user interface), and asked what impact on the message service
   the developments in internetting and multimedia would have.

   2.  Dave Farber gave a bit of history of mail systems, listing the
   names of all the systems anybody had every heard of (see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).
   It was noted that most of the mail systems were not formal projects
   (in the sense of explicitly sponsored research), but things that
   "just happened".

   3.  Ted Myer chaired a discussion of current problems in mail
   systems, and the following made comments as well: R. Stallman,
   D. Farber, P. Santos, K. Harrenstien, R. Kunzelman, T. Knight,
   B. Thomas, D. Lebling, J. Haverty, D. Cohen, D. Adams, V. Cerf, and
   A. Vezza.

      This was mostly gripes about what this or that mail system did
      wrong.

         Topics included use of MLFL instead of MAIL, fully qualifying
         the all the usernames with hostnames on all the addresses,
         immediate feedback about the addressed user having a mailbox at
         the destination host or getting an error message later, host

         table update problems, strange FTP replies (e.g., "System going
         down in 10 minutes"), and addressing issues.

      There were also some things mentioned that might be added to the
      current systems.

         Topics included virtual hosts (e.g., NSW), internetted hosts,
         authentication, message identification, duplicate detection,
         spoofing, multicopy delivery, limits on receipt, program to
         program mail, structured typed data, graphics, fax, and voice.

      At the end of this session there was a statement that further work
      was putting patches on patches and that we should make a
      commitment to a version 2 system.  There should be an edict that
      says "this is it", and the current mail service should be frozen.

   4.  Debbie Deutsch talked about some work being done at BBN on
   multimedia mail.

      Debbie discussed the alternatives for including other types of
      data (voice, graphics, fax, numeric, executable) in messages, and
      for structuring messages to identify and interrelate the different
      types of data.  The main choice to make is between encoding the
      data in ASCII and using keyword field identifiers, or using a
      binary typed structured format.  The current work is attempting
      integrate fax data handling into an existing text mail system.
      Copies of the viewgraphs were distributed.

   5.  There was a discussion of Personal Computers.

      Tom Knight gave a short discription of the Lisp Machine project.

      There was some general discussion of the impact of personal
      computers on mail services.  The main realization being that the
      personal computer will not be available to handle incoming mail
      all the time.  Probably, personal computer users will have their
      mailboxes on some big brother computer (which may be dedicated to
      mailbox service, or be a general purpose host) and poll for their
      mail when they want to read it.  There were some concerns raised
      about accountability and accounting.

   6.  Bob Thomas talked about the ideas for routing mail between
   regular mailboxes on ARPANET Hosts and mailboxes of NSW users.

      The main point of interest is that an NSW user is not a user of a
      specific host, thus, the notion of a mailbox being "user@host"
      dosen't work.  Bob suggested that one might think of NSW as a
      virtual host.  The implementation of this mail service for NSW


<span class="grey">Postel                                                          [Page 3]</span></pre>

<a href="rfc808.html">RFC 808</a>


      users is constrained to minimize the amount of new code and
      changes to existing programs.  Bob described his ideas for address
      formats for sending messages between NSW users, from NSW users to
      ARPANET users, and from ARPANET users to NSW users.  The last
      being the most difficult to pull off.  Copies of the viewgraphs
      were distributed, and copies of a memo were distributed (BBN NSW
      Working Note 24).

   7.  Jon Postel talked about the ideas he had for internet multimedia
   mail systems.

      Two aspects of this were a general approach to addressing and
      routing for mail distribution, and using a structure of typed data
      elements to represent the message data and control.

   8.  There was some discussion of other work in mail services.

      Someone talked about the work of ANSI X3 S33 on message structure
      and protocol.

      Dave Farber described the activities of IFIP TC 6.5 on
      international message services.

      Ted Myer described the interests of the US Congress Office of
      Technology Assesment (OTA) in electronic communication.

General Discussion:

   It was suggested that we need to view the problems in building a
   total message service rather than individual message systems.

   In general it was felt that the current message service was somewhat
   out of control with incompatible varations and extensions.  There
   were several instances where a minor change to one mail system led to
   unexpected problems in another mail system.

   In part, the reason for this seemed to be the varations allowed by
   the protocol, and especially the partial implementation of the
   protocol by most systems.

   The general approach to resolving these problems was two fold:

      First, a few minor further changes were to be allowed, but in
      general full implementation of the protocol (<a href="rfc733.html">RFC 733</a>) was not to
      be carried out. In case of questions about a particular change
      Duane Adams was to decide if it would be allowed ot not.  The goal
      in this approach was to quickly stabilize the mail service in a
      useful state.


<span class="grey">Postel                                                          [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-5" id="page-5" name="page-5"> </a>
<span class="grey">Summary of Computer Mail Services Meeting                   1 March 1982</span>
<a href="rfc808.html">RFC 808</a>


         In particular, if a small number of senders are doing something
         that is incompatible with the total service, they will be asked
         to stop doing it.  Or, if a small number of receivers can't
         handle something that most systems do, they will be asked to
         handle that feature.

      Second, work was to be focused on the definition and
      implementation of a next-generation mail service which would
      attack all the existing problems and include facilities for voice,
      fax, and graphics data.

   The use of structured data in the next-generation mail service was
   approved.  Jack Haverty noted that <a href="rfc713.html">RFC 713</a> specified a language,
   MSDTP, that could be used to define a structured mail protocol.

Conclusions:

   A.  Existing Mail Services

      1.  Mail shall not be sent between hosts if it breaks existing
      mail programs.

         Outlawed by this rule are:

            a. Spaces in user names.

            b. Multiple at signs in mailboxes.
