<meta content="This document defines a new connectivity precondition for the Session
Description Protocol (SDP) precondition framework. A connectivity
precondition can be used to delay session establishment or
modification until media stream connectivity has been successfully
verified. The method of verification may vary depending on the type of
transport used for the media. For unreliable datagram transports such
as UDP, verification involves probing the stream with data or control
packets. For reliable connection-oriented transports such as TCP,
verification can be achieved simply by successful connection
establishment or by probing the connection with data or control
packets, depending on the situation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]" name="DC.Description.Abstract"/>

Abstract

   This document defines a new connectivity precondition for the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) precondition framework.  A connectivity
   precondition can be used to delay session establishment or
   modification until media stream connectivity has been successfully
   verified.  The method of verification may vary depending on the type
   of transport used for the media.  For unreliable datagram transports
   such as UDP, verification involves probing the stream with data or
   control packets.  For reliable connection-oriented transports such as
   TCP, verification can be achieved simply by successful connection
   establishment or by probing the connection with data or control
   packets, depending on the situation.

   The concept of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>]
   precondition in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [<a href="rfc3261.html" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] is
   defined in <a href="rfc3312.html">RFC 3312</a> [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>] (updated by <a href="rfc4032.html">RFC 4032</a> [<a href="rfc4032.html" title='"Update to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Preconditions Framework"'>RFC4032</a>]).  A
   precondition is a condition that has to be satisfied for a given
   media stream in order for session establishment or modification to
   proceed.  When the precondition is not met, session progress is
   delayed until the precondition is satisfied or the session
   establishment fails.  For example, <a href="rfc3312.html">RFC 3312</a> [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>] defines the
   Quality of Service precondition, which is used to ensure availability
   of network resources prior to establishing a session (i.e., prior to
   starting to alert the callee).

   SIP sessions are typically established in order to set up one or more
   media streams.  Even though a media stream may be negotiated
   successfully through an SDP offer-answer exchange, the actual media
   stream itself may fail.  For example, when there is one or more
   Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls in the media path,
   the media stream may not be received by the far end.  In cases where
   the media is carried over a connection-oriented transport such as TCP
   [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>], the connection-establishment procedures may fail.  The
   connectivity precondition defined in this document ensures that
   session progress is delayed until media stream connectivity has been
   verified.

   According to <a href="rfc4032.html">RFC 4032</a> [<a href="rfc4032.html" title='"Update to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Preconditions Framework"'>RFC4032</a>], documents defining new precondition
   types need to describe the behavior of UAs (User Agents) from the
   moment session establishment is suspended due to a set of
   preconditions, until it is resumed when these preconditions are met.
   An entity that wishes to delay session establishment or modification
   until media stream connectivity has been established uses this
   precondition-type in an offer.  When a mandatory connectivity
   precondition is received in an offer, session establishment or
   modification is delayed until the connectivity precondition has been
   met (i.e., until media stream connectivity has been established in
   the desired direction or directions).  The delay of session
   establishment defined here implies that alerting of the called party
   does not occur until the precondition has been satisfied.

   Packets may be both sent and received on the media streams in
   question.  However, such packets SHOULD be limited to packets that
   are necessary to verify connectivity between the two endpoints
   involved on the media stream.  That is, the underlying media stream
   SHOULD NOT be cut through.  For example, Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) connectivity checks [<a href="rfc5245.html" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>RFC5245</a>] and TCP SYN, SYN-
   ACK, and ACK packets can be exchanged on media streams that support
   them as a way of verifying connectivity.

   Some media streams are described by a single 'm' line but,
   nevertheless, involve multiple addresses.  For example, <a href="rfc5109.html">RFC 5109</a>
   [<a href="rfc5109.html" title='"RTP Payload Format for Generic Forward Error Correction"'>RFC5109</a>] specifies how to send FEC (Forward Error Correction)
   information as a separate stream (the address for the FEC stream is
   provided in an 'a=fmtp' line).  When a media stream consists of
   multiple destination addresses, connectivity to all of them MUST be
   verified in order for the precondition to be met.  In the case of RTP
   media streams [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] that use RTCP, connectivity MUST be verified
   for both RTP and RTCP; the RTCP transmission interval rules MUST
   still be adhered to.

   <a href="rfc3312.html">RFC 3312</a> [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>] defines support for two kinds of status types --

   The direction attributes defined in <a href="rfc3312.html">RFC 3312</a> [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>] are
   interpreted as follows:

   o  send: the party that generated the session description is sending
      packets on the media stream to the other party, and the other
      party has received at least one of those packets.  That is, there
      is connectivity in the forward (sending) direction.

   o  recv: the other party is sending packets on the media stream to
      the party that generated the session description, and this party
      has received at least one of those packets.  That is, there is
      connectivity in the backwards (receiving) direction.

   o  sendrecv: both the send and recv conditions hold.

   Note that a "send" connectivity precondition from the offerer's point
   of view corresponds to a "recv" connectivity precondition from the
   answerer's point of view, and vice versa.  If media stream
   connectivity in both directions is required before session
   establishment or modification continues, the desired status needs to
   be set to "sendrecv".

   Connectivity preconditions may have a strength-tag of either

   When a mandatory connectivity precondition is offered and the
   answerer cannot satisfy the connectivity precondition (e.g., because
   the offer does not include parameters that enable connectivity to be
   verified without media cut through) the offer MUST be rejected as
   described in <a href="rfc3312.html">RFC 3312</a> [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>].

   When an optional connectivity precondition is offered, the answerer
   MUST generate its answer SDP as soon as possible.  Since session
   progress is not delayed in this case, it is not known whether the
   associated media streams will have connectivity.  If the answerer
   wants to delay session progress until connectivity has been verified,
   the answerer MUST increase the strength of the connectivity
   precondition by using a strength-tag of "mandatory" in the answer.

   Note that use of a mandatory precondition requires the presence of a
   SIP "Require" header with the option tag "precondition".  Any SIP UA
   that does not support a mandatory precondition will reject such
   requests.  To get around this issue, an optional connectivity
   precondition and the SIP "Supported" header with the option tag
   "precondition" can be used instead.

   Offers with connectivity preconditions in re-INVITEs or UPDATEs
   follow the rules given in <a href="rfc3312.html#section-6">Section 6 of RFC 3312</a> [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>].  That is:

      Both user agents SHOULD continue using the old session parameters
      until all the mandatory preconditions are met.  At that moment,
      the user agents can begin using the new session parameters.

   Media stream connectivity is ascertained by use of a connectivity
   verification mechanism between the media endpoints.  A connectivity
   verification mechanism may be an explicit mechanism, such as ICE
   [<a href="rfc5245.html" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>RFC5245</a>] or ICE TCP [<a href="#ref-ICE-TCP" title='"TCP Candidates with Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)"'>ICE-TCP</a>], or it may be an implicit mechanism,
   such as TCP.  Explicit mechanisms provide specifications for when
   connectivity between two endpoints using an offer/answer exchange is
   ascertained, whereas implicit mechanisms do not.  The verification
   mechanism is negotiated as part of the normal offer/answer exchange;
   however, it is not identified explicitly.  More than one mechanism
   may be negotiated, but the offerer and answerer need not use the
   same.  The following rules guide which connectivity verification
   mechanism to use:

   o  If an explicit connectivity verification mechanism (e.g., ICE) is
      negotiated, the precondition is met when the mechanism verifies
      connectivity successfully.

   o  Otherwise, if a connection-oriented transport (e.g., TCP) is
      negotiated, the precondition is met when the connection is
      established.

   o  Otherwise, if an implicit verification mechanism is provided by
      the transport itself or the media stream data using the transport,
      the precondition is met when the mechanism verifies connectivity
      successfully.

   o  Otherwise, connectivity cannot be verified reliably, and the
      connectivity precondition will never be satisfied if requested.

   This document does not mandate any particular connectivity
   verification mechanism; however, in the following, we provide
   additional considerations for verification mechanisms.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Correlation%20of%20Dialog%20to%20Media%20Stream"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Correlation of Dialog to Media Stream</span>

   SIP and SDP do not provide any inherent capabilities for associating
   an incoming media stream packet with a particular dialog.  Thus, when
   an offerer is trying to ascertain connectivity, and an incoming media
   stream packet is received, the offerer may not know which dialog had
   its "recv" connectivity verified.  Explicit connectivity verification
   mechanisms therefore typically provide a means to correlate the media
   stream, whose connectivity is being verified, with a particular SIP
   dialog.  However, some connectivity verification mechanisms may not
   provide such a correlation.  In the absence of a mechanism for the
   correlation of dialog to media stream (e.g., ICE), a UAS (User Agent
   Server) MUST NOT require the offerer to confirm a connectivity
   precondition.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Explicit%20Connectivity%20Verification%20Mechanisms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Explicit Connectivity Verification Mechanisms</span>

   Explicit connectivity verification mechanisms typically use probe
   traffic with some sort of feedback to inform the sender whether
   reception was successful.  Below we provide two examples of such
   mechanisms, and how they are used with connectivity preconditions:

   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [<a href="rfc5245.html" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>RFC5245</a>] provides one
   or more candidate addresses in signaling between the offerer and the
   answerer and then uses STUN (Simple Traversal of the UDP Protocol
   through NAT) Binding Requests to determine which pairs of candidate
   addresses have connectivity.  Each STUN Binding Request contains a
   password that is communicated in the SDP as well; this enables
   correlation between STUN Binding Requests and candidate addresses for
   a particular media stream.  It also provides correlation with a
   particular SIP dialog.

   ICE implementations may be either full or lite (see [<a href="rfc5245.html" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>RFC5245</a>]).  Full
   implementations generate and respond to STUN Binding Requests,
   whereas lite implementations only respond to them.  With ICE, one
   side is a controlling agent, and the other side is a controlled
   agent.  A full implementation can take on either role, whereas a lite
   implementation can only be a controlled agent.  The controlling agent
   decides which valid candidate to use and informs the controlled agent
   of it by identifying the pair as the nominated pair.  This leads to
   the following connectivity precondition rules:

   o  A full implementation ascertains both "send" and "recv"
      connectivity when it operates as a STUN client and has sent a STUN
      Binding Request that resulted in a successful check for all the
      components of the media stream (as defined further in ICE).

   o  A full or a lite implementation ascertains "recv" connectivity
      when it operates as a STUN server and has received a STUN Binding
      Request that resulted in a successful response for all the
      components of the media stream (as defined further in ICE).

   o  A lite implementation ascertains "send" and "recv" connectivity
      when the controlling agent has informed it of the nominated pair
      for all the components of the media stream.

   A simpler and slightly more delay-prone alternative to the above
   rules is for all ICE implementations to ascertain "send" and "recv"
   connectivity for a media stream when the ICE state for that media
   stream has moved to Completed.

   Note that there is never a need for the answerer to request
   confirmation of the connectivity precondition when using ICE: the
   answerer can determine the status locally.  Also note, that when ICE
   is used to verify connectivity preconditions, the precondition is not
   satisfied until connectivity has been verified for all the component
   transport addresses used by the media stream.  For example, with an
   RTP-based media stream where RTCP is not suppressed, connectivity
   MUST be ascertained for both RTP and RTCP.  Finally, it should be
   noted, that although connectivity has been ascertained, a new offer/
   answer exchange may be required before media can flow (per ICE).

   The above are merely examples of explicit connectivity verification
   mechanisms.  Other techniques can be used as well.  It is however
   RECOMMENDED that ICE be supported by entities that support
   connectivity preconditions.  Use of ICE has the benefit of working
   for all media streams (not just RTP) as well as facilitating NAT and
   firewall traversal, which may otherwise interfere with connectivity.
   Furthermore, the ICE recommendation provides a baseline to ensure

   that all entities that require probe traffic to support the
   connectivity preconditions have a common way of ascertaining
   connectivity.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Verifying%20Connectivity%20for%20Connection-Oriented%20Transports"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Verifying Connectivity for Connection-Oriented Transports</span>

   Connection-oriented transport protocols generally provide an implicit
   connectivity verification mechanism.  Connection establishment
   involves sending traffic in both directions thereby verifying
   connectivity at the transport-protocol level.  When a three-way (or
   more) handshake for connection establishment succeeds, bi-directional
   communication is confirmed and both the "send" and "recv"
   preconditions are satisfied whether requested or not.  In the case of
   TCP for example, once the TCP three-way handshake has completed (SYN,
   SYN-ACK, ACK), the TCP connection is established and data can be sent
   and received by either party (i.e., both a send and a receive
   connectivity precondition has been satisfied).  SCTP (Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol) [<a href="rfc4960.html" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol"'>RFC4960</a>] connections have similar semantics
   as TCP and SHOULD be treated the same.

   When a connection-oriented transport is part of an offer, it may be
   passive, active, or active/passive [<a href="rfc4145.html" title='"TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC4145</a>].  When it is passive,
   the offerer expects the answerer to initiate the connection
   establishment, and when it is active, the offerer wants to initiate
   the connection establishment.  When it is active/passive, the
   answerer decides.  As noted earlier, lack of a media-stream-to-dialog
   correlation mechanism can make it difficult to guarantee with whom
   connectivity has been ascertained.  When the offerer takes on the
   passive role, the offerer will not necessarily know which SIP dialog
   originated an incoming connection request.  If the offerer instead is
   active, this problem is avoided.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Connectivity%20and%20Other%20Precondition%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Connectivity and Other Precondition Types</span>

   The role of a connectivity precondition is to ascertain media stream
   connectivity before establishing or modifying a session.  The
   underlying intent is for the two parties to be able to exchange media
   packets successfully.  However, connectivity by itself may not fully
   satisfy this.  Quality of Service, for example, may be required for
   the media stream; this can be addressed by use of the "qos"
   precondition defined in <a href="rfc3312.html">RFC 3312</a> [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>].  Similarly, successful
   security parameter negotiation may be another prerequisite; this can
   be addressed by use of the "sec" precondition defined in <a href="rfc5027.html">RFC 5027</a>
   [<a href="rfc5027.html" title='"Security Preconditions for Session Description Protocol (SDP) Media Streams"'>RFC5027</a>].

   A sends an INVITE requesting connection-establishment preconditions.
   The setup attribute in the offer is set to holdconn [<a href="rfc4145.html" title='"TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC4145</a>] because
   A cannot send or receive any data before setting up a radio bearer
   for the connection.

   B agrees to use the connectivity precondition by sending a 183
   (Session Progress) response.  The setup attribute in the answer is
   also set to holdconn because B, like A, cannot send or receive any
   data before setting up a radio bearer for the connection.

   When A's radio bearer is ready, A sends an UPDATE to B with a setup
   attribute with a value of actpass.  This attribute indicates that A
   can perform an active or a passive TCP open.  A is letting B choose
   which endpoint will initiate the connection.

   Since B's radio bearer is not ready yet, B chooses to be the one
   initiating the connection and indicates this with a setup attribute
   with a value of active.  At a later point, when B's radio bearer is
   ready, B initiates the TCP connection towards A.

   Once the TCP connection is established successfully, B knows the
   "sendrecv" precondition is satisfied, and B proceeds with the session
   (i.e., alerts the Callee), and sends a 180 (Ringing) response.

   The second example shows a basic SIP session establishment using SDP
   connectivity preconditions and ICE (the required PRACK transaction
   and some SDP details have been omitted for clarity).  The offerer (A)
   is a full ICE implementation whereas the answerer (B) is a lite ICE
   implementation.  The message flow for this scenario is shown in
   Figure 2 below.

     Figure 2: Connectivity Precondition with ICE Connectivity Checks

   SDP1: A includes a mandatory end-to-end connectivity precondition
   with a desired status of "sendrecv"; this will ensure media stream
   connectivity in both directions before continuing with the session
   setup.  Since media stream connectivity in either direction is
   unknown at this point, the current status is set to "none".  A's
   local status table (see [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>]) for the connectivity precondition
   is as follows:

       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm
      -----------+----------+------------------+----------
         send    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no
         recv    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no

   and the resulting offer SDP is:

     a=ice-pwd:asd88fgpdd777uzjYhagZg
     a=ice-ufrag:8hhY
     m=audio 20000 RTP/AVP 0
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
     a=rtcp:20001
     a=curr:conn e2e none
     a=des:conn mandatory e2e sendrecv
     a=candidate:1 1 UDP 2130706431 192.0.2.1 20000 typ host

   SDP2: When B receives the offer, B sees the mandatory sendrecv
   connectivity precondition.  B is a lite ICE implementation and hence
   B can only ascertain "recv" connectivity (from B's point of view)




<span class="grey">Andreasen, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 12]</span></pre>

   from A; thus, B wants A to inform it about connectivity in the other
   direction ("send" from B's point of view).  B's local status table
   therefore looks as follows:

       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm
      -----------+----------+------------------+----------
         send    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no
         recv    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no

   Since B is a lite ICE implementation and B wants to ask A for
   confirmation about the "send" (from B's point of view) connectivity
   precondition, the resulting answer SDP becomes:

     a=ice-lite
     a=ice-pwd:qrCA8800133321zF9AIj98
     a=ice-ufrag:H92p
     m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 0
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.4
     a=rtcp:30001
     a=curr:conn e2e none
     a=des:conn mandatory e2e sendrecv
     a=conf:conn e2e send
     a=candidate:1 1 UDP 2130706431 192.0.2.4 30000 typ host

   Since the "send" and the "recv" connectivity precondition (from B's
   point of view) are still not satisfied, session establishment remains
   suspended.

   SDP3: When A receives the answer SDP, A notes that B is a lite ICE
   implementation and that confirmation was requested for B's "send"
   connectivity precondition, which is the "recv" precondition from A's
   point of view.  A performs a successful send and recv connectivity
   check to B by sending an ICE connectivity check to B and receiving
   the corresponding response.  A's local status table becomes:

       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm
      -----------+----------+------------------+----------
         send    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    no
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    yes

   whereas B's local status table becomes:

       Direction | Current  | Desired Strength | Confirm
      -----------+----------+------------------+----------
         send    |    no    |   mandatory      |   no
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |   no

   Since B asked for confirmation about the "recv" connectivity (from
   A's point of view), A now sends an UPDATE (5) to B to confirm the
   connectivity from A to B:

     a=ice-pwd:asd88fgpdd777uzjYhagZg
     a=ice-ufrag:8hhY
     m=audio 20000 RTP/AVP 0
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
     a=rtcp:20001
     a=curr:conn e2e sendrecv
     a=des:conn mandatory e2e sendrecv
     a=candidate:1 1 UDP 2130706431 192.0.2.1 20000 typ host

   B knows it has recv connectivity (verified by ICE as well as A's
   UPDATE) and send connectivity (confirmed by A's UPDATE) at this
   point.  B's local status table becomes:

       Direction | Current  | Desired Strength | Confirm
      -----------+----------+------------------+----------
         send    |    yes   |   mandatory      |   no
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |   no

   and the session can continue.

   General security considerations for preconditions are discussed in
   <a href="rfc3312.html">RFC 3312</a> [<a href="rfc3312.html" title='"Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3312</a>] and <a href="rfc4032.html">RFC 4032</a> [<a href="rfc4032.html" title='"Update to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Preconditions Framework"'>RFC4032</a>].  As discussed in <a href="rfc4032.html">RFC 4032</a>
   [<a href="rfc4032.html" title='"Update to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Preconditions Framework"'>RFC4032</a>], it is strongly RECOMMENDED that S/MIME [<a href="rfc3853.html" title='"S/MIME Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Requirement for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3853</a>] integrity
   protection be applied to the SDP session descriptions.  When the user
   agent provides identity services (rather than the proxy server), the
   SIP identity mechanism specified in <a href="rfc4474.html">RFC 4474</a> [<a href="rfc4474.html" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC4474</a>] provides an
   alternative end-to-end integrity protection.  Additionally, the
   following security issues relate specifically to connectivity
   preconditions.

   Connectivity preconditions rely on mechanisms beyond SDP, such as TCP
   [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>] connection establishment or ICE connectivity checks
   [<a href="rfc5245.html" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>RFC5245</a>], to establish and verify connectivity between an offerer
   and an answerer.  An attacker that prevents those mechanisms from
   succeeding (e.g., by keeping ICE connectivity checks from arriving at
   their destination) can prevent media sessions from being established.
   While this attack relates to connectivity preconditions, it is
   actually an attack against the connection-establishment mechanisms
   used by the endpoints.  This attack can be performed in the presence
   or in the absence of connectivity preconditions.  In their presence,
   the whole session setup will be disrupted.  In their absence, only
   the establishment of the particular stream under attack will be

   disrupted.  This specification does not provide any mechanism against
   attackers able to block traffic between the endpoints involved in the
   session because such an attacker will always be able to launch DoS
   (Denial-of-Service) attacks.

   Instead of blocking the connectivity checks, the attacker can
   generate forged connectivity checks that would cause the endpoints to
   assume that there was connectivity when there was actually no
   connectivity.  This attack would result in the user experience being
   poor because the session would be established without all the media
   streams being ready.  The same attack can be used, regardless of
   whether or not connectivity preconditions are used, to attempt to
   hijack a connection.  The forged connectivity checks would trick the
   endpoints into sending media to the wrong direction.  To prevent
   these attacks, it is RECOMMENDED that the mechanisms used to check
   connectivity are adequately secured by message authentication and
   integrity protection.  For example, <a href="rfc5245.html#section-2.5">Section 2.5 of [RFC5245]</a>
   discusses how message integrity and data origin authentication are
   implemented in ICE connectivity checks.
