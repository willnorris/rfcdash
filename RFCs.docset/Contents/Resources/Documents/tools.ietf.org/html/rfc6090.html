           <span class="h1">Fundamental Elliptic Curve Cryptography Algorithms</span>

Abstract

   This note describes the fundamental algorithms of Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography (ECC) as they were defined in some seminal references
   from 1994 and earlier.  These descriptions may be useful for
   implementing the fundamental algorithms without using any of the
   specialized methods that were developed in following years.  Only
   elliptic curves defined over fields of characteristic greater than
   three are in scope; these curves are those used in Suite B.

   ECC is a public-key technology that offers performance advantages at
   higher security levels.  It includes an elliptic curve version of the
   Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol [<a href="#ref-DH1976" title='"New Directions in Cryptography"'>DH1976</a>] and elliptic curve
   versions of the ElGamal Signature Algorithm [<a href="#ref-E1985" title='"A public key cryptosystem and a signature scheme based on discrete logarithms"'>E1985</a>].  The adoption of
   ECC has been slower than had been anticipated, perhaps due to the
   lack of freely available normative documents and uncertainty over
   intellectual property rights.

   This note contains a description of the fundamental algorithms of ECC
   over finite fields with characteristic greater than three, based
   directly on original references.  Its intent is to provide the
   Internet community with a summary of the basic algorithms that
   predate any specialized or optimized algorithms.  The summary is
   detailed enough for use as a normative reference.  The original
   descriptions and notations were followed as closely as possible.

   There are several standards that specify or incorporate ECC
   algorithms, including the Internet Key Exchange (IKE), ANSI X9.62,
   and IEEE P1363.  The algorithms in this note can interoperate with

   This section reviews modular arithmetic.  Two integers x and y are
   said to be congruent modulo n if x - y is an integer multiple of n.

   Two integers x and y are coprime when their greatest common divisor
   is 1; in this case, there is no third number z &gt; 1 such that z
   divides x and z divides y.

   The set Zq = { 0, 1, 2, ..., q-1 } is closed under the operations of
   modular addition, modular subtraction, modular multiplication, and
   modular inverse.  These operations are as follows.

      For each pair of integers a and b in Zq, a + b mod q is equal to
      a + b if a + b &lt; q, and is equal to a + b - q otherwise.

      For each pair of integers a and b in Zq, a - b mod q is equal to
      a - b if a - b &gt;= 0, and is equal to a - b + q otherwise.

      For each pair of integers a and b in Zq, a * b mod q is equal to
      the remainder of a * b divided by q.

      For each integer x in Zq that is coprime with q, the inverse of x
      modulo q is denoted as 1/x mod q, and can be computed using the
      extended Euclidean algorithm (see Section 4.5.2 of [<a href="#ref-K1981v2" title='"The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2: Seminumerical Algorithms"'>K1981v2</a>], for
      example).

   Algorithms for these operations are well known; for instance, see
   Chapter 4 of [<a href="#ref-K1981v2" title='"The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2: Seminumerical Algorithms"'>K1981v2</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Group%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Group Operations</span>

   This section establishes some terminology and notation for
   mathematical groups, which are needed later on.  Background
   references abound; see [<a href="#ref-D1966" title='"Abstract Algebra"'>D1966</a>], for example.

   A group is a set of elements G together with an operation that
   combines any two elements in G and returns a third element in G.  The
   operation is denoted as * and its application is denoted as a * b,
   for any two elements a and b in G.  The operation is associative,
   that is, for all a, b, and c in G, a * (b * c) is identical to (a *
   b) * c.  Repeated application of the group operation N-1 times to the
   element a is denoted as a^N, for any element a in G and any positive
   integer N.  That is, a^2 = a * a, a^3 = a * a * a, and so on.  The
   associativity of the group operation ensures that the computation of
   a^n is unambiguous; any grouping of the terms gives the same result.

   The above definition of a group operation uses multiplicative
   notation.  Sometimes an alternative called additive notation is used,
   in which a * b is denoted as a + b, and a^N is denoted as N * a.  In
   multiplicative notation, a^N is called exponentiation, while the
   equivalent operation in additive notation is called scalar
   multiplication.  In this document, multiplicative notation is used
   throughout for consistency.  <a href="#appendix-E">Appendix E</a> elucidates the correspondence
   between the two notations.

   Every group has a special element called the identity element, which
   we denote as e.  For each element a in G, e * a = a * e = a.  By
   convention, a^0 is equal to the identity element for any a in G.

   Every group element a has a unique inverse element b such that
   a * b = b * a = e.  The inverse of a is denoted as a^-1 in
   multiplicative notation.  (In additive notation, the inverse of a is
   denoted as -a.)

   For any positive integer X, a^(-X) is defined to be (a^-1)^(X).
   Using this convention, exponentiation behaves as one would expect,
   namely for any integers X and Y:

      a^(X+Y) = (a^X)*(a^Y)

      (a^X)^Y = a^(XY) = (a^Y)^X.

   In cryptographic applications, one typically deals with finite groups
   (groups with a finite number of elements), and for such groups, the
   number of elements of the group is also called the order of the
   group.  A group element a is said to have finite order if a^X = e for
   some positive integer X, and the order of a is the smallest such X.
   If no such X exists, a is said to have infinite order.  All elements
   of a finite group have a finite order, and the order of an element is
   always a divisor of the group order.

   If a group element a has order R, then for any integers X and Y,

      a^X = a^(X mod R),

      a^X = a^Y if and only if X is congruent to Y mod R,

      the set H = { a, a^2, a^3, ... , a^R=e } forms a subgroup of G,
      called the cyclic subgroup generated by a, and a is said to be a
      generator of H.

   Typically, there are several group elements that generate H.  Any
   group element of the form a^M, with M relatively prime to R, also
   generates H.  Note that a^M is equal to g^(M modulo R) for any non-
   negative integer M.

   Given the element a of order R, and an integer i between 1 and R-1,
   inclusive, the element a^i can be computed by the "square and
   multiply" method outlined in Section 2.1 of [<a href="#ref-M1983" title='"Logarithms in finite cyclic groups - cryptographic issues"'>M1983</a>] (see also Knuth,
   Vol. 2, <a href="#section-4.6.3">Section 4.6.3</a>), or other methods.

   This section establishes terminology and notation for finite fields
   with prime characteristic.

   When p is a prime number, then the set Zp, with the addition,
   subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, is a finite
   field with characteristic p.  Each nonzero element x in Zp has an
   inverse 1/x.  There is a one-to-one correspondence between the
   integers between zero and p-1, inclusive, and the elements of the
   field.  The field Zp is sometimes denoted as Fp or GF(p).

   Equations involving field elements do not explicitly denote the "mod
   p" operation, but it is understood to be implicit.  For example, the
   statement that x, y, and z are in Fp and

      z = x + y

   is equivalent to the statement that x, y, and z are in the set
   { 0, 1, ..., p-1 } and

      z = x + y mod p.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Elliptic%20Curve%20Groups"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Elliptic Curve Groups</span>

   This note only covers elliptic curves over fields with characteristic
   greater than three; these are the curves used in Suite B [<a href="#ref-SuiteB" title='"NSA Suite B Cryptography"'>SuiteB</a>].
   For other fields, the definition of the elliptic curve group would be
   different.

   An elliptic curve over a field Fp is defined by the curve equation

      y^2 = x^3 + a*x + b,

   where x, y, a, and b are elements of the field Fp [<a href="#ref-M1985" title='"Use of elliptic curves in cryptography"'>M1985</a>], and the
   discriminant is nonzero (as described in <a href="#section-3.3.1">Section 3.3.1</a>).  A point on
   an elliptic curve is a pair (x,y) of values in Fp that satisfies the
   curve equation, or it is a special point (@,@) that represents the
   identity element (which is called the "point at infinity").  The
   order of an elliptic curve group is the number of distinct points.

   Two elliptic curve points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are equal whenever
   x1=x2 and y1=y2, or when both points are the point at infinity.  The
   inverse of the point (x1,y1) is the point (x1,-y1).  The point at
   infinity is its own inverse.

   The group operation associated with the elliptic curve group is as
   follows [<a href="#ref-BC1989" title='"On the Implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems"'>BC1989</a>].  To an arbitrary pair of points P and Q specified
   by their coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), respectively, the group
   operation assigns a third point P*Q with the coordinates (x3,y3).
   These coordinates are computed as follows:

      (x3,y3) = (@,@) when P is not equal to Q and x1 is equal to x2.

      x3 = ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1))^2 - x1 - x2 and
      y3 = (x1-x3)*(y2-y1)/(x2-x1) - y1 when P is not equal to Q and
      x1 is not equal to x2.

      (x3,y3) = (@,@) when P is equal to Q and y1 is equal to 0.

      x3 = ((3*x1^2 + a)/(2*y1))^2 - 2*x1 and
      y3 = (x1-x3)*(3*x1^2 + a)/(2*y1) - y1 if P is equal to Q and y1 is
      not equal to 0.

   In the above equations, a, x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, and y3 are elements of
   the field Fp; thus, computation of x3 and y3 in practice must reduce
   the right-hand-side modulo p.  Pseudocode for the group operation is
   provided in <a href="#appendix-F.1">Appendix F.1</a>.

   The representation of elliptic curve points as a pair of integers in
   Zp is known as the affine coordinate representation.  This
   representation is suitable as an external data representation for
   communicating or storing group elements, though the point at infinity
   must be treated as a special case.

   Some pairs of integers are not valid elliptic curve points.  A valid
   pair will satisfy the curve equation, while an invalid pair will not.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Homogeneous%20Coordinates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Homogeneous Coordinates</span>

   An alternative way to implement the group operation is to use
   homogeneous coordinates [<a href="#ref-K1987" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems"'>K1987</a>] (see also [<a href="#ref-KMOV1991" title='"New Public-Key Schemes Based on Elliptic Curves over the Ring Zn"'>KMOV1991</a>]).  This method
   is typically more efficient because it does not require a modular
   inversion operation.

   An elliptic curve point (x,y) (other than the point at infinity
   (@,@)) is equivalent to a point (X,Y,Z) in homogeneous coordinates
   whenever x=X/Z mod p and y=Y/Z mod p.

   Let P1=(X1,Y1,Z1) and P2=(X2,Y2,Z2) be points on an elliptic curve,
   and suppose that the points P1 and P2 are not equal to (@,@), P1 is
   not equal to P2, and P1 is not equal to P2^-1.  Then the product
   P3=(X3,Y3,Z3) = P1 * P2 is given by

      X3 = v * (Z2 * (Z1 * u^2 - 2 * X1 * v^2) - v^3) mod p

      Y3 = Z2 * (3 * X1 * u * v^2 - Y1 * v^3 - Z1 * u^3) + u * v^3 mod p

      Z3 = v^3 * Z1 * Z2 mod p

   where u = Y2 * Z1 - Y1 * Z2 mod p and v = X2 * Z1 - X1 * Z2 mod p.

   When the points P1 and P2 are equal, then (X1/Z1, Y1/Z1) is equal to
   (X2/Z2, Y2/Z2), which is true if and only if u and v are both equal
   to zero.

   The product P3=(X3,Y3,Z3) = P1 * P1 is given by

      X3 = 2 * Y1 * Z1 * (w^2 - 8 * X1 * Y1^2 * Z1) mod p

      Y3 = 4 * Y1^2 * Z1 * (3 * w * X1 - 2 * Y1^2 * Z1) - w^3 mod p

      Z3 = 8 * (Y1 * Z1)^3 mod p

   where w = 3 * X1^2 + a * Z1^2 mod p.  In the above equations, a, u,
   v, w, X1, X2, X3, Y1, Y2, Y3, Z1, Z2, and Z3 are integers in the set
   Fp.  Pseudocode for the group operation in homogeneous coordinates is
   provided in <a href="#appendix-F.2">Appendix F.2</a>.

   When converting from affine coordinates to homogeneous coordinates,
   it is convenient to set Z to 1.  When converting from homogeneous
   coordinates to affine coordinates, it is necessary to perform a
   modular inverse to find 1/Z mod p.

   Some other coordinate systems have been described; several are

   In cryptographic contexts, an elliptic curve parameter set consists
   of a cyclic subgroup of an elliptic curve together with a preferred
   generator of that subgroup.  When working over a prime order finite
   field with characteristic greater than three, an elliptic curve group
   is completely specified by the following parameters:

      The prime number p that indicates the order of the field Fp.

      The value a used in the curve equation.

      The value b used in the curve equation.

      The generator g of the subgroup.

      The order n of the subgroup generated by g.

   An example of an ECC parameter set is provided in <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a>.

   Parameter generation is out of scope for this note.

   Each elliptic curve point is associated with a particular parameter
   set.  The elliptic curve group operation is only defined between two
   points in the same group.  It is an error to apply the group

   For each elliptic curve group, the discriminant -16*(4*a^3 + 27*b^2)
   must be nonzero modulo p [<a href="#ref-S1986" title='"The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves"'>S1986</a>]; this requires that

      4*a^3 + 27*b^2 != 0 mod p.

   Security is highly dependent on the choice of these parameters.  This
   section gives normative guidance on acceptable choices.  See also
   <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> for informative guidance.

   The order of the group generated by g MUST be divisible by a large
   prime, in order to preclude easy solutions of the discrete logarithm
   problem [<a href="#ref-K1987" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems"'>K1987</a>].

   With some parameter choices, the discrete log problem is
   significantly easier to solve.  This includes parameter sets in which
   b = 0 and p = 3 (mod 4), and parameter sets in which a = 0 and
   p = 2 (mod 3) [<a href="#ref-MOV1993" title='"Reducing Elliptic Curve Logarithms to Logarithms in a Finite Field"'>MOV1993</a>].  These parameter choices are inferior for
   cryptographic purposes and SHOULD NOT be used.

   The Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol [<a href="#ref-DH1976" title='"New Directions in Cryptography"'>DH1976</a>] allows two
   parties communicating over an insecure channel to agree on a secret
   key.  It was originally defined in terms of operations in the
   multiplicative group of a field with a large prime characteristic.
   Massey [<a href="#ref-M1983" title='"Logarithms in finite cyclic groups - cryptographic issues"'>M1983</a>] observed that it can be easily generalized so that it
   is defined in terms of an arbitrary cyclic group.  Miller [<a href="#ref-M1985" title='"Use of elliptic curves in cryptography"'>M1985</a>] and
   Koblitz [<a href="#ref-K1987" title='"Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems"'>K1987</a>] analyzed the DH protocol over an elliptic curve
   group.  We describe DH following the former reference.

   Let G be a group, and g be a generator for that group, and let t
   denote the order of G.  The DH protocol runs as follows.  Party A
   chooses an exponent j between 1 and t-1, inclusive, uniformly at
   random, computes g^j, and sends that element to B.  Party B chooses
   an exponent k between 1 and t-1, inclusive, uniformly at random,
   computes g^k, and sends that element to A.  Each party can compute
   g^(j*k); party A computes (g^k)^j, and party B computes (g^j)^k.

   Each run of the ECDH protocol is associated with a particular
   parameter set (as defined in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>), and the public keys g^j
   and g^k and the shared secret g^(j*k) are elements of the cyclic
   subgroup associated with the parameter set.

   An ECDH private key z is an integer in Zt, where t is the order of
   the subgroup.

   As described in the final paragraph of [<a href="#ref-M1985" title='"Use of elliptic curves in cryptography"'>M1985</a>], the x-coordinate of
   the shared secret value g^(j*k) is a suitable representative for the
   entire point whenever exponentiation is used as a one-way function.
   In the ECDH key exchange protocol, after the element g^(j*k) has been
   computed, the x-coordinate of that value can be used as the shared
   secret.  We call this compact output.

   Following [<a href="#ref-M1985" title='"Use of elliptic curves in cryptography"'>M1985</a>] again, when compact output is used in ECDH, only
   the x-coordinate of an elliptic curve point needs to be transmitted,
   instead of both coordinates as in the typical affine coordinate
   representation.  We call this the compact representation.  Its
   mathematical background is explained in <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.

   ECDH can be used with or without compact output.  Both parties in a
   particular run of the ECDH protocol MUST use the same method.  ECDH
   can be used with or without compact representation.  If compact
   representation is used in a particular run of the ECDH protocol, then
   compact output MUST be used as well.

   The ElGamal signature algorithm was introduced in 1984 [<a href="#ref-E1984a" title='"Cryptography and logarithms over finite fields"'>E1984a</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-E1984b" title='"Cryptography and logarithms over finite fields"'>E1984b</a>] [<a href="#ref-E1985" title='"A public key cryptosystem and a signature scheme based on discrete logarithms"'>E1985</a>].  It is based on the discrete logarithm problem, and
   was originally defined for the multiplicative group of the integers
   modulo a large prime number.  It is straightforward to extend it to
   use other finite groups, such as the multiplicative group of the
   finite field GF(2^w) [<a href="#ref-AMV1990" title='"Improved Digital Signature Scheme based on Discrete Exponentiation"'>AMV1990</a>] or an elliptic curve group [<a href="#ref-A1992" title='"Response to the proposed DSS"'>A1992</a>].

   An ElGamal signature consists of a pair of components.  There are
   many possible generalizations of ElGamal signature methods that have
   been obtained by different rearrangements of the equation for the
   second component; see [<a href="#ref-HMP1994" title='"Meta-ElGamal signature schemes"'>HMP1994</a>], [<a href="#ref-HP1994" title='"Verallgemeinerte ElGamal- Signaturen"'>HP1994</a>], [<a href="#ref-NR1994" title='"Message Recovery for Signature Schemes Based on the Discrete Logarithm Problem"'>NR1994</a>], [<a href="#ref-A1992" title='"Response to the proposed DSS"'>A1992</a>], and

   [<a href="#ref-AMV1990" title='"Improved Digital Signature Scheme based on Discrete Exponentiation"'>AMV1990</a>].  These generalizations are independent of the mathematical

   The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title='"DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD"'>FIPS186</a>] is an important
   ElGamal signature variant.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Hash%20Functions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Hash Functions</span>

   ElGamal signatures must use a collision-resistant hash function, so
   that it can sign messages of arbitrary length and can avoid
   existential forgery attacks; see <a href="#section-10.4">Section 10.4</a>.  (This is true for all
   ElGamal variants [<a href="#ref-HMP1994" title='"Meta-ElGamal signature schemes"'>HMP1994</a>].)  We denote the hash function as h().
   Its input is a bit string of arbitrary length, and its output is a
   non-negative integer.

   Let H() denote a hash function whose output is a fixed-length bit
   string.  To use H in an ElGamal signature method, we define the
   mapping between that output and the non-negative integers; this
   realizes the function h() described above.  Given a bit string m, the
   function h(m) is computed as follows:

   1.  H(m) is evaluated; the result is a fixed-length bit string.

   2.  Convert the resulting bit string to an integer i by treating its
       leftmost (initial) bit as the most significant bit of i, and
       treating its rightmost (final) bit as the least significant bit
       of i.

   Koyama and Tsuruoka described a signature method based on Elliptic

   x-coordinate of an elliptic curve point reduced modulo q [<a href="#ref-KT1994" title='"Digital signature system based on elliptic curve and signer device and verifier device for said system"'>KT1994</a>].
   In this section, we recall that method, which we refer to as KT-IV.

   The algorithm uses an elliptic curve group, as described in
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>, with prime field order p and curve equation parameters a
   and b.  We denote the generator as alpha, and the order of the
   generator as q.  We follow [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title='"DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD"'>FIPS186</a>] in checking for exceptional

   The private key z is an integer between 1 and q-1, inclusive,

   To compute a KT-IV signature for a message m using the private key z:

   1.  Choose an integer k uniformly at random from the set of all
       integers between 1 and q-1, inclusive.  (See <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> regarding

   3.  Calculate s1 = r_x mod q.

   4.  Check if h(m) + z * s1 = 0 mod q; if so, a new value of k MUST be
       generated and the signature MUST be recalculated.  As an option,
       one MAY check if s1 = 0; if so, a new value of k SHOULD be
       generated and the signature SHOULD be recalculated.  (It is
       extremely unlikely that s1 = 0 or h(m) + z * s1 = 0 mod q if
       signatures are generated properly.)

   5.  Calculate s2 = k/(h(m) + z*s1) mod q.

   The signature is the ordered pair (s1, s2).  Both signature
   components are non-negative integers.

   Given the message m, the generator g, the group order q, the public

   1.  Check to see that 0 &lt; s1 &lt; q and 0 &lt; s2 &lt; q; if either condition

          u2 = s1 * s2 mod q.

   3.  Compute the elliptic curve point R' = alpha^u1 * Y^u2.

   A KT-IV signature for a message m and a public key Y can easily be

   The conversion operation uses only public information, and it can be
   performed by the creator of the pre-conversion KT-IV signature, the
   verifier of the post-conversion KT-I signature, or by any other
   entity.

   An implementation MAY use this method to compute KT-I signatures.

   This subsection is not normative for this specification and is
   provided only as background information.

   [<a id="ref-HMP1994" name="ref-HMP1994">HMP1994</a>] presents many generalizations of ElGamal signatures.
   Equation (5) of that reference shows the general signature equation

      A = x_A * B + k * C (mod q)

   where x_A is the private key, k is the secret value, and A, B, and C
   are determined by the Type of the equation, as shown in Table 1 of
   [<a href="#ref-HMP1994" title='"Meta-ElGamal signature schemes"'>HMP1994</a>].  DSA [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title='"DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD"'>FIPS186</a>] is an EG-I.1 signature method (as is KT-I),
   with A = m, B = -r, and C = s.  (Here we use the notation of
   [<a href="#ref-HMP1994" title='"Meta-ElGamal signature schemes"'>HMP1994</a>] in which the first signature component is r and the second
   signature component is s; in KT-I and KT-IV these components are
   denoted as s1 and s2, respectively.  The private key x_A corresponds
   to the private key z.)  Its signature equation is

      m = -r * z + s * k (mod q).

   The signature method of [<a href="#ref-KT1994" title='"Digital signature system based on elliptic curve and signer device and verifier device for said system"'>KT1994</a>] and <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a> is an EG-IV.1
   method, with A = m * s, B = -r * s, C = 1.  Its signature equation is

      m * s = -r * s * z + k (mod q)

   The functions f and g mentioned in Table 1 of [<a href="#ref-HMP1994" title='"Meta-ElGamal signature schemes"'>HMP1994</a>] are merely
   multiplication, as described under the heading "Fifth
   generalization".

   In the above equations, we rely on the implicit conversion of the
   message m from a bit string to an integer.  No hash function is shown
   in these equations, but, as described in <a href="#section-10.4">Section 10.4</a>, a hash
   function should be applied to the message prior to signing in order
   to prevent existential forgery attacks.

   Nyberg and Rueppel [<a href="#ref-NR1994" title='"Message Recovery for Signature Schemes Based on the Discrete Logarithm Problem"'>NR1994</a>] studied many different ElGamal signature
   methods and defined "strong equivalence" as follows:

      Two signature methods are called strongly equivalent if the
      signature of the first scheme can be transformed efficiently into
      signatures of the second scheme and vice versa, without knowledge
      of the private key.

   KT-I and KT-IV signatures are obviously strongly equivalent.

   A valid signature with s2=0 leaks the secret key, since in that case
   z = -h(m) / s1 mod q.  We follow [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title='"DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD"'>FIPS186</a>] in checking for this
   exceptional case and the case that s1=0.  The s2=0 check was
   suggested by Rivest [<a href="#ref-R1992" title='"Response to the proposed DSS"'>R1992</a>] and is discussed in [<a href="#ref-BS1992" title='"Response to Comments on the NIST Proposed Digital Signature Standard"'>BS1992</a>].

   [<a id="ref-KT1994" name="ref-KT1994">KT1994</a>] uses "a positive integer q' that does not exceed q" when
   computing the signature component s1 from the x-coordinate r_x of the
   elliptic curve point R = (r_x, r_y).  The value q' is also used
   during signature validation when comparing the x-coordinate of a

   A method for the conversion between integers and octet strings is
   specified in this section, following the established conventions of
   public key cryptography [<a href="#ref-R1993" title='"PKCS#1: RSA Encryption Standard"'>R1993</a>].  This method allows integers to be
   represented as octet strings that are suitable for transmission or
   storage.  This method SHOULD be used when representing an elliptic
   curve point or an elliptic curve coordinate as they are defined in
   this note.

   The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is based on the discrete

   It is essential to validate the implementation of a cryptographic
   algorithm.  This section outlines tests that should be performed on
   the algorithms defined in this note.

   A known answer test, or KAT, uses a fixed set of inputs to test an
   algorithm; the output of the algorithm is compared with the expected
   output, which is also a fixed value.  KATs for ECDH and KT-I are set
   out in the following subsections.

   A consistency test generates inputs for one algorithm being tested
   using a second algorithm that is also being tested, then checks the
   output of the first algorithm.  A signature creation algorithm can be
   tested for consistency against a signature verification algorithm.
   Implementations of KT-I should be tested in this way.  Their
   signature generation processes are non-deterministic, and thus cannot
   be tested using a KAT.  Signature verification algorithms, on the
   other hand, are deterministic and should be tested via a KAT.  This
   combination of tests provides coverage for all of the operations,
   including keypair generation.  Consistency testing should also be
   applied to ECDH.

   The security level of an elliptic curve cryptosystem is determined by
   the cryptanalytic algorithm that is the least expensive for an
   attacker to implement.  There are several algorithms to consider.

   The Pohlig-Hellman method is a divide-and-conquer technique [<a href="#ref-PH1978" title='"An Improved Algorithm for Computing Logarithms over GF(p) and its Cryptographic Significance"'>PH1978</a>].
   If the group order n can be factored as

      n = q1 * q2 * ... * qz,

   then the discrete log problem over the group can be solved by
   independently solving a discrete log problem in groups of order q1,
   q2, ..., qz, then combining the results using the Chinese remainder
   theorem.  The overall computational cost is dominated by that of the
   discrete log problem in the subgroup with the largest order.

   Shanks' algorithm [<a href="#ref-K1981v3" title='"The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 3: Sorting and Searching"'>K1981v3</a>] computes a discrete logarithm in a group
   of order n using O(sqrt(n)) operations and O(sqrt(n)) storage.  The
   Pollard rho algorithm [<a href="#ref-P1978" title='"Monte Carlo methods for index computation mod p"'>P1978</a>] computes a discrete logarithm in a
   group of order n using O(sqrt(n)) operations, with a negligible
   amount of storage, and can be efficiently parallelized [<a href="#ref-VW1994" title='"Parallel Collision Search with Application to Hash Functions and Discrete Logarithms"'>VW1994</a>].

   The Pollard lambda algorithm [<a href="#ref-P1978" title='"Monte Carlo methods for index computation mod p"'>P1978</a>] can solve the discrete logarithm
   problem using O(sqrt(w)) operations and O(log(w)) storage, when the
   exponent is known to lie in an interval of width w.

   The algorithms described above work in any group.  There are
   specialized algorithms that specifically target elliptic curve
   groups.  There are no known subexponential algorithms against general
   elliptic curve groups, though there are methods that target certain
   special elliptic curve groups; see [<a href="#ref-MOV1993" title='"Reducing Elliptic Curve Logarithms to Logarithms in a Finite Field"'>MOV1993</a>] and [<a href="#ref-FR1994" title='"A remark concerning m-divisibility and the discrete logarithm in the divisor class group of curves."'>FR1994</a>].

   A group consisting of a nonempty set of elements S with associated
   group operation * is a subgroup of the group with the set of elements
   G, if the latter group uses the same group operation and S is a
   subset of G.  For each elliptic curve equation, there is an elliptic
   curve group whose group order is equal to the order of the elliptic
   curve; that is, there is a group that contains every point on the
   curve.

   The order m of the elliptic curve is divisible by the order n of the
   group associated with the generator; that is, for each elliptic curve
   group, m = n * c for some number c.  The number c is called the
   "cofactor" [<a href="#ref-P1363" title='"Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography"'>P1363</a>].  Each ECC parameter set as in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> is
   associated with a particular cofactor.

   It is possible and desirable to use a cofactor equal to 1.

   Note that the key exchange protocol as defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> does not
   protect against active attacks; Party A must use some method to
   ensure that (g^k) originated with the intended communicant B, rather
   than an attacker, and Party B must do the same with (g^j).

   It is not sufficient to authenticate the shared secret g^(j*k), since
   this leaves the protocol open to attacks that manipulate the public
   keys.  Instead, the values of the public keys g^x and g^y that are
   exchanged should be directly authenticated.  This is the strategy
   used by protocols that build on Diffie-Hellman and that use end-
   entity authentication to protect against active attacks, such as
   OAKLEY [<a href="rfc2412.html" title='"The OAKLEY Key Determination Protocol"'>RFC2412</a>] and the Internet Key Exchange [<a href="rfc2409.html" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>RFC2409</a>] [<a href="rfc4306.html" title='"Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol"'>RFC4306</a>]
   [<a href="rfc5996.html" title='"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC5996</a>].

   When the cofactor of a group is not equal to 1, there are a number of
   attacks that are possible against ECDH.  See [<a href="#ref-VW1996" title='"On Diffie-Hellman key agreement with short exponents"'>VW1996</a>], [<a href="#ref-AV1996" title="&quot;Minding Your P's and Q's&quot;">AV1996</a>], and
   [<a href="#ref-LL1997" title='"A Key Recovery Attack on Discrete Log-based Schemes Using a Prime Order Subgroup"'>LL1997</a>].

   The elliptic curve group operation does not explicitly incorporate
   the parameter b from the curve equation.  This opens the possibility
   that a malicious attacker could learn information about an ECDH
   private key by submitting a bogus public key [<a href="#ref-BMM2000" title='"Differential fault analysis on elliptic curve cryptosystems"'>BMM2000</a>].  An attacker
   can craft an elliptic curve group G' that has identical parameters to
   a group G that is being used in an ECDH protocol, except that b is
   different.  An attacker can submit a point on G' into a run of the
   ECDH protocol that is using group G, and gain information from the
   fact that the group operations using the private key of the device
   under attack are effectively taking place in G' instead of G.

   This attack can gain useful information about an ECDH private key
   that is associated with a static public key, i.e., a public key that
   is used in more than one run of the protocol.  However, it does not
   gain any useful information against ephemeral keys.

   This sort of attack is thwarted if an ECDH implementation does not
   assume that each pair of coordinates in Zp is actually a point on the
   appropriate elliptic curve.

   These considerations also apply when ECDH is used with compact
   representation (see <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>).

   Elliptic curve parameters should only be used if they come from a
   trusted source; otherwise, some attacks are possible [<a href="#ref-AV1996" title="&quot;Minding Your P's and Q's&quot;">AV1996</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-V1996" title='"Hidden Collisions on DSS"'>V1996</a>].

   If no hash function is used in an ElGamal signature system, then the
   system is vulnerable to existential forgeries, in which an attacker
   who does not know a private key can generate valid signatures for the
   associated public key, but cannot generate a signature for a message
   of its own choosing.  (See [<a href="#ref-E1985" title='"A public key cryptosystem and a signature scheme based on discrete logarithms"'>E1985</a>] for instance.)  The use of a
   collision-resistant hash function eliminates this vulnerability.

   In principle, any collision-resistant hash function is suitable for
   use in KT signatures.  To facilitate interoperability, we recognize
   the following hashes as suitable for use as the function H defined in
   <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>:

      SHA-256, which has a 256-bit output.

      SHA-384, which has a 384-bit output.

      SHA-512, which has a 512-bit output.

   All of these hash functions are defined in [<a href="#ref-FIPS180-2" title='"SECURE HASH STANDARD"'>FIPS180-2</a>].

   The number of bits in the output of the hash used in KT signatures
   should be equal or close to the number of bits needed to represent
   the group order.

   1.  MUST - This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", means that
       the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   2.  MUST NOT - This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", means that the
       definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.

   3.  SHOULD - This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", means that
       there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to
       ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be
       understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different
       course.

   4.  SHOULD NOT - This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED", means
       that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
       when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but
       the full implications should be understood and the case carefully

   5.  MAY - This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", means that an item
       is truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item
       because a particular marketplace requires it or because the
       vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor
       may omit the same item.  An implementation which does not include
       a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another
       implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with
       reduced functionality.  In the same vein an implementation which
       does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate
       with another implementation which does not include the option

   It is easy to generate an integer uniformly at random between zero
   and (2^t)-1, inclusive, for some positive integer t.  Generate a
   random bit string that contains exactly t bits, and then convert the
   bit string to a non-negative integer by treating the bits as the
   coefficients in a base-2 expansion of an integer.

   It is sometimes necessary to generate an integer r uniformly at
   random so that r satisfies a certain property P, for example, lying
   within a certain interval.  A simple way to do this is with the
   rejection method:

   1.  Generate a candidate number c uniformly at random from a set that
       includes all numbers that satisfy property P (plus some other
       numbers, preferably not too many)

   2.  If c satisfies property P, then return c.  Otherwise, return to
       Step 1.

   For example, to generate a number between 1 and n-1, inclusive,
   repeatedly generate integers between zero and (2^t)-1, inclusive,
   stopping at the first integer that falls within that interval.

   Recommendations on how to generate random bit strings are provided in
   [<a href="rfc4086.html" title='"Randomness Requirements for Security"'>RFC4086</a>].

   In the affine representation, the x-coordinate of the point P^i does
   not depend on the y-coordinate of the point P, for any non-negative
   exponent i and any point P.  This fact can be seen as follows.  When
   given only the x-coordinate of a point P, it is not possible to
   determine exactly what the y-coordinate is, but the y value will be a
   solution to the curve equation

      y^2 = x^3 + a*x + b (mod p).

   There are at most two distinct solutions y = w and y = -w mod p, and
   the point P must be either Q=(x,w) or Q^-1=(x,-w).  Thus P^n is equal
   to either Q^n or (Q^-1)^n = (Q^n)^-1.  These values have the same
   x-coordinate.  Thus, the x-coordinate of a point P^i can be computed
   from the x-coordinate of a point P by computing one of the possible
   values of the y coordinate of P, then computing the ith power of P,
   and then ignoring the y-coordinate of that result.

   In general, it is possible to compute a square root modulo p by using
   Shanks' method [<a href="#ref-K1981v2" title='"The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2: Seminumerical Algorithms"'>K1981v2</a>]; simple methods exist for some values of p.
   When p = 3 (mod 4), the square roots of z mod p are w and -w mod p,
   where

      w = z ^ ((p+1)/4) (mod p);

   this observation is due to Lehmer [<a href="#ref-L1969" title='"Computer technology applied to the theory of numbers"'>L1969</a>].  When p satisfies this
   property, y can be computed from the curve equation, and either y = w
   or y = -w mod p, where

      w = (x^3 + a*x + b)^((p+1)/4) (mod p).

   Square roots modulo p only exist for a quadratic residue modulo p,
   [<a href="#ref-R1988" title='"A Course in Number Theory"'>R1988</a>]; if z is not a quadratic residue, then there is no number w
   such that w^2 = z (mod p).  A simple way to verify that z is a
   quadratic residue after computing w is to verify that
   w * w = z (mod p).  If this relation does not hold for the above
   equation, then the value x is not a valid x-coordinate for a valid
   elliptic curve point.  This is an important consideration when ECDH
   is used with compact output; see <a href="#section-10.3">Section 10.3</a>.

   The primes used in the P-256, P-384, and P-521 curves described in
   [<a href="rfc5903.html" title='"Elliptic Curve Groups modulo a Prime (ECP Groups) for IKE and IKEv2"'>RFC5903</a>] all have the property that p = 3 (mod 4).

   provide a 128-bit security level.  We use the notation of
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>, and express the generator in the affine coordinate

   To an arbitrary pair of elliptic curve points P and Q specified by
   their affine coordinates P=(x1,y1) and Q=(x2,y2), the group operation
   assigns a third point R = P*Q with the coordinates (x3,y3).  These
   coordinates are computed as follows:

     if P is (@,@),
        R = Q
     else if Q is (@,@),
        R = P
     else if P is not equal to Q and x1 is equal to x2,
        R = (@,@)
     else if P is not equal to Q and x1 is not equal to x2,
        x3 = ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1))^2 - x1 - x2 mod p and
        y3 = (x1-x3)*(y2-y1)/(x2-x1) - y1 mod p
     else if P is equal to Q and y1 is equal to 0,
        R = (@,@)
     else    // P is equal to Q and y1 is not equal to 0
        x3 = ((3*x1^2 + a)/(2*y1))^2 - 2*x1 mod p and
        y3 = (x1-x3)*(3*x1^2 + a)/(2*y1) - y mod p.

   From the first and second case, it follows that the point at infinity
   is the neutral element of this operation, which is its own inverse.

   From the curve equation, it follows that for a given curve point P =
   (x,y) distinct from the point at infinity, (x,-y) also is a curve
   point, and from the third and the fifth case it follows that this is
   the inverse of P, P^-1.

   Note: The fifth and sixth case are known as "point squaring".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/F.2.%20%20Homogeneous%20Coordinates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-F.2" name="appendix-F.2">F.2</a>.  Homogeneous Coordinates</span>

   An elliptic curve point (x,y) (other than the point at infinity
   (@,@)) is equivalent to a point (X,Y,Z) in homogeneous coordinates
   (with X, Y, and Z in Fp and not all three being zero at once)
   whenever x=X/Z and y=Y/Z. "Homogenous coordinates" means that two
   triples (X,Y,Z) and (X',Y',Z') are regarded as "equal" (i.e.,
   representing the same point) if there is some nonzero s in Fp such
   that X'=s*X, Y'=s*Y, and Z'=s*Z.  The point at infinity (@,@) is
   regarded as equivalent to the homogenous coordinates (0,1,0), i.e.,
   it can be represented by any triple (0,Y,0) with nonzero Y in Fp.

   Let P1=(X1,Y1,Z1) and P2=(X2,Y2,Z2) be points on the elliptic curve,
   and let u = Y2 * Z1 - Y1 * Z2 and v = X2 * Z1 - X1 * Z2.

   We observe that the points P1 and P2 are equal if and only if u and v
   are both equal to zero.  Otherwise, if either P1 or P2 are equal to
   the point at infinity, v is zero and u is nonzero (but the converse
   implication does not hold).

   Then, the product P3=(X3,Y3,Z3) = P1 * P2 is given by:

     if P1 is the point at infinity,
        P3 = P2
     else if P2 is the point at infinity,
        P3 = P1
     else if u is not equal to 0 but v is equal to 0,
        P3 = (0,1,0)
     else if both u and v are not equal to 0,
        X3 = v * (Z2 * (Z1 * u^2 - 2 * X1 * v^2) - v^3)
        Y3 = Z2 * (3 * X1 * u * v^2 - Y1 * v^3 - Z1 * u^3) + u * v^3
        Z3 = v^3 * Z1 * Z2
     else    // P2 equals P1, P3 = P1 * P1
         w = 3 * X1^2 + a * Z1^2
        X3 = 2 * Y1 * Z1 * (w^2 - 8 * X1 * Y1^2 * Z1)
        Y3 = 4 * Y1^2 * Z1 * (3 * w * X1 - 2 * Y1^2 * Z1) - w^3
        Z3 = 8 * (Y1 * Z1)^3

   It thus turns out that the point at infinity is the identity element
   and for P1=(X,Y,Z) not equal to this point at infinity, P2=(X,-Y,Z)
   represents P1^-1.
