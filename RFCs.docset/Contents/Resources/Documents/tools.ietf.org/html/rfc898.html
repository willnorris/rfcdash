NOTES ON THE MEETING

   The MIT C Gateway -- MIT - Martin

      Postel:  A description of the gateway implemented at MIT.  The
      gateway was first developed by Noel Chiappa.  It is written in C.
      The MIT environment has 32 internal networks which are treated as
      subnets of the MITNET on the Internet.  The MIT gateways then do
      subnet routing in their interior protocol.  The subnet routing
      scheme is similar to GGP.  Liza has added an EGP implementation to
      this gateway.

      Muuss:

      Campus network/project Athena
      Dynamic routing
      Congestion control - grad student
                      +---------------+---+
       Class A net  : | 18|subnet|res|host|
                      +---------------+---+

      "Bridges" forward between subnets.

      Campus Network and Project Athena 65 VAX 750s, 200 IBM PCs.

      Hosts: Now = 400, 1986 = 3,000, 1990 = 10,000

      Subnets: Now = 42, 1985 = 60, 1990 = 200, (4 subnets/building)

      Protocols: Internet, DECnet, Chaosnet

      FiberOptic spine between campus buildings.

      MIT gateways:

         11/03s and 11/23s
         68000 on Abus
         6800 on Multibus (Bridge communications)

         MIT C gateway -
         Runs under MOS, bridge OS, homegrown OS. Multiple protocols,
         multiple interfaces.

         11/03 - 100 packets/sec.
         11/23 - 180 packets/sec.

         GGP - Gw/Gw
         EGP - Exterior Gw
         IGP - Interior Gw

         EGP:  Autonomous systems

         EGP:
           Neighbor acquisition
           Hello/I heard you
           Net reachability poll
           Net reachability message

      MIT IGP:

         IP header on EGP protocol
         Dest: net number, subnet number, 0, 0377 (broadcast address)

      IGP header:

         Autonomous system number
         Sequence number
         Tasks:
             Propagate exterior and subnet routing.

             Nets reached

      MIT - Gw broadcasts initial routings when it comes up, and again
      on each change, net is flooded on each change several times. Each
      bridge can ask for help.

Gateway SIG Meeting Notes


      Future:  Wideband net gateway from BBN will also sit on net  18,
      and an MIT routing server to acquire routing information. Trick -
      BBN-Gw will be on an Ethernet, and a modified ARP will be used by
      the bridges to "fool" the BBN gateway into acquiring the routes.

      Subnet Routing - inspired by PUP and CHAOS
         Neighbor Bridge
           Net I/F
           Bridge address
           Latest seq number
           Aging value
         Route to subnet
           Distance

         Packets
           Request
           I'm up

             Route update
               Distance vector (256 bytes)
                       0 - Direct
                       1 -127 - hop count
                       128-255 - "Interface used for next hop" to subnet
                                 and hop count
                       255 - Unreachable

      Problem -
         Many neighbors --&gt; too much time and traffic needed for
      processing.

         3 level addressing and routing strategy
         Ext Gw:
           Routing server
           Default Gw
         Subnet routing
           Small but rich subnet routing updates.

   The Butterfly Gateway -- BBN - Hinden

      Postel:  A description of the butterfly hardware and a discussion
      of the plans for the new gateway software to be implemented on it.
      The butterfly machine is a multiprocessor (MC68000's)
      interconnected with a funny switch.  The new software will
      incorporate the so called "Shortest Path First" or SPF routing
      algorithm.

Gateway SIG Meeting Notes


      Muuss:

      Replacement for existing 30 PDP-11 "core" gateways.
      Problems to be solved.

         o  Replace GGP
              - Routing updates filling up
              - Neighbor probes (N**2)
              - Few buffers

         o  Present GGP updates only hold 70 net numbers, repacking
            data will increase that to approximately 100 nets, but
            this is just short term.

      Features of Butterfly -
         o  1000's of nets
         o  Partitioned nets
         o  Type of service routing, access control
         o  Flow control
         o  Large and small gateway configurations

      New functions -
         o  Routing
         o  Neighbor discovery
         o  Reduce neighbor pinging
         o  Access/departure model
         o  Connect gateways with point-to-point lines

      Routing -
         o  SPF - shortest path first
         o  Gateway based routing (opposed to network routing)
         o  Routing updates
              Gw ID
              &lt;nets directly connected&gt;
              &lt;neighbor, distance&gt;
         o  Updates flooded to other gateways

      Next-door - Neighbors
         o  Neighbor gateways closest to gateway
         o  Ping next-door-neighbors only
         o  For up/down acquisition, partition into rings.  Reduces
            pinging.

      Access/departure model

          First Gw (entrance) picks exit gateway

   The EGP C Gateway -- ISI - Kirton

      Postel:  A user process was installed in Berkeley 4.2 Unix to do
      EGP protocol functions leaving the normal router kernel function
      in charge of forwarding datagrams.  The EGP user process may do
      system calls to update the kernel routing data.  Based on the work
      of Liza Martin.

   The Wisconsin BITNET/CSNET Gateway -- UWisc - Solomon

      Postel:  This was a discussion of a mail relay between the
      Internet and BITNET to be installed at Wisconsin.

      Muuss:

      WISC-IBM (192.5.2.24) will connect to BITNET

      Mail gateway, BITNET uses <a href="rfc822.html">RFC 822</a> headers!

   LAN to X.25 Gateway -- Computer Gateways Inc. - Buhr

      Postel:  This was a description of a protocol translation device
      between an X.25 world and the DATAPOINT ARCNET world.

      Muuss:

      ARCNET to X.25 Bridge

      ARCNET - from Datapoint,
        Baseband coax, 2.5 mbps
        Token passing
        Reserve/send/wait/ack protocol
        RIM chip implements this

      "The OSI models seem less clear than the Internet models, perhaps
      because they are less well developed."

      Wraps the subnetwork in an enhanced subnetwork layer.

      Every pair of subnetworks must be connected in this design - hence
      a bridge not a gateway.

      Bridge is a network layer RELAY.

      ARCNET address is sent as X.25 data

   ISI-UCI Gateway -- UCI - Rose

      Postel:  This was a description of the UCI dumb gateway. This one
      is made up of two hosts (VAX 750s) 50 miles apart.  The VAXs are
      connected via a 9.6 Kbs leased line.  One is interfaced to the
      ISI-NET (an Ethernet) and the other to UCIICS net (also an
      Ethernet).  The VAXs run Berkeley Unix 4.1.  These VAXs run as
      regular hosts too.

      Muuss:

      MTU is 512. Effective bandwidth of approximately 6000 baud over
      9600 baud line.

   FACC Gateway -- FACC - Holkenbrink

      Postel:  A description of a gateway designed by Ford.  The gateway
      is based on a MC68000 multiprocessor and a VME bus.  An
      interesting question that came up during this presentation  was
      "What is the least information a host (or gateway) must have when
      it comes up, and how can it acquire the rest of what it needs to
      go into full operation from the environment?"

      Muuss:

      Inter-segment Processor. M68000 CPU with various co-processors.
      68000 IOPS, 1822, IOP Ethernet IOP. 1 cpu does IP, routing.
      Multi-cpu version of MOS

   Lincoln IP/ST Gateway -- LL - Forgie/Kantrowitz

      Postel:  This was a discussion of the design of the Lincoln
      gateways used primarily in the WBCNET for speech transmission
      research.  This gateway uses special I/O interfaces to promote a
      high packet processing rate.  The gateway implements both the
      regular IP, and the ST protocol which permits resource
      reservations to minimize the variation in transmission delay.
      These gateways can, of course, act as regular internet gateways,
      and have achieved very good performance in terms of datagrams per
      second.

      Muuss:

      Packet voice experiments, wideband SATNET. Concentrate traffic
      from local nets to trunk net. Needed enough performance to load
      WBSATNET. 11/44 and ACC IF11 (Z-80). T1 trunk protocol converter.
      (voice T1 &lt;--&gt; datagram)

      Nbytes of M messages every INTERVAL. Reservations are absolute.

      ST and IP for each distant run = MPP multipurpose packets.

      12,000 lines of C code in 11/44 portion.

   Minimal Stub Gateways -- MITRE - Nabielsky

      Postel:  This was a more abstract discussion of how stub gateways
      could interact and acquire information about the topology of the
      Internet.

      Muuss:

      Ethernet stub to Internet

      Alternative to ARP using Multicast

   SPF routing -- BBN - Seamonson

      Postel:  This was a fine presentation of the principles of the
      "Shortest Path First" (SPF) routing procedures with some remarks
      on how it is tailored to the Internet gateway situation.  One
      point that was impressed on me was that when using SPF in a set of
      gateways (say, the core autonomous system) the procedure will do
      routing to an "exit" gateway.  Somehow I had not thought about it
      in those terms before, but (obviously) just as there is a source
      and a destination IMP in the ARPANET there will be an entrance and
      an exit gateway in an SPF autonomous system.

      Muuss:

      Features -
        Metric, update procedures, path calculation, forwarding

      Current GGP problems -
        o   Counting to infinity
        o   Not enough topology information in each Gw
        o   Updates potentially very large

      SPF in ARPANET
        o   Single path (not optimal) - no split of flow
        o   Delay based, to minimize delay
        o   Global knowledge of connection topology and delays

      Metric used -
        o   Delay, delay of each packet averaged
              (queueing plus transmission plus propagation)
              arrival-to-arrival time.
        o   Average delay on each trunk computed every 9.6 seconds.
            Report large changes in delay, fast

      Update procedure -
        o   Updates report delay to each neighbor
        o   Update triggered by topology change, significant delay
            change, or 1 time/minute.
            Decay of threshold to direct to send update
        o   Sequence numbers
        o   Flooding on all trunks sent out on all lines
        o   Receipt of echo is acknowledgement
        o   Retransmission
        o   Aging of information
        o   Updates are 2*n*l packet growth.  n = number imps,
            l = number lines

      Then tree is inverted into a "go here to get to this destination."

      For Internet -

          Similar algorithm, needs special packet header to
          indicate "exit" gateway to get to destination network.

         Update procedure -
            Neighbor interface, neighbors, and delay to neighbor.

   Multiple Constraint Routing -- SRI - Shacham

      Postel:  This was a clear presentation of some of the consequences
      of the idea of type of service routing.  The level of complexity
      of the routing procedure is determined to depend on how many
      catagories of service there are and how many selections there are
      in each catagory.  A few examples were discussed including the
      current type of service parameters of IP.

      Muuss:

      Both current and proposed ARPANET algorithms provide "best" path
      under single constraint (number of hops, delay).
      Internet will have diverse characteristics, it would be nice to
      consider more than one constraint.

        o   Determine a set of measures.
        o   Represent each measure as a single number.
        o   Determine range of values.  (complexity 0(c**n) range of n)
        o   Define path measure as a function of measure of length.
             sum (delay, cost)
             min/capacity, length, security)

      If just one cost is used, then SPF (or whatever) can be used for
      each cost.  However, under multiple constraints there is a more
      difficult problem. e.g.:  minimum delay with packet size of at
      least 1000 bytes.

      RUMC has been shown to be in the NP complete family.

      RUMC needs bigger tables, more processing and routing overhead.
      Its not awful for 2-choice TOS, like in IP.

      Table size is random, we have to be prepared for the worst case.

      Possible strategies:  flood a "search packet," dropped when

      constraints are not met, see if it makes it though. Good only for
      virtual circuit. Weighted sum (VC only) works only with some
      probability.

      TOS is needed for Internet, but the algorithms are costly.
      Complexity for providing TOS IP style is not too high.

   FACC Multinet Gateway Routing -- FACC - Cook

      Postel:  This approach considered hop count to be an inadequate
      metric for routing decsions in a system of different types of
      networks (e.g., Ethernets, ARPANETs, 2.4Kb lines).  Delay was
      selected as the metric to use.  There are some interesting issues
      in the measurement of delay for some types of networks.  Also, the
      design considers the use of multiple paths when they are avaiable,
      and routing to provide connectivty between the parts of
      partitioned networks.

      Muuss:

      Routing with a single constraint.
      A network of gateways Access, Transport, or Dual networks.
      Some networks are used as backbones between gateways only.

      Routing updates
        Variable length
        Broadcast routing updates

      Unitary ends - A - Gw - B - Rest
         Routing for A is really just routing to B
         Neighbor Gws, nets
         Lots and lots of tables

   Metanet Gateway -- SRI - Denny

      Postel:  This is a project to invent several new addressing
      features for gateways.  In particular, there is a scheme to use an
      option much like the source route option to do multi-addressing of
      IP datagrams.  It seems as if the gateways that implement this
      option will have to know which other gateways do and don't
      implement it.  Also, there was discussion of a gateway to a
      network that is in radio silence, and how to keep TCP connections
      going with hosts that can't talk.  This project is also concerned
      about network reconstitution, security, survivability, congestion
      control, and supporting multimedia data (voice, bitmaps, etc.) in
      applications.  A gateway is being developed in ADA for a MC68000
      machine (SUN), and the initial version of the gateway is to be up
      in May 84.

   Design of the FACC Multinet Gateway -- FACC - Cook

      Postel:  This is a distributed multiprocessor machine using a
      special bus network for the interprocessor communication.  The
      softaware is written in C.  The gateways is in an early test
      phase.

      Muuss:

      RADC program

      Started with AUTODIN II, switched to DDN.
      Small to large switching devices.
      DoD uses of PDNs, and partitioned network problems.

      Distributed processing architecture -
        Parallel contention, 90M bps bus, 22 wires. Each node has cpu,
        memory, optimal comm line. Wire - OR presentation of address,
        contention happens each time bus becomes free, all requestors
        put out type of msg, pri, and address.   Reads back wire - OR of
        result, and highest gwy wins, sorted by (pri, type, higher
      addr).
        Bus was originally designed for our FAA fail-soft application
        Z-800l w/MMU. Not binary addressing, but unitary (base1)
      One element resolved per bus transaction.
      Boards may be plugged in while running.
      Inherent parallelism in layered protocols.

      Interface connector clues board to modem levels and date rate.  Up
      to 100K bps now, soon up to T1 rate.

      Multiprocessor approach allows routing calculation to take place
      out-of-band from the measurement of delay and traffic, and allows
      use of more compute power for routing.

      Mostly written in C, with some assembler.  Multiprocessor
      operating system, designed from scratch.

   SAC Gateway -- SRI - Su/Lewis

      Postel:  This was a presentation of the design for the gateways to
      be used in the advanced SAC demo experiments on network
      partitioning and reconstitution, and communication between
      intermingiling mobile networks.  Much of these demonstrations will
      be done with packet radio units and networks.  Some of the ideas
      are to use a gateway-centered type of addressing and double
      encapsulation (i.e., an extra IP header) to route datagrams.

      Muuss:

      Network dynamics due to component mobility or failure.
      Mobile host, reconstitution, partitioning.
        H/W:  11/23
        S/W:  Some "C" gateway
        OS:   VMOS (SRI)

      Gateway-centered addressing, rather than network.
        Gw host instead of net.host.
      Double encapsulation:  additional IP header.
        TCP uses addr as an ID, IP uses it as an ADDRESS (-&gt; route)
        Need to separate these dual uses of this address field.
      Incremental Routing (next-hop indication)

   EGP -- Linkabit - Mills

      Postel:  A presentation of the EGP design.  EGP has three major
      aspects, neighbor acquisition, neighbor reachability, and network
      reachability.  The autonomous system concept was discussed.

      Muuss:

      Background, Implementation, Experience, Disparaging Remarks

      Design goals -
        o   Established demarcations
        o   Decouple implementations
        o   Confine routing loops
        o   Exchange reachability information
        o   Provide flow control for connectivity information
        o   Medium-term lifetime

      Non goals                       Not trying to do these!
        o   Flexibility of topology
        o   Rapid response             Very slow update

      EGP neighbors do not need to peer with more than one
      CORE gateway, but you may peer with anybody you wish.

      Shortcomings -

         o   Tree-structured routing constraint
           - Rigid topology

      time, and are a real no-no.

      System models -
         o   "Appropriate first hop" criterion
           - Not useful for implementation
           - Requires global information
           - Inadequate for verification

   Congestion Control -- FACC - Nagle

Gateway SIG Meeting Notes


      Muuss:

      First principle of congestion control:

         DON'T DROP PACKETS (unless absolutely necessary)

      Second principle:

         Hosts must behave themselves (or else)

         Enemies list -

            1.  TOPS-20 TCP from DEC
            2.  VAX/UNIX 4.2 from Berkeley

      Third principle:

         Memory won't help (beyond a certain point).

         The small packet problem: Big packets are good, small are bad
         (big = 576).

      Suggested fix: Rule: When the user writes to TCP, initiate a send
      only if there are NO outstanding packets on the connection. [good
      for TELNET, at least] (or if you fill a segment). No change when
      Acks come back. Assumption is that there is a pipe-like buffer
      between the user and the TCP.

      The source quench problem Rule: When a TCP gets an ICMP Source
      Quench, it must reduce the number of outstanding datagrams on
      relevant TCP connections.

      Rule: When a gateway nears overload, before starting to drop
      packets, send a Source Quench.

      Node capacity: Each node ought to have one buffer for each TCP
      connection, plus some for overload.

      Both fixes really need to be done together, although the first one
      is often helpful by itself. Side effect: FTPs start off "slowly,"
      until the first Ack comes back Dave Mills thinks this will
      increase the mean delay for medium-size interactions. This
      probably will not work so well for SATNET.

      Problems about propagation time of links biasing the validity of
      this result!!

   A Gateway Congestion Control Policy--NW Systems - Niznik

      Postel:  This talk was (for Postel) hard to follow.  There were a
      number of references to well known results in queuing theory etc,
      but I could not follow how they were being used.

      Muuss:

      Replacements for IMP SPF
      Topological observations
      Nodal congestion control policy
        GMD - control application [from German network]
        RPN - relational Petri net
        DCT - dynamic congestion table
      NCCP performance evaluation
      Planned GCCP:  Gateway congestion control policy

      Lots of diagrams and figures.

      Better throughput than SPF, but somewhat higher delay.

      Cubic structure of table.

   DISCUSSION (Postel's personal comments)

      There was very little organized discussion during the meeting and
      not really very much question and answer interaction during the
      presentation.  There was a lot of discussion during the breaks,
      and at lunch time, and at the end of each day.

      Some things that occured to me during the meeting that may have
      been triggered by something someone said (or maybe by the view out
      the window):

         Don't design a protocol where you expect to get a lot of
         messages from a lot of sources at the same time.  For example,
         don't ask all the hosts on an Ethernet to send you an ack to a
         broadcast packet.

         Has anyone worked out in detail the routing traffic costs for
         the GGP vs the SPF procedures for the actual case of the
         Internet?

         How will the fact that thinking of the routing in the core
         autonomous system is cast in terms of an entry and an exit
         gateway effect other things?  Will there be special

         arrangements between the entry and exit gateway?  Will an
         autonomous system become a circuit switch connecting pairs of
         entry/exit gateways?

         Is TOS routing worth the cost?

         Should we allow (as a new type of ICMP message) redirects to
         Gateways?

         Does making memory larger ever hurt?  If a gateway's memory is
         full of inappropriately retransmitted TCP segments would it be
         better if there were less memory?

         Is there something reasonable to do with source quench at the
         TCP?  Re: <a href="rfc896.html">RFC-896</a>.

         If there are links (or networks) of vastly differing delay and
         thruput characteristics what impact would an IP level load
         splitting (say by gateways) have on TCP connections (some of
         the segments of the connection go one path and others go a
         different path)?

         Are any problems avoided (either way) by using double IP
         headers vs a "source route like" IP option to separate the IP
