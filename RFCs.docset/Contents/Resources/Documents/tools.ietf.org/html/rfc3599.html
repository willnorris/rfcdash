                                        Subaddress Extension

On email systems that allow for "subaddressing" or "detailed addressing"
(e.g., "ken+sieve@example.org"), it is sometimes desirable to make
comparisons against these sub-parts of addresses.  This document defines
an extension to the Sieve mail filtering language that allows users to
compare against the user and detail parts of an address.  [STANDARDS

This document defines the changes that need to be made to the Domain
Name System (DNS) to support hosts running IP version 6 (IPv6).  The
changes include a resource record type to store an IPv6 address, a
domain to support lookups based on an IPv6 address, and updated
definitions of existing query types that return Internet addresses as
part of additional section processing.  The extensions are designed to
be compatible with existing applications and, in particular, DNS
implementations themselves.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

                                        Information Model

This document presents an object-oriented information model of IP
Security (IPsec) policy designed to facilitate agreement about the
content and semantics of IPsec policy, and enable derivations of task-
specific representations of IPsec policy such as storage schema,
distribution representations, and policy specification languages used to
configure IPsec-enabled endpoints.  The information model described in
this document models the configuration parameters defined by IPSec.  The
information model also covers the parameters found by the Internet Key
Exchange protocol (IKE).  Other key exchange protocols could easily be
added to the information model by a simple extension.  Further
extensions can further be added easily due to the object-oriented nature
of the model.

This information model is based upon the core policy classes as defined
in the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) and in the Policy Core
Information Model Extensions (PCIMe).  [STANDARDS TRACK]

Mobile IP ensures correct routing of packets to a mobile node as the
mobile node changes its point of attachment to the Internet.  However,
it is also required to provide proper Quality of Service (QoS)

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) operates over UDP and TCP, among
others.  When used with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the
source address the request came from, and to the port written into the
topmost Via header field value of the request.  This behavior is not
desirable in many cases, most notably, when the client is behind a
Network Address Translator (NAT).  This extension defines a new
parameter for the Via header field, called "rport", that allows a client
to request that the server send the response back to the source IP
address and port from which the request originated.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

                                        Protocol (L2TP)

The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) defines a mechanism for tunneling
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) sessions.  It is common for these PPP
sessions to be established using modems connected over the public
switched telephone network.

One of the standards governing modem operation defines procedures that
enable a client modem to put the call on hold and later, re-establish
the modem link with minimal delay and without having to redial.  While
the modem call is on hold, the client phone line can be used to place or
receive other calls.

The L2TP base protocol does not provide any means to signal these events
from the L2TP Access Controller (LAC), where the modem is physically
connected, to the L2TP Network Server (LNS), where the PPP session is
handled.

This document describes a method to let the LNS know when a client modem
connected to a LAC has placed the call on hold.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

                                        Cryptographic Authentication

This document describes the authentication of Intermediate System to
Intermediate System (IS-IS) Protocol Data Units (PDUs) using the Hashed
Message Authentication Codes - Message Digest 5 (HMAC-MD5) algorithm as
found in <a href="rfc2104.html">RFC 2104</a>.  IS-IS is specified in International Standards
Organization (ISO) 10589, with extensions to support Internet Protocol
version 4 (IPv4) described in <a href="rfc1195.html">RFC 1195</a>.  The base specification includes
an authentication mechanism that allows for multiple authentication
algorithms.  The base specification only specifies the algorithm for
cleartext passwords.

This document proposes an extension to that specification that allows
the use of the HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm to be used in
conjunction with the existing authentication mechanisms.  This memo
provides information for the Internet community.

A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a key-dependent one way hash
function.  One popular way to construct a MAC algorithm is to use a
block cipher in conjunction with the Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) mode of
operation.  The classic CBC-MAC algorithm, while secure for messages of
a pre-selected fixed length, has been shown to be insecure across
messages of varying lengths such as the type found in typical IP
datagrams.  This memo specifies the use of AES in CBC mode with a set of
extensions to overcome this limitation.  This new algorithm is named
AES-XCBC-MAC-96.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

A problem statement is first provided.  Then, the document describes
example applications scenarios identified by Service Providers where
existing MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms fall short and

The Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol is intended
for use by mobile nodes in an ad hoc network.  It offers quick
adaptation to dynamic link conditions, low processing and memory
overhead, low network utilization, and determines unicast routes to
destinations within the ad hoc network.  It uses destination sequence
numbers to ensure loop freedom at all times (even in the face of
anomalous delivery of routing control messages), avoiding problems (such
as "counting to infinity") associated with classical distance vector
protocols.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet

                                        Real-Time Applications

This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP
provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for
applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or
simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does
not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of-
service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a
control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a
manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal
control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to
be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The
protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.

Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to <a href="rfc1889.html">RFC 1889</a> which it
obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only
changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.
The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for
calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission
in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session
simultaneously.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

This document describes extensions that may be used to add functionality

mechanisms for the TLS handshake client and server hellos, and specific
extensions using these generic mechanisms.

The extensions may be used by TLS clients and servers.  The extensions
are backwards compatible - communication is possible between TLS 1.0

This document describes a header compression scheme for point to point
links with packet loss and long delays.  It is based on Compressed
Real-time Transport Protocol (CRTP), the IP/UDP/RTP header compression
described in <a href="rfc2508.html">RFC 2508</a>.  CRTP does not perform well on such links: packet
loss results in context corruption and due to the long delay, many more
packets are discarded before the context is repaired.  To correct the
behavior of CRTP over such links, a few extensions to the protocol are
specified here.  The extensions aim to reduce context corruption by
changing the way the compressor updates the context at the decompressor:
updates are repeated and include updates to full and differential
context parameters.  With these extensions, CRTP performs well over
links with packet loss, packet reordering and long delays.  [STANDARDS

some portable interfaces for applications that use raw sockets under

path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) information.  This document

(DHCPv4).  The giaddr specifies an IP address which determines both a
subnet, and thereby a link on which a Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) client resides as well as an IP address that can be used
to communicate with the relay agent.  The subnet-selection option allows
the functions of the giaddr to be split so that when one entity is
performing as a DHCP proxy, it can specify the subnet/link from which to
allocate an IP address, which is different from the IP address with
which it desires to communicate with the DHCP server.  Analogous
situations exist where the relay agent needs to specify the subnet/link
on which a DHCP client resides, which is different from an IP address
that can be used to communicate with the relay agent.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

The Eifel detection algorithm allows a TCP sender to detect a posteriori
whether it has entered loss recovery unnecessarily.  It requires that
the TCP Timestamps option defined in <a href="rfc1323.html">RFC 1323</a> be enabled for a
connection.  The Eifel detection algorithm makes use of the fact that
the TCP Timestamps option eliminates the retransmission ambiguity in
TCP.  Based on the timestamp of the first acceptable ACK that arrives
during loss recovery, it decides whether loss recovery was entered
unnecessarily.  The Eifel detection algorithm provides a basis for
future TCP enhancements.  This includes response algorithms to back out
of loss recovery by restoring a TCP sender's congestion control state.

                                        with Media Authorization

Establishing multimedia streams must take into account requirements for
end-to-end QoS, authorization of network resource usage and accurate
accounting for resources used.  During session set up, policies may be
enforced to ensure that the media streams being requested lie within the
bounds of the service profile established for the requesting host.
Similarly, when a host requests resources to provide a certain QoS for a
packet flow, policies may be enforced to ensure that the required
resources lie within the bounds of the resource profile established for
the requesting host.

To prevent fraud and to ensure accurate billing, this document describes
various scenarios and mechanisms that provide the linkage required to
verify that the resources being used to provide a requested QoS are in-
line with the media streams requested (and authorized) for the session.

This document describes the representation of a session authorization
policy element for supporting policy-based per-session authorization and
admission control.  The goal of session authorization is to allow the
exchange of information between network elements in order to authorize
the use of resources for a service and to co-ordinate actions between
the signaling and transport planes.  This document describes how a
process on a system authorizes the reservation of resources by a host
and then provides that host with a session authorization policy element
which can be inserted into a resource reservation protocol (e.g., the
Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) PATH message) to facilitate proper
and secure reservation of those resources within the network.  We
describe the encoding of session authorization information as a policy
element conforming to the format of a Policy Data object (<a href="rfc2750.html">RFC 2750</a>) and

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state intra-domain routing
protocol used for routing in IP networks.  Though the definition of the
Area Border Router (ABR) in the OSPF specification does not require a
router with multiple attached areas to have a backbone connection, it is
actually necessary to provide successful routing to the inter-area and
external destinations.  If this requirement is not met, all traffic
destined for the areas not connected to such an ABR or out of the OSPF
domain, is dropped.  This document describes alternative ABR behaviors

ICAP servers for some sort of transformation or other processing
("adaptation").  The server executes its transformation service on
messages and sends back responses to the client, usually with modified
messages.  Typically, the adapted messages are either HTTP requests or
HTTP responses.  This memo provides information for the Internet

Crediting loyalty points and collecting digital coupons or gift
certificates are common functions in purchasing and trading
transactions.  These activities can be generalized using the concept of
a "voucher", which is a digital representation of the right to claim
goods or services.  This document presents a Voucher Trading System
(VTS) that circulates vouchers securely and its terminology; it lists
design principles and requirements for VTS and the Generic Voucher
Language (GVL), with which diverse types of vouchers can be described.

                                        Protocol (IMAP)

The Message Disposition Notification (MDN) facility defined in <a href="rfc2298.html">RFC 2298</a>
provides a means by which a message can request that message processing
by the recipient be acknowledged as well as a format to be used for such
acknowledgements.  However, it doesn't describe how multiple Mail User
Agents (MUAs) should handle the generation of MDNs in an Internet
Message Access Protocol (IMAP4) environment.

                                        Extension

This document describes the multiappending extension to the Internet
Message Access Protocol (IMAP) (<a href="rfc3501.html">RFC 3501</a>).  This extension provides
substantial performance improvements for IMAP clients which upload
multiple messages at a time to a mailbox on the server.

A server which supports this extension indicates this with a capability
name of "MULTIAPPEND".  [STANDARDS TRACK]

                                        PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1

The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows a
client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.
IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in
a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.  IMAP4rev1 also
provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the
server.

IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming
mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages,
setting and clearing flags, <a href="rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</a> and <a href="rfc2045.html">RFC 2045</a> parsing, searching,
and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions
thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers.
These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.

IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing
configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is
discussed in <a href="rfc2244.html">RFC 2244</a>.

IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is
handled by a mail transfer protocol such as <a href="rfc2821.html">RFC 2821</a>.  [STANDARDS TRACK]
