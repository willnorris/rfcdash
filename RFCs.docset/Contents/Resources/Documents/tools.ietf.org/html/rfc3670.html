Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to define an information model to
   describe the quality of service (QoS) mechanisms inherent in
   different network devices, including hosts.  Broadly speaking, these
   mechanisms describe the properties common to selecting and
   conditioning traffic through the forwarding path (datapath) of a
   network device.  This selection and conditioning of traffic in the
   datapath spans both major QoS architectures: Differentiated Services
   and Integrated Services.

   This document should be used with the QoS Policy Information Model
   (QPIM) to model how policies can be defined to manage and configure
   the QoS mechanisms (i.e., the classification, marking, metering,
   dropping, queuing, and scheduling functionality) of devices.
   Together, these two documents describe how to write QoS policy rules
   to configure and manage the QoS mechanisms present in the datapaths
   of devices.

   they represent information independent of a binding to a specific

   The purpose of this document is to define an information model to
   describe the quality of service (QoS) mechanisms inherent in
   different network devices, including hosts.  Broadly speaking, these
   mechanisms describe the attributes common to selecting and
   conditioning traffic through the forwarding path (datapath) of a
   network device.  This selection and conditioning of traffic in the
   datapath spans both major QoS architectures: Differentiated Services
   (see [<a href="#ref-R2475" title='"An Architecture for Differentiated Service"'>R2475</a>]) and Integrated Services (see [<a href="#ref-R1633" title='"Integrated Services in the Internet Architecture: An Overview"'>R1633</a>]).

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3670.html">RFC 3670</a>             QoS Device Datapath Info Model         January 2004</span>


   This document is intended to be used with the QoS Policy Information
   Model [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>] to model how policies can be defined to manage and
   configure the QoS mechanisms (i.e., the classification, marking,
   metering, dropping, queuing, and scheduling functionality) of
   devices.  Together, these two documents describe how to write QoS
   policy rules to configure and manage the QoS mechanisms present in
   the datapaths of devices.

   This document, as well as [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>], are information models.  That is,
   they represent information independent of a binding to a specific
   type of repository.  A separate document could be written to provide
   a mapping of the data contained in this document to a form suitable
   for implementation in a directory that uses (L)DAP as its access
   protocol.  Similarly, a document could be written to provide a
   mapping of the data in [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>] to a directory. Together, these four
   documents (information models and directory schema mappings) would
   then describe how to write QoS policy rules that can be used to store
   information in directories to configure device QoS mechanisms.

   The approach taken in this document defines a common set of classes
   that can be used to model QoS in a device datapath. Vendors can then
   map these classes, either directly or using an intervening format
   like a COP-PR PIB, to their own device-specific implementations.
   Note that the admission control element of Integrated Services is not
   included in the scope of this model.

   The design of the class, association, and aggregation hierarchies
   described in this document is influenced by the Network QoS submodel
   defined by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) - see [<a href="#ref-CIM" title="Inc.">CIM</a>].
   These hierarchies are not derived from the Policy Core Information
   Model [<a href="#ref-PCIM" title='"Policy Core Information Model - Version 1 Specification"'>PCIM</a>].  This is because the modeling of the QoS mechanisms of
   a device is separate and distinct from the modeling of policies that
   manage those mechanisms.  Hence, there is a need to separate QoS
   mechanisms (this document) from their control (specified using the
   generic policy document [<a href="#ref-PCIM" title='"Policy Core Information Model - Version 1 Specification"'>PCIM</a>] augmented by the QoS Policy document
   [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>]).

   While it is not a policy model per se, this document does have a
   dependency on the Policy Core Information Model Extensions document
   [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>].  The device-level packet filtering, through which a
   Classifier splits a traffic stream into multiple streams, is based on
   the FilterEntryBase and FilterList classes defined in [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>
   [<a href="#ref-R2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>R2119</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Policy%20Management%20Conceptual%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Policy Management Conceptual Model</span>

   The Policy Core Information Model [<a href="#ref-PCIM" title='"Policy Core Information Model - Version 1 Specification"'>PCIM</a>] describes a general
   methodology for constructing policy rules.  PCIM Extensions [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>]
   updates and extends the original PCIM.  A policy rule aggregates a
   set of policy conditions and an ordered set of policy actions.  The
   semantics of a policy rule are such that if the set of conditions
   evaluates to TRUE, then the set of actions are executed.

   Policy conditions and actions have two principal components: operands
   and operators.  Operands can be constants or variables. To specify a
   policy, it is necessary to specify:

   o  the operands to be examined (also known as state variables);

   o  the operands to be changed (also known as configuration
      variables);

   o  the relationships between these two sets of operands.

   Operands can be specified at a high-level, such as Joe (a user) or
   Gold (a service).  Operands can also be specified at a much finer
   level of detail, one that is much closer to the operation of the
   device.  Examples of the latter include an IP Address or a queue's
   bandwidth allocation.  Implicit in the use of operands is the binding
   of legal values or ranges of values to an operand.  For example, the
   value of an IP address cannot be an integer.  The concepts of
   operands and their ranges are defined in [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>].

   The second component of policy conditions and actions is a set of
   operators.  Operators can express both relationships (greater than,
   member of a set, Boolean OR, etc.) and assignments.  Together,
   operators and operands can express a variety of conditions and
   actions, such as:

      If Bob is an Engineer...
      If the source IP address is in the Marketing Subnet...
      Set Joe's IP address to 192.0.2.100
      Limit the bandwidth of application x to 10 Mb

   We recognize that the definition of operator semantics is critical to
   the definition of policies.  However, the definition of these
   operators is beyond the scope of this document.  Rather, this
   document (with [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>]) takes the first steps in identifying and
   standardizing a set of properties (operands) for use in defining
   policies for Differentiated and Integrated Services.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20Purpose%20and%20Relation%20to%20Other%20Policy%20Work"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Purpose and Relation to Other Policy Work</span>

   This model establishes a canonical model of the QoS mechanisms of a
   network device (e.g., a router, switch, or host) that is independent
   of any specific type of network device.  This enables traffic
   conditioning to be described using a common set of abstractions,
   modeled as a set of services and sub-services.

   When the concepts of this document are used in conjunction with the
   concepts of [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>], one is able to define policies that bind the
   services in a network to the needs of applications using that
   network.  In other words, the business requirements of an
   organization can be reflected in one set of policies, and those
   policies can be translated to a lower-level set of policies that
   control and manage the configuration and operation of network
   devices.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Typical%20Examples%20of%20Policy%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Typical Examples of Policy Usage</span>

   Policies could be implemented as low-level rules using the
   information model described in this specification.  For example, in a
   low-level policy, a condition could be represented as an evaluation
   of a specific attribute from this model.  Therefore, a condition such
   as "If filter = HTTP" would be interpreted as a test determining
   whether any HTTP filters have been defined for the device.  A high-
   level policy, such as "If protocol = HTTP, then mark with
   Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) 24," would be expressed as
   a series of actions in a low-level policy using the classes and
   attributes described below:

   1.  Create HTTP filter
   2.  Create DSCP marker with the value of 24
   3.  Bind the HTTP filter to the DSCP marker

   Note that unlike "mark with DSCP 24," these low-level actions are not
   performed on a packet as it passes through the device. Rather, they
   are configuration actions performed on the device itself, to make it
   ready to perform the correct action(s) on the correct packet(s).  The
   act of moving from a high-level policy rule to the correct set of
   low-level device configuration actions is an example of what
   [<a href="#ref-POLTERM" title='"Terminology for Policy-Based Management"'>POLTERM</a>] characterizes as "policy translation" or "policy
   conversion".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Approach"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Approach</span>

   QoS activities in the IETF have mainly focused in two areas,
   Integrated Services (IntServ) and Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
   (see [<a href="#ref-POLTERM" title='"Terminology for Policy-Based Management"'>POLTERM</a>], [<a href="#ref-R1633" title='"Integrated Services in the Internet Architecture: An Overview"'>R1633</a>] and [<a href="#ref-R2475" title='"An Architecture for Differentiated Service"'>R2475</a>]).  This document focuses on the
   specification of QoS properties and classes for modeling the datapath
   where packet traffic is conditioned. However, the framework defined
   by the classes in this document has been designed with the needs of
   the admission control portion of IntServ in mind as well.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Common%20Needs%20Of%20DiffServ%20and%20IntServ"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Common Needs Of DiffServ and IntServ</span>

   First, let us consider IntServ.  IntServ has two principal
   components.  One component is embedded in the datapath of the
   networking device.  Its functions include the classification and
   policing of individual flows, and scheduling admitted packets for the
   outbound link.  The other component of IntServ is admission control,
   which focuses on the management of the signaling protocol (e.g., the
   PATH and RESV messages of RSVP).  This component processes
   reservation requests, manages bandwidth, outsources decision making
   to policy servers, and interacts with the Routing Table manager.

   We will consider RSVP when defining the structure of this information
   model.  As this document focuses on the datapath, elements of RSVP
   applicable to the datapath will be considered in the structure of the
   classes.  The complete IntServ device model will, as we have
   indicated earlier, be addressed in a subsequent document.

   This document models a small subset of the QoS policy problem, in
   hopes of constructing a methodology that can be adapted for other
   aspects of QoS in particular, and of policy construction in general.
   The focus in this document is on QoS for devices that implement
   traffic conditioning in the datapath.

   DiffServ operates exclusively in the datapath.  It has all of the
   same components of the IntServ datapath, with two major differences.
   First, DiffServ classifies packets based solely on their DSCP field,
   whereas IntServ examines a subset of a standard flow's addressing 5-
   tuple.  The exception to this rule occurs in a router or host at the
   boundary of a DiffServ domain.  A device in this position may examine
   a packet's DSCP, its addressing 5-tuple, other fields in the packet,
   or even information wholly outside the packet, in determining the
   DSCP value with which to mark the packet prior to its transfer into
   the DiffServ domain.  However, routers in the interior of a DiffServ
   domain will only need to classify based on the DSCP field.






<span class="grey">Moore, et al.               Standards Track                     [Page 8]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3670.html">RFC 3670</a>             QoS Device Datapath Info Model         January 2004</span>


   The second difference between IntServ and DiffServ is that the
   signaling protocol used in IntServ (e.g., RSVP) affects the
   configuration of the datapath in a more dynamic fashion.  This is
   because each newly admitted RSVP reservation requires a
   reconfiguration of the datapath.  In contrast, DiffServ requires far
   fewer changes to the datapath after the Per Hop Behaviors (PHBs) have
   been configured.

   The approach advocated in this document for the creation of policies
   that control the various QoS mechanisms of networking devices is to
   first identify the attributes with which policies are to be
   constructed.  These attributes are the parameters used in expressions
   that are necessary to construct policies.  There is also a parallel
   desire to define the operators, relations, and precedence constructs
   necessary to construct the conditions and actions that constitute
   these policies.  However, these efforts are beyond the scope of this
   document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Specific%20Needs%20Of%20DiffServ"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Specific Needs Of DiffServ</span>

   DiffServ-specific rules focus on two particular areas: the core and
   the edges of the network.  As explained in the DiffServ Architecture
   document [<a href="#ref-R2475" title='"An Architecture for Differentiated Service"'>R2475</a>], devices at the edge of the network classify traffic
   into different traffic streams.  The core of the network then
   forwards traffic from different streams by using a set of Per Hop
   Behaviors (PHBs).  A DSCP identifies each PHB. The DSCP is part of
   the IP header of each packet (as described in [<a href="#ref-R2474" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>R2474</a>]).  This enables
   multiple traffic streams to be aggregated into a small number of
   aggregated traffic streams, where each aggregate traffic stream is
   identified by a particular DSCP, and forwarded using a particular
   PHB.

   The attributes used to manipulate QoS capabilities in the core of the
   network primarily address the behavioral characteristics of each
   supported PHB.  At the edges of the DiffServ network, the additional
   complexities of flow classification, policing, RSVP mappings,
   remarkings, and other factors have to be considered. Additional
   modeling will be required in this area.  However, first, the
   standards for edges of the DiffServ network need more detail - to
   allow the edges to be incorporated into the policy model.

   This document focuses exclusively on the forwarding aspects of
   network QoS.  Therefore, while the forwarding aspects of IntServ are
   considered, the management of IntServ is not considered. This topic
   will be addressed in a future document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Methodology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Methodology</span>

   There is a clear need to define attributes and behavior that together
   define how traffic should be conditioned.  This document defines a
   set of classes and relationships that represent the QoS mechanisms
   used to condition traffic; [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>] is used to define policies to
   control the QoS mechanisms defined in this document.

   However, some very basic issues need to be considered when combining
   these documents.  Considering these issues should help in
   constructing a schema for managing the operation and configuration of
   network QoS mechanisms through the use of QoS policies.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Level%20of%20Abstraction%20for%20Expressing%20QoS%20Policies"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Level of Abstraction for Expressing QoS Policies</span>

   The first issue requiring consideration is the level of abstraction
   at which QoS policies should be expressed.  If we consider policies
   as a set of rules used to react to events and manipulate attributes
   or generate new events, we realize that policy represents a continuum
   of specifications that relate business goals and rules to the
   conditioning of traffic done by a device or a set of devices.  An
   example of a business level policy might be: from 1:00 pm PST to 7:00
   am EST, sell off 40% of the network capacity on the open market.  In
   contrast, a device-specific policy might be: if the queue depth grows
   at a geometric rate over a specified duration, trigger a potential
   link failure event.

   A general model for this continuum is shown in Figure 1 below.

   High-level business policies are used to express the requirements of
   the different applications, and prioritize which applications get
   "better" treatment when the network is congested.  The goal, then, is
   to use policies to relate the operational and configuration needs of
   a device directly to the business rules that the network
   administrator is trying to implement in the network that the device
   belongs to.

   Device-independent policies translate business policies into a set of
   generalized operational and configuration policies that are
   independent of any specific device, but dependent on a particular set
   of QoS mechanisms, such as random early detection (RED) dropping or
   weighted round robin scheduling.  Not only does this enable different
   types of devices (routers, switches, hosts, etc.) to be controlled by
   QoS policies, it also enables devices made by different vendors that
   use the same types of QoS mechanisms to be controlled.  This enables
   these different devices to each supply the correct relative
   conditioning to the same type of traffic.

   In contrast, device-dependent policies translate device-independent
   policies into ones that are specific for a given device.  The reason
   that a distinction is made between device-independent and device-
   dependent policies is that in a given network, many different devices
   having many different capabilities need to be controlled together.
   Device-independent policies provide a common layer of abstraction for
   managing multiple devices of different capabilities, while device-
   dependent policies implement the specific conditioning that is
   required.  This document provides a common set of abstractions for
   representing QoS mechanisms in a device-independent way.

   This document is focused on the device-independent representation of
   QoS mechanisms.  QoS mechanisms are modeled in sufficient detail to
   provide a common device-independent representation of QoS policies.
   They can also be used to provide a basis for specialization, enabling
   each vendor to derive a set of vendor-specific classes that represent
   how traffic conditioning is done for that vendor's set of devices.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Specifying%20Policy%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Specifying Policy Parameters</span>

   Policies are a function of parameters (attributes) and operators
   (boolean, arithmetic, relational, etc.).  Therefore, both need to be
   defined as part of the same policy in order to correctly condition
   the traffic.  If the parameters of the policy are specified too
   narrowly, they will reflect the individual implementations of QoS in
   each device.  As there is currently little consensus in the industry
   on what the correct implementation model for QoS is, most defined
   attributes would only be applicable to the unique characteristics of
   a few individual devices.  Moreover, standardizing all of these



<span class="grey">Moore, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 11]</span></pre>

   potential implementation alternatives would be a never-ending task as
   new implementations continued to appear on the market.

   On the other hand, if the parameters of the policy are specified too
   broadly, it is impossible to develop meaningful policies. For
   example, if we concentrate on the so-called Olympic set of policies,
   a business policy like "Bob gets Gold Service," is clearly
   meaningless to the large majority of existing devices. This is
   because the device has no way of determining who Bob is, or what QoS
   mechanisms should be configured in what way to provide Gold service.

   Furthermore, Gold service may represent a single service, or it may
   identify a set of services that are related to each other. In the
   latter case, these services may have different conditioning
   characteristics.

   This document defines a set of parameters that fit into a canonical
   model for modeling the elements in the forwarding path of a device
   implementing QoS traffic conditioning.  By defining this model in a
   device-independent way, the needed parameters can be appropriately
   abstracted.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Specifying%20Policy%20Services"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Specifying Policy Services</span>

   Administrators want the flexibility to be able to define traffic
   conditioning without having to have a low-level understanding of the
   different QoS mechanisms that implement that conditioning.
   Furthermore, administrators want the flexibility to group different
   services together, describing a higher-level concept such as "Gold
   Service".  This higher-level service could be viewed as providing the
   processing to deliver "Gold" quality of service.

   These two goals dictate the need for the following set of
   abstractions:

   o  a flexible way to describe a service

   o  must be able to group different services that may use different
      technologies (e.g., DiffServ and IEEE 802.1Q) together

   o  must be able to define a set of sub-services that together make up
      a higher-level service

   o  must be able to associate a service and the set of QoS mechanisms
      that are used to condition traffic for that service

   o  must be able to define policies that manage the QoS mechanisms
      used to implement a service.

   This document addresses this set of problems by defining a set of
   classes and associations that can represent abstract concepts like
   "Gold Service," and bind each of these abstract services to a
   specific set of QoS mechanisms that implement the conditioning that
   they require.  Furthermore, this document defines the concept of
   "sub-services," to enable Gold Service to be defined either as a
   single service or as a set of services that together should be
   treated as an atomic entity.

   Given these abstractions, policies (as defined in [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>]) can be
   written to control the QoS mechanisms and services defined in this
   document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.4.%20%20Level%20of%20Abstraction%20for%20Defining%20QoS%20Attributes%20and%20Classes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" name="section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Level of Abstraction for Defining QoS Attributes and Classes</span>

   This document defines a set of classes and properties to support
   policies that configure device QoS mechanisms.  This document
   concentrates on the representation of services in the datapath that
   support both DiffServ (for aggregate traffic conditioning) and
   IntServ (for flow-based traffic conditioning).  Classes and
   properties for modeling IntServ admission control services may be
   defined in a future document.

   The classes and properties in this document are designed to be used
   in conjunction with the QoS policy classes and properties defined in
   [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>].  For example, to preserve the delay characteristics committed
   to an end-user, a network administrator may wish to create policies
   that monitor the queue depths in a device, and adjust resource
   allocations when delay budgets are at risk (perhaps as a result of a
   network topology change).  The classes and properties in this
   document define the specific services and mechanisms required to
   implement those services. The classes and properties defined in
   [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>] provide the overall structure of the policy that manages and
   configures this service.

   This combination of low-level specification (using this document) and
   high-level structuring (using [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>]) of network services enables
   network administrators to define new services required of the
   network, that are directly related to business goals, while ensuring
   that such services can be managed.  However, this goal (of creating
   and managing service-oriented policies) can only be realized if
   policies can be constructed that are capable of supporting diverse
   implementations of QoS.  The solution is to model the QoS
   capabilities of devices at the behavioral level. This means that for
   traffic conditioning services realized in the datapath, the model
   must support the following characteristics:

   o  modeling of a generic network service that has QoS capabilities



<span class="grey">Moore, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 13]</span></pre>

   o  modeling of how the traffic conditioning itself is defined

   o  modeling of how statistics are gathered to monitor QoS traffic
      conditioning services - this facet of the model will be added in a
      future document.

   This document models a network service, and associates it with one or
   more QoS mechanisms that are used to implement that service.  It also
   models in a canonical form the various components that are used to
   condition traffic, such that standard as well as custom traffic
   conditioning services may be described.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.%20%20Characterization%20of%20QoS%20Properties"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" name="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Characterization of QoS Properties</span>

   The QoS properties and classes will be described in more detail in
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  However, we should consider the basic characteristics of
   these properties, to understand the methodology for representing
   them.

   There are essentially two types of properties, state and
   configuration.  Configuration properties describe the desired state
   of a device, and include properties and classes for representing
   desired or proposed thresholds, bandwidth allocations, and how to
   classify traffic.  State properties describe the actual state of the
   device.  These include properties to represent the current
   operational values of the attributes in devices configured via the
   configuration properties, as well as properties that represent state
   (queue depths, excess capacity consumption, loss rates, and so
   forth).

   In order to be correlated and used together, these two types of
   properties must be modeled using a common information model.  The
   possibility of modeling state properties and their corresponding
   configuration settings is accomplished using the same classes in this
   model - although individual instances of the classes would have to be
   appropriately named or placed in different containers to distinguish
   current state values from desired configuration settings.

   State information is addressed in a very limited fashion by QDDIM.
   Currently, only CurrentQueueDepth is proposed as an attribute on
   QueuingService.  The majority of the model is related to
   configuration.  Given this fact, it is assumed that this model is a
   direct memory map into a device.  All manipulation of model classes
   and properties directly affects the state of the device.  If it is
   desired to also use these classes to represent desired configuration,
   that is left to the discretion of the implementor.

   It is acknowledged that additional properties are needed to
   completely model current state.  However, many of the properties
   defined in this document represent exactly the state variables that
   will be configured by the configuration properties.  Thus, the
   definition of the configuration properties has an exact
   correspondence with the state properties, and can be used in modeling
   both actual (state) and desired/proposed configuration.

   The question of context also leads to another question: how does the
   information specified in the core and QoS policy models ([<a href="#ref-PCIM" title='"Policy Core Information Model - Version 1 Specification"'>PCIM</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>], and [<a href="#ref-QPIM" title='"Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model"'>QPIM</a>], respectively) integrate with the information
   defined in this document?  To put it another way, where should
   device-independent concepts that lead to device-specific QoS
   attributes be derived from?

   Past thinking was that QoS was part of the policy model.  This view
   is not completely accurate, and it leads to confusion.  QoS is a set
   of services that can be controlled using policy.  These services are
   represented as device mechanisms.  An important point here is that
   QoS services, as well as other types of services (e.g., security),
   are provided by the mechanisms inherent in a given device.  This
   means that not all devices are indeed created equal.  For example,
   although two devices may have the same type of mechanism (e.g., a
   queue), one may be a simple implementation (i.e., a FIFO queue)
   whereas one may be much more complex and robust (e.g., class-based
   weighted fair queuing (CBWFQ)).  However, both of these devices can
   be used to deliver QoS services, and both need to be controlled by
   policy.  Thus, a device-independent policy can instruct the devices
   to queue certain traffic, and a device-specific policy can be used to
   control the queuing in each device.

   Furthermore, policy is used to control these mechanisms, not to
   represent them.  For example, QoS services are implemented with
   classifiers, meters, markers, droppers, queues, and schedulers.
   Similarly, security is also a characteristic of devices, as
   authentication and encryption capabilities represent services that
   networked devices perform (irrespective of interactions with policy
   servers).  These security services may use some of the same
   mechanisms that are used by QoS services, such as the concepts of
   filters.  However, they will mostly require different mechanisms than
   the ones used by QoS, even though both sets of services are
   implemented in the same devices.

   Thus, the similarity between the QoS model and models for other
   services is not so much that they contain a few common mechanisms.
   Rather, they model how a device implements their respective services.

   As such, the modeling of QoS should be part of a networking device
   schema rather than a policy schema.  This allows the networking
   device schema to concentrate on modeling device mechanisms, and the
   policy schema to focus on the semantics of representing the policy
   itself (conditions, actions, operators, etc.).  While this document
   concentrates on defining an information model to represent QoS
   services in a device datapath, the ultimate goal is to be able to
   apply policies that control these services in network devices.
   Furthermore, these two schemata (device and policy) must be tightly
   integrated in order to enable policy to control QoS services.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.7.%20%20Attribute%20Representation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7" name="section-3.7">3.7</a>.  Attribute Representation</span>

   The last issue to be considered is the question of how attributes are
   represented.  If QoS attributes are represented as absolute numbers
   (e.g., Class AF2 gets 2 Mbs of bandwidth), it is more difficult to
   make them uniform across multiple ports in a device or across
   multiple devices, because of the broad variation in link capacities.
   However, expressing attributes in relative or proportional terms
   (e.g., Class AF2 gets 5% of the total link bandwidth) makes it more
   difficult to express certain types of conditions and actions, such
   as:

      (If ConsumedBandwidth = AssignedBandwidth Then ...)

   There are really three approaches to addressing this problem:

   o  Multiple properties can be defined to express the same value in
      various forms.  This idea has been rejected because of the
      difficulty in keeping these different properties synchronized
      (e.g., when one property changes, the others all have to be
      updated).

   o  Multi-modal properties can be defined to express the same value,
      in different terms, based on the access or assignment mode.  This
      option was rejected because it significantly complicates the model
      and is impossible to express in current directory access protocols
      (e.g., (L)DAP).

   o  Properties can be expressed as "absolutes", but the operators in
      the policy schema would need to be more sophisticated.  Thus, to
      represent a percentage, division and multiplication operators are
      required (e.g., Class AF2 gets .05 * the total link bandwidth).
      This is the approach that has been taken in this document.

   The mental model for constructing this schema is based on the work
   done in the Differentiated Services working group.  This schema is
   based on information provided in the current versions of the DiffServ
   Informal Management Model [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>], the DiffServ MIB [<a href="#ref-DSMIB" title='"Management Information Base for the Differentiated Services Architecture"'>DSMIB</a>], the
   PIB [<a href="#ref-PIB" title='"Differentiated Services Quality of Service Policy Information Base"'>PIB</a>], as well as on information in the set of RFCs that
   constitute the basic definition of DiffServ itself ([<a href="#ref-R2475" title='"An Architecture for Differentiated Service"'>R2475</a>], [<a href="#ref-R2474" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>R2474</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-R2597" title='"Assured Forwarding PHB Group"'>R2597</a>], and [<a href="#ref-R3246" title='"An Expedited Forwarding PHB (Per-Hop Behavior)"'>R3246</a>]).  In addition, a common set of terminology is
   available in [<a href="#ref-POLTERM" title='"Terminology for Policy-Based Management"'>POLTERM</a>].

   This model is built around two fundamental class hierarchies that are
   bound together using a set of associations.  The two class
   hierarchies derive from the QoSService and ConditioningService base
   classes.  A set of associations relate lower-level QoSService
   subclasses to higher-level QoS services, relate different types of
   conditioning services together in processing a traffic class, and
   relate a set of conditioning services to a specific QoS service.
   This combination of associations enables us to view the device as
   providing a set of services that can be configured, in a modular
   building block fashion, to construct application-specific services.
   Thus, this document can be used to model existing and future standard
   as well as application-specific network QoS services.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.8.1.%20%20The%20QoSService%20Class"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.8.1" name="section-3.8.1">3.8.1</a>.  The QoSService Class</span>

   The first of the classes defined here, QoSService, is used to
   represent higher-level network services that require special
   conditioning of their traffic.  An instance of QoSService (or one of
   its subclasses) is used to bring together a group of conditioning
   services that, from the perspective of the system manager, are all
   used to deliver a common service.  Thus, the set of classifiers,
   markers, and related conditioning services that provide premium
   service to the "selected" set of user traffic may be grouped together
   into a premium QoS service.

   QoSService has a set of subclasses that represent different
   approaches to delivering IP services.  The currently defined set of
   subclasses are a FlowService for flow-oriented QoS delivery and a
   DiffServService for DiffServ aggregate-oriented QoS service delivery.

   The QoS services can be related to each other as peers, or they can
   be implemented as subservient services to each other.  The
   QoSSubService aggregation indicates that one or more QoSService
   objects are subservient to a particular QoSService object.  For
   example, this enables us to define Gold Service as a combination of
   two DiffServ services, one for high quality traffic treatment, and
   one for servicing the rest of the traffic.  Each of these

   DiffServService objects would be associated with a set of
   classifiers, markers, etc, such that the high quality traffic would
   get EF marking and appropriate queuing.

   The DiffServService class itself has an AFService subclass.  This
   subclass is used to represent the specific notion that several
   related markings within the AF PHB Group work together to provide a
   single service.  When other DiffServ PHB Groups are defined that use
   more than one code point, these will be likely candidates for
   additional DiffServService subclasses.

   Technology-specific mappings of these services, representing the
   specific use of PHB marking or 802.1Q marking, are captured within
   the ConditioningService hierarchy, rather than in the subclasses of
   QoSService.

   These concepts are depicted in Figure 2.  Note that both of the
   associations are aggregations: a QoSService object aggregates both
   the set of QoSService objects subservient to it, and the set of
   ConditioningService objects that realize it.  See <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for class
   and association definitions.

   The goal of the ConditioningService classes is to describe the
   sequence of traffic conditioning that is applied to a given traffic
   stream on the ingress interface through which it enters a device, and
   then on the egress interface through which it leaves the device.
   This is done using a set of classes and relationships.  The routing
   decision in the device core, which selects which egress interface a
   particular packet will use, is not represented in this model.

   A single base class, ConditioningService, is the superclass for a set
   of subclasses representing the mechanisms that condition traffic.

   These subclasses define device-independent conditioning primitives
   (including classifiers, meters, markers, droppers, queues, and
   schedulers) that together implement the conditioning of traffic on an
   interface.  This model abstracts these services into a common set of
   modular building blocks that can be used, regardless of device
   implementation, to model the traffic conditioning internal to a
   device.

   The different conditioning mechanisms need to be related to each
   other to describe how traffic is conditioned.  Several important
   variations of how these services are related together exist:

   o  A particular ingress or egress interface may not require all the
      types of ConditioningServices.

   o  Multiple instances of the same mechanism may be required on an
      ingress or egress interface.

   o  There is no set order of application for the ConditioningServices
      on an ingress or egress interface.

   Therefore, this model does not dictate a fixed ordering among the
   subclasses of ConditioningService, or identify a subclass of
   ConditioningService that must appear first or last among the
   ConditioningServices on an ingress or egress interface.  Instead,
   this model ties together the various ConditioningService instances on
   an ingress or egress interface using the NextService,
   NextServiceAfterMeter, and NextServiceAfterConditioningElement
   associations.  There are also separate associations, called
   IngressConditioningServiceOnEndpoint and
   EgressConditioningServiceOnEndpoint, which, respectively, tie an
   ingress interface to its first ConditioningService, and tie an egress
   interface to its last ConditioningService(s).

   There is one important way in which the QDDIM model diverges from the
   [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>].  In [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>], traffic passes through a network device in
   three stages:

   o  It comes in on an ingress interface, where it may receive QoS
      conditioning.

   o  It traverses the routing core, where logic outside the scope of
      QoS determines which egress interface it will use to leave the
      device.

   o  It may receive further QoS conditioning on the selected egress
      interface, and then it leaves the device.

   In this model, no information about the QoS conditioning that a
   packet receives on the ingress interface is communicated with the
   packet across the routing core to the egress interface.

   The QDDIM model relaxes this restriction, to allow information about
   the treatment that a packet received on an ingress interface to be
   communicated along with the packet to the egress interface.  (This
   relaxation adds a capability that is present in many network
   devices.)  QDDIM represents this information transfer in terms of a
   packet preamble, which is how many devices implement it.  But
   implementations are free to use other mechanisms to achieve the same
   result.

   Figure 3:  Meter Followed by Two Preamble Markers

   Figure 3 shows an example in which meter results are captured in a
   packet preamble.  The arrows labeled with single letters represent
   instances of either the NextService association (a, d, and e), or of
   its peer association NextServiceAfterMeter (b and c).  PreambleMarker
   PM-1 adds to the packet preamble an indication that the packet exited
   Meter A as conforming traffic. Similarly, PreambleMarker PM-2 adds to
   the preambles of packets that come through it indications that they
   exited Meter A as nonconforming traffic.  A PreambleMarker appends
   its information to whatever is already present in a packet preamble,
   as opposed to overwriting what is already there.

   To foster interoperability, the basic format of the information
   captured by a PreambleMarker is specified.  (Implementations, of
   course, are free to represent this information in a different way
   internally - this is just how it is represented in the model.) The
   information is represented by an ordered, multi-valued string
   property FilterItemList, where each individual value of the property
   is of the form "&lt;type&gt;,&lt;value&gt;".  When a PreambleMarker "appends" its
   information to the information that was already present in a packet
   preamble, it does so by adding additional items of the indicated
   format to the end of the list.

   QDDIM provides a limited set of &lt;type&gt;'s that a PreambleMarker may
   use:

   o  ConformingFromMeter: the value is the name of the meter.

   o  PartConformingFromMeter: the value is the name of the meter.

   o  NonConformingFromMeter: the value is the name of the meter.

   o  VlanId: the value is the virtual LAN identifier (VLAN ID).

   Implementations may recognize other &lt;type&gt;'s in addition to these.
   If collisions of implementation-specific &lt;type&gt;'s become a problem,
   it is possible that &lt;type&gt;'s may become an IANA-administered range in
   a future revision of this document.

   To make use of the information that a PreambleMarker stores in a
   packet preamble, a specific subclass PreambleFilter of
   FilterEntryBase is defined, to match on the "&lt;type&gt;,&lt;value&gt;" strings.
   To simplify the case where there's just a single level of metering in
   a device, but different individual meters on each ingress interface,
   PreambleFilter allows a wildcard "any" for the &lt;value&gt; part of the
   three meter-related filters.  With this wildcard, an administrator
   can specify a Classifier to select all packets that were found to be
   conforming (or partially conforming, or non-conforming) by their
   respective meters, without having to name each meter individually in
   a separate ClassifierElement.

   Once a meter result has been stored in a packet preamble, it is
   available for any subsequent Classifier to use.  So while the
   motivation for this capability has been described in terms of
   preserving QoS conditioning information from an ingress interface to
   an egress interface, a prior meter result may also be used for
   classifying packets later in the datapath on the same interface where
   the meter resides.

   This document uses a number of classes to model the classifiers
   defined in [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>]: ClassifierService, ClassifierElement,
   FilterList, FilterEntryBase, and various subclasses of
   FilterEntryBase.  There are also two associations involved:
   ClassifierElementUsesFilterList and EntriesInFilterList.  The QDDIM
   model makes no use of CIM's FilterEntry class.

   In [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>], a single traffic stream coming into a classifier is
   split into multiple traffic streams leaving it, based on which of an
   ordered set of filters each packet in the incoming stream matches.  A

   filter matches either a field in the packet itself, or possibly other
   attributes associated with the packet.  In the case of a multi-field
   (MF) classifier, packets are assigned to output streams based on the
   contents of multiple fields in the packet header.  For example, an MF
   classifier might assign packets to an output stream based on their
   complete IP-addressing 5-tuple.

   To optimize the representation of MF classifiers, subclasses of
   FilterEntryBase are introduced, which allow multiple related packet
   header fields to be represented in a single object.  These subclasses
   are IPHeaderFilter and 8021Filter.  With IPHeaderFilter, for example,
   criteria for selecting packets based on all five of the IP 5-tuple
   header fields and the DiffServ DSCP can be represented by a
   FilterList containing one IPHeaderFilter object.  Because these two
   classes have applications beyond those considered in this document,
   they, as well as the abstract class FilterEntryBase, are defined in
   the more general document [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>] rather than here.

   The FilterList object is always needed, even if it contains only one
   filter entry (that is, one FilterEntryBase subclass) object. This is
   because a ClassifierElement can only be associated with a Filter
   List, as opposed to an individual FilterEntry.  FilterList is also
   defined in [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>].

   The EntriesInFilterList aggregation (also defined in [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>]) has a
   property EntrySequence, which in the past (in CIM) could be used to
   specify an evaluation order on the filter entries in a FilterList.
   Now, however, the EntrySequence property supports only a single
   value: '0'.  This value indicates that the FilterEntries are ANDed
   together to determine whether a packet matches the MF selector that
   the FilterList represents.

   A ClassifierElement specifies the starting point for a specific
   policy or data path.  Each ClassifierElement uses the
   NextServiceAfterClassifierElement association to determine the next
   conditioning service to apply for packets to.

   A ClassifierService defines a grouping of ClassifierElements. There
   are certain instances where a ClassifierService actually specifies an
   aggregation of ClassifierServices.  One practical case would be where
   each ClassifierService specifies a group of policies associated with
   a particular application and another ClassifierService groups the
   application-specific ClassifierService instances.  In this particular
   case, the application-specific ClassifierService instances are
   specified once, but unique combinations of these ClassifierServices
   are specified, as needed, using other ClassifierService instances.
   ClassifierService instances grouping other ClassifierService
   instances may not specify a FilterList using the

   ClassifierService serves just as a Classifier collecting function.

   In [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>], a distinction is made between absolute droppers and
   algorithmic droppers.  In QDDIM, both of these types of droppers are
   modeled with the DropperService class, or with one of its subclasses.
   In both cases, the queue from which the dropper drops packets is tied
   to the dropper by an instance of the NextService association.  The
   dropper always plays the PrecedingService role in these associations,
   and the queue always plays the FollowingService role.  There is
   always exactly one queue from which a dropper drops packets.

   Since an absolute dropper drops all packets in its queue, it needs no
   configuration beyond a NextService tie to that queue. For an
   algorithmic dropper, however, further configuration is needed:

   o  a specific drop algorithm;

   o  parameters for the algorithm (for example, token bucket size);

   o  the source(s) of input(s) to the algorithm;

   o  possibly per-input parameters for the algorithm.

   The first two of these items are represented by properties of the
   DropperService class, or properties of one of its subclasses. The
   last two, however, involve additional classes and associations.

   The HeadTailDropQueueBinding is the association that identifies the
   inputs for the algorithm executed by a tail dropper.  This
   association is not used for a head dropper, because a head dropper
   always has exactly one input to its drop algorithm, and this input is
   always the queue from which it drops packets.  For a tail dropper,
   this association is defined to have a many-to-many cardinality.
   There are, however, two distinct cases:

   One dropper bound to many queues: This represents the case where the
   drop algorithm for the dropper involves inputs from more than one
   queue.  The dropper still drops from only one queue, the one to which
   it is tied by a NextService association.  But the drop decision may
   be influenced by the state of several queues.  For the classes
   HeadTailDropper and HeadTailDropQueueBinding, the rule for combining
   the multiple inputs is simple addition: if the sum of the lengths of
   the monitored queues exceeds the dropper's QueueThreshold value, then

   packets are dropped.  This rule for combining inputs may, however, be
   overridden by a different rule in subclasses of one or both of these
   classes.

   One queue bound to many droppers: This represents the case where the
   state of one queue (which is typically also the queue from which
   packets are dropped) provides an input to multiple droppers' drop
   algorithms.  A use case here is a classifier that splits a traffic
   stream into, say, four parts, representing four classes of traffic.
   Each of the parts goes through a separate HeadTailDropper, then
   they're re-merged onto the same queue.  The net is a single queue
   containing packets of four traffic types, with, say, the following
   drop thresholds:

      o    Class 1 - 90% full
      o    Class 2 - 80% full
      o    Class 3 - 70% full
      o    Class 4 - 50% full

   Here the percentages represent the overall state of the queue. With
   this configuration, when the queue in question becomes 50% full,
   Class 4 packets will be dropped rather than joining the queue, when
   it becomes 70% full, Class 3 and 4 packets will be dropped, etc.

   The two cases described here can also occur together, if a dropper
   receives inputs from multiple queues, one or more of which are also
   providing inputs to other droppers.

   Like a tail dropper, a RED dropper, represented by an instance of the
   REDDropperService class, may take as its inputs the states of
   multiple queues.  In this case, however, there is an additional step:
   each of these inputs may be smoothed before the RED dropper uses it,
   and the smoothing process itself must be parameterized. Consequently,
   in addition to REDDropperService and QueuingService, a third class,
   DropThresholdCalculationService, is introduced, to represent the
   per-queue parameterization of this smoothing process.

   The following instance diagram illustrates how these classes work
   with each other:

    Q-1      Q-2      Q-3

   Figure 4. Inputs for a RED Dropper

   So REDDropperService-A (RDSvc-A) is using inputs from three queues to
   make its drop decision.  (As always, RDSvc-A is linked to the queue
   from which it drops packets via the NextService association.)  For
   each of these three queues, there is a
   (DropThresholdCalculationService) DTCS instance that represents the
   smoothing weight and time interval to use when looking at that queue.
   Thus each DTCS instance is tied to exactly one queue, although a
   single queue may be examined (with different weight and time values)
   by multiple DTCS instances.  Also, a DTCS instance and the queue
   behind it can be thought of as a "unit of reusability".  So a single
   DTCS can be referred to by multiple RDSvc's.

   Unless it is overridden by a different rule in a subclass of
   REDDropperService, the rule that a RED dropper uses to combine the
   smoothed inputs from the DTCS's to create a value to use in making
   its drop decision is simple addition.

   In order to appreciate the rationale behind this rather complex model
   for scheduling, we must consider the rather complex nature of
   schedulers, as well as the extreme variations in algorithms and
   implementations.  Although these variations are broad, we have
   identified four examples that serve to test the model and justify its
   complexity.

   A simple, hierarchical scheduler has the following properties. First,
   when a scheduling opportunity is given to a set of queues, a single,
   viable queue is determined based on some scheduling criteria, such as
   bandwidth or priority.  The output of the scheduler is the input to
   another scheduler that treats the first scheduler (and its queues) as
   a single logical queue.  Hence, if the first scheduler determined the
   appropriate packet to release based on a priority assigned to each

   queue, the second scheduler might specify a bandwidth
   limit/allocation for the entire set of queues aggregated by the first
   scheduler.

   Figure 5 illustrates the example and how it would be instantiated
   using the model.  In the figure, NextService determines the first
   scheduler after the queue.  NextScheduler determines the
   subsequent ordering of schedulers.  In addition, the
   ElementSchedulingService association determines the set of
   scheduling parameters used by a specific scheduler.  Scheduling
   parameters can be bound either to queues or to schedulers.  In
   the case of the SchedulingElement EF1-Pri, the binding is to a
   queue, so the QueueToSchedule association is used.  In the case
   of the SchedulingElement PriSched1-Band, the binding is to
   another scheduler, so the SchedulerToSchedule association is
   used.  Note that due to space constraints of the document, the
   SchedulingService PRISched1 is represented twice, to show how it
   is connected to all the other objects.

   A complex, hierarchical scheduler has the same characteristics as
   a simple scheduler, except that the criteria for the second
   scheduler are determined on a per queue basis rather than on an
   aggregate basis.  One scenario might be a set of bounded priority
   schedulers.  In this case, each queue is assigned a relative
   priority.  However, each queue is also not allowed to exceed a
   bandwidth allocation that is unique to that queue.  In order to
   support this scenario, the queue must be bound to two separate
   schedulers.  Figure 6 illustrates this situation, by describing
   an EF queue and a best effort (BE) queue both pointing to a
   priority scheduler via the NextService association.  The
   NextScheduler association between the priority scheduler and the
   bandwidth scheduler in turn defines the ordering of the
   scheduling hierarchy.  Also note that each scheduler has a
   distinct set of scheduling parameters that are bound back to each
   queue.  This demonstrates the need to support two or more
   parameter sets on a per queue basis.

   An excess capacity scheduler offers a similar requirement to support
   two scheduling parameter sets per queue.  However, in this scenario
   the reasons are a little different.  Suppose a set of queues have
   each been assigned bandwidth limits to ensure that no traffic class
   starves out another traffic class.  The result may be that one or
   more queues have exceeded their allocation while the queues that
   deserve scheduling opportunities are empty.

   The question then is how is the excess (idle) bandwidth allocated.
   Conceivably, the scheduling criteria for excess capacity are
   completely different from the criteria that determine allocations
   under uniform load.  This could be supported with a scheduling
   hierarchy.  However, the problem is that the criteria for using the
   subsequent scheduler are different from those in the last two cases.
   Specifically, the next scheduler should only be used if a scheduling
   opportunity exists that was passed over by the prior scheduler.

   When a scheduler chooses to forgo a scheduling decision, it is
   behaving as a non-work conserving scheduler.  Work conserving
   schedulers, by definition, will always take advantage of a scheduling
   opportunity, irrespective of which queue is being serviced and how
   much bandwidth it has consumed in the past. This point leads to an
   interesting insight.  The semantics of a non-work conserving
   scheduler are equivalent to those of a meter, in that if a packet is
   in profile it is given the scheduling opportunity, and if it is out
   of profile it does not get a scheduling opportunity.  However, with
   meters there are semantics that determine the next action behavior
   when the packet is in profile and when the packet is out of profile.
   Similarly, with the non-work conserving scheduler, there needs to be
   a means for determining the next scheduler when a scheduler chooses
   not to utilize a scheduling opportunity.

   Figure 7 illustrates this last scenario.  It appears very similar to
   Figure 6, except that the binding between the allocation scheduler
   and the WRR scheduler is using a FailNextScheduler association.  This
   association is explicitly indicating the fact that the only time the
   WRR scheduler would be used is when there are non-empty queues that
   the allocation scheduler rejected for scheduling consideration.  Note
   that Figure 7 is incomplete, in that typically there would be several
   more queues that are bound to an allocation scheduler and a WRR
   scheduler.

   A hierarchical class-based queuing (CBQ) scheduler is the fourth
   scenario to be considered.  In hierarchical CBQ, each queue is
   allocated a specific bandwidth allocation.  Queues are grouped
   together into a logical scheduler.  This logical scheduler in turn
   has an aggregate bandwidth allocation that equals the sum of the
   queues it is scheduling.  In turn, logical schedulers can be
   aggregated into higher-level logical schedulers.  Changing
   perspectives and looking top down, the top-most logical scheduler has
   100% of the link capacity.  This allocation is parceled out to
   logical schedulers below it such that the sum of the allocations is
   equal to 100%.  These second tier schedulers may in turn parcel out
   their allocation across a third tier of schedulers and so forth until
   the lowest tier that parcels out their allocations to specific queues
   representing relatively fine-grained classes of traffic.  The unique
   aspect of hierarchical CBQ is that when there is insufficient
   bandwidth for a specific allocation, schedulers higher in the tree
   are tested to see if another portion of the tree has capacity to
   spare.

   Figure 8 demonstrates this example with two tiers.  The example is
   split in half because of space constraints, resulting in the CBQTier1
   scheduling service instance being represented twice. Note that the
   total allocation at the top tier is 50 Mb.  The voice allocation is
   22 Mb.  The remaining 23 Mb is split between FTP and Web.  Hence, if
   Web traffic is actually consuming 20 Mb (5 Mb in excess of the
   allocation).  If FTP is consuming 5 Mb, then it is possible for the
   CBQTier1 scheduler to offer 3Mb of its allocation to Web traffic.
   However, this is not enough, so the FailNextScheduler association
   needs to be traversed to determine if there is any excess capacity
   available from the voice class.  If the voice class is only consuming
   15 Mb of its 22 Mb allocation, there are sufficient resources to
   allow the web traffic through.  Note that FailNextScheduler is used
   as the association.  The reason is because the CBQTier1 scheduler in
   fact failed to schedule a packet because of insufficient resources.
   It is conceivable that a variant of hierarchical CBQ allows a
   hierarchy for successful scheduling as well.  Hence, both
   associations are necessary.

   Note that due to space constraints of the document, the
   SchedulingService CBQTier1 is represented twice, to show how it is
   connected to all the other objects.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20The%20Class%20Hierarchy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  The Class Hierarchy</span>

   The following sections present the class and association hierarchies
   that together comprise the information model for modeling QoS
   capabilities at the device level.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Associations%20and%20Aggregations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Associations and Aggregations</span>

   Associations and aggregations are a means of representing
   relationships between two (or theoretically more) objects.
   Dependency, aggregation, and other relationships are modeled as
   classes containing two (or more) object references.  It should be
   noted that aggregations represent either "whole-part" or "collection"
   relationships.  For example, aggregation can be used to represent the
   containment relationship between a system and the components that
   constitute the system.

   Since associations and aggregations are classes, they can benefit
   from all of the object-oriented features that other non-relationship
   classes have.  For example, they can contain properties and methods,
   and inheritance can be used to refine their semantics such that they
   represent more specialized types of their superclasses.

   Note that an association (or an aggregation) object is treated as an
   atomic unit (individual instance), even though it relates/collects/is
   comprised of multiple objects.  This is a defining feature of an
   association (or an aggregation) - although the individual elements
   that are related to other objects have their own identities, the
   association (or aggregation) object that is constructed using these
   objects has its own identity and name as well.

   It is important to note that associations and aggregations form an
   inheritance hierarchy that is separate from the class inheritance
   hierarchy.  Although associations and aggregations are typically bi-
   directional, there is nothing that prevents higher order associations
   or aggregations from being defined. However, such associations and
   aggregations are inherently more complex to define, understand, and
   use.  In practice, associations and aggregations of orders higher
   than binary are rarely used, because of their greatly increased
   complexity and lack of generality.  All of the associations and
   aggregations defined in this model are binary.

   Note also that by definition, associations and aggregations cannot be
   unary.

   Finally, note that associations and aggregations that are defined
   between two classes do not affect the classes themselves.  That is,
   the addition or deletion of an association or an aggregation does not
   affect the interfaces of the classes that it is connecting.

   The structure of the class, association, and aggregation class
   inheritance hierarchies for managing the datapaths of QoS devices is
   shown, respectively, in Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11. The
   notation (CIMCORE) identifies a class defined in the CIM Core model.
   Please refer to [<a href="#ref-CIM" title="Inc.">CIM</a>] for the definitions of these classes.
   Similarly, the notation [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>] identifies a class defined in the
   Policy Core Information Model Extensions document. This model has
   been influenced by [<a href="#ref-CIM" title="Inc.">CIM</a>], and is compatible with the Directory
   Enabled Networks (DEN) effort.

   This is an abstract class defined in the Core Model of CIM; it is a
   subclass of ManagedElement.  ManagedSystemElement serves as the base
   class for the PhysicalElement and LogicalElement class hierarchies.
   LogicalElement, in turn, is the base class for a number of important
   CIM hierarchies, including System.  Any distinguishable component of
   a System is a candidate for inclusion in this class hierarchy,
   including physical components (e.g., chips and cards) and logical
   components (e.g., software components, services, and other objects).

   None of the associations in which this class participates is used
   directly in the QoS device state model.  However, the aggregation
   Component, which relates one ManagedSystemElement to another, is the
   base class for the two aggregations that form the core of the QoS
   device state model: QoSSubService and QoSConditioningSubService.
   Similarly, the association ProvidesServiceToElement, which relates a
   ManagedSystemElement to a Service, is the base class for the model's
   CalculationServiceForDropper association.

   This is an abstract class defined in the Core Model of CIM.  It is a
   subclass of the ManagedSystemElement class, and is the base class for
   all logical components of a managed System, such as Files, Processes,
   or system capabilities in the form of Logical Devices and Services.

   This is an abstract class defined in the Core Model of CIM.  It is a
   subclass of the LogicalElement class, and is the base class for all
   objects that represent a "service" or functionality in a System.  A
   Service is a general-purpose object that is used to configure and
   manage the implementation of functionality.  As noted above in

   ConditioningService define the particular types of conditioning that
   are done.  Six fundamental types of conditioning are defined in this
   document.  These are the services performed by a classifier, a meter,
   a marker, a dropper, a queue, and a scheduler.  Other, more
   sophisticated types of conditioning may be defined in future
   documents.

   ConditioningService is a concrete class because at the time it was
   defined in CIM, its superclass was concrete.  While this class can be
   instantiated, an instance of it would not accomplish anything,
   because the nature of the conditioning, and the parameters that
   control it, are specified only in the subclasses of
   ConditioningService.

   Two associations in which ConditioningService participates are
   critical to its usage in QoS - QoSConditioningSubService and
   NextService.  QoSConditioningSubService aggregates
   ConditioningServices into a particular QoS service (such as AF), to
   describe the specific conditioning functionality that underlies that
   QoS service in a particular device.  NextService indicates the
   subsequent conditioning service(s) for different traffic streams.

   The class definition is as follows:

      NAME                ConditioningService
      DESCRIPTION         A concrete class to define how traffic
                          is conditioned in the data forwarding
                          path of a host or network device.

   The concept of a Classifier comes from [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>]. ClassifierService
   is a concrete class that represents a logical entity in an ingress or
   egress interface of a device, that takes a single input stream, and
   sorts it into one or more output streams.  The sorting is done by a
   set of filters that select packets based on the packet contents, or
   possibly based on other attributes associated with the packet.  Each
   output stream is the result of matching a particular filter.

   The representation of classifiers in QDDIM is closely related to that
   presented in [<a href="#ref-DSMIB" title='"Management Information Base for the Differentiated Services Architecture"'>DSMIB</a>] and [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>].  Rather than being linked
   directly to its FilterLists, a classifier is modeled here as an
   aggregation of ClassifierElements.  Each of these ClassifierElements
   is then linked to a single FilterList, by the association
   ClassifierElementUsesFilterList.

   A Classifier is modeled as a subclass of ConditioningService so that
   it can be aggregated into a QoSService (using the
   QoSConditioningSubService aggregation), and can use the NextService
   association to identify the subsequent ConditioningService objects
   for the different traffic streams.

   ClassifierService is designed to allow hierarchical classification.
   When hierarchical classification is used, a ClassifierElement may
   point to another ClassifierService.  When used for this purpose, the
   ClassifierElement must not use the ClassifierElementUsesFilterList
   association.

   The class definition is as follows:

      NAME                ClassifierService
      DESCRIPTION         A concrete class describing how an input
                          traffic stream is sorted into multiple
                          output streams using one or more
                          filters.

   The concept of a ClassifierElement comes from [<a href="#ref-DSMIB" title='"Management Information Base for the Differentiated Services Architecture"'>DSMIB</a>].  This concrete
   class represents the linkage, within a single ClassifierService,
   between a FilterList that specifies a set of criteria for selecting
   packets from the stream of packets coming into the ClassifierService,
   and the next ConditioningService to which the selected packets go
   after they leave the ClassifierService.  ClassifierElement has no
   properties of its own.  It is present to serve as the anchor for an
   aggregation with its classifier, and for associations with its
   FilterList and its next ConditioningService.

   When a ClassifierElement is associated with a ClassifierService
   through the NextServiceAfterClassifierElement association, the
   ClassifierElement may not use the ClassifierElementUsesFilterList
   association.  Further, when a ClassifierElement is associated with a
   ClassifierService as described above, the order of processing of the
   associated ClassifierService is a function of the ClassifierOrder
   property of the ClassifierElementInClassifierService aggregation.
   For example, lets assume the following:

   1. ClassifierService (C1) aggregates ClassifierElements (E1), (E2)
      and (E3), with relative ClassifierOrder values of 1, 2, and 3.

   2. ClassifierElements (E1) and (E3) associations to FilterLists (F1)
      and (F3) respectively using the ClassifierElementUsesFilterList
      association.

   3. (E1) &amp; (E3) are associated with Meters (M1) and (M3) through their
      respective NextServiceAfterClassifierElement associations.

   4. (E2) is associated with ClassifierService (C2) through its
      NextServiceAfterClassifierElement association.

   5. ClassifierService (C2) aggregates ClassifierElements (E4) and (E5)
      with relative ClassifierOrder values of 1 and 2.

   6. ClassifierElements (E4) and (E5) have associations to FilterLists
      (F4) and (F5) respectively using the
      ClassifierElementUsesFilterList association.

   In this example, packet processing would match FilterLists in the
   order of (F1), (F4), (F5), and (F3).

   The class definition is as follows:

                          the process by which a classifier
                          uses a filter to select packets
                          to forward to a specific next
                          conditioning service.

   This is a concrete class that represents the metering of network
   traffic.  Metering is the function of monitoring the arrival times of
   packets of a traffic stream, and determining the level of conformance
   of each packet with respect to a pre-established traffic profile.  A
   meter has the ability to invoke different ConditioningServices for
   conforming and non-conforming traffic. Traffic leaving a meter may be
   further conditioned (e.g., dropped or queued) by routing the packet
   to another conditioning element. Please see [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>] for more
   information on metering.

   This class is the base class for defining different types of meters.
   As such, it contains common properties that all meter subclasses
   share.  It is modeled as a ConditioningService so that it can be
   aggregated into a QoSService (using the QoSConditioningSubService

   service.  MeterService also participates in the NextServiceAfterMeter
   association, to identify the subsequent ConditioningService objects
   for conforming and non-conforming traffic.

   The class definition is as follows:

   Note: The MeterType property and the MeterService subclasses provide
   similar information.  The MeterType property is defined for query
   purposes and for future expansion.  It is possible that not all
   MeterServices will require a subclass to define them.  In these
   cases, MeterService will be instantiated directly, and the MeterType
   property will provide the only way of identifying the type of the
   meter.

   This property is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer that is used
   to specify the particular type of meter represented by an instance of
   MeterService.  The following enumeration values are defined:

      1 - Other
      2 - Average Rate Meter
      3 - Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Meter
      4 - Token Bucket Meter

   Note: if the value of MeterType is not one of these four values, it
   SHOULD be interpreted as if it had the value '1' (Other).

   This is a concrete subclass of MeterService that represents a simple
   meter, called an Average Rate Meter.  This type of meter measures the
   average rate at which packets are submitted to it over a specified
   time.  Packets are defined as conformant if their average arrival
   rate does not exceed the specified measuring rate of the meter.  Any
   packet that causes the specified measuring rate to be exceeded is

   This is a concrete subclass of the MeterService class that represents
   the metering of network traffic using a token bucket meter.  Two
   types of token bucket meters are defined using this class - a simple,
   two-parameter bucket meter, and a multi-stage meter.

   A simple token bucket usually has two parameters, an average token
   rate and a burst size, and has two conformance levels: "conforming"
   and "non-conforming".  This class also defines an excess burst size,
   which enables the meter to have three conformance levels
   ("conforming", "partially conforming", and "non-conforming").  In
   this case, packets that exceed the excess burst size are deemed non-
   conforming, while packets that exceed the smaller burst size but are
   less than the excess burst size are deemed partially conforming.
   Operation of these meters is described in [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>].

   The class definition is as follows:

      NAME                TokenBucketMeterService
      DESCRIPTION         A concrete class classifying admitted
                          traffic with respect to a token bucket.
                          Either two or three levels of
                          conformance can be defined.

   This is a concrete class that represents the general process of
   marking some field in a network packet with some value. Subclasses of
   MarkerService identify particular fields to be marked, and introduce
   properties to represent the values to be used in marking these
   fields.  Markers are usually invoked as a result of a preceding
   classifier match.  Operation of markers of various types is described
   in [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>].

   MarkerService is a concrete class because at the time it was defined
   in CIM, its superclass was concrete.  While this class can be
   instantiated, an instance of it would not accomplish anything,
   because both the field to be marked and the value to be used to mark
   it are specified only in subclasses of MarkerService.

   MarkerService is modeled as a ConditioningService so that it can be
   aggregated into a QoSService (using the QoSConditioningSubService
   association) to indicate that its functionality underlies that QoS
   service.  It participates in the NextService association to identify
   the subsequent ConditioningService object that acts on traffic after
   it has been marked by the marker.

   The class definition is as follows:

   This property is an unsigned 8-bit integer, representing a value to

   This is a concrete class that represents the ability to selectively
   drop network traffic, or to invoke another ConditioningService for
   further processing of traffic that is not dropped.  This is the base
   class for different types of droppers. Droppers are distinguished by
   the algorithm that they use to drop traffic.  Please see [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>]
   for more information about the various types of droppers.  Note that
   this class encompasses both Absolute Droppers and Algorithmic
   Droppers from [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>].

   DropperService is modeled as a ConditioningService so that it can be
   aggregated into a QoSService (using the QoSConditioningSubService
   association) to indicate that its functionality underlies that QoS
   service.  It participates in the NextService association to identify
   the subsequent ConditioningService object that acts on any remaining
   traffic that is not dropped.

   NextService has special semantics for droppers, in addition to the
   general "what happens next" semantics that apply to all
   ConditioningServices.  The queue(s) from which a particular dropper
   drops packets are identified by following chain(s) of NextService
   associations "rightwards" from the dropper until they reach a queue.

   This is a concrete class that represents the threshold information of
   a head or tail dropper.  The inherited property DropFrom indicates
   whether a particular instance of this class represents a head dropper
   or a tail dropper.

   A head dropper always examines the same queue from which it drops
   packets, and this queue is always related to the dropper as the

   This is an unsigned 32-bit integer that indicates the queue depth at
   which traffic will be dropped.  For a tail dropper, all newly
   arriving traffic is dropped.  For a head dropper, packets at the
   front of the queue are dropped to make room for new packets, which
   are added at the end.  The value is expressed in bytes.

   This is a concrete class that represents the ability to drop network
   traffic using a Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm. This
   algorithm is described in [<a href="#ref-RED">RED</a>].  The purpose of a RED algorithm is
   to avoid congestion (as opposed to managing congestion).  Instead of
   waiting for the queues to fill up, and then dropping large numbers of
   packets, RED works by monitoring the average queue depth.  When the
   queue depth exceeds a minimum threshold, packets are randomly
   discarded.  These discards cause TCP to slow its transmission rate
   for those connections that experienced the packet discards.  Other
   TCP connections are not affected by these discards.  Please see
   [<a href="#ref-DSMODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for DiffServ Routers"'>DSMODEL</a>] for more information about a dropper.

   A RED dropper always drops packets from a single queue, which is
   related to the dropper as the following service in the NextService
   association.  The queue(s) examined by the drop algorithm are found
   by following the CalculationServiceForDropper association to find the
   dropper's DropThresholdCalculationService, and then following the
   CalculationBasedOnQueue association(s) to find the queue(s) being
   watched.

   The class definition is as follows:

      NAME                REDDropperService
      DESCRIPTION         A concrete class used to describe
                          dropping using the RED algorithm (or
                          one of its variants).

   NOTE:  In [<a href="#ref-DSMIB" title='"Management Information Base for the Differentiated Services Architecture"'>DSMIB</a>], there is a single diffServRandomDropTable, which
   represents the general category of random dropping.  (RED is one type
   of random dropping, but there are also types of random dropping
   distinct from RED.)  The REDDropperService class corresponds to the
   columns in the table that apply to the RED algorithm in particular.

   probability function.  This function governs the rate at which
   packets are subject to being dropped, as a function of the queue
   length.

   This property expresses a drop probability in drops per thousand

   This is a concrete class that represents the ability to conceptualize
   a QoS service as a set of coordinated sub-services. This enables the
   network administrator to map business rules to the network, and the
   network designer to engineer the network such that it can provide
   different functions for different traffic streams.

   This class has two main purposes.  First, it serves as a common base
   class for defining the various sub-services needed to build higher-
   level QoS services.  Second, it serves as a way to consolidate the
   relationships between different types of QoS services and different
   types of ConditioningServices.

   For example, Gold Service may be defined as a QoSService which
   aggregates two QoS services together.  Each of these QoS services
   could be represented by an instance of the class DiffServService, one
   for servicing of very high demand packets (represented by an instance
   of DiffServService itself), and one for the service given to most of
   the packets, represented by an instance of AFService, which is a
   subclass of DiffServService.  The high demand DiffServService
   instance will then use the QoSConditioningSubService aggregation to
   aggregate together the necessary classifiers to indicate which
   traffic it applies to, and the appropriate meters for contract
   limits, the marker to mark the EF PHB in the packets, and the
   queuing-related conditioning services.  The AFService instance will
   also use the QoSConditioningSubService aggregation, to aggregate its
   classifiers and meters, the several markers used to mark the
   different AF PHBs in the packets, and the queuing-related
   conditioning services needed to deliver the packet treatment.

   QoSService is modeled as a type of Service, which is used as the
   anchor point for defining a set of sub-services that implement the
   desired conditioning characteristics for different types of flows.
   It will direct the specific type of conditioning services to be used
   in order to implement this service.

   This is a concrete class representing the use of standard or custom
   DiffServ services to implement a (higher-level) QoS service.  Note
   that a DiffServService object may be just one of a set of coordinated
   QoSSubServices objects that together implement a higher-level QoS
   service.

   DiffServService is modeled as a subclass of QoSService.  This enables
   it to be related to a higher-level QoS service via QoSSubService, as
   well as to specific ConditioningService objects (e.g., metering,
   dropping, queuing, and others) via QoSConditioningSubService.

   This property is a 16-bit unsigned integer, which identifies a
   particular per hop behavior, or family of per hop behaviors.  The
   value here is a Per Hop Behavior Identification Code, as defined in
   [<a href="#ref-R3140" title='"Per Hop Behavior Identification Codes"'>R3140</a>].  Note that as defined, these identification codes use the
   default, recommended, code points for PHBs as part of their
   structure.  These values may well be different from the actual value
   used in the marker, as the marked value is a domain-dependent value.
   The ability to indicate the PHB Identification Code associated with a
   service is helpful for tying the QoS Service to reference documents,
   and for inter-domain coordination and operation.

   This is a concrete class that represents a specialization of the
   general concept of forwarding network traffic, by adding specific
   semantics that characterize the operation of the Assured Forwarding
   (AF) Service ([<a href="#ref-R2597" title='"Assured Forwarding PHB Group"'>R2597</a>]).

   [<a id="ref-R2597" name="ref-R2597">R2597</a>] defines four different AF classes, to represent four
   different treatments of traffic.  A different amount of forwarding
   resources, such as buffer space and bandwidth, are allocated to each
   AF class.  Within each AF class, IP packets are marked with one of
   three possible drop precedence values.  The drop precedence of a
   packet determines the relative importance of that packet compared to
   other packets within the same AF class, if congestion occurs.  A
   congested interface will try to avoid dropping packets marked with a
   lower drop precedence value, by instead discarding packets marked
   with a higher drop precedence value.

   Note that [<a href="#ref-R2597" title='"Assured Forwarding PHB Group"'>R2597</a>] defines 12 DSCPs that together represent the AF Per
   Hop Behavior (PHB) group.  Implementations are free to extend this
   (e.g., add more classes and/or drop precedences).

   The AFService class is modeled as a specialization of
   DiffServService, which is in turn a specialization of QoSService.
   This enables it to be related to higher-level QoS services, as well
   as to lower-level conditioning sub-services (e.g., classification,
   metering, dropping, queuing, and others).

   The class definition is as follows:

   This class represents a logical entity that calculates an average
   queue depth for a queue, based on a smoothing weight and a sampling
   time interval.  It does this calculation on behalf of a RED dropper,
   to allow the dropper to make its decisions whether to drop packets
   based on a smoothed average queue depth for the queue.

   The class definition is as follows:

      NAME                DropThresholdCalculationService
      DESCRIPTION         A concrete class representing a logical
                          entity that calculates an average queue
                          depth for a queue, based on a smoothing

   This property is a 32-bit unsigned integer, ranging between 0 and
   100,000 - specified in thousandths.  It defines the weighting of past
   history in affecting the calculation of the current average queue
   depth.  The current queue depth calculation uses the inverse of this
   value as its factor, and one minus that inverse as the factor for the
   historical average.  The calculation takes the form:

      average = (old_average*(1-inverse of SmoothingWeight))
           + (current_queue_depth*inverse of SmoothingWeight)

   Implementations may choose to limit the acceptable set of values to a
   specified set, such as powers of 2.

   Min and max values are 0 and 100000.

   This property is a 32-bit unsigned integer, defining the number of
   nanoseconds between each calculation of average/smoothed queue depth.
   If this property is not specified, the CalculationService may
   determine an appropriate interval.

   FilterEntryBase is the abstract base class from which all filter
   entry classes are derived.  It serves as the endpoint for the
   EntriesInFilterList aggregation, which groups filter entries into
   filter lists.  Its properties include CIM naming properties and an
   IsNegated boolean property (to easily "NOT" the match information
   specified in an instance of one of its subclasses).

   Because FilterEntryBase has general applicability, it is defined in
   [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>].  See [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>] for the definition of this class.

   This concrete class makes it possible to represent an entire IP
   header filter in a single object.  A property IpVersion identifies
   whether the IP addresses in an instance are IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
   (Since the source and destination IP addresses come from the same
   packet header, they will always be of the same type.)

   This concrete class allows 802.1.source and destination MAC
   addresses, as well as the 802.1 protocol ID, priority, and VLAN
   identifier fields, to be expressed in a single object

   This is a concrete class that models classifying packets using
   traffic-conditioning results stored in a packet preamble by a
   PreambleMarkerService.  See <a href="#section-3.8.3">Section 3.8.3</a> for a discussion of how,
   and why, QDDIM models the capability to store these results in a
   packet preamble.  An instance of PreambleFilter is used to select
   packets based on a two-part string identifying a specific result.
   The logic for this match is "at least one".  That is, a packet with
   multiple results in its preamble matches a filter if at least one of
   these results matches the filter.

   The class definition is as follows:

   for each of these types.

   Note that there are two parallel terminologies for characterizing
   meter results.  The enumeration value "conforming(1)" is sometimes
   described as "in profile," and the value "nonConforming(3)" is
   sometimes described as "out of profile".

   This is a concrete class that aggregates instances of (subclasses of)
   FilterEntryBase via the aggregation EntriesInFilterList.  It is
   possible to aggregate different types of filters into a single
   FilterList - for example, packet header filters (represented by the
   IPHeaderFilter class) and security filters (represented by subclasses
   of FilterEntryBase defined by IPsec).

   The aggregation property EntriesInFilterList.EntrySequence is always
   set to 0, to indicate that the aggregated filter entries are ANDed
   together to form a selector for a class of traffic.

   This is a concrete class that represents the collection of buffers
   used by a QueuingService.  (The association QueueAllocation
   represents this usage.)  The existence and management of individual
   buffers may be modeled in a future document.  At the current level of
   abstraction, modeling the existence of the BufferPool is necessary.
   Long term, it is not sufficient.

   In implementations where there are multiple buffer sizes, an instance
   of BufferPool should be defined for each set of buffers with
   identical or similar sizes.  These instances of buffer pools can then
   be grouped together using the CollectedBuffersPool aggregation.

   Note that this class is derived from CollectionOfMSEs, and not from
   Forwarding or ConditioningService.  A BufferPool is only a collection
   of storage, and is NOT a Service.

   The class definition is as follows:

      NAME                BufferPool

   This property is a 32-bit unsigned integer, identifying the
   approximate number of bytes in each buffer in the buffer pool. An
   implementation will typically group buffers of roughly the same size
   together, to reduce the number of buffer pools it needs to manage.

   This property is a 32-bit unsigned integer, reporting the number of
   buffers in the Pool that are currently not allocated to any instance
   of a QueuingService.  Buffers allocated to a QueuingService could
   either be in use (that is, currently contain packet data), or be

   This is an abstract class that represents the configuration
   information that a PacketSchedulingService has for one of the
   elements that it is scheduling.  The scheduled element is either a
   QueuingService or another PacketSchedulingService.

   Among the subclasses of this class, some are defined in such a way
   that all of their instances are work conserving.  Other subclasses,
   however, may have instances that either are or are not work
   conserving.  In this class, the boolean property WorkConserving
   indicates whether an instance is or is not work conserving.  The
   range of values for WorkConserving is restricted to TRUE in the
   subclasses that are inherently work conserving, since instances of
   these classes cannot be anything other than work conserving.

   This boolean property indicates whether the PacketSchedulingService
   tied to this instance by the ElementInSchedulingService aggregation
   is treating the input tied to this instance by the QueueToSchedule or
   SchedulingServiceToSchedule association in a work-conserving manner.
   Note that this property is writable, indicating that an administrator
   can change the behavior of the SchedulingElement - but only for those
   elements that can operate in a non-workconserving mode.

   This class is a subclass of the abstract class SchedulingElement. It
   introduces five new properties to support bandwidth-based scheduling.
   As is the case with all subclasses of SchedulingElement, the input
   associated with an instance of AllocationSchedulingElement is of one

   This property is a 16-bit unsigned integer enumeration that
   identifies the units in which the BandwidthAllocation and
   BurstAllocation properties are expressed.  The following values are
   defined:

      o bytes(1)
      o packets(2)
      o cells(3)       -- fixed-size, for example, ATM

   This property is a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the amount
   of temporary or short-term bandwidth (in units per second) that can
   be allocated to an input, beyond the amount of bandwidth allocated
   through the BandwidthAllocation property.  If the maximum actual
   bandwidth allocation for the input were to be measured, it would be

   higher probability of being serviced than other inputs.  It also
   introduces a property Priority, to serve as a tiebreaker to be used
   when inputs have equal weighting factors.  As is the case with all
   subclasses of SchedulingElement, the input associated with an
   instance of WRRSchedulingElement is of one of two types: either a
   queue, or another scheduler.

   Because scheduling of this type is always work conserving, the
   inherited boolean property WorkConserving is restricted to the value
   TRUE in this class.

   The class definition is as follows:

      DESCRIPTION       This class specializes the
                        SchedulingElement class to add
                        a per-input weight.  This is used
                        by a weighted round robin packet
                        scheduler when it handles its
                        associated inputs.  It also adds a
                        second property to serve as a tie-breaker
                        in the case where multiple inputs have
                        been assigned the same weight.

   This property is a 32-bit unsigned integer, which defines the
   weighting factor that offers some inputs a higher probability of
   being serviced than other inputs.  This property represents this
   probability.  Its minimum value is 0, its maximum value is 100000,
   and its units are in thousandths.

   This property is a 16-bit unsigned integer, which serves as a
   tiebreaker, in the event that two or more inputs have equal weights.
   A larger value represents a higher priority.  If this property is
   specified for any of the WRRSchedulingElements associated with a
   PacketSchedulingService, then it must be specified for all
   WRRSchedulingElements for that PacketSchedulingService, and the
   property values for these WRRSchedulingElements must all be
   different.

   While this condition may not occur in some implementations of a
   weighted round-robin scheduler, many implementations require a
   priority to resolve an equal-weight condition.  In instances where
   this behavior is not necessary or is undesirable, this property may
   be left unspecified.

   This class is a subclass of the abstract class SchedulingElement. It
   indicates that a scheduler is taking packets from a set of inputs
   using the priority scheduling discipline.  As is the case with all
   subclasses of SchedulingElement, the input associated with an
   instance of PrioritySchedulingElement is of one of two types: either
   a queue, or another scheduler.  The property Priority in
   PrioritySchedulingElement represents the priority for an input,
   relative to the priorities of all the other inputs to which the
   scheduler that aggregates this PrioritySchedulingElement is
   associated.  Inputs to which the scheduler is related via other
   scheduling disciplines do not figure in this prioritization.

   Because scheduling of this type is always work conserving, the
   inherited boolean property WorkConserving is restricted to the value
   TRUE in this class.

   The class definition is as follows:

   This class is a subclass of the class PrioritySchedulingElement,
   which is itself derived from the abstract class SchedulingElement.
   As is the case with all subclasses of SchedulingElement, the input
   associated with an instance of BoundedPrioritySchedulingElement is of
   one of two types: either a queue, or another scheduler.
   BoundedPrioritySchedulingElement adds an upper bound (in kilobits per
   second) on how much traffic can be handled from an input.  This data
   is specific to that one input.  It is needed when bounded strict
   priority scheduling is performed.

   This class inherits from its superclass PrioritySchedulingElement the
   restriction of the inherited boolean property WorkConserving to the
   value TRUE.

   The class definition is as follows:

      NAME              BoundedPrioritySchedulingElement
      DESCRIPTION       This concrete class specializes the
                        PrioritySchedulingElement class to add

   This property is a 32-bit unsigned integer that defines the upper
   limit on the amount of traffic that can be handled from the input.
   This is not a shaped upper bound, since bursts can occur. It is a
   strict bound, limiting the impact of the input.  The units are
   kilobits per second.

   This section details the QoS device datapath associations, including
   the aggregations, which were shown earlier in Figures 4 and 5.  These
   associations are defined as classes in the Information Model.  Each
   of these classes has two properties referring to instances of the two
   classes that the association links.  Some of the association classes
   have additional properties as well.

   This abstract association defines two object references (named
   Antecedent and Dependent) that establish general dependency
   relationships between different managed objects in the information
   model.  The Antecedent reference identifies the independent object in
   the association, while the Dependent reference identifies the entity
   that IS dependent.

   This association defines two object references that establish a

   The Service is the Dependent reference, relying on the

   for a protocol endpoint, the cardinality for the Dependent object
   reference is narrowed from 0..n to 0..1. Since, on the other hand, a
   single ConditioningService can be the first to process packets
   received via multiple protocol endpoints, the cardinality of the
   Antecedent object reference remains 0..n.

   This association is derived from the association
   ServiceSAPDependency, and represents the binding, in the egress
   direction, between a protocol endpoint and the last
   ConditioningService that processes packets before they leave a
   network device via that protocol endpoint.  (This "last"
   ConditioningService is ordinarily a scheduler, but it doesn't have to
   be.)  Since there can be multiple "last" ConditioningServices for a
   protocol endpoint in the case of a fallback scheduler, the
   cardinality for the Dependent object reference remains 0..n.  Since,
   however, a single ConditioningService cannot be the last one to

   head/tail dropper must monitor at least one queue.  For the classes
   HeadTailDropper and HeadTailDropQueueBinding, the rule for combining
   the inputs from multiple queues is simple addition: if the sum of the

   This association defines two object references that establish a

   This association is very similar to the ServiceSAPDependency
   relationship.  For the latter, the Service is dependent on an
   AccessPoint to get at another Service.  In this relationship, it
   directly identifies its Service dependency.  Both relationships
   should not be instantiated, since their information is repetitive.

   one another directly, or they may be mapped to multiple "next"
   Services based on the characteristics of the packet.

   subclass from NextService.  However, meters are 1:n fan-out elements,
   and require a mechanism to distinguish between the different
   results/outputs of the meter.  Therefore, this association defines a
   new key property, MeterResult, which is used to record the result and
   identify the output through which this traffic left the meter.
   Because of this additional key, NextServiceAfterMeter cannot be a
   subclass of NextService.

   The class definition is as follows:

      NAME              NextServiceAfterMeter
      DESCRIPTION       An association used to establish
                        a predecessor-successor relationship
                        between a particular output of a
                        MeterService and the next
                        ConditioningService object that is
                        responsible for further processing of
                        the traffic.

   The preceding MeterService, 'earlier' in the processing sequence for
   a packet.  Since Meters are 1:n fan-out devices, this relationship
   associates a particular output of a MeterService (identified by the
   MeterResult property) to the next ConditioningService that is used to
   further process the traffic.

   This property is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer, and
   represents information describing the result of the metering. Traffic
   is distinguished as being conforming, non-conforming, or partially
   conforming.  More complicated metering can be built either by
   extending the enumeration or by cascading meters.

   The enumerated values are: "Unknown" (0), "Conforming" (1),
   "PartiallyConforming" (2), "NonConforming" (3).

   but there is an additional constraint on participation in this
   association.  A particular instance of (a subclass of)
   SchedulingElement always participates either in exactly one instance
   of this association, or in exactly one instance of the association
   SchedulingServiceToSchedule.

   ClassifierService are presented with packets coming into the
   classifier.  This property is an unsigned 32-bit integer representing
   this order.  Values are represented in ascending order: first '1',
   then '2', and so on.  Different values MUST be assigned for each of
   the ClassifierElements aggregated by a given ClassifierService.

   This aggregation is a specialization of the Component aggregation; it
   is used to define a set of filter entries (subclasses of
   FilterEntryBase) that are aggregated by a FilterList.

   The cardinalities of the aggregation itself are 0..1 on the
   FilterList end, and 0..n on the FilterEntryBase end.  Thus in the
   general case, a filter entry can exist without being aggregated into

   any FilterList.  However, the only way a filter entry can figure in
   the QoS Device model is by being aggregated into a FilterList by this
   aggregation.

   This concrete aggregation represents the relationship between a
   PacketSchedulingService and the set of SchedulingElements that tie it
   to its inputs.

   The class definition for the aggregation is as follows:

      NAME              ElementInSchedulingService
      DESCRIPTION       An aggregation used to tie a
                        PacketSchedlingService to the
                        configuration information for one of
                        the elements (either a QueuingService or
                        another PacketSchedulingService) that it
                        schedules.
      DERIVED FROM      Component
      ABSTRACT          False
      PROPERTIES        GroupComponent[ref
                          PacketSchedulingService[0..1]],
                        PartComponent[ref
                           SchedulingElement[1..n]

   This property is overridden in this aggregation to represent an
   object reference to a PacketSchedulingService object (instead of to
   the more generic Service object defined in its superclass). It also
   restricts the cardinality of the aggregate to 0..1 (instead of the
   more generic 0-or-more), representing the fact that a
   SchedulingElement exists within the context of at most one
   PacketSchedulingService.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.28.2.%20%20The%20Reference%20PartComponent"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.28.2" name="section-4.4.28.2">4.4.28.2</a>.  The Reference PartComponent</span>

   This property is overridden in this aggregation to represent an
   object reference to a SchedulingElement object (instead of to the
   more generic Service object defined in its superclass).  This object
   represents a single scheduling element for the scheduler. It also
   restricts the cardinality of the SchedulingElement to 1..n (instead
   of the more generic 0-or-more), representing the fact that a
   PacketSchedulingService always includes at least one
   SchedulingElement.

   Like [<a href="#ref-PCIM" title='"Policy Core Information Model - Version 1 Specification"'>PCIM</a>] and [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>], this document defines an information model
   that cannot be implemented directly.  Consequently, security issues
   do not arise until it is mapped to an actual, implementable data
   model such as a MIB, PIB, or LDAP schema.  See [<a href="#ref-PCIM" title='"Policy Core Information Model - Version 1 Specification"'>PCIM</a>] for a general
   discussion of security considerations for information models.  See
   also [<a href="#ref-DSMIB" title='"Management Information Base for the Differentiated Services Architecture"'>DSMIB</a>] (which in fact is a data model that corresponds to a
   large extent with the QDDIM information model), for a discussion of
   the security implications of specific objects in the model.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Appendix%20A%3A"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>:  </span>Naming Instances in a Native CIM Implementation

   Following the precedent established in [<a href="#ref-PCIM" title='"Policy Core Information Model - Version 1 Specification"'>PCIM</a>], this document has
   placed the details of how to name instances of its classes in a
   native CIM implementation here in an appendix.  Since <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> in
   [<a href="#ref-PCIM" title='"Policy Core Information Model - Version 1 Specification"'>PCIM</a>] has a lengthy discussion of the general principles of CIM
   naming, this appendix does not repeat that information here.  Readers
   interested in a more global discussion of how instances are named in
   a native CIM implementation should refer to [<a href="#ref-PCIM" title='"Policy Core Information Model - Version 1 Specification"'>PCIM</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.1.%20%20Naming%20Instances%20of%20the%20Classes%20Derived%20from%20Service"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.1" name="section-9.1">9.1</a>.  Naming Instances of the Classes Derived from Service</span>

   Most of the classes defined in this model are derived from the CIM
   class Service.  Although Service is an abstract class, it
   nevertheless has key properties included as part of its definition.
   The purpose of including key properties in an abstract class is to
   have instances of all of its instantiable subclasses named in the
   same way.  Thus, the majority of the classes in this model name their
   instances in exactly the same way: with the two key properties
   CreationClassName and Name that they inherit from Service.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.2.%20%20Naming%20Instances%20of%20Subclasses%20of%20FilterEntryBase"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.2" name="section-9.2">9.2</a>.  Naming Instances of Subclasses of FilterEntryBase</span>

   Like Service, FilterEntryBase (defined in [<a href="#ref-PCIME" title='"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions"'>PCIME</a>]) is an abstract
   class that includes key properties in its definition.
   FilterEntryBase has four key properties.  Two of them,
   SystemCreationClassName and SystemName, are propagated to it via the
   weak association FilterEntryInSystem.  The other two,
   CreationClassName and Name, are native to FilterEntryBase.

   Thus, instances of all of the subclasses of FilterEntryBase,
   including the PreambleFilter class defined here, are named in the
   same way: with the four key properties they inherit from
   FilterEntryBase.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.3.%20%20Naming%20Instances%20of%20ProtocolEndpoint"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.3" name="section-9.3">9.3</a>.  Naming Instances of ProtocolEndpoint</span>

   The class ProtocolEndpoint inherits its key properties from its
   superclass, ServiceAccessPoint.  These key properties provide the
   same naming structure that we've seen before: two propagated key
   properties SystemCreationClassName and SystemName, plus two native
   key properties CreationClassName and Name.

   Unlike the other classes in this model, BufferPool is not derived
   from Service.  Consequently, it does not inherit its key properties
   from Service.  Instead, it inherits one of its key properties,
   CollectionID, from its superclass Collection, and adds its other key
   property, CreationClassName, in its own definition.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.4.1.%20%20The%20Property%20CollectionID"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.4.1" name="section-9.4.1">9.4.1</a>.  The Property CollectionID</span>

   CollectionID is a string property with a maximum length of 256
   characters.  It identifies the buffer pool.  Note that this property
   is defined in the BufferPool class's superclass, CollectionOfMSEs,
   but not as a key property.  It is overridden in BufferPool, to make
   it part of this class's composite key.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.4.2.%20%20The%20Property%20CreationClassName"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.4.2" name="section-9.4.2">9.4.2</a>.  The Property CreationClassName</span>

   This property is a string property of with a maximum length of 256
   characters.  It is set to "CIM_BufferPool" if this class is directly
   instantiated, or to the class name of the BufferPool subclass that is
   created.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.5.%20%20Naming%20Instances%20of%20SchedulingElement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.5" name="section-9.5">9.5</a>.  Naming Instances of SchedulingElement</span>

   This class has not yet been incorporated into the CIM model, so it
   does not have any CIM naming properties yet.  If the normal pattern
   is followed, however, instances will be named with two properties
   CreationClassName and Name.
