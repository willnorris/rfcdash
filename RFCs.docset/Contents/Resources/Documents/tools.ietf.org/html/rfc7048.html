   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] includes Neighbor Unreachability
   Detection (NUD), which detects when a neighbor is no longer
   reachable.  The timeouts specified for NUD are very short (by
   default, three transmissions spaced one second apart).  These short
   timeouts can be appropriate when there are alternative neighbors to
   which the packets can be sent -- for example, if a host has multiple
   default routers in its Default Router List or if the host has a
   Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) created by a Redirect message.  In those
   cases, when NUD fails, the host will try the alternative neighbor by
   redoing the next-hop selection.  That implies picking the next router
   in the Default Router List or discarding the NCE created by a
   Redirect message, respectively.

   The timeouts specified in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] were chosen to be short in order
   to optimize scenarios where alternative neighbors are available.

   However, when there is no alternative neighbor, there are several
   benefits to making NUD probe for a longer time.  One benefit is to
   make NUD more robust against transient failures, such as spanning

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7048.html">RFC 7048</a>                  NUD Is Too Impatient              January 2014</span>


   tree reconvergence and other layer 2 issues that can take many
   seconds to resolve.  Marking the NCE as unreachable, in that case,
   causes additional multicast on the network.  Assuming there are IP
   packets to send, the lack of an NCE will result in multicast Neighbor
   Solicitations being sent (to the solicited-node multicast address)
   every second instead of the unicast Neighbor Solicitations that NUD
   sends.

   As a result, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is operationally more brittle
   than the IPv4 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  For IPv4, there is
   no mandatory time limit on the retransmission behavior for ARP
   [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0826" title='"Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol: Or converting network protocol addresses to 48.bit Ethernet address for transmission on Ethernet hardware"'>RFC0826</a>], which allows implementors to pick more robust schemes.

   The following constant values in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] seem to have been made
   part of IPv6 conformance testing: MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT,
   MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT, and RETRANS_TIMER.  While such strict
   conformance testing seems consistent with [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>], it means that
   the standard needs to be updated to allow IPv6 Neighbor Discovery to
   be as robust as ARP.

   This document updates <a href="rfc4861.html">RFC 4861</a> to relax the retransmission rules.

   Additional motivations for making IPv6 Neighbor Discovery more robust
   in the face of degenerate conditions are covered in [<a href="rfc6583.html" title='"Operational Neighbor Discovery Problems"'>RFC6583</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Protocol%20Updates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Protocol Updates</span>

   Discarding the NCE after three packets spaced one second apart is
   only needed when an alternative neighbor is available, such as an
   additional default router or discarding an NCE created by a Redirect.

   If an implementation transmits more than MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT/
   MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT packets, then it SHOULD use the exponential
   backoff of the retransmit timer.  This is to avoid any significant
   load due to a steady background level of retransmissions from
   implementations that retransmit a large number of Neighbor
   Solicitations (NS) before discarding the NCE.

   Even if there is no alternative neighbor, the protocol needs to be
   able to handle the case when the link-layer address of the neighbor/
   target has changed by switching to multicast Neighbor Solicitations
   at some point in time.

   In order to capture all the cases above, this document introduces a
   new UNREACHABLE state in the conceptual model described in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].
   An NCE in the UNREACHABLE state retains the link-layer address, and
   IPv6 packets continue to be sent to that link-layer address.  But in
   the UNREACHABLE state, the NUD Neighbor Solicitations are multicast
   (to the solicited-node multicast address), using a timeout that
   follows an exponential backoff.

   In the places where [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] says to discard/delete the NCE after N
   probes (Sections <a href="#section-7.3">7.3</a> and <a href="#section-7.3.3">7.3.3</a>, and <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>), this document
   instead specifies a transition to the UNREACHABLE state.

   If the Neighbor Cache Entry was created by a Redirect message, a node
   MAY delete the NCE instead of changing its state to UNREACHABLE.  In
   any case, the node SHOULD NOT use an NCE created by a Redirect to
   send packets if that NCE is in the UNREACHABLE state.  Packets should
   be sent following the next-hop selection algorithm in <a href="rfc4861.html#section-5.2">[RFC4861],
   Section 5.2</a>, which disregards NCEs that are not reachable.

   <a href="rfc4861.html#section-6.3.6">Section 6.3.6 of [RFC4861]</a> indicates that default routers that are
   "known to be reachable" are preferred.  For the purposes of that
   section, if the NCE for the router is in the UNREACHABLE state, it is
   not known to be reachable.  Thus, the particular text in
   <a href="#section-6.3.6">Section 6.3.6</a> that says "in any state other than INCOMPLETE" needs to
   be extended to say "in any state other than INCOMPLETE or
   UNREACHABLE".

   Apart from the use of multicast NS instead of unicast NS, and the
   exponential backoff of the timer, the UNREACHABLE state works the
   same as the current PROBE state.

   A node MAY garbage collect a Neighbor Cache Entry at any time as
   specified in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  This freedom to garbage collect does not
   change with the introduction of the UNREACHABLE state in the
   conceptual model.  An implementation MAY prefer garbage collecting
   UNREACHABLE NCEs over other NCEs.

   There is a non-obvious extension to the state-machine description in
   <a href="rfc4861.html#appendix-C">Appendix C of [RFC4861]</a> in the case for "NA, Solicited=1, Override=0.
   Different link-layer address than cached".  There we need to add
   "UNREACHABLE" to the current list of "STALE, PROBE, Or DELAY".  That
   is, the NCE would be unchanged.  Note that there is no corresponding
   change necessary to the text in <a href="rfc4861.html#section-7.2.5">[RFC4861], Section 7.2.5</a>, since it is
   phrased using "Otherwise" instead of explicitly listing the three
   states.

   The other state transitions described in <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a> handle the
   introduction of the UNREACHABLE state without any change, since they
   are described using "not INCOMPLETE".

   There is also the more obvious change already described above.
   [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] has this:

   State           Event                   Action             New state

   PROBE           Retransmit timeout,     Discard entry         -
                   N or more
                   retransmissions.

   That needs to be replaced by:

   State           Event                   Action             New state

   PROBE           Retransmit timeout,     Increase timeout  UNREACHABLE
                   N retransmissions.      Send multicast NS

   UNREACHABLE     Retransmit timeout      Increase timeout  UNREACHABLE
                                           Send multicast NS

   The exponential backoff SHOULD be clamped at some reasonable maximum
   retransmit timeout, such as 60 seconds (see MAX_RETRANS_TIMER below).
   If there is no IPv6 packet sent using the UNREACHABLE NCE, then it is
   RECOMMENDED to stop the retransmits of the multicast NS until either
   the NCE is garbage collected or there are IPv6 packets sent using the
   NCE.  The multicast NS and associated exponential backoff can be
   applied on the condition of continued use of the NCE to send IPv6
   packets to the recorded link-layer address.

   A node can unicast the first few Neighbor Solicitation messages even
   while in the UNREACHABLE state, but it MUST switch to multicast
   Neighbor Solicitations within 60 seconds of the initial
   retransmission to be able to handle a link-layer address change for
   the target.  The example below shows such behavior.

   This section is NOT normative but specifies a simple implementation
   that conforms with this document.  The implementation is described
   using operator-configurable values that allow it to be configured to
   be compatible with the retransmission behavior in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  The
   operator can configure the values for MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT,
   MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT, RETRANS_TIMER, and the new BACKOFF_MULTIPLE,
   MAX_RETRANS_TIMER, and MARK_UNREACHABLE.  This allows the
   implementation to be as simple as:

   next_retrans = ($BACKOFF_MULTIPLE ^ $solicit_retrans_num) *
   $RetransTimer * $JitterFactor where solicit_retrans_num is zero for
   the first transmission, and JitterFactor is a random value between
   MIN_RANDOM_FACTOR and MAX_RANDOM_FACTOR [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] to avoid any
   synchronization of transmissions from different hosts.

   After MARK_UNREACHABLE transmissions, the implementation would mark
   the NCE UNREACHABLE and as a result explore alternate next hops.
   After MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT, the implementation would switch to
   multicast NUD probes.

   The behavior of this example algorithm is to have 5 attempts, with
   time spacing of 0 (initial request), 1 second later, 3 seconds after
   the first retransmission, then 9, then 27, and switch to UNREACHABLE
   after the first three transmissions.  Thus, relative to the time of
   the first transmissions, the retransmissions would occur at 1 second,
   4 seconds, 13 seconds, and finally 40 seconds.  At 4 seconds from the
   first transmission, the NCE would be marked UNREACHABLE.  That
   behavior corresponds to:

      MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT=5

      RETRANS_TIMER=1 (default)

      MAX_RETRANS_TIMER=60

      BACKOFF_MULTIPLE=3

      MARK_UNREACHABLE=3

   After 3 retransmissions, the implementation would mark the NCE
   UNREACHABLE.  That results in trying an alternative neighbor, such as
   another default router, or ignoring an NCE created by a Redirect as
   specified in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  With the above values, that would occur
   after 4 seconds following the first transmission compared to the

   2 seconds using the fixed scheme in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  That additional
   delay is small compared to the default ReachableTime of
   30,000 milliseconds.

   After 5 transmissions, i.e., 40 seconds after the initial
   transmission, the example behavior is to switch to multicast NUD
   probes.  In the language of the state machine in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>], that
   corresponds to the action "Discard entry".  Thus, any attempts to
   send future packets would result in sending multicast NS packets.  An
   implementation MAY retain the backoff value as it switches to
   multicast NUD probes.  The potential downside of deferring switching
   to multicast is that it would take longer for NUD to handle a change
   in a link-layer address, i.e., the case when a host or a router
   changes its link-layer address while keeping the same IPv6 address.
   However, [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] says that a node MAY send unsolicited NS to handle
   that case, which is rather infrequent in operational networks.  In
   any case, the implementation needs to follow the "SHOULD" in
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> to switch to multicast solutions within 60 seconds after
   the initial transmission.

   If BACKOFF_MULTIPLE=1, MARK_UNREACHABLE=3, and MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT=3,
   you would get the same behavior as in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

   If the request was not answered at first -- due, for example, to a
   transitory condition -- an implementation following this algorithm
   would retry immediately and then back off for progressively longer
   periods.  This would allow for a reasonably fast resolution time when
   the transitory condition clears.

   Note that RetransTimer and ReachableTime are by default set from the
   protocol constants RETRANS_TIMER and REACHABLE_TIME but are
   overridden by values advertised in Router Advertisements as specified
   in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].  That remains the case even with the protocol updates
   specified in this document.  The key values that the operator would
   configure are BACKOFF_MULTIPLE, MAX_RETRANS_TIMER,
   MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT, and MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT.

   It is useful to have a maximum value for
   ($BACKOFF_MULTIPLE^$solicit_attempt_num)*$RetransTimer so that the
   retransmissions are not too far apart.  The above value of 60 seconds
   for this MAX_RETRANS_TIMER is consistent with DHCPv6.
