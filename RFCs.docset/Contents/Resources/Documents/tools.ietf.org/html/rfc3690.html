Abstract

   This document presents a list of requirements in support of Emergency
   Telecommunications Service (ETS) within the context of IP telephony.
   It is an extension to the general requirements presented in <a href="rfc3689.html">RFC 3689</a>.
   Solutions to these requirements are not presented in this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Effective telecommunications capabilities can be imperative to
   facilitate immediate recovery operations for serious disaster events,
   such as, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks.
   Disasters can happen unexpectedly, at any time or place.  Quick
   response for recovery operations requires immediate access to any
   public telecommunications capabilities at hand.  These capabilities
   include:  conventional telephone, cellular phones, and Internet
   access via online terminals, IP telephones, and wireless Personal
   Digital Assistants (PDAs).  The commercial telecommunications
   infrastructure is rapidly evolving to Internet-based technology.
   Therefore, the Internet community needs to consider how it can best
   support emergency management and recovery operations.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>1</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Problem"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Problem</span>

   Standards have been developed by other standards bodies concerning
   emergency communications.  As discussed in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"General System Requirements for Emergency Telecommunications Service"'>3</a>], some of these
   standards, such as T1.631 [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Signaling System No. 7(SS7): High Probability of Completion (HPC) Network Capability"'>5</a>], define specific indicators or labels
   for emergency communications in Signaling System 7 (SS7) networks.
   Certain requirements must be defined in order to achieve peering
   across hybrid networks (networks that communicate between IP and
   other types of networks, such as that realized by the Public Switched
   Telephone Network) in order to achieve an interworking of services.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Scope</span>

   [<a id="ref-3" name="ref-3">3</a>] has defined a set of general system requirements to support
   Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS).  This document defines an
   additional set of system requirements to achieve support for ETS
   within the specific context of IP telephony (note that this document
   views IP telephony within the context of an end-to-end application
   layer service).  Solutions to requirements are not defined.  The
   document does not specify protocol enhancements or specifications.

   Note that [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Requirements for Resource Priority Mechanisms for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>4</a>], Requirements for Resource Priority Mechanisms for the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), is an RFC that shares some overlap
   with this document.  However, [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Requirements for Resource Priority Mechanisms for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>4</a>] only applies to SIP and is not
   meant to be applied to a more general perspective of IP telephony as
   it relates to ETS.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Out%20of%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Out of Scope</span>

   An item that is not in scope of this document is mandating acceptance
   and support of the requirements presented in this document.  The IETF
   does not mandate requirements or capabilities to independent networks
   that comprise the Internet.  As an example, Internet Service
   Providers (ISP) may choose not to operate any telephony-related
   gateways or services.  The IETF cannot and does not mandate that an
   ISP deploy either telephony-related gateways or telephony-related
   services.  There is an expectation that business contracts, for
   example Service Level Agreements (SLA), will be used to satisfy those
   following requirements that apply to service providers.  Absence of
   an SLA implies best effort service is provided.

   It is assumed that some ISPs will choose to offer ETS services and
   that other carriers will choose not to offer ETS services.  These
   requirements do not apply to ISPs that have chosen not to offer ETS
   services.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20IP%20Telephony%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  IP Telephony Requirements</span>

   The requirements in this section relate only to Telephony Signaling
   as used in Internet-based telephony services.  They are an extension
   to the general requirements specified in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"General System Requirements for Emergency Telecommunications Service"'>3</a>].  The following
   requirements explicitly do not relate to IP-layer mechanisms, such as
   Differentiated Services or Integrated Services.

   1) Telephony signaling applications used with Internet-based
      telephony MUST be able to carry labels.

   2) The ability to carry labels MUST be extensible to support various
      types and numbers of labels.  A single binary value will not be
      sufficient given the various labeling standards in existence
      today.

   3) Telephony signaling labels SHOULD have a mapping with the various
      emergency related labels/markings used in other telephony based
      networks, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
      This ensures that a telephone call placed over a hybrid
      infrastructure (traditional PSTN over some portion(s) of the path,
      Internet telephony over some other portion(s) of the path) can
      carry the labels end-to-end with appropriate translation at
      PSTN/Internet boundaries.  Absence of a mapping means that the
      signaling reverts to a default service (presumably one attributed
      to the general public).

   4) Application layer IP telephony capabilities MUST NOT preclude the
      ability to do application layer accounting.

      Accounting is a useful feature in support of billing and tracking
      down abuse of service.  If specific solutions or protocols in
      support of ETS require accounting, then this will be articulated
      in future document(s).

   5) Application layer mechanisms in gateways and stateful proxies that
      are specifically in place to recognize ETS type labels MUST be
      able to support "best available" service (this will probably be
      realized as better than best effort).  These labels MAY exist in
      the application layer headers of data (i.e., bearer) traffic or
      signaling traffic used for call completion.

      The support for best available service SHOULD focus on probability
      of forwarding packets.  Probability MAY reach 100% depending on
      the local policy associated with the label.  Local policy MUST
      also be used to determine if better than best effort is to be
      applied to a specific label (or related set of labels).

      Additional comments on this topic are presented below in item 2 of
      <a href="#section-4">section 4</a>.

      The above paragraphs MUST be taken in their entirety.  The ability
      to support best available service does not mean that the
      application layer mechanism is expected to be activated.  Further,
      we do not define the means by which best available service is
      realized.  Application layer mechanisms that do not recognize ETS
      type labels are not subject to this requirement.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Issues"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Issues</span>

   This section presents issues that arise in considering solutions for
   the telephony requirements that have been defined for ETS.  This
   section does not specify solutions, nor is it to be confused with
   requirements.  Subsequent documents that articulate a more specific
   set of requirements for a particular service may make a statement
   about the following issues.

   1) Alternate paths

      Experience with The Government Emergency Telecommunications
      Service (GETS) over the PSTN has shown the utility of alternate
      paths to a destination to help facilitate emergency-related
      communications.  From the perspective of the Internet, this
      utility may be difficult to achieve and have a more limited
      benefit.  Unlike the PSTN, which creates a fixed path during call
      setup phase, the Internet uses dynamic routing for IP packets.
      This dynamic routing capability automatically causes IP packets to
      travel the best current path.  The Internet network infrastructure
      does not have the concept of a "call" or the concept of "call
      setup", though IP telephony applications might have application
      layer awareness of calls or the call setup concept.

   2) Application of Best Available Service

      In item 5 of <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> above, we discuss the requirement of
      supporting best available service.  We note that in this document,
      the scope of that support is constrained to the application layer
      and flows that traverse that layer.  This may involve direct
      support for the flow containing the ETS type label, or may involve
      indirect support (e.g., ETS labels in signaling messages that

      It is critical to understand that how the support for best
      available service can be realized is outside the scope of this
      document.  In addition, the perceived effectiveness of a given
      approach or implementation is also outside the scope of this
      document.

   Only authorized users or operators SHOULD be able to create non-
   ordinary Labels (i.e., labels that may alter the default best effort
   service).  Labels SHOULD be associated with mechanisms to provide
   strong end-to-end integrity during their transmission through the
   telephony systems.  Finally, in cases where labels are expected to be
   acted upon by operators, these operators SHOULD have the capability
   of authenticating the label on a received message or transmission in
   order to prevent theft of service and reduce risk of denial of
   service (e.g., by unauthorized users consuming any limited
   resources).

   Security is also discussed in the general requirements of [<a href="#ref-3" title='"General System Requirements for Emergency Telecommunications Service"'>3</a>], which
   applies to <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> above.
