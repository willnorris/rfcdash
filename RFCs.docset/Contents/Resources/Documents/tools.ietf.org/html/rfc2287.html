   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a basic set of managed objects for fault,
   configuration and performance management of applications from a
   systems perspective.  More specifically, the managed objects are
   restricted to information that can be determined from the system
   itself and which does not require special instrumentation within the
   applications to make the information available.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-1" title="(December">1</a>],
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI)  (See RFC

   1902 [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure of Management Information for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>]). In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type
   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we often
   use a textual string, termed the object descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   The primary purpose of computing technologies is the execution of
   application software. These applications, typically specialized
   collections of executables, files, and interprocess communications,
   exist to solve business, scientific or other "problems". The
   configuration, fault detection, performance monitoring and control of
   application software across its life on a host computer is of great
   economic importance. For the purposes of our work, we define
   applications as one or more units of executable code and other
   resources, installed on a single host system that a manager may think
   of as a single object for management purposes.

   The information described by the objects in the System Application
   MIB support configuration, fault, and performance management; they
   represent some of the basic attributes of application software from a
   systems (non-application specific) perspective.  The information
   allows for the description of applications as collections of
   executables and files installed and executing on a host computer.

   This memo is concerned primarily with, and defines a model for,
   application information resident on a host computer which can be
   determined from the system itself, and not from the individual
   applications.  This system-level view of applications is designed to
   provide information about software applications installed and running
   on the host system without requiring modifications and code additions
   to the applications themselves.  This approach was taken to insure
   ease and speed of implementation, while allowing room for future
   growth.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Architecture%20for%20Application%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Architecture for Application Management</span>

   In the area of application management it is fully acknowledged and
   even expected that additional MIB modules will be defined over time
   to provide an even greater level of detail regarding applications.
   This MIB module presents the most general case:  a set of management
   objects for providing generic information about applications and
   whose object values can be determined from the computer system itself
   without requiring instrumentation within the application.





<span class="grey">Krupczak &amp; Saperia          Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2287.html">RFC 2287</a>                  MIB for Applications             February 1998</span>


   A finer-grained level of detail is planned for the future "appl MIB"
   which will be a common set of management objects relating to generic
   applications, but which require some type of instrumentation in the
   application in order to be determined.  Since the applmib MIB module
   will provide a finer level of detail, any connection to the sysAppl
   MIB should be made by having references from the more detailed appl
   MIB back to the more generic sysAppl MIB.  Likewise, as application-
   specific MIB modules such as the WWW MIB, etc., are developed over
   time, these more specific MIBs should reference back to the more
   generic MIBs.

   While this MIB module does not attempt to provide every detailed
   piece of information for managing applications, it does provide a
   basic systems-level view of the applications and their components on
   a single host system.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20The%20Structure%20of%20the%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  The Structure of the MIB</span>

   The System Application MIB structure models application packages as a
   whole, and also models the individual elements (files and
   executables) which collectively form an application.  The MIB is
   structured to model information regarding installed application
   packages and the elements which make up each application package. The
   MIB also models activity information on applications (and in turn,
   their components) that are running or have previously run on the host
   system.  In modeling applications and their elements, this MIB module
   provides the necessary link for associating executing processes with
   the applications of which they are a part.

   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

       -  System Application Installed Group
              - sysApplInstallPkgTable
              - sysApplInstallElmtTable

       -  System Application Run Group
              - sysApplRunTable
              - sysApplPastRunTable
              - sysApplElmtRunTable
              - sysApplElmtPastRunTable
              - (scalars for restricting table sizes)

       -  System Application Map Group
              - sysApplMapTable

   As can be seen by the arrangement above, for each category, the MIB
   first treats an application package as a whole, and then breaks down
   the package to provide information about each of the elements
   (executable and non-executable files) of the package.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20System%20Application%20Installed%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  System Application Installed Group</span>

   The System Application Installed group consists of two tables.
   Through these two tables, administrators will be able to determine
   which applications have been installed on a system and what their
   constituent components are.  The first table, the
   sysApplInstallPkgTable, lists the application packages installed on a
   particular host. The second, the sysApplInstallElmtTable, provides
   information regarding the executables and non-executable files, or
   elements, which collectively compose an application.

   NOTE: This MIB is intended to work with applications that have been
   installed on a particular host, where "installed" means that the
   existence of the application and the association between an
   application and its component files can be discovered without
   requiring additional instrumentation of the application itself.  This
   may require that certain conventions be used, such as using a central
   software installation mechanism or registry, when installing
   application packages.  For example, many UNIX systems utilize a
   "pkgadd" utility to track installed application packages, while many
   PC systems utilize a global registry.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20System%20Application%20Run%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  System Application Run Group</span>

   This group models activity information for applications that have
   been invoked and are either currently running, or have previously
   run, on the host system.  Likewise, the individual elements of an
   invoked application are also modeled to show currently running
   processes, and processes that have run in the past.  This information
   is modeled using two pairs of tables: a pair of tables for currently
   running applications and past run applications, and a pair of tables
   for the currently running elements and the past run elements.  Seven
   scalars are also defined to control the size of the past run tables.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.1.%20%20sysApplRunTable%20and%20sysApplPastRunTable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.1" name="section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  sysApplRunTable and sysApplPastRunTable</span>

   The sysApplRunTable and the sysApplPastRunTable make up the first
   pair of tables.  The sysApplRunTable contains the application
   instances which are currently running on the host.  Each time an
   application is invoked, a new entry is created in the sysApplRunTable
   to provide information about that particular invocation of the
   application.  An entry will remain in this table until the

   application instance terminates, at which time the entry will be
   deleted from the sysApplRunTable and placed in the
   sysApplPastRunTable.

   The sysApplPastRunTable maintains a history of instances of
   applications which have previously executed on the host.  Entries to
   this table are made when an invoked application from the
   sysApplRunTable terminates; the table entry which represents the
   application instance is removed from the SysApplRunTable and a
   corresponding entry is added to the sysApplPastRunTable.

   Because the sysApplPastRunTable will continuously grow as
   applications are executed and terminate, two scalars are defined to
   control the aging-out of table entries. The value of
   sysApplPastRunMaxRows specifies the maximum number of entries the
   table may contain, while the sysApplPastRunTblTimeLimit specifies the
   maximum age of the table entries.  Oldest entries are removed first.

   It is important to note that the sysApplRunTable and
   sysApplPastRunTable contain entries for each INVOCATION of an
   application. A single application package might be invoked multiple
   times; each invocation is properly recorded by a separate entry in
   the sysApplRunTable.

   In order to implement this group, the agent must be able to recognize
   that an application has been invoked, and be able to determine when
   that invocation terminates.  This poses a complex problem since a
   single application invocation may involve numerous processes, some of
   which may be required to remain running throughout the duration of
   the application, others which might come and go.  The
   sysApplInstallElmtRole columnar object in the sysApplInstallElmtTable
   is meant to assist in this task by indicating which element is the
   application's primary executable, which elements must be running in
   order for the application to be running, which elements are dependent
   on required elements, etc.  See the description of
   sysApplInstallElmtRole for more details.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.2.%20%20sysApplElmtRunTable%20and%20sysApplElmtPastRunTable"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.2" name="section-5.2.2">5.2.2</a>.  sysApplElmtRunTable and sysApplElmtPastRunTable</span>

   While the sysApplRunTable and sysApplPastRunTable focus on
   applications as a whole, the sysApplElmtRunTable and
   sysApplElmtPastRunTable provide information regarding an
   application's executable elements, (processes), which are either
   currently executing or have executed in the past.

   The sysApplElmtRunTable contains an entry for every process currently
   running on the host.  An entry is created in this table for each
   process at the time it is started, and will remain in the table until

   the process terminates.  Note that in order to provide complete
   information on the load on the system, this table lists EVERY running
   process, not just those processes that are running as part of an
   identified application.  However, when processes terminate, only
   information from entries corresponding to elements of an identified
   application are moved to the sysApplElmtPastRunTable.

   The sysApplElmtPastRunTable maintains a history of processes which
   have previously executed on the host as part of an application. When
   a process from the sysApplElmtRunTable terminates, the entry's
   information is moved to this sysApplElmtPastRunTable provided that
   the process was part of an identified application.  If the process
   cannot be associated with any 'parent' application, then it is simply
   removed from the sysApplElmtRunTable.  This allows for processes like
   'ps' or 'grep' to show up in the sysApplElmtRunTable, (where they are
   consuming resources and are thus "interesting"), but not in the
   sysApplElmtPastRunTable.

   Because the sysApplElmtPastRunTable will continuously grow as
   processes are executed and terminate, two scalars are defined to
   control the aging-out of table entries.  The value of
   sysApplElmtPastRunMaxRows specifies the maximum number of entries the
   table may contain, while the sysApplElmtPastRunTblTimeLimit specifies
   the maximum age of the table entries.  Oldest entries are removed
   first.

   The System Application Map group contains a single table, the
   sysApplMapTable, whose sole purpose is to provide a backwards mapping
   for determining the invoked application, installed element, and
   installed application package given a known process identification
   number.

           If any one of the REQUIRED elements is not running,
           the application instance may be in the process of exiting.

   This section discusses implementation issues that are important for
   both an agent developer, and a management application developer or
   user to understand with regards to this MIB module.  Although this
   section does not attempt to prescribe a particular implementation
   strategy, it does attempt to recognize some of the real world
   limitations that could effect an implementation of this MIB module.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.%20%20Implementation%20with%20Polling%20Agents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Implementation with Polling Agents</span>

   Implementations of the System Application MIB on popular operating
   systems might require some considerable processing power to obtain
   status information from the managed resources.  It might also be
   difficult to determine when an application or a process starts or
   finishes. Implementors of this MIB might therefore choose an
   implementation approach where the agent polls the managed resources
   at regular intervals. The information retrieved by every poll is used
   to update a cached version of this MIB maintained inside of the
   agent. SNMP request are processed based on the information found in
   this MIB cache.

   A scalar sysApplAgentPollInterval is defined to give the manager
   control over the polling frequency. There is a trade- off between the
   amount of resources consumed during every poll to update the MIB
   cache, and the accuracy of the information provided by the System
   Application MIB agent. A default value of 60 seconds is defined to
   keep the processing overhead low, while providing usable information
   for long-lived processes. A manager is expected to adjust this value
   if more accurate information about short-lived applications or
   processes is needed, or if the amount of resources consumed by the
   agent is too high.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.%20%20sysApplElmtPastRunTable%20Entry%20Collisions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" name="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  sysApplElmtPastRunTable Entry Collisions</span>

   The sysApplElmtPastRunTable maintains a history of processes which
   have previously executed on the host as part of an application.
   Information is moved from the sysApplElmtRunTable to this PastRun
   table when the process represented by the entry terminates.

   The sysApplElmtPastRunTable is indexed by the tuple,
   (sysApplElmtPastRunInvocID, sysApplElmtPastRunIndex), where the first
   part identifies the application invocation of which the process was a
   part, and the second part identifies the process itself.

   Recall that the sysApplElmtRunIndex represents the system's unique
   identification number assigned to a running process and that this
   value is mapped to sysApplElmtPastRunIndex when the process

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2287.html">RFC 2287</a>                  MIB for Applications             February 1998</span>


   terminates and the entry's information is moved from the
   sysApplElmtRunTable to the sysApplElmtPastRunTable.  Many systems
   re-use process ID numbers which are no longer assigned to running
   processes; typically, the process numbers wrap and the next available
   process number is used.

   It is therefore possible for two entries in the sysApplElmtPastRun
   Table to have the same value for sysApplElmtPastRunIndex.  For this
   reason, entries in the ElmtPastRun table are indexed by the tuple
   sysApplElmtPastRunInvocID, sysApplElmtPastRunIndex to reduce the
   chance of a collision by two past run elements with the same
   sysApplElmtPastRunIndex.

   However, it is still possible, though unlikely, for a collision to
   occur if the following happens:

   1)   the invoked application (identified by InvocID), has an
        element which runs, terminates, and is moved into the
        sysApplElmtPastRun table (index: InvocID, RunIndex)

   2)   the numbers used for the system's process identification
        numbering wrap

   3)   that same invoked application (same InvocID), has another
        element process run, AND that process is assigned the same
        identification number as one of the processes previously run by
        that invoked application (same RunIndex), and finally,

   4)   that element process terminates and is moved to the
        sysApplElmtPastRun table prior to the old, duplicate (InvocID,
        RunIndex) entry being aged out of the table by settings defined
        for sysApplElmtPastRunMaxRows and
        sysApplElmtPastRunTblTimeLimit.

   In the event that a collision occurs, the new entry will replace the
   old entry.

   In order to implement this MIB, an agent must make certain management
   information available about various logical and physical entities
   within a managed system which may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.

   Therefore, a network administrator may wish to employ instance-level
   access control, and configure the access mechanism (i.e., community
   strings in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C), such that certain instances within
   this MIB are excluded from particular MIB views.
