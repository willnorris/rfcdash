<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2889.html">RFC 2889</a>          LAN Switch Benchmarking Methodology        August 2000</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document is intended to provide methodology for the benchmarking
   of local area network (LAN) switching devices.  It extends the
   methodology already defined for benchmarking network interconnecting
   devices in <a href="rfc2544.html">RFC 2544</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>] to switching devices.

   This RFC primarily deals with devices which switch frames at the
   Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. It provides a methodology for
   benchmarking switching devices, forwarding performance, congestion
   control, latency, address handling and filtering. In addition to
   defining the tests, this document also describes specific formats for
   reporting the results of the tests.

   A previous document, "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching
   Devices" [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>], defined many of the terms that are used in this
   document.  The terminology document SHOULD be consulted before
   attempting to make use of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Requirements</span>

   The following RFCs SHOULD be consulted before attempting to make use
   of this document: <a href="rfc1242.html">RFC 1242</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices"'>1</a>], <a href="rfc2285.html">RFC 2285</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>], and <a href="rfc2544.html">RFC 2544</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>].

   For the sake of clarity and continuity, this RFC adopts the template
   for benchmarking tests set out in <a href="rfc2544.html#section-26">Section 26 of RFC 2544</a>.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20Test%20setup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. Test setup</span>

   This document extends the general test setup described in <a href="rfc2544.html#section-6">section 6
   of RFC 2544</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>] to the benchmarking of LAN switching devices.  <a href="rfc2544.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2544.html">2544</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>] primarily describes non-meshed traffic where input and
   output interfaces  are grouped in mutually exclusive sending and
   receiving pairs.  In fully meshed traffic, each interface of a
   DUT/SUT is set up to both receive and transmit frames to all the
   other interfaces under test.

   Prior to each test run, the DUT/SUT MUST learn the MAC addresses used
   in the test and the address learning SHOULD be verified.  Addresses
   not learned will be forwarded as flooded frames and reduce the amount
   of correctly forwarded frames.  The rate at which address learning
   frames are offered may have to be adjusted to be as low as 50 frames
   per second or even less, to guarantee successful learning.  The
   DUT/SUT address aging time SHOULD be configured to be greater than



<span class="grey">Mandeville &amp; Perser          Informational                      [Page 2]</span></pre>

   the period of the learning phase of the test plus the trial duration
   plus any configuration time required by the testing device.
   Addresses SHOULD NOT age out until the trial duration is completed.
   More than one learning trial may be needed for the association of the
   address to the port to occur.

   If a DUT/SUT uses a hashing algorithm with address learning, the
   DUT/SUT may not learn the necessary addresses to perform the tests.
   The format of the MAC addresses MUST be adjustable so that the
   address mapping may be re-arranged to ensure that the DUT/SUT learns
   all the addresses.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Frame%20formats%20and%20sizes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Frame formats and sizes</span>

   The test frame format is defined in <a href="rfc2544.html#section-8">RFC 2544 section 8</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>] and MUST
   contain a unique signature field located in the UDP DATA area of the
   Test Frame (see <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>]).  The purpose of the signature field
   is filter out frames that are not part of the offered load.

   The signature field MUST be unique enough to identify the frames not
   originating from the DUT/SUT.  The signature field SHOULD be located
   after byte 56 (collision window [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>] ) or at the end of the frame. The
   length, contents and method of detection is not defined in this memo.

   The signature field MAY have a unique identifier per port.  This
   would filter out misforwarded frames.  It is possible for a DUT/SUT
   to strip off the MAC layer, send it through its switching matrix, and
   transmit it out with the correct destination MAC address but the
   wrong payload.

   For frame sizes, refer to <a href="rfc2544.html#section-9">RFC 2544, section 9</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>].

   There are three possible frame formats for layer 2 Ethernet switches:
   standard MAC Ethernet frames, standard MAC Ethernet frames with
   vendor-specific tags added to them, and IEEE 802.3ac frames tagged to
   accommodate 802.1p&amp;Q.  The two types of tagged frames may exceed the
   standard maximum length frame of 1518 bytes, and may not be accepted
   by the interface controllers of some DUT/SUTs. It is recommended to
   check the compatibility of the DUT/SUT with tagged frames before
   testing.

   Devices switching tagged frames of over 1518 bytes will have a

   To determine the throughput, frame loss and forwarding rates of
   DUT/SUTs offered fully meshed traffic as defined in <a href="rfc2285.html">RFC 2285</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>].

   When offering full meshed traffic, the following parameters MUST be
   defined.  Each parameter is configured with the following
   considerations.

      Frame Size - Recommended frame sizes are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,
      1280 and 1518 bytes, per <a href="rfc2544.html#section-9">RFC 2544 section 9</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>].  The four CRC
      bytes are included in the frame size specified.

      Interframe Gap (IFG) - The IFG between frames inside a burst MUST
      be at the minimum specified by the standard (9.6 us for 10Mbps
      Ethernet, 960 ns for 100Mbps Ethernet, and 96 ns for 1 Gbps
      Ethernet) of the medium being tested.

      Duplex mode - Half duplex or full duplex.

      ILoad - Intended Load per port is expressed in a percentage of the
      medium's maximum theoretical load, regardless of traffic
      orientation or duplex mode.  Certain test configurations will
      theoretically over-subscribe the DUT/SUT.

      In half duplex, an ILoad over 50% will over-subscribe the DUT/SUT.

      Burst Size - The burst size defines the number of frames sent
      back-to-back at the minimum legal IFG [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>] before pausing
      transmission to receive frames.  Burst sizes SHOULD vary between 1
      and 930 frames.  A burst size of 1 will simulate constant load
      [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices"'>1</a>].

      Addresses per port - Represents the number of addresses which are
      being tested for each port.  Number of addresses SHOULD be a
      binary exponential (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, ...).
      Recommended value is 1.

      Trial Duration - The recommended Trial Duration is 30 seconds.
      Trial duration SHOULD be adjustable between 1 and 300 seconds.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2889.html">RFC 2889</a>          LAN Switch Benchmarking Methodology        August 2000</span>


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.3%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.3" name="section-5.1.3">5.1.3</a> Procedure</span>

   All ports on the tester MUST transmit test frames either in a Frame
   Based or Time Based mode (Appendix B).  All ports SHOULD start
   transmitting their frames within 1% of the trial duration.  For a
   trial duration of 30 seconds, all ports SHOULD have started
   transmitting frames within 300 milliseconds of each other.

   Each port in the test MUST send test frames to all other ports in a
   round robin type fashion.  The sequence of addresses MUST NOT change
   when congestion control is applied.  The following table shows how
   each port in a test MUST transmit test frames to all other ports in
   the test.  In this example, there are six ports with 1 address per
   port:

   Source Port       Destination Ports (in order of transmission)

   Port #1           2       3       4       5       6       2...
   Port #2           3       4       5       6       1       3...
   Port #3           4       5       6       1       2       4...
   Port #4           5       6       1       2       3       5...
   Port #5           6       1       2       3       4       6...
   Port #6           1       2       3       4       5       1...

   As shown in the table, there is an equal distribution of destination
   addresses for each transmit opportunity. This keeps the test balanced
   so that one destination port is not overloaded by the test algorithm
   and all ports are equally and fully loaded throughout the test.  Not
   following this algorithm exactly will produce inconsistent results.

   For tests using multiple addresses per port, the actual port
   destinations are the same as described above and the actual
   source/destination address pairs SHOULD be chosen randomly to
   exercise the DUT/SUT's ability to perform address lookups.

   For every address, learning frames MUST be sent to the DUT/SUT to
   allow the DUT/SUT update its address tables properly.

   Each port should receive the same number of test frames that it
   transmitted.  Each receiving port MUST categorize, then count the
   frames into one of two groups:

      1.) Received Frames: received frames MUST have the correct
          destination MAC address and SHOULD match a signature field.

      2.) Flood count [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>].

   Any frame originating from the DUT/SUT (spanning tree, SNMP, RIP,
    ...) MUST not be counted as a received frame.  Frames originating
   from the DUT/SUT MAY be counted as flooded frames or not counted at
   all.

   Frame loss rate of the DUT/SUT SHOULD be reported as defined in
   <a href="#section-26.3">section 26.3</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>] with the following notes: Frame loss rate SHOULD be
   measured at the end of the trail duration.  The term "rate", for this

   Throughput measurement is defined in <a href="#section-26.1">section 26.1</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>].  A search
   algorithm is employed to find the maximum Oload [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>] with a zero Frame
   loss rate [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices"'>1</a>].  The algorithm MUST adjust Iload to find the
   throughput.

   Forwarding rate (FR) of the DUT/SUT SHOULD be reported as the number
   of test frames per second that the device is observed to successfully
   forward to the correct destination interface in response to a
   specified Oload.  The Oload MUST also be cited.

   Forwarding rate at maximum offered load (FRMOL) MUST be reported as
   the number of test frames per second that a device can successfully
   transmit to the correct destination interface in response to the MOL
   as defined in <a href="#section-3.6">section 3.6</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>]. The MOL MUST also be cited.

   Maximum forwarding rate (MFR) MUST be reported as the highest
   forwarding rate of a DUT/SUT taken from an iterative set of
   forwarding rate measurements.  The iterative set of forwarding rate
   measurements are made by adjusting Iload.  The Oload applied to the
   device MUST also be cited.

   The results for these tests SHOULD be reported in the form of a
   graph.  The x coordinate SHOULD be the frame size, the y coordinate
   SHOULD be the test results.  There SHOULD be at least two lines on
   the graph, one plotting the theoretical and one plotting the test
   results.

   To measure the DUT/SUT's ability to switch traffic while performing
   many different address lookups, the number of addresses per port MAY
   be increased in a series of tests.

   To determine the throughput when transmitting from/to multiple ports
   and to/from one port. As with the fully meshed throughput test, this
   test is a measure of the capability of the DUT to switch frames
   without frame loss.  Results of this test can be used to determine
   the ability of the DUT to utilize an Ethernet port when switching
   traffic from multiple Ethernet ports.

   When offering bursty partially meshed traffic, the following
   parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is configured with the
   following considerations.

      Frame Size - Recommended frame sizes are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,
      1280 and 1518 bytes, per <a href="rfc2544.html#section-9">RFC 2544 section 9</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>].  The four CRC
      bytes are included in the frame size specified.

      Interframe Gap (IFG) - The IFG between frames inside a burst MUST
      be at the minimum specified by the standard (9.6 us for 10Mbps
      Ethernet, 960 ns for 100Mbps Ethernet, and 96 ns for 1 Gbps
      Ethernet) of the medium being tested.

      Duplex mode - Half duplex or full duplex.

      ILoad - Intended Load per port is expressed in a percentage of the
      medium's maximum theoretical load, regardless of traffic
      orientation or duplex mode.  Certain test configurations will
      theoretically over-subscribe the DUT/SUT.

      In half duplex, an ILoad over 50% will over-subscribe the DUT/SUT.

      Burst Size - The burst size defines the number of frames sent
      back-to-back at the minimum legal IFG [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>] before pausing
      transmission to receive frames.  Burst sizes SHOULD vary between 1
      and 930 frames.  A burst size of 1 will simulate constant load
      [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices"'>1</a>].

      Addresses per port - Represents the number of addresses which are

      Recommended value is 1.

      Trial Duration - The recommended Trial Duration is 30 seconds.
      Trial duration SHOULD be adjustable between 1 and 300 seconds.

      Local Traffic - A Boolean value of ON or OFF.  The frame sequence
      algorithm MAY be altered to remove local traffic.  With local
      traffic ON, the algorithm is exactly the same as a fully meshed
      throughput.  With local traffic OFF, the port sends frames to all

   All ports on the tester MUST transmit test frames either in a Frame
   Based or Time Based mode (Appendix B).  All ports SHOULD start
   transmitting their frames within 1% of the trial duration.  For a
   trial duration of 30 seconds, all ports SHOULD have started
   transmitting frames with 300 milliseconds of each other.

   Each port in the test MUST send test frames to all other ports in a
   round robin type fashion as defined in <a href="#section-5.1.3">section 5.1.3</a>.  Local traffic
   MAY be removed from the round robin list in order to send the entire
   load across the backbone uplink.

   For tests using multiple addresses per port, the actual port
   destinations are the same as described above and the actual
   source/destination address pairs SHOULD be chosen randomly to
   exercise the DUT/SUT's ability to perform address lookups.

   For every address, the testing device MUST send learning frames to
   allow the DUT/SUT to update its address tables properly.

   To measure the DUT/SUT's ability to switch traffic while performing
   many different address lookups, the number of addresses per port MAY
   be increased in a series of tests.

   Each receiving port MUST categorize, then count the frames into one
   of two groups:

      1.) Received frames MUST have the correct destination MAC address
          and SHOULD match a signature field.

      2.) Flood count [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>].

   Any frame originating from the DUT/SUT MUST not be counted as a
   received frame.  Frames originating from the DUT/SUT MAY be counted
   as flooded frames or not counted at all.

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

      Frame Size - Recommended frame sizes are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,
      1280 and 1518 bytes, per <a href="rfc2544.html#section-9">RFC 2544 section 9</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>].  The four CRC
      bytes are included in the frame size specified.

      Interframe Gap (IFG) - The IFG between frames inside a burst MUST
      be at the minimum specified by the standard (9.6 us for 10Mbps
      Ethernet, 960 ns for 100Mbps Ethernet, and 96 ns for 1 Gbps
      Ethernet) of the medium being tested.

      Duplex mode - Half duplex or full duplex.

      ILoad - Intended Load per port is expressed in a percentage of the
      medium's maximum theoretical load, regardless of traffic
      orientation or duplex mode.  Certain test configurations will
      theoretically over-subscribe the DUT/SUT.

      ILoad will not over-subscribe the DUT/SUT in this test.

      Burst Size - The burst size defines the number of frames sent
      back-to-back at the minimum legal IFG [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>] before pausing
      transmission to receive frames.  Burst sizes SHOULD vary between 1
      and 930 frames.  A burst size of 1 will simulate constant load
      [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices"'>1</a>].

      Addresses per port - Represents the number of addresses which are
      being tested for each port.  Number of addresses SHOULD be a
      binary exponential (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, ...).
      Recommended value is 1.

      Trial Duration - The recommended Trial Duration is 30 seconds.
      Trial duration SHOULD be adjustable between 1 and 300 seconds.

      Ports do not send and receive test frames simultaneously.  As a
      consequence, there should be no collisions unless the DUT is
      misforwarding frames, generating flooded or Spanning-Tree frames
      or is enabling some flow control mechanism.  Ports used for this
      test are either transmitting or receiving, but not both. Those
      ports which are transmitting send test frames destined to
      addresses corresponding to each of the ports receiving.  This
      creates a unidirectional mesh of traffic.

      All ports on the tester MUST transmit test frames either in a
      Frame Based or Time Based mode (Appendix B).  All ports SHOULD
      start transmitting their frames within 1% of the trial duration.
      For a trial duration of 30 seconds, all ports SHOULD have started
      transmitting frames with 300 milliseconds of each other.

      Each transmitting port in the test MUST send frames to all
      receiving ports in a round robin type fashion.  The sequence of
      addresses MUST NOT change when congestion control is applied.
      The following table shows how each port in a test MUST transmit
      test frames to all other ports in the test.  In this 8 port
      example, port 1 through 4 are transmitting and ports 5 through 8
      are receiving; each with 1 address per port:

      Source Port, then Destination Ports (in order of transmission)

      Port #1              5       6       7       8       5       6...
      Port #2              6       7       8       5       6       7...
      Port #3              7       8       5       6       7       8...
      Port #4              8       5       6       7       8       5...

      As shown in the table, there is an equal distribution of
      destination addresses for each transmit opportunity. This keeps
      the test balanced so that one destination port is not overloaded
      by the test algorithm and all receiving ports are equally and
      fully loaded throughout the test.  Not following this algorithm
      exactly will product inconsistent results.

      For tests using multiple addresses per port, the actual port
      destinations are the same as described above and the actual
      source/destination address pairs SHOULD be chosen randomly to
      exercise the DUT/SUT's ability to perform address lookups.

      For every address, the testing device MUST send learning frames to
      allow the DUT/SUT to load its address tables properly.  The
      address table's aging time SHOULD be set sufficiently longer than

      the learning time and trial duration time combined.  If the
      address table ages out during the test, the results will show a
      lower performing DUT/SUT.

      To measure the DUT/SUT's ability to switch traffic while
      performing many different address lookups, the number of addresses
      per port MAY be increased in a series of tests.

   This test MUST consist of a multiple of four ports with the same MOL.
   Four ports are REQUIRED and MAY be expanded to fully utilize the

   from the source ports and frames originating from the DUT/SUT.  Only
   test frames from the source ports SHOULD be counted.

   The uncongested receive port should be receiving at a rate of half
   the MOL.  The number of test frames received on the uncongested port
   SHOULD be 50% of the test frames transmitted by the first source
   transmitter.  The congested receive port should be receiving at the
   MOL.  The number of test frames received on the congested port should
   be between 100% and 150% of the test frames transmitted by one source
   transmitter.

   This test MUST report the frame lost rate at the uncongested port,
   the forwarding rate (at 50% offered load) at the uncongested port,
   and the frame lost rate at the congested port.  This test MAY report
   the frame counts transmitted and frame counts received by the
   DUT/SUT.

   If there is frame loss at the uncongested port, "Head of Line"
   blocking is present.  The DUT cannot forward the amount of traffic to
   the congested port and as a result it is also losing frames destined
   to the uncongested port.

   If there is no frame loss on the congested port, then backpressure is
   present.  It should be noted that this test expects the overall load
   to the congested port to be greater than 100%. Therefore if the load
   is greater than 100% and no frame loss is detected, then the DUT must
   be implementing a flow control mechanism.  The type of flow control
   mechanism used is beyond the scope of this memo.

   It should be noted that some DUTs may not be able to handle the 100%
   load presented at the input port. In this case, there may be frame
   loss reported at the uncongested port which is due to the load at the
   input port rather than the congested port's load.

   If the uncongested frame loss is reported as zero, but the maximum
   forwarding rate is less than 7440 (for 10Mbps Ethernet), then this
   may be an indication of congestion control being enforced by the DUT.
   In this case, the congestion control is affecting the throughput of
   the uncongested port.

   If no congestion control is detected, the expected percentage frame
   loss for the congested port is 33% at 150% overload.  It is receiving
   100% load from 1 port, and 50% from another, and can only get 100%
   possible throughput, therefore having a frame loss rate of 33%
   (150%-50%/150%).

   The Forward Pressure test overloads a DUT/SUT port and measures the
   output for forward pressure [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>].  If the DUT/SUT transmits frames
   with an interframe gap less than 96 bits (<a href="#section-4.2.3.2.2">section 4.2.3.2.2</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>]),
   then forward pressure is detected.

   The objective of the Maximum Forwarding Rate test is to measure the
   peak value of the Forwarding Rate when the Offered Load is varied
   between the throughput [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices"'>1</a>] and the Maximum Offered Load [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>].

      Duplex mode - Half duplex or full duplex.

      Trial Duration - The recommended Trial Duration is 30 seconds.
      Trial duration SHOULD be adjustable between 1 and 300 seconds.

      Step Size - The minimum incremental resolution that the Iload will
      be incremented in frames per second.  The smaller the step size,
      the more accurate the measurement and the more iterations
      required.  As the Iload approaches the MOL, the minimum step size
      will increase because of gap resolution on the testing device.

   If the Throughput [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices"'>1</a>] and the MOL [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>] are the same, then MFR [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>] is

   The Minimum Interframe gap test SHOULD, at a minimum, be performed in
   a two-port configuration as described below.  Learning frames MUST be
   sent to allow the DUT/SUT to update its address tables properly.

   Test frames SHOULD be transmitted to the first port (port 1) of the
   DUT/SUT with an interframe gap of 88 bits.  This will apply forward
   pressure to the DUT/SUT and overload it at a rate of one byte per
   frame.  The test frames MUST be constructed with a source address of
   port 1 and a destination address of port 2.

   The FR on the second port (port 2) of the DUT/SUT is measured.  The
   measured Forwarding Rate should not exceed the medium's maximum
   theoretical utilization (MOL).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.6.4%20Measurements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.6.4" name="section-5.6.4">5.6.4</a> Measurements</span>

   Port 2 MUST categorize, then count the frames into one of two groups:

      1.) Received Frames: received frames MUST have the correct
          destination MAC address and SHOULD match a signature field.

      2.) Flood count [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>].

   Any frame originating from the DUT/SUT MUST not be counted as a

   MFR MUST be reported as the highest forwarding rate of a DUT/SUT
   taken from an iterative set of forwarding rate measurements. The
   Iload applied to the device MUST also be cited.

   Forwarding rate (FR) of the DUT/SUT SHOULD be reported as the number
   of frames per second that the device is observed to successfully

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is

      Age Time - The maximum time that a DUT/SUT will keep a learned
      address in its forwarding table.

      Addresses Learning Rate - The rate at which new addresses are
      offered to the DUT/SUT to be learned.  The rate at which address
      learning frames are offered may have to be adjusted to be as low
      as 50 frames per second or even less, to guarantee successful
      learning.

      Initial Addresses - The initial number of addresses to start the
      test with.  The number MUST be between 1 and the maximum number
      supported by the implementation.

   The aging time of the DUT/SUT MUST be known.  The aging time MUST be
   longer than the time necessary to produce frames at the specified
   rate.  If a low frame rate is used for the test, then it may be
   possible that sending a large amount of frames may actually take
   longer than the aging time.

   This test MUST at a minimum be performed in a three-port
   configuration described below.  The test MAY be expanded to fully
   utilized the DUT/SUT in increments of two or three ports.  An
   increment of two would include an additional Learning port and Test
   port.  An increment of three would include an additional Learning
   port, Test port, and Monitoring port.

   The Learning port (Lport) transmits learning frames to the DUT/SUT
   with varying source addresses and a fixed destination address
   corresponding to the address of the device connected to the Test port
   (Tport) of the DUT/SUT.  By receiving frames with varying source
   addresses, the DUT/SUT should learn these new addresses.  The source
   addresses MAY be in sequential order.

   The Test port (Tport) of the DUT/SUT acts as the receiving port for
   the learning frames.  Test frames will be transmitted back to the
   addresses learned on the Learning port.  The algorithm for this is
   explained below.

   The Monitoring port (Mport) on the DUT/SUT acts as a monitoring port
   to listen for flooded or mis-forwarded frames.  If the test spans
   multiple broadcast domains (VLANs), each broadcast domain REQUIRES a
   Monitoring port.

   It is highly recommended that SNMP, Spanning Tree, and any other
   frames originating from the DUT/SUT be disabled when running this
   test.  If such protocols cannot be turned off, the flood count MUST
   be modified only to count test frame originating from Lport and MUST
   NOT count frames originating from the DUT/SUT.

   The algorithm for the test is as follows:

   Using a binary search approach, the test targets the exact number of
   addresses supported per port with consistent test iterations.  Due to
   the aging time of DUT/SUT address tables, each iteration may take
   some time during the waiting period for the addresses to clear.  If
   possible, configure the DUT/SUT for a low value for the aging time.

   Once the high and low values of N meet, then the threshold of address
   handling has been found.

      frames are the frames sent with varying destination addresses to
      confirm that the DUT/SUT has learned all of the addresses for each
      test iteration.

      The flood count on Tport during the test portion of each test.  If
      the number is non-zero, this is an indication of the DUT/SUT
      flooding a frame in which the destination address is not in the
      address table.

      The number of frames correctly forwarded to test Lport during the
      test portion of the test.  Received frames MUST have the correct
      destination MAC address and SHOULD match a signature field.  For a
      passing test iteration, this number should be equal to the number
      of frames transmitted by Tport.

      The flood count on Lport during the test portion of each test.  If
      the number is non-zero, this is an indication of the DUT/SUT
      flooding a frame in which the destination address is not in the
      address table.

      The flood count on Mport.  If the value is not zero, then this
      indicates that for that test iteration, the DUT/SUT could not
      determine the proper destination port for that many frames.  In
      other words, the DUT/SUT flooded the frame to all ports since its
      address table was full.

   The objective of the Errored frames filtering test is to determine
   the behavior of the DUT under error or abnormal frame conditions.
   The results of the test indicate if the DUT/SUT filters the errors,
   or simply propagates the errored frames along to the destination.

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

      ILoad - Intended Load per port is expressed in a percentage of the
      medium's maximum theoretical load possible.  The actual
      transmitted frame per second is dependent upon half duplex or full
      duplex operation.  The test SHOULD be run multiple times with a
      different load per port in each case.

      Trial Duration - The recommended Trial Duration is 30 seconds.
      Trial duration SHOULD be adjustable between 1 and 300 seconds.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.9.3%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.9.3" name="section-5.9.3">5.9.3</a> Procedure</span>

   Each of the illegal frames for Ethernet MUST be checked:

   Oversize - The DUT/SUT MAY filter frames larger than 1518 bytes from
   being propagated through the DUT/SUT <a href="#section-4.2.4.2.1">section 4.2.4.2.1</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>].
   Oversized frames transmitted to the DUT/SUT should not be forwarded.
   DUT/SUT supporting tagged Frames MAY forward frames up to and
   including 1522 bytes long (<a href="#section-4.2.4.2.1">section 4.2.4.2.1</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Frame Extensions for Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks (VLAN) Tagging on 802.3 Networks"'>5</a>]).

   Undersize - The DUT/SUT MUST filter frames less than 64 bytes from
   being propagated through the DUT/SUT (<a href="#section-4.2.4.2.2">section 4.2.4.2.2</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>]).
   Undersized frames (or collision fragments) received by the DUT/SUT
   must not be forwarded.

   CRC Errors - The DUT/SUT MUST filter frames that fail the Frame Check
   Sequence Validation (<a href="#section-4.2.4.1.2">section 4.2.4.1.2</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>]) from being propagated
   through the DUT/SUT.  Frames with an invalid CRC transmitted to the
   DUT/SUT should not be forwarded.

   Dribble Bit Errors - The DUT/SUT MUST correct and forward frames
   containing dribbling bits.  Frames transmitted to the DUT/SUT that do
   not end in an octet boundary but contain a valid frame check sequence
   MUST be accepted by the DUT/SUT (<a href="#section-4.2.4.2.1">section 4.2.4.2.1</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>]) and forwarded

   boundary (<a href="#section-3.4">section 3.4</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>]).

   Alignment Errors - The DUT/SUT MUST filter frames that fail the Frame
   Check Sequence Validation AND do not end in an octet boundary.  This
   is a combination of a CRC error and a Dribble Bit error.  When both
   errors are occurring in the same frame, the DUT/SUT MUST determine
   the CRC error takes precedence and filters the frame (<a href="#section-4.2.4.1.2">section</a>
   <a href="#section-4.2.4.1.2">4.2.4.1.2</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"CSMA/CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,"'>4</a>]) from being propagated.

   For each of the error conditions in <a href="#section-5.6.3">section 5.6.3</a>, a "pass" or "fail"
   MUST be reported.  Actual frame counts MAY be reported for diagnostic
   purposes.

   The objective of the Broadcast Frame Forwarding and Latency Test is
   to determine the throughput and latency of the DUT when forwarding
   broadcast traffic.  The ability to forward broadcast frames will
   depend upon a specific function built into the device for that
   purpose.  It is therefore necessary to determine the ability of
   DUT/SUT to handle broadcast frames, since there may be many different
   ways of implementing such a function.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.10.2%20Setup%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.10.2" name="section-5.10.2">5.10.2</a> Setup Parameters</span>

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

      Frame Size - Recommended frame sizes are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,
      1280 and 1518 bytes, per <a href="rfc2544.html#section-9">RFC 2544 section 9</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>].  The four CRC
      bytes are included in the frame size specified.

      Duplex mode - Half duplex or full duplex.

      ILoad - Intended Load per port is expressed in a percentage of the
      medium's maximum theoretical load, regardless of traffic
      orientation or duplex mode.  Certain test configurations will
      theoretically over-subscribe the DUT/SUT.

      ILoad will not over-subscribe the DUT/SUT in this test.

      Trial Duration - The recommended Trial Duration is 30 seconds.
      Trial duration SHOULD be adjustable between 1 and 300 seconds.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.10.3%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.10.3" name="section-5.10.3">5.10.3</a> Procedure</span>

   For this test, there are two parts to be run.

   Broadcast Frame Throughput - This portion of the test uses a single
   source test port to transmit test frames with a broadcast address
   using the frame specified in <a href="rfc2544.html">RFC 2544</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>].  Selected receive ports
   then measure the forwarding rate and Frame loss rate.

   Broadcast Frame Latency - This test uses the same setup as the
   Broadcast Frame throughput, but instead of a large stream of test
   frames being sent, only one test frame is sent and the latency to
   each of the receive ports are measured in seconds.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.10.4%20Measurements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.10.4" name="section-5.10.4">5.10.4</a> Measurements</span>

   Frame loss rate of the DUT/SUT SHOULD be reported as defined in
   <a href="#section-26.3">section 26.3</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>3</a>] with the following notes: Frame loss rate SHOULD be
   measured at the end of the trial duration.  The term "rate", for this
   measurement only, does not imply the units in the fashion of "per
   second."

   Forwarding rate (FR) of the DUT/SUT SHOULD be reported as the number
   of test frames per second that the device is observed to successfully
   forward to the correct destination interface in response to a
   specified Oload.  The Oload MUST also be cited.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.10.5%20Reporting%20format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.10.5" name="section-5.10.5">5.10.5</a> Reporting format</span>

   The results for these tests SHOULD be reported in the form of a
   graph.  The x coordinate SHOULD be the frame size, the y coordinate
   SHOULD be the test results.  There SHOULD be at least two lines on
   the graph, one plotting the theoretical and one plotting the test
   results.

   To measure the DUT/SUT's ability to switch traffic while performing
   many different address lookups, the number of addresses per port MAY
   be increased in a series of tests.

   IBG is defined in <a href="rfc2285.html">RFC 2285</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>2</a>] as the interval between two bursts.
   To achieve a desired load, the following Input Parameter need to be
   defined:

     LENGTH - Frame size in bytes including the CRC.

     LOAD   - The intended load in percent.  Range is 0 to 100.

     BURST  - The number of frames in the burst (integer value).

     SPEED  - media's speed in bits/sec
                 Ethernet is 10,000,000 bits/sec
                 Fast Ethernet is 100,000,000 bits/sec
                 Gigabit Ethernet is 1,000,000,000 bits/sec

     IFG    - A constant 96 bits for the minimum interframe gap.

   The IBG (in seconds) can be calculated:


          [(100/LOAD - 1) * BURST * (IFG + 64 + 8*LENGTH)] + IFG
   IBG = -----------------------------------------------------------
                                  SPEED

   The number of bursts for the trial duration is rounded up to the
   nearest integer number.  The follow Input Parameter need to be
   defined:

     LENGTH - Frame size in bytes including the CRC.

     BURST  - The number of frames in the burst (integer value).

     SPEED  - media's speed in bits/sec
                 Ethernet is 10,000,000 bits/sec
                 Fast Ethernet is 100,000,000 bits/sec
                 Gigabit Ethernet is 1,000,000,000 bits/sec

     IFG    - A constant 96 bits for the minimum interframe gap.

     IBG    - Found in the above formula

     DURATION - Trial duration in seconds.

   An intermediate number of the Burst duration needs to be calculated
   first:

    TXTIME  =  -----------------------------------------
                               SPEED

   Number of Burst for the Trial Duration (rounded up):

                     DURATION
    #OFBURSTS =   --------------
                  (TXTIME + IBG)

   Example:

     LENGTH   = 64  bytes per frame
     LOAD     = 100 % offered load
     BURST    = 24  frames per burst
     SPEED    = 10  Mbits/sec (Ethernet)
     DURATION = 10  seconds test


    IBG       = 1612.8 uS
      TXTIME    = 1603.2 uS
    #OFBURSTS = 3110

Appendix B: Generating Offered Load

   In testing, the traffic generator is configured with the Iload
   (Intended Load) and measures the Oload (Offered Load).  If the
   DUT/SUT applies congestion control, then the Iload and the Oload are
   not the same value. The question arises, how to generate the Oload?
   This appendix will describe two different methods.

   The unit of measurement for Oload is bits per second.  The two
   methods described here will hold one unit constant and let the
   DUT/SUT vary the other unit.  The traffic generator SHOULD specify
   which method it uses.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.1%20Frame%20Based%20Load"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.1" name="appendix-B.1">B.1</a> Frame Based Load</span>

   Frame Based Load holds the number of bits constant.  The Trial
   Duration will vary based upon congestion control.  Advantage is
   implementation is a simple state machine (or loop).  The disadvantage
   is that Oload needs to be measured independently.







<span class="grey">Mandeville &amp; Perser          Informational                     [Page 32]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-33" id="page-33" name="page-33"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2889.html">RFC 2889</a>          LAN Switch Benchmarking Methodology        August 2000</span>


   All ports on the traffic generator MUST transmit the exact number of
   test frames.  The exact number of test frames is found by multiplying
   the Iload of the port by the Trial Duration.  All ports MAY NOT
   transmit the same number of frames if their Iload is not the same.
   An example would be the Partially meshed many-to-one test.

   All ports SHOULD start transmitting their frames within 1% of the
   trial duration.  For a trial duration of 30 seconds, all ports SHOULD
   have started transmitting frames within 300 milliseconds of each
   other.

   The reported Oload SHOULD be the average during the Trial Duration.
   If the traffic generator continues to transmit after the Trial
   Duration due to congestion control, Oload MAY be averaged over the
   entire transmit time.  Oload for the DUT/SUT MUST be the aggregate of
   all the Oloads per port.  Oload per port MAY be reported.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.2%20Time%20Based%20Load"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.2" name="appendix-B.2">B.2</a> Time Based Load</span>

   Time based load holds the Trial Duration constant, while allowing the
   number of octets transmitted to vary.  Advantages are an accurate
   Trial Duration and integrated Oload measurement.  Disadvantage is
   that the starting and stopping of the traffic generator MUST be more
   accurate.

   All ports on the traffic generator are configured to transmit the
   Iload for a finite amount of time.  Each port MUST count the number
   of octets successfully transmitted.

   The start and stop is initiated at a layer defined by the test
   parameters.  The layer can be the MAC layer, IP layer, or some other
   point in the protocol stack.  The traffic generator MUST complete its
   layer specific transmit process when the stop time is reached (i.e.
   no fragments, finish the frame).

   All ports MUST start transmitting their frames within 1% of the trial
   duration.  For a trial duration of 30 seconds, all ports SHOULD have
   started transmitting frames within 300 milliseconds of each other.

   All ports SHOULD stop transmitting frames after the specified trail
   duration within 0.01% of the trial duration.  Each port's stop time
   MUST be reference to its start time.  This trial duration error
   controls the accuracy of the Oload measurement and SHOULD be reported
   with the Oload measurement.

   Each port is allowed an offset error of 0.1% and a trial duration
   error of 0.01%.
