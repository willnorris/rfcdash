     <span class="h1">Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Solution for DHCP</span>

Abstract

   This document specifies the procedure for creating a binding between
   a DHCPv4/DHCPv6-assigned IP address and a binding anchor on a Source
   Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) device.  The bindings set up by
   this procedure are used to filter packets with forged source IP
   addresses.  This mechanism complements <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp38">BCP 38</a> (<a href="rfc2827.html">RFC 2827</a>) ingress
   filtering, providing finer-grained source IP address validation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document describes a fine-grained source address validation
   mechanism for IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  This mechanism creates bindings
   between IP addresses assigned to network interfaces by DHCP and
   suitable binding anchors (<a href="#section-4.3.5">Section 4.3.5</a>).  As discussed in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>
   and [<a href="rfc7039.html" title='"Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Framework"'>RFC7039</a>], a "binding anchor" is an attribute that is immutable
   or difficult to change that may be used to identify the system an IP
   address has been assigned to; common examples include a Media Access
   Control (MAC) address found on an Ethernet switch port or Wi-Fi
   security association.  The bindings are used to identify and filter
   packets originated by these interfaces using forged source IP
   addresses.  In this way, this mechanism can prevent hosts from using
   IP addresses assigned to any other attachment point in or not
   associated with the network.  This behavior is referred to as
   "spoofing" and is key to amplification attacks, in which a set of
   systems send messages to another set of systems claiming to be from a
   third set of systems, and sending the replies to systems that don't
   expect them.  Whereas <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp38">BCP 38</a> [<a href="rfc2827.html" title='"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing"'>RFC2827</a>] protects a network from a
   neighboring network by providing prefix granularity source IP address
   validity, this mechanism protects a network, including a Local Area
   Network, from itself by providing address granularity source IP
   validity when DHCP/DHCPv6 is used to assign IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
   Both provide a certain level of traceability, in that packet drops
   indicate the presence of a system that is producing packets with
   spoofed IP addresses.

   SAVI-DHCP snoops DHCP address assignments to set up bindings between
   IP addresses assigned by DHCP and corresponding binding anchors.  It
   includes the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 Snooping Process (<a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>) and the
   Data Snooping Process (<a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>), as well as a number of other
   technical details.  The Data Snooping Process is a data-triggered
   procedure that snoops the IP header of data packets to set up
   bindings.  It is designed to avoid a permanent blockage of valid
   addresses in the case that DHCP snooping is insufficient to set up
   all the valid bindings.

   This mechanism is designed for the stateful DHCP scenario [<a href="rfc2131.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>]
   [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>].  Stateless DHCP [<a href="rfc3736.html" title='"Stateless Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Service for IPv6"'>RFC3736</a>] is out of scope for this
   document, as it has nothing to do with IP address allocation.  An
   alternative SAVI method would have be used in those cases.  For hosts
   using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) to allocate
   addresses, First-Come, First-Served Source Address Validation
   Improvement (FCFS SAVI) [<a href="rfc6620.html" title='"FCFS SAVI: First-Come, First-Served Source Address Validation Improvement for Locally Assigned IPv6 Addresses"'>RFC6620</a>] should be enabled.  SAVI-DHCP is
   primarily designed for pure DHCP scenarios in which only addresses
   assigned through DHCP are allowed.  However, it does not block link-

   local addresses, as they are not assigned using DHCP.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the administration deploy a SAVI solution for link-
   local addresses, e.g., FCFS SAVI [<a href="rfc6620.html" title='"FCFS SAVI: First-Come, First-Served Source Address Validation Improvement for Locally Assigned IPv6 Addresses"'>RFC6620</a>].

   This mechanism works for networks that use DHCPv4 only, DHCPv6 only,
   or both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.  However, the DHCP address assignment
   mechanism in IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios, e.g., [<a href="rfc7341.html" title='"DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) Transport"'>RFC7341</a>], are
   beyond the scope of this document.

   Binding anchor: A "binding anchor" is defined to be a physical and/or
   link-layer property of an attached device, as in [<a href="rfc7039.html" title='"Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Framework"'>RFC7039</a>].  A list
   of sample binding anchors can be found in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> of that
   document.  To the degree possible, a binding anchor associates an IP
   address with something unspoofable that identifies a single-client
   system or one of its interfaces.  See <a href="#section-4.3.5">Section 4.3.5</a> for more detail.

   Attribute: A configurable property of each binding anchor (port, MAC
   address, or other information) that indicates the actions to be
   performed on packets received from the attached network device.

   DHCP address: An IP address assigned via DHCP.

   SAVI-DHCP: The name of this SAVI function for DHCP-assigned
   addresses.

   SAVI device: A network device on which SAVI-DHCP is enabled.

   IPv6 [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>].

   Binding entry: A rule that associates an IP address with a binding
   anchor.

   Binding State Table (BST): The data structure that contains the
   binding entries.

   Binding entry limit: The maximum number of binding entries that may
   be associated with a binding anchor.  Limiting the number of binding
   entries per binding anchor prevents a malicious or malfunctioning
   node from overloading the binding table on a SAVI device.

   Direct attachment: Ideally, a SAVI device is an access device that
   hosts are attached to directly.  In such a case, the hosts are direct
   attachments (i.e., they attach directly) to the SAVI device.

   Indirect attachment: A SAVI device MAY be an aggregation device that
   other access devices are attached to and that hosts in turn attach
   to.  In such a case, the hosts are indirect attachments (i.e., they
   attach indirectly) to the SAVI device.

   Unprotected link: Unprotected links are links that connect to hosts
   or networks of hosts that receive their DHCP traffic by another path
   and are therefore outside the SAVI perimeter.

   Unprotected device: An unprotected device is a device associated with
   an unprotected link.  One example might be the gateway router of a
   network.

   Protected link: If DHCP messages for a given attached device always
   use a given link, the link is considered to be "protected" by the
   SAVI device and is therefore within the SAVI perimeter.

   Protected device: A protected device is a device associated with a
   protected link.  One example might be a desktop switch in the
   network, or a host.

   Cut vertex: A cut vertex is any vertex whose removal increases the
   number of connected components in a (network) graph.  This is a
   concept in graph theory.  This term is used in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> to
   accurately specify the required deployment location of SAVI devices
   when they only perform the DHCP Snooping Process.

   Identity Association (IA): "A collection of addresses assigned to a
   client" [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>].

   Detection message: A Neighbor Solicitation or ARP message intended by
   the Data Snooping Process to detect a duplicate address.

   DHCP_DEFAULT_LEASE: Default lifetime for a DHCPv6 address when the
   binding is triggered by a DHCPv6 Confirm message but a DHCPv6
   Leasequery exchange [<a href="rfc5007.html" title='"DHCPv6 Leasequery"'>RFC5007</a>] cannot be performed by the SAVI device
   to fetch the lease.

   using DHCP and therefore may or may not be protected), zero or more
   protected DHCP clients, and one or more SAVI devices.  It may also
   include DHCP relays, when the DHCP server is not co-located with a
   set of clients, and zero or more protected non-SAVI devices.  Outside
   the perimeter, via unprotected links, there may be many unprotected
   devices.

                       Figure 1: SAVI-DHCP Scenario

   Figure 1 shows a deployment scenario that contains these elements.
   Note that a physical device can instantiate multiple elements, e.g.,
   a switch can be both a SAVI device and a DHCP relay, or in a cloud-
   computing environment, a physical host may contain a virtual switch
   plus some number of virtual hosts.  In such cases, the links are
   logical links rather than physical links.

   Networks are not usually isolated.  As a result, traffic from other
   networks, including transit traffic as specified in [<a href="rfc6620.html" title='"FCFS SAVI: First-Come, First-Served Source Address Validation Improvement for Locally Assigned IPv6 Addresses"'>RFC6620</a>] (e.g.,
   traffic from another SAVI switch or a router) may enter a SAVI-DHCP
   network through the unprotected links.  Since SAVI solutions are
   limited to validating traffic generated from a local link, SAVI-DHCP
   does not set up bindings for addresses assigned in other networks and
   cannot validate them.  Traffic from unprotected links should be
   checked by an unprotected device or mechanisms described in




<span class="grey">Bi, et al.                   Standards Track                    [Page 9]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7513.html">RFC 7513</a>                        SAVI DHCP                       May 2015</span>


   [<a href="rfc2827.html" title='"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing"'>RFC2827</a>].  The generation and deployment of such a mechanism is
   beyond the scope of this document.

   Traffic from protected links is, however, locally generated and
   should have its source addresses validated by SAVI-DHCP if possible.
   In the event that there is an intervening protected non-SAVI device
   between the host and the SAVI device, however, use of the physical
   attachment point alone as a binding anchor is insufficiently secure,
   as several devices on a port or other point of attachment can spoof
   each other.  Hence, additional information such as a MAC address
   SHOULD be used to disambiguate them.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20SAVI%20Binding%20Type%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  SAVI Binding Type Attributes</span>

   As illustrated in Figure 1, a system attached to a SAVI device can be
   a DHCP client, a DHCP relay/server, a SAVI device, or a non-SAVI
   device.  Different actions are performed on traffic originated from
   different elements.  To distinguish among their requirements, several
   properties are associated with their point of attachment on the SAVI
   device.

   When a binding association is uninstantiated, e.g., when no host is
   attached to the SAVI device using a given port or other binding
   anchor, the binding port attributes take default values unless
   overridden by configuration.  By default, a SAVI switch does not
   filter DHCP messages, nor does it attempt to validate source
   addresses, which is to say that the binding attributes are ignored
   until SAVI-DHCP is itself enabled.  This is because a SAVI switch
   that depends on DHCP cannot tell, a priori, which ports have valid
   DHCP servers attached, or which have routers or other equipment that
   would validly appear to use an arbitrary set of source addresses.
   When SAVI has been enabled, the attributes take effect.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.1.%20%20Trust%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1" name="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Trust Attribute</span>

   The "Trust Attribute" is a Boolean value.  If TRUE, it indicates that
   the packets from the corresponding attached device need not have
   their source addresses validated.  Examples of a trusted attachment
   would be a port to another SAVI device, or to an IP router, as shown
   in Figure 1.  In both cases, traffic using many source IP addresses
   will be seen.  By default, the Trust attribute is FALSE, indicating
   that any device found on that port will seek an address using DHCP
   and be limited to using such addresses.

   SAVI devices will not set up bindings for points of attachment with
   the Trust attribute set TRUE; no packets, including DHCP messages,
   from devices with this attribute on their attachments will be
   validated.  However, DHCP Server-to-Client messages will be snooped



<span class="grey">Bi, et al.                   Standards Track                   [Page 10]</span></pre>

   on attachment points with the Trust attribute set TRUE in the same
   way as if they had the DHCP-Trust attribute set (see <a href="#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2</a>).

   The "DHCP-Trust Attribute" is similarly a Boolean attribute.  It
   indicates whether the attached device is permitted to initiate DHCP
   Server-to-Client messages.  In Figure 1, the points of attachment of
   the DHCP server and the DHCP relay would have this attribute set
   TRUE, and attachment points that have Trust set TRUE are implicitly
   treated as if DHCP-Trust is TRUE.

   If the DHCP-Trust attribute is TRUE, SAVI devices will forward DHCP
   Server-to-Client messages from the points of attachment with this
   attribute.  If the DHCP Server-to-Client messages can trigger the
   state transitions, the binding setup processes specified in Sections
   6 and 7 will handle them.  By default, the DHCP-Trust attribute is
   FALSE, indicating that the attached system is not a DHCP server.

   A DHCPv6 implementor can refer to [<a href="#ref-DHCPv6-SHIELD">DHCPv6-SHIELD</a>] for more details.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.3.%20%20DHCP-Snooping%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.3" name="section-4.2.3">4.2.3</a>.  DHCP-Snooping Attribute</span>

   The "DHCP-Snooping Attribute" is similarly a Boolean attribute.  It
   indicates whether bindings will be set up based on DHCP snooping.

   If this attribute is TRUE, DHCP Client-to-Server messages to points
   of attachment with this attribute will trigger creation of bindings
   based on the DHCP Snooping Process described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.  If it is
   FALSE, either the Trust attribute must be TRUE (so that bindings
   become irrelevant) or another SAVI mechanism such as FCFS SAVI must
   be used on the point of attachment.

   The DHCP-Snooping attribute is configured on the DHCP client's point
   of attachment.  This attribute can be also used on the attachments to
   protected non-SAVI devices that are used by DHCP clients.  In
   Figure 1, the attachment from Client A to SAVI Device A, the
   attachment from Client B to SAVI Device B, and the attachment from
   Non-SAVI Device 2 to SAVI Device A can be configured with this
   attribute.

   The "Data-Snooping Attribute" is a Boolean attribute.  It indicates
   whether data packets from the corresponding point of attachment may
   trigger the binding setup procedure.





<span class="grey">Bi, et al.                   Standards Track                   [Page 11]</span></pre>

   Data packets from points of attachment with this attribute may
   trigger the setup of bindings.  SAVI devices will set up bindings on
   points of attachment with this attribute based on the data-triggered
   process described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   If the DHCP-Snooping attribute is configured on a point of
   attachment, the bindings on this attachment are set up based on DHCP
   message snooping.  However, in some scenarios, a DHCP client may use
   a DHCP address without the DHCP address assignment procedure being
   performed on its current attachment.  For such attached devices, the
   Data Snooping Process, which is described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>, is necessary.
   This attribute is configured on such attachments.  The usage of this
   attribute is further discussed in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   Since some networks require DHCP deployment and others avoid it,
   there is no obvious universal default value for the Data-Snooping
   attribute.  Hence, the Data-Snooping attribute should default to
   FALSE, and a mechanism should be implemented to conveniently set it
   to TRUE on all points of attachment for which the Trust attribute is
   FALSE.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.5.%20%20Validating%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.5" name="section-4.2.5">4.2.5</a>.  Validating Attribute</span>

   The "Validating Attribute" is a Boolean attribute.  It indicates
   whether packets from the corresponding attachment will have their IP
   source addresses validated based on binding entries on the
   attachment.

   If it is TRUE, packets coming from attachments with this attribute
   will be validated based on binding entries on the attachment as
   specified in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.  If it is FALSE, they will not.  Since the
   binding table is used in common with other SAVI algorithms, it merely
   signifies whether the check will be done, not whether it will be done
   for SAVI-DHCP originated bindings.

   This attribute is by default the inverse of the Trust attribute;
   source addresses on untrusted links are validated by default.  It MAY
   be set FALSE by the administration.

   The expected use case is when SAVI is used to monitor but not block
   forged transmissions.  The network manager, in that case, may set the
   DHCP-Snooping and/or Data-Snooping attribute TRUE but the Validating
   attribute FALSE.

   Different types of attributes may indicate mutually exclusive actions
   on a packet.  Mutually exclusive attributes MUST NOT be set TRUE on
   the same attachment.  The compatibility of different attributes is
   listed in Figure 2.  Note that although Trust and DHCP-Trust are
   compatible, there is no need to configure DHCP-Trust to TRUE on an
   attachment with Trust attribute TRUE.

   SAVI devices form a perimeter separating trusted and untrusted
   regions of a network, as FCFS SAVI does (<a href="rfc6620.html#section-2.5">Section 2.5 of [RFC6620]</a>).
   The perimeter is primarily designed for scalability.  It has two
   implications.

   o  SAVI devices only need to establish bindings for directly attached
      clients, or clients indirectly attached through a non-SAVI
      protected device, rather than all of the clients in the network.

   o  Each SAVI device only needs to validate the source addresses in
      traffic from clients attached to it, without checking all the
      traffic passing by.

   Consider the example in Figure 1.  The protection perimeter is formed
   by SAVI Devices A, B, and C.  In this case, SAVI Device B does not
   create a binding for Client A.  However, because SAVI Device A
   filters spoofed traffic from Client A, SAVI Device B can avoid
   receiving spoofed traffic from Client A.

   The perimeter in SAVI-DHCP is not only a perimeter for data packets
   but also a perimeter for DHCP messages.  DHCP server response
   messages incoming across the perimeter will be dropped (<a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>).
   The placement of the DHCP relay and DHCP server, which are not
   involved in [<a href="rfc6620.html" title='"FCFS SAVI: First-Come, First-Served Source Address Validation Improvement for Locally Assigned IPv6 Addresses"'>RFC6620</a>], is related to the construction of the
   perimeter.  The requirement on the placement and configuration of the
   DHCP relay and DHCP server is discussed in <a href="#section-4.3.3">Section 4.3.3</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.2.%20%20SAVI-DHCP%20Perimeter%20Configuration%20Guideline"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.2" name="section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a>.  SAVI-DHCP Perimeter Configuration Guideline</span>

   A perimeter separating trusted and untrusted regions of the network
   is formed as follows:

   (1)  Configure the Validating and DHCP-Snooping attributes TRUE on
        the direct attachments of all DHCP clients.

   (2)  Configure the Validating and DHCP-Snooping attributes TRUE on
        the indirect attachments of all DHCP clients (i.e., DHCP clients
        on protected links).

   (3)  Configure the Trust attribute TRUE on the attachments to other
        SAVI devices.

   (4)  If a non-SAVI device, or a number of connected non-SAVI devices,
        are attached only to SAVI devices, set the Trust attribute TRUE
        on their attachments.

   (5)  Configure the DHCP-Trust attribute TRUE on the direct
        attachments to trusted DHCP relays and servers.

   In this way, the points of attachments with the Validating attribute
   TRUE (and generally together with attachments of unprotected devices)
   on SAVI devices can form a perimeter separating DHCP clients and
   trusted devices.  Data packet checks are only performed on the
   perimeter.  The perimeter is also a perimeter for DHCP messages.  The
   DHCP-Trust attribute is only TRUE on links inside the perimeter.
   Only DHCP Server-to-Client messages originated within the perimeter
   are trusted.

   As a result of the configuration guidelines, SAVI devices only trust
   DHCP Server-to-Client messages originated inside the perimeter.
   Thus, the trusted DHCP relays and DHCP servers must be placed within
   the perimeter.  DHCP Server-to-Client messages will be filtered on
   the perimeter.  Server-to-Relay messages will not be filtered, as
   they are within the perimeter.  In this way, DHCP Server-to-Client
   messages from bogus DHCP servers are filtered on the perimeter,
   having entered through untrusted points of attachment.  The SAVI
   devices are protected from forged DHCP messages.

   DHCP Server-to-Client messages arriving at the perimeter from outside
   the perimeter are not trusted.  There is no distinction between a
   DHCP server owned and operated by the correct administration but
   outside the SAVI perimeter and a bogus DHCP server.  For example, in
   Figure 1, DHCP Server A is valid, but it is attached to Non-SAVI
   Device 1.  A bogus DHCP server is also attached to Non-SAVI Device 1.
   While one could imagine a scenario in which the valid one had a
   statistically configured port number and MAC address, and therefore a
   binding, by default SAVI-DHCP cannot distinguish whether a message
   received from the port of Non-SAVI Device 1 is from DHCP Server A or
   the bogus DHCP server.  If DHCP Server A is contained in the
   perimeter, Non-SAVI Device 1 will also be contained in the perimeter.
   Thus, DHCP Server A cannot be contained within the perimeter apart
   from manual configuration of the binding anchor.

   Another consideration on the placement is that if the DHCP server/
   relay is not inside the perimeter, the SAVI devices may not be able
   to set up bindings correctly because the SAVI devices may not be on
   the path between the clients and the server/relay, or the DHCP
   messages are encapsulated (e.g., Relay-reply and Relay-forward).

   In common deployment practice, the traffic from the unprotected
   network is treated as trustworthy, which is to say that it is not
   filtered.  In such a case, the Trust attribute can be set TRUE on the
   unprotected link.  If non-SAVI devices, or a number of connected non-
   SAVI devices, are only attached to SAVI devices and unprotected
   devices, their attachment to SAVI devices can have the Trust
   attribute set TRUE.  Then an unclosed perimeter will be formed, as
   illustrated in Figure 3.

   The strength of this binding-based mechanism depends on the strength
   of the binding anchor.  The sample binding anchors in [<a href="rfc7039.html" title='"Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Framework"'>RFC7039</a>] have
   the property in which they associate an IP address with a direct
   physical or secure virtual interface such as a switch port, a
   subscriber association, or a security association.  In addition,
   especially in the case where a protected non-SAVI device such as a
   desktop switch or a hub is between the client and SAVI devices, they
   MAY be extended to also include a MAC address or other link-layer
   attribute.  In short, a binding anchor is intended to associate an IP
   address with something unspoofable that identifies a single-client
   system or one of its interfaces; this may be a physical or virtual
   interface or that plus disambiguating link-layer information.

   If the binding anchor is spoofable, such as a plain MAC address, or
   non-exclusive, such as a switch port extended using a non-SAVI
   device, an attacker can use a forged binding anchor to evade
   validation.  Indeed, using a binding anchor that can be easily
   spoofed can lead to worse outcomes than allowing spoofed IP traffic.
   Thus, a SAVI device MUST use a non-spoofable and exclusive binding
   anchor.

   In addition to a possible binding anchor configuration specified in
   <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>, an implementation has the following configuration
   requirements:

   (1)  Address configuration.  For DHCPv4: the SAVI device MUST have an
        IPv4 address.  For DHCPv6: the client of a SAVI device MUST have
        a link-local address; when the DHCPv6 server is not on the same
        link as the SAVI device, the SAVI device MUST also have an IPv6
        address of at least the same scope as the DHCPv6 Server.

   (2)  DHCP server address configuration: a SAVI device MUST store the
        list of the DHCP server addresses that it could contact during a
        leasequery process.

   (3)  A SAVI device may also require security parameters, such as
        preconfigured keys to establish a secure connection for the
        leasequery process [<a href="rfc4388.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Leasequery"'>RFC4388</a>] [<a href="rfc5007.html" title='"DHCPv6 Leasequery"'>RFC5007</a>] connection.

   The Binding State Table, which may be implemented centrally in the
   switch or distributed among its ports, is used to contain the
   bindings between the IP addresses assigned to the attachments and the
   corresponding binding anchors of the attachments.  Note that in this
   description, there is a binding entry for each IPv4 or IPv6 address
   associated with each binding anchor, and there may be several of each
   such address, especially if the port is extended using a protected
   non-SAVI device.  Each binding entry has six fields:

   o  Binding Anchor (listed as "Anchor" in subsequent figures): the
      binding anchor, i.e., one or more physical and/or link-layer
      properties of the attachment.

   o  IP Address (listed as "Address" in subsequent figures): the IPv4
      or IPv6 address assigned to the attachment by DHCP.

   o  State: the state of the binding.  Possible values of this field
      are listed in Sections <a href="#section-6.2">6.2</a> and <a href="#section-7.3">7.3</a>.

   o  Lifetime: the remaining seconds of the binding.  Internally, this
      MAY be stored as the timestamp value at which the lifetime
      expires.

   o  Transaction ID (TID): the Transaction ID [<a href="rfc2131.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>] [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>] of
      the corresponding DHCP transaction.  The TID field is used to

      associate DHCP Server-to-Client messages with corresponding
      binding entries.

   o  Timeouts: the number of timeouts that expired in the current state
      (only used in the Data Snooping Process; see <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>).

   The IA is not present in the BST for three reasons:

   o  The lease of each address in one IA is assigned separately.

   o  When the binding is set up based on data snooping, the IA cannot
      be recovered from the leasequery protocol.

   o  DHCPv4 does not define an IA.

   An example of such a table is shown in Figure 4.

   This section specifies the process of setting up bindings based on
   DHCP snooping.  This process is illustrated using a state machine.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20%20Rationale"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Rationale</span>

   The rationale of the DHCP Snooping Process is that if a DHCP client
   is legitimately using a DHCP-assigned address, the DHCP address
   assignment procedure that assigns the IP address to the client must
   have been performed via the client's point of attachment.  This
   assumption works when the SAVI device is always on the path(s) from
   the DHCP client to the DHCP server(s)/relay(s).  Without considering
   the movement of DHCP clients, the SAVI device should be the cut
   vertex whose removal will separate the DHCP client and the remaining
   network containing the DHCP server(s)/relay(s).  For most of the
   networks whose topologies are simple, it is possible to deploy this
   SAVI function at proper devices to meet this requirement.

   However, if there are multiple paths from a DHCP client to the DHCP
   server and the SAVI device is only on one of them, there is an
   obvious failure case: the SAVI device may not be able to snoop the
   DHCP procedure.  Host movement may also make this requirement
   difficult to meet.  For example, when a DHCP client moves from one
   attachment to another attachment in the same network, it may fail to
   reinitialize its interface or send a Confirm message because of
   incomplete protocol implementation.  Thus, there can be scenarios in
   which only performing this DHCP Snooping Process is insufficient to
   set up bindings for all the valid DHCP addresses.  These exceptions
   and the solutions are discussed in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   Discover) defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> are used extensively in the
   definitions of events and elsewhere in the state machine definition.
   If an event will trigger the creation of a new binding entry, the
   binding entry limit on the binding anchor MUST NOT be exceeded.

   EVE_DHCP_RENEW: A DHCPv4 Renew or a DHCPv6 Renew message is received.

   EVE_DHCP_SOLICIT_RC: A DHCPv6 Solicitation message with the Rapid

   EVE_DHCP_LEASEQUERY: A successful DHCPv6 LEASEQUERY-REPLY (refer to
   <a href="rfc5007.html#section-4.3.3">Section 4.3.3 of [RFC5007]</a>) is received.

   Note: the events listed here do not cover all the DHCP messages in
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  The messages that do not really determine address usage
   (DHCPv4 Discover, DHCPv4 Inform, DHCPv6 Solicit without Rapid Commit,
   DHCPv6 Information-Request, DHCPv4 Offer, DHCPv6 Advertise, and
   DHCPv6 Reconfigure) and that are not necessary to snoop (DHCPv4
   Negative Acknowledgment (NAK); refer to <a href="#section-6.4.2.3">Section 6.4.2.3</a>) are not
   included.  Note also that DHCPv4 DHCPLEASEQUERY is not used in the
   DHCP Snooping Process to avoid confusion with <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.  Also, since
   the LEASEQUERY should have been originated by the SAVI device itself,
   the destination check should verify that the message is directed to
   this SAVI device, and it should not be forwarded once it has been
   processed here.

   Moreover, only if a DHCP message can pass the following checks, the
   corresponding event is regarded as a valid event:

   o  Attribute check: the DHCP Server-to-Client messages and
      LEASEQUERY-REPLY should be from attachments with the DHCP-Trust
      attribute; the DHCP Client-to-Server messages should be from
      attachments with the DHCP-Snooping attribute.

   o  Destination check: the DHCP Server-to-Client messages should be
      destined to attachments with the DHCP-Snooping attribute.  This
      check is performed to ensure the binding is set up on the SAVI
      device that is nearest to the destination client.

   o  Binding anchor check: the DHCP Client-to-Server messages that may
      trigger modification or removal of an existing binding entry must
      have a matching binding anchor with the corresponding entry.

   o  TID check: the DHCP Server-to-Client/Client-to-Server messages
      that may cause modification of existing binding entries must have
      a matched TID with the corresponding entry.  Note that this check
      is not performed on LEASEQUERY and LEASEQUERY-REPLY messages as
      they are exchanged between the SAVI devices and the DHCP servers.
      Besides, this check is not performed on DHCP Renew/Rebind
      messages.

   o  Binding limitation check: the DHCP messages must not cause new
      binding setup on an attachment whose binding entry limitation has
      been reached (refer to <a href="#section-11.5">Section 11.5</a>).

   o  Address check: the source address of the DHCP messages should pass
      the check specified in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.

   On receiving a DHCP message without triggering a valid event, the
   state will not change, and the actions will not be performed.  Note

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/is%20received"></a>          is received</span>

   The message MUST be forwarded to the corresponding client.

   If the message is DHCPv4 ACK, the Address field of the corresponding
   entry (i.e., the binding entry whose TID is the same as the message)
   is set to the address in the message (i.e., 'yiaddr' in DHCPv4 ACK).
   The Lifetime field is set to the sum of the lease time in the ACK
   message and MAX_DHCP_RESPONSE_TIME.  The State field is changed to
   BOUND.

   If the message is DHCPv6 Reply, note the following cases:

   1.  If the status code is not "Success", no modification of
       corresponding entries will be made.  Corresponding entries will
       expire automatically if no "Success" Reply is received during the
       lifetime.  The entries are not removed immediately because the
       client may be able to use the addresses whenever a "Success"
       Reply is received ("If the client receives any Reply messages
       that do not indicate a NotOnLink status, the client can use the
       addresses in the IA and ignore any messages that indicate a
       NotOnLink status" [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>]).

   2.  If the status code is "Success", the SAVI device checks the IA
       options in the Reply message.

       A.  If there are IA options in the Reply message, the SAVI device
           checks each IA option.  When the first assigned address is
           found, the Address field of the binding entry with a matched
           TID is set to the address.  The Lifetime field is set to the
           sum of the lease time in the Reply message and
           MAX_DHCP_RESPONSE_TIME.  The State field is changed to BOUND.
           If there is more than one address assigned in the message,
           new binding entries are set up for the remaining address
           assigned in the IA options.  An example of the entries is
           illustrated in Figure 8.  SAVI devices do not specially
           process IA options with a NoAddrsAvail status because there
           should be no address contained in such IA options.

       B.  Otherwise, the DHCP Reply message is in response to a Confirm
           message.  The state of the binding entries with a matched TID
           is changed to BOUND.  Because [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>] does not require the
           lease time of addresses to be contained in the Reply message,
           the SAVI device SHOULD send a LEASEQUERY [<a href="rfc5007.html" title='"DHCPv6 Leasequery"'>RFC5007</a>] message
           querying by IP address to the All_DHCP_Servers multicast

           address [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>] or a list of configured DHCP server
           addresses.  The LEASEQUERY message is generated for each IP
           address if multiple addresses are confirmed.  The lifetime of
           corresponding entries is set to 2*MAX_LEASEQUERY_DELAY.  If
           there is no response message after MAX_LEASEQUERY_DELAY, send
           the LEASEQUERY message again.  An example of the entries is
           illustrated in Figure 7.  If the SAVI device does not send
           the LEASEQUERY message, a preconfigured lifetime
           DHCP_DEFAULT_LEASE MUST be set on the corresponding entry.
           (Note: it is RECOMMENDED to use T1 configured on DHCP servers
           as the DHCP_DEFAULT_LEASE.)

   Note: the SAVI devices do not check if the assigned addresses are
   duplicated because in SAVI-DHCP scenarios, the DHCP servers are the
   only source of valid addresses.  However, the DHCP servers should be
   configured to make sure no duplicated addresses are assigned.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.%20%20Scenario"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Scenario</span>

   The rationale of the DHCP Snooping Process specified in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> is
   that if a DHCP client's use of a DHCP address is legitimate, the
   corresponding DHCP address assignment procedure must have been
   finished during the attachment of the DHCP client.  This is the case
   when the SAVI device is continuously on the path(s) from the DHCP
   client to the DHCP server(s)/relay(s).  However, there are two cases
   in which this does not work:

   o  Multiple paths: there is more than one feasible link-layer path
      from the client to the DHCP server/relay, and the SAVI device is
      not on every one of them.  The client may get its address through
      one of the paths that does not pass through the SAVI device, but
      packets from the client can travel on paths that pass through the
      SAVI device, such as when the path through the link-layer network
      changes.  Because the SAVI device could not snoop the DHCP packet
      exchange procedure, the DHCP Snooping Process cannot set up the
      corresponding binding.






<span class="grey">Bi, et al.                   Standards Track                   [Page 31]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7513.html">RFC 7513</a>                        SAVI DHCP                       May 2015</span>


   o  Dynamic path: there is only one feasible link-layer path from the
      client to the DHCP server/relay, but the path is dynamic due to
      topology change (for example, some link becomes broken due to
      failure or some planned change) or link-layer path change.  This
      situation also covers the local-link movement of clients without
      the address confirm/reconfiguration process.  For example, a host
      changes its attached switch port in a very short time.  In such
      cases, the DHCP Snooping Process will not set up the corresponding
      binding.

   The Data Snooping Process can avoid the permanent blocking of
   legitimate traffic in case one of these two exceptions occurs.  This
   process is performed on attachments with the Data-Snooping attribute.
   Data packets without a matching binding entry may trigger this
   process to set up bindings.

   Snooping data traffic introduces a considerable burden on the
   processor and ASIC-to-Processor bandwidth of SAVI devices.  Because
   of the overhead of this process, the implementation of this process
   is OPTIONAL.  This function SHOULD be enabled unless the
   implementation is known to be used in the scenarios without the above
   exceptions.  For example, if the implementation is to be used in
   networks with tree topology and without host local-link movement,
   there is no need to implement this process in such scenarios.

   This process is not intended to set up a binding whenever a data
   packet without a matched binding entry is received.  Instead,
   unmatched data packets trigger this process probabilistically, and
   generally a number of unmatched packets will be discarded before the
   binding is set up.  The parameter(s) of this probabilistic process
   SHOULD be configurable, defaulting to a situation where data snooping
   is disabled.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.%20%20Rationale"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" name="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Rationale</span>

   This process makes use of NS/ARP and DHCP Leasequery to set up
   bindings.  If an address is not used by another client in the
   network, and the address has been assigned in the network, the
   address can be bound with the binding anchor of the attachment from
   which the unmatched packet is received.

   The Data Snooping Process provides an alternative path for binding
   entries to reach the BOUND state in the exceptional cases explained
   in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a> when there are no DHCP messages that can be snooped by
   the SAVI device.

   In some of the exceptional cases (especially the dynamic topology
   case), by the time the binding has reached the BOUND state, the DHCP
   messages may be passing through the SAVI device.  In this case, the
   events driven by DHCP messages that are expected in the BOUND state
   in the DHCP Snooping Process may occur, and the binding can be
   handled by the DHCP Snooping Process state machine.

   In any event, the lease expiry timeout event will occur even if no
   others do.  This will cause the binding to be deleted and the state
   to logically return to NO_BIND state.  Either the DHCP or the Data
   Snooping Process will be reinvoked if the lease is still in place.
   If DHCP messages are still not passing through the SAVI device, there
   will be a brief disconnection during which data packets passing
   through the SAVI device will be dropped.  The probabilistic
   initiation of the Data Snooping Process can then take over again and
   return the binding state to BOUND in due course.

   The security issues concerning this process are discussed in
   <a href="#section-11.1">Section 11.1</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.3.%20%20Additional%20Binding%20States%20Description"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3" name="section-7.3">7.3</a>.  Additional Binding States Description</span>

   In addition to NO_BIND and BOUND from <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>, three new states
   used in this process are listed here.  The INIT_BIND state is not
   used, as it is entered by observing a DHCP message.

   DETECTION: The address in the entry is undergoing local duplication
   detection.

   RECOVERY: The SAVI device is querying the assignment and lease time
   of the address in the entry through DHCP Leasequery.

   VERIFY: The SAVI device is verifying that the device connected to the
   attachment point has a hardware address that matches the one returned
   in the DHCP Leasequery.

   Because the mechanisms used for the operations carried out while the
   binding is in these three states operate over unreliable protocols,
   each operation is carried out twice with a timeout that is triggered
   if no response is received.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.4.%20%20Events"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.4" name="section-7.4">7.4</a>.  Events</span>

   To handle the Data Snooping Process, six extra events, described
   here, are needed in addition to those used by the DHCP Snooping
   Process (see <a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>).  If an event will trigger the creation of
   a new binding entry, the binding entry limit on the binding anchor
   MUST NOT be exceeded.

   EVE_DATA_UNMATCH: A data packet without a matched binding is
   received.

   EVE_DATA_CONFLICT: An ARP Reply / Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message
   against an address in the DETECTION state is received from a host
   other than the one for which the entry was added (i.e., a host
   attached at a point other than the one on which the triggering data
   packet was received).

   EVE_DATA_LEASEQUERY:

   o  IPv4: A DHCPLEASEACTIVE message with the IP Address Lease Time
      option is received.  Note that the DHCPLEASEUNKNOWN and
      DHCPLEASEUNASSIGNED replies are ignored.

   o  IPv6: A successful LEASEQUERY-REPLY is received.

   EVE_DATA_VERIFY: An ARP Reply / NA message has been received in the
   VERIFY state from the device connected to the attachment point on
   which the data packet was received.

   The triggering packet should pass the following checks to trigger a
   valid event:

   o  Attribute check: the data packet should be from attachments with
      the Data-Snooping attribute; the DHCPLEASEACTIVE/LEASEQUERY-REPLY
      messages should be from attachments with the DHCP-Snooping
      attribute.

   o  Binding limitation check: the data messages must not cause new
      binding setup on an attachment whose binding entry limitation has
      been reached (refer to <a href="#section-11.5">Section 11.5</a>).

   o  Address check: For EVE_DATA_LEASEQUERY, the source address of the
      DHCPLEASEQUERY messages must pass the check specified in
      <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.  For EVE_DATA_CONFLICT and EVE_DATA_VERIFY, the
      source address and target address of the ARP or NA messages must
      pass the check specified in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.

   o  Interval check: the interval between two successive
      EVE_DATA_UNMATCH events triggered by an attachment MUST be no
      smaller than DATA_SNOOPING_INTERVAL.

   o  TID check: the DHCPLEASEACTIVE/LEASEQUERY-REPLY messages must have
      a matched TID with the corresponding entry.

   o  Prefix check: the source address of the data packet should be of a
      valid local prefix, as specified in <a href="rfc7039.html#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC7039]</a>.

   EVE_DATA_EXPIRE: A timer expires indicating that a response to a
   hardware address verification message sent in the VERIFY state has
   not been received within the specified DETECTION_TIMEOUT period.

   EVE_ENTRY_EXPIRE: A timer expires after the Lifetime indicated in the
   relevant BST entry has elapsed.  This is identical to the usage in
   the DHCP Snooping Process.

   The Data Snooping Process involves sending three different messages
   to other network devices.  Each message may be sent up to two times
   since they are sent over unreliable transports and are sent in
   different states.  The functions defined in this section specify the
   messages to be sent in the three cases.  In each case, the message to
   be sent depends on whether the triggering data packet is an IPv4 or
   an IPv6 packet.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.5.1.%20%20Duplicate%20Detection%20Message%20Sender"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.5.1" name="section-7.5.1">7.5.1</a>.  Duplicate Detection Message Sender</span>

   Send a message to check if the source address in the data packet that
   triggered the Data Snooping Process has a local conflict (that is, it
   uses an address that is being used by another node):

   IPv4 address:  Broadcast an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Request
         [<a href="rfc826.html" title='"Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol: Or Converting Network Protocol Addresses to 48.bit Ethernet Address for Transmission on Ethernet Hardware"'>RFC826</a>] or an ARP Probe [<a href="rfc5227.html" title='"IPv4 Address Conflict Detection"'>RFC5227</a>] for the address to the local
         network.  An ARP Response will be expected from the device on
         the attachment point on which the triggering data packet was
         received.  An ARP Reply received on any other port indicates a
         duplicate address.

   IPv6 address:  Send a Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) message
         (Neighbor Solicitation message) to the solicited-node multicast
         address [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] targeting the address.  Ideally, only the
         host on that point of attachment responds with a Neighbor
         Advertisement.  A Neighbor Advertisement received on any other
         port indicates a duplicate address.

   As both the ARP and DAD processes are unreliable (the packet either
   to or from the other system may be lost in transit; see [<a href="rfc6620.html" title='"FCFS SAVI: First-Come, First-Served Source Address Validation Improvement for Locally Assigned IPv6 Addresses"'>RFC6620</a>]),
   if there is no response after the DETECTION_TIMEOUT, an
   EVE_ENTRY_EXPIRE is generated.

   Send a DHCPLEASEQUERY message to the DHCP server(s) to determine if
   it has given out a lease for the source address in the triggering
   data packet.  A list of authorized DHCP servers is kept by the SAVI
   device.  The list should be either preconfigured with the IPv4 and/or
   IPv6 addresses or dynamically discovered: For networks using IPv4,
   this can be done by sending DHCPv4 Discover messages and parsing the
   returned DHCPv4 Offer messages; for networks using IPv6, discovery
   can be done by sending DHCPv6 SOLICIT messages and parsing the
   returned ADVERTISE messages.  The same TID should be used for all
   LEASEQUERY messages sent in response to a triggering data message on
   an attachment point.  The TID is generated if the TID field in the
   BST entry is empty and recorded in the TID field of the BST entry
   when the first message is sent.  Subsequent messages use the TID from
   the BST entry.

   (1)  IPv4 address: Send a DHCPLEASEQUERY [<a href="rfc4388.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Leasequery"'>RFC4388</a>] message querying
        by IP address to each DHCPv4 server in the list of authorized
        servers with an IP Address Lease Time option (option 51).  If
        the server has a valid lease for the address, the requested
        information will be returned in a DHCPLEASEACTIVE message.

   (2)  IPv6 address: Send a LEASEQUERY [<a href="rfc5007.html" title='"DHCPv6 Leasequery"'>RFC5007</a>] message querying by IP
        address to each DHCPv6 server in the list of authorized servers
        using the server address as the link-address in the LEASEQUERY
        message.  If the server has a valid lease for the address, the
        requested information will be returned in a LEASEQUERY-REPLY
        message marked as successful (i.e., without an
        OPTION_STATUS_CODE in the reply).  The IA Address option(s)
        returned contains any IPv6 addresses bound to the same link
        together with the lease validity time.

   As DHCP Leasequeries are an unreliable process (the packet either to
   or from the server may be lost in transit), if there is no response
   after the MAX_LEASEQUERY_DELAY, an EVE_DATA_EXPIRE is generated.
   Note that multiple response messages may be received if the list of
   authorized servers contains more than one address of the appropriate
   type and, in the case of DHCPv6, the responses may contain additional
   addresses for which leases have been allocated.

   IPv4 address:  Send an ARP Request with the Target Protocol Address
         set to the IP address in the BST entry.  The ARP Request is
         only sent to the attachment that triggered the binding.  If the
         attached device has the IP address bound to the interface
         attached to the SAVI device, an ARP Reply should be received
         containing the hardware address of the interface on the
         attached device that can be compared with the leasequery value.

   IPv6 address:  Send a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with the
         target address set to the IP address in the BST entry.  The NS
         is only sent to the attachment that triggered the binding.  If

   mitigate the damage from DoS attacks against this process.

   Create a new entry in the BST.  Set the Binding Anchor field to the
   corresponding binding anchor of the attachment.  Set the Address
   field to the source address of the packet.

   Address conflicts MUST be detected and prevented.

   If local address detection is performed:
         Set the State field to DETECTION.  Set the Lifetime of the

         sending a Duplicate Address Detection Message (<a href="#section-7.5.1">Section 7.5.1</a>).
         Transition to DETECTION state.

         option in the LEASEQUERY-REPLY message and
         MAX_DHCP_RESPONSE_TIME.  Set the Timeouts field to 0.  Start

   This section specifies how to use bindings to filter out packets with
   spoofed source addresses.

   Filtering policies are different for data packets and control
   packets.  DHCP, ARP, and Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>]
   messages are classified as control packets.  All other packets are
   classified as data packets.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.%20%20Data%20Packet%20Filtering"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" name="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Data Packet Filtering</span>

   Data packets from attachments with the Validating attribute TRUE MUST
   have their source addresses validated.  There is one exception to
   this rule.

   A packet whose source IP address is a link-local address cannot be
   checked against DHCP assignments, as it is not assigned using DHCP.
   Note: as explained in <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a>, a SAVI solution for link-local
   addresses, e.g., FCFS SAVI [<a href="rfc6620.html" title='"FCFS SAVI: First-Come, First-Served Source Address Validation Improvement for Locally Assigned IPv6 Addresses"'>RFC6620</a>], can be enabled to check packets
   with a link-local source address.

   If the source IP address of a packet is not a link-local address, but
   there is not a matching entry in the BST with BOUND state, this
   packet MUST be discarded.  However, the packet may trigger the Data
   Snooping Process (<a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>) if the Data-Snooping attribute is set on
   the attachment.

   Data packets from an attachment with the Validating attribute set
   FALSE will be forwarded without having their source addresses
   validated.

   The SAVI device MAY log packets that fail source address validation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2.%20%20Control%20Packet%20Filtering"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" name="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Control Packet Filtering</span>

   For attachments with the Validating attribute:

   DHCPv4 Client-to-Server messages in which the source IP address is
   neither all zeros nor bound with the corresponding binding anchor in
   the BST MUST be discarded.

   DHCPv6 Client-to-Server messages in which the source IP address is
   neither a link-local address nor bound with the corresponding binding
   anchor in the BST MUST be discarded.

   NDP messages in which the source IP address is neither a link-local
   address nor bound with the corresponding binding anchor MUST be
   discarded.

   NA messages in which the target address is neither a link-local
   address nor bound with the corresponding binding anchor MUST be
   discarded.

   ARP messages in which the protocol is IP and the sender protocol
   address is neither all zeros nor bound with the corresponding binding
   anchor MUST be discarded.

   ARP Reply messages in which the target protocol address is not bound
   with the corresponding binding anchor MUST be discarded.

   For attachments with other attributes:

   DHCP Server-to-Client messages not from attachments with the DHCP-
   Trust attribute or Trust attribute MUST be discarded.

   For attachments with no attribute:

   DHCP Server-to-Client messages from such attachments MUST be
   discarded.

   The SAVI device MAY record any messages that are discarded.

   If a SAVI device reboots, the information kept in volatile memory
   will be lost.  This section specifies the restoration of attribute
   configuration and the BST.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.1.%20%20Attribute%20Configuration%20Restoration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.1" name="section-9.1">9.1</a>.  Attribute Configuration Restoration</span>

   The loss of attribute configuration will not break the network: no
   action will be performed on traffic from attachments with no
   attribute.  However, the loss of attribute configuration makes this
   SAVI function unable to work.

   To avoid the loss of binding anchor attribute configuration, the
   configuration MUST be able to be stored in non-volatile storage.
   After the reboot of the SAVI device, if the configuration of binding
   anchor attributes is found in non-volatile storage, the configuration
   MUST be used.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.2.%20%20Binding%20State%20Restoration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.2" name="section-9.2">9.2</a>.  Binding State Restoration</span>

   The loss of binding state will cause the SAVI devices to discard
   legitimate traffic.  Simply using the Data Snooping Process to
   recover a large number of bindings is a heavy overhead and may cause
   considerable delay.  Thus, recovering bindings from non-volatile
   storage, as specified below, is RECOMMENDED.

   Binding entries MAY be saved into non-volatile storage whenever a new
   binding entry changes to BOUND state.  If a binding with BOUND state
   is removed, the saved entry MUST be removed correspondingly.  The
   time when each binding entry is established is also saved.

   If the BST is stored in non-volatile storage, the SAVI device SHOULD
   restore binding state from the non-volatile storage immediately after
   reboot.  Using the time when each binding entry was saved, the SAVI
   device should check whether the entry has become obsolete by
   comparing the saved lifetime and the difference between the current
   time and time when the binding entry was established.  Obsolete
   entries that would have expired before the reboot MUST be removed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.%20%20Constants"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" name="section-10">10</a>.  Constants</span>

   o  MAX_LEASEQUERY_DELAY (10s): Maximum LEASEQUERY timeout value
      (LQ_MAX_RT from [<a href="rfc5007.html" title='"DHCPv6 Leasequery"'>RFC5007</a>])

   o  DETECTION_TIMEOUT (0.5s): Maximum duration of a hardware address

   There are two security problems with the Data Snooping Process
   (<a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>):

   (1)  The Data Snooping Process is costly, but an attacker can trigger
        it simply through sending a number of data packets.  To avoid
        Denial-of-Service attacks against the SAVI device itself, the
        Data Snooping Process MUST be rate limited.  A constant
        DATA_SNOOPING_INTERVAL is used to control the frequency.  Two
        Data Snooping Processes on one attachment MUST be separated by a
        minimum interval time of DATA_SNOOPING_INTERVAL.  If this value
        is changed, the value needs to be large enough to minimize DoS
        attacks.

   (2)  The Data Snooping Process may set up incorrect bindings if the
        clients do not reply to the detection probes (<a href="#section-7.6.1">Section 7.6.1</a>).
        An attack will pass the duplicate detection if the client



<span class="grey">Bi, et al.                   Standards Track                   [Page 48]</span></pre>

        assigned the target address does not reply to the detection
        probes.  The DHCP Leasequery procedure performed by the SAVI
        device just tells whether or not the address is assigned in the
        network.  However, the SAVI device cannot determine whether the
        address is just assigned to the triggering attachment from the
        DHCPLEASEQUERY Reply.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.2.%20%20Securing%20Leasequery%20Operations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.2" name="section-11.2">11.2</a>.  Securing Leasequery Operations</span>

   In [<a href="rfc4388.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Leasequery"'>RFC4388</a>] and [<a href="rfc5007.html" title='"DHCPv6 Leasequery"'>RFC5007</a>], the specific case of DHCP Leasequeries
   originated by "access concentrators" is addressed extensively.  SAVI
   devices are very similar to access concentrators in that they snoop
   on DHCP traffic and seek to validate source addresses based on the
   results.  Accordingly, the recommendations for securing leasequery
   operations for access concentrators in <a href="rfc4388.html#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC4388]</a> and
   <a href="rfc5007.html#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC5007]</a> MUST be followed when leasequeries are made
   from SAVI devices.  [<a href="rfc5007.html" title='"DHCPv6 Leasequery"'>RFC5007</a>] RECOMMENDS that communications between
   the querier and the DHCP server are protected with IPsec.  It is
   pointed out that there are relatively few devices involved in a given
   administrative domain (SAVI devices, DHCP relays, and DHCP servers)
   so that manual configuration of keying material would not be overly
   burdensome.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.3.%20%20Client%20Departure%20Issues"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.3" name="section-11.3">11.3</a>.  Client Departure Issues</span>

   After a binding is set up, the corresponding client may leave its
   attachment point.  It may depart temporarily due to signal fade or
   permanently by moving to a new attachment point or leaving the
   network.  In the signal fade case, since the client may return
   shortly, the binding should be kept momentarily, lest legitimate
   traffic from the client be blocked.  However, if the client leaves
   permanently, keeping the binding can be a security issue.  If the
   binding anchor is a property of the attachment point rather than the
   client, e.g., the switch port but not incorporating the MAC address,
   an attacker using the same binding anchor can send packets using IP
   addresses assigned to the client.  Even if the binding anchor is a
   property of the client, retaining binding state for a departed client
   for a long time is a waste of resources.

   Whenever a direct client departs from the network, a link-down event
   associated with the binding anchor will be triggered.  SAVI-DHCP
   monitors such events and performs the following mechanism.

   (1)  Whenever a client with the Validating attribute leaves, a timer
        of duration OFFLINK_DELAY is set on the corresponding binding
        entries.





<span class="grey">Bi, et al.                   Standards Track                   [Page 49]</span></pre>

   (2)  If a DAD Neighbor Solicitation / Gratuitous ARP request is
        received that targets the address during OFFLINK_DELAY, the
        entry MAY be removed.

   (3)  If the client returns on-link during OFFLINK_DELAY, cancel the
        timer.

   In this way, the bindings of a departing client are kept for
   OFFLINK_DELAY.  In cases of link flapping, the client will not be
   blocked.  If the client leaves permanently, the bindings will be
   removed after OFFLINK_DELAY.

   SAVI-DHCP does not handle the departure of indirect clients because
   it will not be notified of such events.  Switches supporting indirect
   attachment (e.g., through a separate non-SAVI switch) SHOULD use
   information specific to the client such as its MAC address as part of
   the binding anchor.

   DNA [<a href="rfc4436.html" title='"Detecting Network Attachment in IPv4 (DNAv4)"'>RFC4436</a>] [<a href="rfc6059.html" title='"Simple Procedures for Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6"'>RFC6059</a>] is designed to decrease the handover latency
   after reattachment to the same network.  DNA mainly relies on
   performing a reachability test by sending unicast Neighbor
   Solicitation / Router Solicitation / ARP Request messages to
   determine whether a previously configured address is still valid.

   Although DNA provides optimization for clients, there is insufficient
   information for this mechanism to migrate the previous binding or
   establish a new binding.  If a binding is set up only by snooping the
   reachability test message, the binding may be invalid.  For example,
   an attacker can perform the reachability test with an address bound
   to another client.  If a binding is migrated to the attacker, the
   attacker can successfully obtain the binding from the victim.
   Because this mechanism wouldn't set up a binding based on snooping
   the DNA procedure, it cannot achieve perfect compatibility with DNA.
   However, it only means the reconfiguration of the interface is slowed
   but not prevented.  Details are discussed as follows.

   In Simple DNAv6 [<a href="rfc6059.html" title='"Simple Procedures for Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6"'>RFC6059</a>], the probe is sent with the source address
   set to a link-local address, and such messages will not be discarded
   by the policy specified in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.  If a client is reattached to
   a previous network, the detection will be completed, and the address
   will be regarded as valid by the client.  However, the candidate
   address is not contained in the probe.  Thus, the binding cannot be
   recovered through snooping the probe.  As the client will perform
   DHCP exchange at the same time, the binding will be recovered from
   the DHCP Snooping Process.  The DHCP Request messages will not be
   filtered out in this case because they have link-local source

   addresses.  Before the DHCP procedure is completed, packets will be
   filtered out by the SAVI device.  In other words, if this SAVI
   function is enabled, Simple DNAv6 will not help reduce the handover
   latency.  If the Data-Snooping attribute is configured on the new
   attachment of the client, the data-triggered procedure may reduce
   latency.

   In DNAv4 [<a href="rfc4436.html" title='"Detecting Network Attachment in IPv4 (DNAv4)"'>RFC4436</a>], the ARP Probe will be discarded because an
   unbound address is used as the sender protocol address.  As a result,
   the client will regard the address under detection as valid.
   However, the data traffic will be filtered.  The DHCP Request message
   sent by the client will not be discarded because the source IP
   address field should be all zeros as required by [<a href="rfc2131.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>].  Thus, if
   the address is still valid, the binding will be recovered from the
   DHCP Snooping Process.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.5.%20%20Binding%20Number%20Limitation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.5" name="section-11.5">11.5</a>.  Binding Number Limitation</span>

   A binding entry will consume certain high-speed memory resources.  In
   general, a SAVI device can afford only a quite limited number of
   binding entries.  In order to prevent an attacker from overloading
   the resources of the SAVI device, a binding entry limit is set on
   each attachment.  The binding entry limit is the maximum number of
   bindings supported on each attachment with the Validating attribute.
   No new binding should be set up after the limit has been reached.  If
   a DHCP Reply assigns more addresses than the remaining binding entry
   quota of each client, the message will be discarded and no binding
   will be set up.

   A SAVI device MUST delete binding anchor information as soon as
   possible (i.e., as soon as the state for a given address is back to
   NO_BIND), except where there is an identified reason why that
   information is likely to be involved in the detection, prevention, or
   tracing of actual source-address spoofing.  Information about hosts
   that never spoof (probably the majority of hosts) SHOULD NOT be
   logged.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.7.%20%20Fragmented%20DHCP%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.7" name="section-11.7">11.7</a>.  Fragmented DHCP Messages</span>

   This specification does not preclude reassembly of fragmented DHCP
   messages, but it also does not require it.  If DHCP fragmentation
   proves to be an issue, the issue will need to be specified and
   addressed.  (This topic is beyond the scope of this document.)
