Abstract

   This document describes a protocol for supporting Mobile Networks
   between a Mobile Router and a Home Agent by extending the Mobile IPv4
   protocol.  A Mobile Router is responsible for the mobility of one or
   more network segments or subnets moving together.  The Mobile Router
   hides its mobility from the nodes on the Mobile Network.  The nodes
   on the Mobile Network may be fixed in relationship to the Mobile
   Router and may not have any mobility function.

   Extensions to Mobile IPv4 are introduced to support Mobile Networks.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document describes network mobility extensions to the Mobile
   IPv4 protocol.  The goal of introducing these extensions is to
   accommodate mobility scenarios where groups of hosts and routers move
   homogeneously (as a whole).  It is required that all hosts and
   routers in a Mobile Network be able to run applications connecting to
   the Internet, and be reachable from the Internet.

   For details regarding terminology related to network mobility (NEMO),
   a quick read of <a href="rfc4885.html">RFC 4885</a> [<a href="rfc4885.html" title='"Network Mobility Support Terminology"'>RFC4885</a>] is suggested.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Examples%20of%20Mobile%20Networks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Examples of Mobile Networks</span>

   A Mobile Network links together a set of hosts and routers.
   Connecting this Mobile Network to the Internet is ensured at two
   levels: first, a Mobile Router is connected on one side to the Mobile
   Network and on another side to a wireless access system; second, a
   Home Agent placed on the home link manages traffic between the
   Correspondent Node and a Local Fixed Node (LFN, a node in the Mobile
   Network) by means of encapsulating traffic.

   A scenario of applicability for this Mobile Network is described
   next.  A Mobile Network is formed by a wireless-enabled Personal
   Digital Assistant (PDA) and a portable photographic camera, linked
   together by Bluetooth wireless link-layer technology.  This is
   sometimes referred to as a Personal Area Network (PAN).  In the
   illustration below, one can notice the PDA playing the role of a
   Mobile Router and the camera the role of Local Fixed Node.

   The camera (Local Fixed Node) uploads photographic content to a
   Correspondent Node (CN) server.  When the Mobile Network moves away,
   the Mobile Router serving the Mobile Network changes its point of
   attachment from one cellular access (Access Router) to another,
   obtaining a new Care-of Address.  The Home Agent (HA) encapsulates
   application traffic for the CN and LFN.

   Whereas the illustration above is a very simple instantiation of the
   applicability of Mobile IP-based Mobile Networks, more complex Mobile
   Networks are easily accommodated by the Mobile IPv4 extensions
   presented in this document (NEMOv4).  For example, laptop computers
   used by passengers in a bus, train, ship, or plane should all be
   considered as forming Mobile Networks, as long as they move together
   (homogeneously).

   As introduced previously, this document presents extensions to the
   Mobile IPv4 protocol.  The entities sending and receiving these
   extensions are the Mobile Router and the Home Agent.  The Local Fixed
   Node is relieved from running Mobile IP software and, although it
   moves (together with the Mobile Network), its IP stack is not seeing
   any change in addressing.

   Mobility for the entire Mobile Network is supported by the Mobile
   Router registering its current point of attachment (Care-of Address)
   to its Home Agent: the Mobile Router sends an extended Registration
   Request to the Home Agent, which returns an extended Registration
   Reply.  This signaling sets up the tunnel between the two entities,
   as illustrated in the following figure:

   The prefix(es) used within a Mobile Network (either implicitly
   configured on the Home Agent or explicitly identified by the Mobile
   Router in the Registration Request) is/are advertised by the Home
   Agent for route propagation in the home network.  Traffic to and from
   nodes in the Mobile Network are tunneled by the Home Agent to the
   Mobile Router, and vice versa.  Though packets from a Local Fixed
   Node placed in the Mobile Network can be forwarded by the Mobile
   Router directly without tunneling (if reverse tunneling were not
   used), these packets will be dropped if ingress filtering is turned
   on at the Access Router.

   Extensively relating to Mobile IPv4 [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>], this specification
   addresses mainly the co-located Care-of Address mode.  Foreign Agent
   Care-of Address mode (with 'legacy' Foreign Agents [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>]) is

   supported but without optimization, and with double encapsulation
   being used.  For an optimization of this mode, the gentle reader is
   directed to an extension document [<a href="#ref-NEMOv4-FA" title='"FA extensions to NEMOv4 Base"'>NEMOv4-FA</a>].

   Compared to Mobile IPv4, this document specifies an additional tunnel
   between a Mobile Router's Home Address and the Home Agent.  This
   tunnel is encapsulated within the normal tunnel between the Care-of
   Address (CoA) and Home Agent.  In Foreign Agent CoA mode, the tunnel
   between the Mobile Router and Home Agent is needed to allow the
   Foreign Agent to direct the decapsulated packet to the proper
   visiting Mobile Router.  However, in co-located CoA mode, the
   additional tunnel is not essential and could be eliminated because
   the Mobile Router is the recipient of the encapsulated packets for
   the Mobile Network; a proposal for this feature is in the extending
   document mentioned above [<a href="#ref-NEMOv4-FA" title='"FA extensions to NEMOv4 Base"'>NEMOv4-FA</a>].

   All traffic between the nodes in the Mobile Network and the
   Correspondent Nodes passes through the Home Agent.  This document
   does not touch on aspects related to route optimization of this
   traffic.

   A similar protocol has been documented in <a href="rfc3963.html">RFC 3963</a> [<a href="rfc3963.html" title='"Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support Protocol"'>RFC3963</a>] for
   supporting IPv6 Mobile Networks with Mobile IPv6 extensions.

   Multihoming for Mobile Routers is outside the scope of this document.

   Mobile Router

           <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>] defines a Mobile Router as a mobile node
           that can be a router that is responsible for the mobility of
           one or more entire networks moving together, perhaps on an
           airplane, a ship, a train, an automobile, a bicycle, or a
           kayak.

   Mobile Network Prefix

           The network prefix of the subnet delegated to a Mobile Router
           as the Mobile Network.

   Prefix Table

           A list of Mobile Network Prefixes indexed by the Home Address
           of a Mobile Router.  The Home Agent manages and uses the
           Prefix Table to determine which Mobile Network Prefixes
           belong to a particular Mobile Router.

   Local Fixed Node

           <a href="rfc4885.html">RFC 4885</a> [<a href="rfc4885.html" title='"Network Mobility Support Terminology"'>RFC4885</a>] defines a Local Fixed Node (LFN) to be a
           fixed node belonging to the Mobile Network and unable to
           change its point of attachment.  This definition should not
           be confused with "Long, Fat Network, LFN" of <a href="rfc1323.html">RFC 1323</a>
           [<a href="rfc1323.html" title='"TCP Extensions for High Performance"'>RFC1323</a>], at least because the latter is pronounced
           "elephan(t)" whereas a NEMO LFN is distinctively pronounced
           "elefen".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Requirements</span>

   Although the original Mobile IPv4 specifications stated that Mobile
   Networks can be supported by the Mobile Router and Home Agent using
   static configuration or running a routing protocol (see <a href="rfc3344.html#section-4.5">Section 4.5
   of RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>]), there is no solution for explicit
   registration of the Mobile Networks served by the Mobile Router.  A
   solution needs to provide the Home Agent a means to ensure that a
   Mobile Router claiming a certain Mobile Network Prefix is authorized
   to do so.  A solution would also expose the Mobile Network Prefixes
   (and potentially other subnet-relevant information) in the exchanged
   messages, to aid in network debugging.

   The following requirements for Mobile Network support are enumerated:

   o  A Mobile Router should be able to operate in explicit or implicit
      mode.  A Mobile Router may explicitly inform the Home Agent which
      Mobile Network(s) need to be propagated via a routing protocol.  A
      Mobile Router may also function in implicit mode, where the Home
      Agent may learn the Mobile Networks through other means, such as
      from the AAA server, via pre-configuration, or via a dynamic
      routing protocol.

   o  The Mobile Network should be supported using Foreign Agents that
      are compliant to <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>] without any changes ('legacy'
      Foreign Agents).

   o  The Mobile Network should allow Fixed Nodes, Mobile Nodes, or
      Mobile Routers to be on it.

   o  The Local Fixed Nodes on a Mobile Network should be able to
      execute their sessions without running Mobile IP stacks.  The
      Mobile Router managing the LFNs' Mobile Network is 'hiding'
      mobility events like the changes of the Care-of Address from the
      Local Fixed Nodes in that Mobile Network.

   For Explicit Mode, the Mobile Router informs the Home Agent about the
   Mobile Network Prefixes during registration.  The Registration
   Request contains zero, one, or several Mobile Network Request
   extensions in addition to any other extensions defined by or in the
   context of <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>].  When several Mobile Networks need to
   be registered, each is included in a separate Mobile Network Request
   extension, with its own Type, Length, Sub-Type, Prefix Length, and
   Prefix.  A Mobile Network Request extension is encoded in Type-
   Length-Value (TLV) format and respects the following ordering:

   The Registration Reply contains zero, one or several Mobile Network
   Acknowledgement extensions in addition to any other extensions
   defined by or in the context of <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>].  For Implicit
   Mode, the Mobile Network Acknowledgement informs the Mobile Router
   the prefixes for which the Home Agent sets up forwarding with respect
   to this Mobile Router.  Policies such as permitting only traffic from
   these Mobile Networks to be tunneled to the Home Agent may be applied
   by the Mobile Router.  For Explicit Mode, when several Mobile
   Networks need to be acknowledged explicitly, each is included in a
   separate Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension, with its own Type,
   Sub-Type, Length, Prefix, and Prefix Length fields.  At least one
   Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension MUST be in a successful
   Registration Reply to indicate to the Mobile Router that the Mobile
   Network Request extension was processed, and therefore was not
   skipped by the Home Agent.

   A Registration Reply may contain any non-zero number of Explicit Mode
   and Implicit Mode Acknowledgements sub-types.  Both sub-types can be
   present in a single Registration Reply.  A Mobile Network
   Acknowledgement extension is encoded in Type-Length-Value (TLV)
   format.  When the registration is denied with Code HA_MOBNET_ERROR
   (Code field in the Registration Reply), the Code field in the
   included Mobile Network Extension provides the reason for the
   failure.

   A Mobile Router's operation is generally derived from the behavior of
   a Mobile Node, as set in <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>].  In addition to
   maintaining mobility bindings for its Home Address, the Mobile
   Router, together with the Home Agent, maintains forwarding
   information for the Mobile Network Prefix(es) assigned to the Mobile
   Router.

   A Mobile Router SHOULD set the 'T' bit to 1 in all Registration
   Request messages it sends to indicate the need for reverse tunnels
   for all traffic.  Without reverse tunnels, all the traffic from the
   Mobile Network will be subject to ingress filtering in the visited
   networks.  Upon reception of a successful Registration Reply, the
   Mobile Router processes the registration in accordance to <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a>
   [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>].  In addition, the following steps are taken:

   o  Check for Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension(s) in
      Registration Reply.

   o  Create tunnel to the Home Agent if the Mobile Router is registered
      in reverse tunneling mode.

   o  Set up default route via this tunnel or egress interface when the
      Mobile Router is registered with or without reverse tunneling,
      respectively.

   In accordance with this specification, a Mobile Router may operate in
   one of the following two modes: explicit and implicit.  In explicit
   mode, the Mobile Router includes Mobile Network Prefix information in
   all Registration Requests (as Mobile Network Request extensions),
   while in implicit mode it does not include this information in any
   Registration Request.  In the latter case, the Home Agent obtains the
   Mobile Network Prefixes by other means than Mobile IP.  One example
   of obtaining the Mobile Network Prefix is through static
   configuration on the Home Agent.

   A Mobile Router can obtain a co-located or Foreign Agent Care-of
   Address while operating in explicit or implicit modes.

   For deregistration, the Mobile Router sends a registration request
   with lifetime set to zero without any Mobile Network Request
   extensions.

   In a Mobile IP Registration Reply message, there may be two Code
   fields: one proper to the Registration Reply header (the 'proper'
   Code) and one within the Mobile Network Acknowledgement Extension
   (simply the 'Code').  A Mobile Router interprets the values of the
   Code field in the Mobile Network Acknowledgement Extension of the
   Registration Reply in order to identify any error related to managing
   the Mobile Network Prefixes by the Home Agent.  It also interprets
   the values of the Code field in the Registration Reply header (the
   proper Code).

   If the value of the Code field in the Registration Reply (the proper)
   is set to HA_MOBNET_DISALLOWED, then the Mobile Router MUST stop
   sending Registration Requests with any Mobile Network Prefix
   extensions to that Home Agent.

   If the value of the Code field in the Registration Reply (the proper)
   is set to HA_MOBNET_ERROR, then the Mobile Router MUST stop sending
   Registration Requests that contain any of the Mobile Network Prefixes
   that are defined by the values of the fields Prefix and Prefix Length
   in the Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension.  Note that the
   registration is denied in this case, and no forwarding for any Mobile
   Network Prefixes would be set up by the Home Agent for the Mobile
   Router.

   It is possible that the Mobile Router receives a Registration Reply
   with no Mobile Network extensions if the registration was processed
   by a Mobile IPv4 Home Agent that does not support this specification
   at all.  In that case, the absence of Mobile Network extensions must
   be interpreted by the Mobile Router as the case where the Home Agent
   does not support Mobile Networks.

   All the error code values have been assigned by IANA; see <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>.

   Operating a Mobile Router in a Mobile IPv4 environment has certain
   requirements on the management of the necessary initial configuration
   and supervision of the ongoing status information.  Mobile Router
   maintenance indicators may need to be exposed in a manner consistent
   with other Mobile IPv4 indicators.

   The objects for the Management Information Base (MIB) for Mobile IPv4
   are defined in <a href="rfc2006.html">RFC 2006</a> [<a href="rfc2006.html" title='"The Definitions of Managed Objects for IP Mobility Support using SMIv2"'>RFC2006</a>].  The structure of the basic model
   of Mobile IP protocol describes three entities: Mobile Node, Home
   Agent, and Foreign Agent.  In addition to these entities, this
   document proposes a functional entity to be the Mobile Router.

   A Home Agent MUST support all the operations specified in <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a>
   [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>] for Mobile Node support.  The Home Agent MUST support both
   implicit and explicit modes of operation for a Mobile Router.

   The Home Agent processes the registration in accordance to <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a>
   [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>], which includes route setup to the Mobile Router's Home
   Address via the tunnel to the Care-of Address.  In addition, for a
   Mobile Router registering in explicit mode, the following steps are
   taken:

   1.  Check that the Mobile Network Prefix information is valid.

   2.  Ensure the Mobile Network Prefix(es) is/are authorized to be on
       the Mobile Router.

   3.  Create a tunnel to the Mobile Router if it does not already
       exist.

   4.  Set up route for the Mobile Network Prefix via this tunnel.

   5.  Propagate Mobile Network Prefix routes via routing protocol if
       necessary.

   6.  Send the Registration Reply with the Mobile Network
       Acknowledgement extension(s).

   If there are any subnet routes via the tunnel to the Mobile Router
   that are not specified in the Mobile Network extensions, these routes
   are removed.

   In the case where the Mobile Node is not permitted to act as a Mobile
   Router, the Home Agent sends a Registration Reply message whose Code
   field is HA_MOBNET_DISALLOWED (the proper Code field of the
   Registration Reply).

   For a Mobile Router registering in implicit mode, the Home Agent
   performs steps 3-6 above, once the registration request is processed
   successfully.

   For deregistration, the Home Agent removes the tunnel to the Mobile
   Router and all routes using this tunnel.  The Mobile Network
   extensions are ignored.

   [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>], contains binding information for every Mobile Node
   registered with it.  <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>] defines the format of a

   <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>], the Home Agent MUST store the Mobile Network
   Prefixes associated with the Mobile Router in the corresponding
   registration entry, when the corresponding registration was performed
   in explicit mode.  When the Home Agent is advertising reachability to
   Mobile Network Prefixes served by a Mobile Router, the information
   stored in the Registration Table can be used.

   The Home Agent must be able to authorize a Mobile Router for use of
   Mobile Network Prefixes when the Mobile Router is operating in
   explicit mode.  Also, when the Mobile Router operates in implicit
   mode, the Home Agent must be able to locate the Mobile Network
   Prefixes associated with that Mobile Router.  The Home Agent may
   store the Home Address of the Mobile Router along with the Mobile
   Network prefixes associated with that Mobile Router.  If the Mobile
   Router does not have a Home Address assigned, this table may store
   the Network Access Identifier (NAI) [<a href="rfc2794.html" title='"Mobile IP Network Access Identifier Extension for IPv4"'>RFC2794</a>] of the Mobile Router
   that will be used in dynamic Home Address assignment.

   The Home Agent must process Registration Requests coming from Mobile

   specifies that the Home Address of a mobile node registering with a
   Home Agent must belong to a prefix advertised on the home network.
   In accordance with this specification, however, the Home Address must
   be configured from a prefix that is served by the Home Agent, not
   necessarily the one on the home network.

   If the Registration Request is valid, the Home Agent checks to see if
   there are any Mobile Network Prefix extensions included in the
   Registration Request.

   If so, the Mobile Network Prefix information is obtained from the
   included extensions, and the Home Address from the Home Address field
   of the Registration Request.  For every Mobile Network Prefix
   extension included in the registration request, the Home Agent MUST
   perform a check against the Prefix Table.  If the Prefix Table does
   not contain at least one entry pairing that Home Address to that
   Mobile Network Prefix, then the check fails; otherwise, it succeeds.

   Following this check against the Prefix Table, the Home Agent MUST
   construct a Registration Reply containing Mobile Network
   Acknowledgement extensions.  For a Mobile Network Prefix for which
   the check was unsuccessful, the Code field in the corresponding
   Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension should be set to
   MOBNET_UNAUTHORIZED.

   For a Mobile Network Prefix for which the check was successful, the
   Code field in the respective Mobile Network Acknowledgement
   extensions should be set to 0.

   The Home Agent MUST attempt to set up forwarding for each Mobile
   Network Prefix extension for which the Prefix Table check was
   successful.  If the forwarding setup fails for a particular Mobile
   Network Prefix (for reasons such as not enough memory available or
   not enough devices available), the Code field in the respective
   Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension should be set to
   MOBNET_FWDING_SETUP_FAILED.

   If forwarding and setup was successful for at least one Mobile
   Network Prefix, then the Code field (the proper) of the Registration
   Reply message should be set to 0.  Otherwise, when forwarding and
   setup was unsuccessful for each and every Mobile Network Prefixes,
   that Code (the proper) should be HA_MOBNET_ERROR.

   If the Registration Request is sent in implicit mode, i.e., without
   any Mobile Network Request extension, the Home Agent may use pre-
   configured Mobile Network prefix information for the Mobile Router to
   set up forwarding.

   If the Home Agent is updating an existing binding entry for the
   Mobile Router, it MUST check all the prefixes in the Registration
   Table against the prefixes included in the Registration Request.  If
   one or more Mobile Network prefixes are missing from the included

   information in the registration request, the Home Agent MUST delete
   those prefixes from the registration table.  Also, the Home Agent
   MUST disable forwarding for those prefixes.

   If all checks are successful, the Home Agent either creates a new
   entry for the Mobile Router or updates an existing binding entry for
   it and returns a successful registration reply back to the Mobile
   Router or the Foreign Agent (if the Registration Request was received
   from a Foreign Agent).

   In accordance with <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>], the Home Agent does proxy
   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for the Mobile Router Home Address
   when the Mobile Router Home Address is derived from the home network.

   If the 'T' bit is set, the Home Agent creates a bi-directional tunnel
   for the corresponding Mobile Network prefixes or updates the existing
   bi-directional tunnel.  This tunnel is maintained independent of the
   reverse tunnel for the Mobile Router home address itself.

   If the Mobile Network prefixes served by the Home Agent are
   aggregated with the home network prefix and if the Home Agent is the
   default router on the home network, the Home Agent does not have to
   advertise the Mobile Network Prefixes.  The routes for the Mobile
   Network Prefix are automatically aggregated into the home network
   prefix (it is assumed that the Mobile Network Prefixes are
   automatically aggregated into the home network prefix).  If the
   Mobile Router updates the Mobile Network prefix routes via a dynamic
   routing protocol, the Home Agent SHOULD propagate the routes on the
   appropriate networks.

   The Home Agent creates and maintains a bi-directional tunnel for the
   Mobile Network prefixes of a Mobile Router registered with it.  A
   Home Agent supporting IPv4 Mobile Router operation MUST be able to
   forward packets destined to the Mobile Network prefixes served by the
   Mobile Router to its Care-of Address.  Also, the Home Agent MUST be
   able to accept packets tunneled by the Mobile Router with the source
   address of the outer header set to the Care-of Address of the Mobile
   Router and that of the inner header set to the Mobile Router's Home
   Address or an address from one of the registered Mobile Network
   prefixes.

   served by the Mobile Router.  The Registration Reply MUST contain at
   least one Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension.

   If the Home Agent is unable to set up forwarding for one or more
   Mobile Network prefixes served by the Mobile Router, it MUST set the
   Mobile Network Acknowledgement Extension status Code in the
   Registration Reply to MOBNET_FWDING_SETUP_FAILED.  When the prefix
   length is zero or greater than decimal 32, the status Code MUST be
   set to MOBNET_INVALID_PREFIX_LEN.

   If the Mobile Router is not authorized to forward packets to a Mobile

   If the received Registration Request is for deregistration of the
   Care-of Address, the Home Agent, upon successful processing of it,
   MUST delete the entry (or entries) from its Registration Table.  The
   Home Agent tears down the bi-directional tunnel and stops forwarding

   For traffic to the nodes in the Mobile Network, the Home Agent MUST
   perform double tunneling of the packet, if the Mobile Router had
   registered with a Foreign Agent Care-of Address.  In this case, the
   Home Agent MUST encapsulate the packet with the tunnel header (source
   IP address set to Home Agent, and destination IP address set to
   Mobile Router's Home Address) and then encapsulate one more time with
   the tunnel header (source IP address set to Home Agent, and
   destination IP address set to CoA).

   For optimization, the Home Agent SHOULD only encapsulate the packet
   with the tunnel header (source IP address set to Home Agent, and
   destination IP address set to CoA) for co-located CoA mode.

   When a Home Agent receives a packet from the Mobile Network prefix in
   the bi-directional tunnel, it MUST de-encapsulate the packet and
   route it as a normal IP packet.  It MUST verify that the incoming

   packet has the source IP address set to the Care-of Address of the
   Mobile Router.  The packet MUST be dropped if the source address is
   not set to the Care-of Address of the Mobile Router.

   For traffic from the nodes in the Mobile Network, the Mobile Router
   encapsulates the packet with a tunnel header (source IP address set
   to Mobile Router's Home Address, and destination IP address set to
   Home Agent) if reverse tunnel is enabled.  Otherwise, the packet is
   routed directly to the Foreign Agent or access router.

   In co-located CoA mode, the Mobile Router MAY encapsulate one more
   time with a tunnel header (source IP address set to the CoA and

   Nested Network Mobility is a scenario where a Mobile Router allows
   another Mobile Router to attach to its Mobile Network.  There could
   be arbitrary levels of nested mobility.  The operation of each Mobile
   Router remains the same whether the Mobile Router attaches to another
   Mobile Router or to a fixed Access Router on the Internet.  The
   solution described here does not place any restriction on the number
   of levels for nested mobility.  Two issues should be noted though.
   First, whenever physical loops occur in a nested aggregation of
   Mobile Networks, this protocol neither detects nor solves them --
   datagram forwarding may be blocked.  Second, Mobile Routers in a deep
   nested aggregation of Mobile Networks might introduce significant
   overhead on the data packets as each level of nesting introduces
   another tunnel header encapsulation.  Applications that do not
   support MTU discovery are adversely affected by the additional header
   encapsulations because the usable MTU is reduced with each level of
   nesting.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Routing%20Protocol%20between%20Mobile%20Router%20and%20Home%20Agent"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  Routing Protocol between Mobile Router and Home Agent</span>

   There are several benefits of running a dynamic routing protocol
   between the Mobile Router and the Home Agent.  If the Mobile Network
   is relatively large, including several wireless subnets, then the
   topology changes within the moving network can be exposed from the
   Mobile Router to the Home Agent by using a dynamic routing protocol.
   The purpose of the NEMOv4 protocol extensions to Mobile IPv4, as
   defined in previous sections, is not to inform the Home Agent about
   these topology changes, but to manage the mobility of the Mobile
   Router.

   Similarly, topology changes in the home network can be exposed to the
   Mobile Router by using a dynamic routing protocol.  This may be
   necessary when new fixed networks are added in the home network.



<span class="grey">Leung, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 18]</span></pre>

   Here too, the purpose of NEMOv4 extensions is not to inform the
   Mobile Router about topology changes at home.

   Examples of dynamic routing protocols include, but are not limited
   to, OSPF Version 2 [<a href="rfc2328.html" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>RFC2328</a>], BGP [<a href="rfc4271.html" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>], and RIP [<a href="rfc2453.html" title='"RIP Version 2"'>RFC2453</a>].

   The recommendations are related to how the routing protocol and the
   Mobile IPv4 implementation work in tandem on the Mobile Router and on
   the Home Agent (1) without creating incoherent states in the
   forwarding information bases at home and on the Mobile Router, (2)
   without introducing topologically incorrect addressing information in
   the visited domain, and (3) without duplicating sent data or over-
   provisioning security.

   The information exchanged between the Mobile Router and the Home
   Agent is sent over the bi-directional tunnel established by the
   Mobile IPv4 exchange Registration Request - Registration Reply (see
   <a href="#section-6.5">Section 6.5</a>).  If a network address and prefix of a subnet in the
   moving network is sent by the Mobile Router within a routing protocol
   message, then they SHOULD NOT be sent in the Mobile IPv4 Registration
   Request too.  This avoids incoherencies in the forwarding information
   bases.  The Mobile Router SHOULD use NEMOv4 implicit mode in this
   case (see <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).

   The Mobile Router SHOULD NOT send routing protocol information
   updates in the foreign network.  The subnet addresses and prefixes
   valid in the moving network are topologically incorrect in the
   visited network.

   If the Mobile Router and the Home Agent use a dynamic routing

   security mechanisms to protect that protocol's messages, then the
   security recommendations in <a href="#section-10.1">Section 10.1</a> apply.

   The Mobile Network extension is protected by the same rules as for
   Mobile IP extensions in registration messages.  See the Security
   Considerations section in <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>].

   The Home Agent MUST be able to verify that the Mobile Router is
   authorized to provide mobility service for the Mobile Networks in the
   Registration Request, before anchoring these Mobile Network Prefixes
   on behalf of the Mobile Router.  Forwarding for prefixes MUST NOT be
   set up without successful authorization of the Mobile Router for
   those prefixes.  The Mobile Router MUST be notified when there is a
   registration failure because it cannot be successfully authorized for
   prefixes it requested.

   All Registration Requests and replies MUST be authenticated by the
   MN-HA Authentication Extension as specified in <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a> [<a href="rfc3344.html" title='"IP Mobility Support for IPv4"'>RFC3344</a>].
   When the registration request is sent in explicit mode, i.e., with
   one or more Mobile Network Prefix extensions, all the Mobile Network
   Prefix extensions MUST be included before the MN-HA Authentication
   extension.  Also, these extensions MUST be included in the
   calculation of the MN-HA authenticator value.

   The Mobile Router should perform ingress filtering on all the packets
   received on the Mobile Network prior to reverse tunneling them to the
   Home Agent.  The Mobile Router MUST drop any packets that do not have
   a source address belonging to the Mobile Network.

   The Mobile Router MUST also ensure that the source address of packets
   arriving on the Mobile Network is not the same as the Mobile Router's
   IP address on any interface.  These checks will protect against nodes
   attempting to launch IP spoofing attacks through the bi-directional
   tunnel.

   The Home Agent, upon receiving packets through the bi-directional
   tunnel, MUST verify that the source addresses of the outer IP header
   of the packets are set to the Mobile Router's Care-of Address.  Also,
   it MUST ensure that the source address of the inner IP header is a
   topologically correct address on the Mobile Network.  This will
   prevent nodes from using the Home Agent to launch attacks inside the
   protected network.

   If a dynamic routing protocol is used between the Mobile Router and
   the Home Agent to propagate the Mobile Network information into the
   home network, the routing updates SHOULD be protected with IPsec ESP
   confidentiality between the Mobile Router and Home Agent, to prevent
   information about home network topology from being visible to
   eavesdroppers.

   IANA has assigned rules for the existing registry "Mobile IPv4
   numbers - per <a href="rfc3344.html">RFC 3344</a>".  The numbering space for Extensions that may
   appear in Mobile IP control messages (those sent to and from UDP port
   number 434) should be modified.

   The authors would like to thank Christophe Janneteau, George
   Popovich, Ty Bekiares, Ganesh Srinivasan, Alpesh Patel, Ryuji
   Wakikawa, George Tsirtsis, and Henrik Levkowetz for their helpful
   discussions, reviews, and comments.  Vijay Devarapalli extensively
   reviewed one of the later versions of the document.  Hans Sjostrand
   identified the last clarifications with respect to Foreign Agent mode
   treatment.  Pete McCann contributed necessary refinements of many
   statements.

   Mobile IPv4 versions as early as 1996 (<a href="rfc2002.html">RFC 2002</a> by Charles Perkins)
   described Mobile Networks and Mobile Routers support.

   Fred Templin indicated the potential confusion for the term "LFN".

   Amanda Baber of IANA agreed on the principles of allocating numbers
   for this specification and suggested improvements on the IANA
   section.

   Tim Polk of the IESG identified a deeply entrenched error on managing
   the Code fields.

   Lars Eggert of the IESG suggested the accommodation of the otherwise
   legal non-contiguous netmask fields, instead of simply prefix
   lengths.

   Dan Romascanu of the IESG indicated the necessity of manageability of
   Mobile Routers and NEMOv4-enabled Home Agents and their deployability
   in MIP4 environments.
