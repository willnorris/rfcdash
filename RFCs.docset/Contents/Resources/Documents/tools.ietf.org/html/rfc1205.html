                         5250 Telnet Interface

Status of this Memo

   This RFC is being distributed in order to document the interface to
   the IBM 5250 Telnet implementation.  This information is being
   provided for hosts on the Internet that want to support the 5250 work
   station data stream within the Telnet protocol.  This memo provides
   information for the Internet community.  It does not specify any
   standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This RFC describes the interface to the IBM 5250 Telnet
   implementation.  The purpose of this memo is to describe the details
   of the interface so that a person wanting to implement a client
   Telnet which emulates an IBM 5250 work station would be able to do
   so.  This memo does not describe all of the 5250 commands, aid codes,
   and other information specific to the 5250 data stream.  That
   information is contained in the IBM 5250 Information Display System,
   Functions Reference Manual, IBM publication number SA21-9247.
   Corrections and additions to this manual are documented in this RFC
   in <a href="#section-5">section 5</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Telnet%20Options"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Telnet Options</span>

   No new Telnet options are defined for 5250 mode of operation.
   However, to enable 5250 mode, both the client and server must agree
   to at least support the Binary, End-Of-Record (EOR), and Terminal-
   Type Telnet options.  The complete list of 5250 terminal types is
   maintained in the Assigned Numbers RFC and includes the following:

   An example of a typical negotiation process to establish 5250 mode of
   operation is shown below.  In this example, the server initiates the
   negotiation by sending the DO TERMINAL-TYPE request.

    Server: IAC DO TERMINAL-TYPE
    Client: IAC WILL TERMINAL-TYPE
    Server: IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE SEND IAC SE
    Client: IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE IS IBM-5251-11 IAC SE
    (The client has specified its terminal-type is an IBM-5251-11)

    Server: IAC DO END-OF-RECORD
    Client: IAC WILL END-OF-RECORD
    Server: IAC WILL END-OF-RECORD
    Client: IAC DO END-OF-RECORD
    (The server and client have both agreed to transmit EORs)

    Server: IAC DO TRANSMIT-BINARY
    Client: IAC WILL TRANSMIT-BINARY
    Server: IAC WILL TRANSMIT-BINARY
    Client: IAC DO TRANSMIT-BINARY
    (The server and client have both agreed to binary transmission)

   The actual data stream that is exchanged between the client and
   server is composed of a header followed by the 5250 work station data
   stream.  For information about the 5250 work station data stream
   refer to the IBM 5250 Information Display System, Functions Reference
   Manual (SA21-9247).  The header which prefixes the 5250 data stream
   was originally designed for the 5250 Display Station Pass-Through
   (DSPT) application.  5250 DSPT is an application similar to Telnet
   which runs on the IBM AS/400, System/36, and System/38 over an SNA
   network.  This header is designed to be variable in length and is
   composed of two parts.  The first, fixed part is always 6 octets long
   and has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Logical Record Length:  16 bits

      This field indicates the length, in octets, of this logical record
      including the header length.  The length is calculated BEFORE

      doubling any IAC characters in the data stream.  The length does
      not include the &lt;IAC&gt;&lt;EOR&gt; that is appended to the end of the data
      stream to mark the end of this logical record.  The length is
      specified with the most significant octet first.  For example, a
      length of 36 (decimal) would be specified as '0024'X.

   Record Type:  16 bits

      This field indicates the SNA record type.  It should always be set
      to '12A0'X to indicate the General Data Stream (GDS) record type.

   Reserved:  16 bits

      This field is currently not used.

   The second part of the header is designed to be variable in length.
   The length of this variable part is specified in the first octet.
   Currently this portion of the header will always be 4 octets long and
   has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Var Hdr Len:  8 bits

      The length, in octets, of the variable portion of the header.
      Currently this is always '04'X.

   Flags:  16 bits

       Bit 0:      ERR     This bit is set to indicate a data stream
                           output error.  The negative response code
                           is sent as data following the opcode field.
       Bit 1:      ATN     This bit is set to indicate that the 5250
                           attention key was pressed.
       Bits 2-4:   *       These bits are reserved (set to zero).
       Bit 5:      SRQ     This bit is set to indicate that the 5250
                           System Request key was pressed.
       Bit 6:      TRQ     This bit is set to indicate that the 5250
                           Test Request key was pressed.
       Bit 7:      HLP     This bit is set to indicate the Help in

      type of operation requested by the sender.  The following are the
      valid values:

         '00'X:  No Operation
         '01'X:  Invite Operation
         '02'X:  Output Only
         '03'X:  Put/Get Operation
         '04'X:  Save Screen Operation
         '05'X:  Restore Screen Operation
         '06'X:  Read Immediate Operation
         '07'X:  Reserved
         '08'X:  Read Screen Operation
         '09'X:  Reserved
         '0A'X:  Cancel Invite Operation
         '0B'X:  Turn On Message Light
         '0C'X:  Turn Off Message Light

   The actual 5250 work station data stream will immediately follow the
   opcode field in the header and will be terminated by the &lt;IAC&gt;&lt;EOR&gt;
   pair.  For some operations the header will be immediately followed by
   an &lt;IAC&gt;&lt;EOR&gt; without any 5250 work station data stream in between.
   For example, the following request to turn on the message light could
   be sent by the server:

        000A 12A0 0000 0400 000B FFEF
        |    |    |    | |    |  |

        |    |    |    | |    |
        |    |    |    | |    Opcode = Turn On Message Light ('0B'X)
        |    |    |    | |
        |    |    |    | Flags = '0000'X
        |    |    |    |
        |    |    |    Variable Header Length = '04'X
        |    |    |
        |    |    Reserved - Set to '0000'X
        |    |
        |    Record Type = General Data Stream ('12A0'X)
        |
        Logical Record Length = '000A'X for this record

   In this example the requested operation is indicated by the opcode
   and there is no associated work station data stream.

   The following examples illustrate the flow of data between the client
   and server for some of the more common operations.  These examples
   are intended to show the order in which the logical records are sent
   between the client and server and the content of those records.  The
   hex representation of the records which are exchanged between the
   client and server is shown.  The way in which a client implements the
   various operations will differ between implementations and those
   details are not discussed here.  In these examples, when the value of
   a field is dependent on the length of the screen data for a
   particular logical record, it will be represented as 'LLLL'.

   A Query command may be sent by the server system in order to
   determine the attributes of the device it is talking to.  When a
   client receives a Query command, it must send the Query Reply back to
   the server.  See <a href="#section-5">section 5</a> for a complete description of the format
   for the Query command and Query Reply.

   Server: Sends Write Structured    001112A0 00000400 000304F3 0005D970

   The server will send a Cancel Invite when it needs to reverse the
   normal flow direction.  When a client receives a Cancel Invite, it
   should reply with a Cancel Invite and not send any user data until
   the server has once again "invited" the work station.  A work station
   is said to be "invited" when the server has sent a read command to
   the client.  The Cancel Invite flow is as follows:

   Server: Sends header with the     000A12A0 00000400 000AFFEF
           Opcode = Cancel Invite.

   Client: Sends header with the     000A12A0 00000400 000AFFEF
           Opcode = Cancel Invite

   The 5250 System Request operation is invoked when a client wants to
   interrupt the server job to perform some function.  The typical
   scenario would be for a user to press the system request key, or
   whatever key is mapped to a system request key, which would cause the
   client Telnet to initiate the following flow:

   Client: Sends header with the     000A12A0 00000404 0000FFEF
           System Request bit set.

   Note:  It is possible for a client to include user data in this
   record following the header.  This data would be interpreted by the
   server as an option to be selected from the system request menu.  If
   this were the case, the server would not send the system request menu
   and the flow would continue based on the option selected.  For this
   example, the client does not send any user data and the flow would
   continue as follows:

   Server: Sends header with the     000A12A0 00000400 000AFFEF
           Opcode = Cancel Invite.

   Client: Sends header with the     000A12A0 00000400 000AFFEF
           Opcode = Cancel Invite
           to indicate that the
           work station is no
           longer invited.

   Server: Sends Save (Immediate)    000C12A0 00000400 00040402 FFEF
           command with
           Opcode = Save Screen.

   Client: Sends the screen image    LLLL12A0 00000400 00040412
           to be saved.              &lt;Screen Image&gt; FFEF

   completed, the server will continue with the following restore
   operation:

   Server: Sends the saved           LLLL12A0 00000400 00050412

           Data Tag (MDT) command,
           opcode = Invite.

   At this point the client would "invite" the workstation and enter the
   state that it was in prior to the System Request key being hit.

   This section is intended to be used as an addendum to the IBM 5250
   Information Display System, Functions Reference Manual.  Described
   here are enhancements to the 5250 data stream which are not yet
   documented in the current version of that manual.  The current
   version of that manual at the time of this writing has the IBM
   publication number SA21-9247-6.  Also described in this section are
   corrections to erroneous information contained in SA21-9247-6.
   Listed below are the specific corrections and enhancements, with an
   approximate page number reference to the above manual.

   The Insert Cursor (IC) order on pages 2-136 and 2-137 is incorrectly
   listed with a value of Hex 03; the correct value is Hex 13.

   On page 2-137, the listed "Restrictions" for the Insert Cursor,
   Repeat to Address, and Set Buffer Address orders should be updated to
   describe how Row and Column values must be valid for the current
   display screen size (either 24 x 80 or 27 x 132).

   A new flag is added to the second byte of the Control Character on
   page 2-40.  This flag is used to specify whether the cursor should be
   moved or not moved at the end of the Write to Display processing.
   Bit 1 of the second byte, which was previously reserved, will now be
   used for this flag.  If bit 1 is a 0, the cursor continues to be
   moved to the system IC address on a Lock-to-Unlock keyboard
   transition.  If bit 1 is a 1, the cursor is not moved.

   A new Field Control Word (FCW) will be added on page 2-65 to indicate
   an entry field contains transparent data.  This means the entry field
   contents are sent from the display screen directly to the host at
   read time with no formatting.  Therefore, an entry field can contain
   any values (Hex 00 to Hex FF).  A transparent field is indicated by a
   Hex 84xx FCW, where xx is any value.  Note: unpredictable results
   will occur if a field is defined as both signed numeric and a
   transparent field.

   The Read Immediate, Read Input Fields, and Read MDT Fields commands
   have been enhanced to include support for transparent fields (page
   2-5).  If a transparent FCW is found for an input field, the field
   data is not formatted (for example, nulls are not converted to
   blanks).

   The restriction listed for the Set Buffer Address (SBA) order (page
   2-138) on the column address equal to zero is no longer always the
   case.  A reference to Start of Field (SF) row 1/column 1 field
   support should be made.  A note should be added in SF to describe Row
   1/Column 1 field support.  A Row 1/Column 1 field is defined by a SBA
   of row 1/column 0, followed by an SF.  For a Row 1/Column 1 input
   field, the first input-capable position is row 1/column 1.  If the SF
   defines an input field, the screen attribute is not allowed to be
   nondisplay.  Writing of the screen attribute is suppressed for a Row
   1/Column 1 field and the attribute discarded.

   The Read MDT Fields Alternate input command has been added.  It is
   the same as the Read MDT Fields command except:

      - The command is indicated by a X'82'
      - Leading and embedded nulls within the field remain as nulls

   The Read MDT Fields Immediate Alternate input command has been added.
   It is the same as the Read MDT Fields Alternate command except:

      - The command is indicated by a X'83'
      - The command is an immediate read command like Read Immediate;
        therefore, no control characters follow the command byte,
        field data is returned immediately, and the aid code is X'00'.

   The Move Cursor order (MC) has been added (page 2-137).  The MC order
   moves the cursor to the location specified by the two bytes following
   the order.  Byte 1 gives the row address and byte 2 gives the column
   address.  The MC order is useful when the cursor is to be moved
   without affecting the system IC address.  The MC order is unaffected
   by the Write to Display control character values including the "Leave

   data stream, the cursor will move to the address specified in the
   last MC or IC.

   Restrictions:

     A parameter error will be posted when:
      - There are fewer then two bytes following the order.
      - The row address is zero or greater than the number of
        rows on the display screen.
      - The column address is zero or greater than the number of
        columns on the display screen.

   Format:

   Results:

     The address specified by the MC order is used to move the
     cursor when the Write to Display is completed.

   The Transparent Data order (TD) has been added (page 2-137).  The TD
   order is followed by two length bytes and transparent data.  The
   transparent data is written to the display screen at the current
   display address; any values (Hex 00 to Hex FF) are allowed in the
   transparent data.  All length values are valid as long as the end of
   the display screen is not overwritten.

   Restrictions:

     A parameter error will be posted when:
      - There are fewer then two bytes following the order.
      - There are fewer bytes in the data stream then specified in the
        length field.

   The Query command is a new input command (page 2-5) and is used by
   the server to obtain information on the functional capabilities of
   the client 5250 display.  When the client receives a Query command,
   the client sends a Query Reply describing its capabilities back to
   the server.

   The Query command must follow an Escape ('04'X) and Write Structured
   Field command ('F3'X).  The format of the Query command is as
   follows:
