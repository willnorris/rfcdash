<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document provides a brief overview of multicast routing
   architectures that are currently deployed on the Internet and how
   those protocols fit together.  It also describes those multicast
   routing protocols that were never widely deployed or have fallen into
   disuse.  A companion document [<a href="#ref-ADDRARCH" title='"Overview of the Internet Multicast Addressing Architecture"'>ADDRARCH</a>] describes multicast
   addressing architectures.

   Specifically, this memo deals with:

   o  setting up multicast forwarding state (<a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>),

   o  distributing multicast topology information (<a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>),

   o  learning active sources (<a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>),

   o  configuring and distributing the rendezvous point (RP) information
      (<a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>),

   o  mechanisms for enhanced redundancy (<a href="#section-2.5">Section 2.5</a>),

   o  interacting with hosts (<a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>), and

   o  restricting the multicast flooding in the link layer
      (<a href="#section-2.7">Section 2.7</a>).

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> starts by describing a simplistic example how these classes
   of mechanisms fit together.  Some multicast data transport issues are
   also introduced in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   This memo reclassifies to Historic [<a href="rfc2026.html" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>] the following RFCs:

   o  Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP) [<a href="rfc3913.html" title='"Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP): Protocol Specification"'>RFC3913</a>],

   o  Core Based Trees (CBT) [<a href="rfc2189.html" title='"Core Based Trees (CBT version 2) Multicast Routing -- Protocol Specification --"'>RFC2189</a>] [<a href="rfc2201.html" title='"Core Based Trees (CBT) Multicast Routing Architecture"'>RFC2201</a>],

   In order to give a simplified summary how each of these class of
   mechanisms fits together, consider the following multicast receiver
   scenario.

   Certain protocols and configurations need to be in place before
   multicast routing can work.  Specifically, when ASM is employed, a
   router will need to know its RP address(es) (<a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>,
   <a href="#section-2.5">Section 2.5</a>).  With IPv4, RPs need to be connected to other RPs using
   MSDP so information about sources connected to other RPs can be
   distributed (<a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>).  Further, routers need to know if or how
   multicast topology differs from unicast topology, and routing
   protocol extensions can provide that information (<a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>).

   When a host wants to receive a transmission, it first needs to find
   out the multicast group address (and with SSM, source address) using
   various means (e.g., SDP description file [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] or manually).
   Then it will signal its interest to its first-hop router using IGMP
   (IPv4) or MLD (IPv6) (<a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>).  The router initiates setting up
   hop-by-hop multicast forwarding state (<a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>) to the source (in
   SSM) or first through the RP (in ASM).  Routers use an RP to find out
   all the sources for a group (<a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>).  When multicast
   transmission arrives at the receiver's LAN, it is flooded to every
   Ethernet switch port unless flooding reduction such as IGMP snooping
   is employed (<a href="#section-2.7">Section 2.7</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Setting%20up%20Multicast%20Forwarding%20State"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Setting up Multicast Forwarding State</span>

   The most important part of multicast routing is setting up the
   multicast forwarding state.  State maintenance requires periodic
   messaging because forwarding state has a timeout.  This section
   describes the protocols commonly used for this purpose.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.1.%20%20PIM-SM"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.1" name="section-2.1.1">2.1.1</a>.  PIM-SM</span>

   By far, the most common multicast routing protocol is PIM-SM
   [<a href="rfc4601.html" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC4601</a>].  The PIM-SM protocol includes both Any Source Multicast
   (ASM) and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) functionality.  PIM-SSM is
   a subset of PIM-SM that does not use the RPs but instead requires
   that receivers know the (source,group) pair and signal that
   explicitly.  Most current routing platforms support PIM-SM.

   PIM routers elect a designated router on each LAN and the DR is
   responsible for PIM messaging and source registration on behalf of
   the hosts.  The DR encapsulates multicast packets sourced from the
   LAN in a unicast tunnel to the RP.  PIM-SM builds a unidirectional,
   group-specific distribution tree consisting of the interested
   receivers of a group.  Initially, the multicast distribution tree is
   rooted at the RP but later the DRs have the option of optimizing the
   delivery by building (source,group)-specific trees.

   A more lengthy introduction to PIM-SM can be found in <a href="rfc4601.html#section-3">Section 3 of
   [RFC4601]</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.2.%20%20PIM-DM"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.2" name="section-2.1.2">2.1.2</a>.  PIM-DM</span>

   Whereas PIM-SM has been designed to avoid unnecessary flooding of
   multicast data, PIM-DM [<a href="rfc3973.html" title='"Protocol Independent Multicast - Dense Mode (PIM-DM): Protocol Specification (Revised)"'>RFC3973</a>] assumed that almost every subnet at
   a site had at least one receiver for a group.  PIM-DM floods
   multicast transmissions throughout the network ("flood and prune")
   unless the leaf parts of the network periodically indicate that they
   are not interested in that particular group.



<span class="grey">Savola                       Informational                      [Page 5]</span></pre>

   PIM-DM may be an acceptable fit in small and/or simple networks,
   where setting up an RP would be unnecessary, and possibly in cases
   where a large percentage of users are expected to want to receive the
   transmission so that the amount of state the network has to keep is
   minimal.

   PIM-DM was used as a first step in transitioning away from DVMRP.  It
   also became apparent that most networks would not have receivers for
   most groups, and to avoid the bandwidth and state overhead, the
   flooding paradigm was gradually abandoned.  Transitioning from PIM-DM
   to PIM-SM was easy as PIM-SM was designed to use compatible packet
   formats and dense-mode operation could also be satisfied by a sparse
   protocol.  PIM-DM is no longer in widespread use.

   Many implementations also support so-called "sparse-dense"
   configuration, where Sparse mode is used by default, but Dense is
   used for configured multicast group ranges (such as Auto-RP in
   <a href="#section-2.4.3">Section 2.4.3</a>) only.  Lately, many networks have transitioned away
   from sparse-dense to only sparse mode.

   Bidirectional PIM [<a href="rfc5015.html" title='"Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast (BIDIR-PIM)"'>RFC5015</a>] is a multicast forwarding protocol that
   establishes a common shared-path for all sources with a single root.
   It can be used as an alternative to PIM-SM inside a single domain.
   It doesn't have data-driven events or data-encapsulation.  As it
   doesn't keep source-specific state, it may be an appealing approach
   especially in sites with a large number of sources.

   As of this writing, there is no inter-domain solution to configure a
   group range to use bidirectional PIM.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.4.%20%20DVMRP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.4" name="section-2.1.4">2.1.4</a>.  DVMRP</span>

   Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [<a href="rfc1075.html" title='"Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol"'>RFC1075</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-DVMRPv3" title='"Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol"'>DVMRPv3</a>] [<a href="#ref-DVMRPv3-AS" title='"Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol Applicability Statement"'>DVMRPv3-AS</a>] was the first protocol designed for
   multicasting.  To get around initial deployment hurdles, it also
   included tunneling capabilities, which were part of its multicast
   topology functions.

   Currently, DVMRP is used only very rarely in operator networks,
   having been replaced with PIM-SM.  The most typical deployment of
   DVMRP is at a leaf network, to run from a legacy firewall only
   supporting DVMRP to the internal network.  However, Generic Routing
   Encapsulation (GRE) tunneling [<a href="rfc2784.html" title='"Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)"'>RFC2784</a>] seems to have overtaken DVMRP
   in this functionality, and there is relatively little use for DVMRP
   except in legacy deployments.

   MOSPF [<a href="rfc1584.html" title='"Multicast Extensions to OSPF"'>RFC1584</a>] was implemented by several vendors and has seen some
   deployment in intra-domain networks.  However, since it is based on
   intra-domain Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) it does not scale to the
   inter-domain case, operators have found it is easier to deploy a
   single protocol for use in both intra-domain and inter-domain
   networks and so it is no longer being actively deployed.

   BGMP [<a href="rfc3913.html" title='"Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP): Protocol Specification"'>RFC3913</a>] did not get sufficient support within the service

   CBT [<a href="rfc2201.html" title='"Core Based Trees (CBT) Multicast Routing Architecture"'>RFC2201</a>][RFC2189] was an academic project that provided the

   functionality was incorporated into PIM implementations, there was no
   longer a need for a production CBT implementation.  Therefore, CBT
   never saw production deployment.

   It is worth noting that it is possible to run different protocols
   with different multicast group ranges.  For example, treat some
   groups as dense or bidirectional in an otherwise PIM-SM network; this
   typically requires manual configuration of the groups or a mechanism
   like BSR (<a href="#section-2.4.3">Section 2.4.3</a>).  It is also possible to interact between
   different protocols; for example, use DVMRP in the leaf network, but
   PIM-SM upstream.  The basics for interactions among different
   protocols have been outlined in [<a href="rfc2715.html" title='"Interoperability Rules for Multicast Routing Protocols"'>RFC2715</a>].

   The following figure gives a concise summary of the deployment status
   of different protocols as of this writing.

   From this table, it is clear that PIM-Sparse Mode is the only
   multicast routing protocol that is deployed inter-domain and,
   therefore, is most frequently used within multicast domains as well.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Distributing%20Topology%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Distributing Topology Information</span>

   PIM has become the de-facto multicast forwarding protocol, but as its
   name implies, it is independent of the underlying unicast routing
   protocol.  When unicast and multicast topologies are the same
   ("congruent"), i.e., use the same routing tables (routing information
   base, RIB), it has been considered sufficient just to distribute one
   set of reachability information to be used in conjunction with a
   protocol that sets up multicast forwarding state (e.g., PIM-SM).

   However, when PIM which by default built multicast topology based on
   the unicast topology gained popularity, it became apparent that it
   would be necessary to be able to distribute also non-congruent
   multicast reachability information in the regular unicast protocols.
   This was previously not an issue, because DVMRP built its own
   reachability information.

   The topology information is needed to perform efficient distribution
   of multicast transmissions and to prevent transmission loops by
   applying it to the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check.

   This subsection introduces these protocols.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.1.%20%20Multiprotocol%20BGP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" name="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  Multiprotocol BGP</span>

   Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 [<a href="rfc4760.html" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>RFC4760</a>] (often referred to as
   "MBGP"; however, it is worth noting that "MBGP" does *not* stand for
   "Multicast BGP") specifies a mechanism by which BGP can be used to
   distribute different reachability information for unicast (SAFI=1)
   and multicast traffic (SAFI=2).  Multiprotocol BGP has been widely





<span class="grey">Savola                       Informational                      [Page 8]</span></pre>

   deployed for years, and is also needed to route IPv6.  Note that
   SAFI=3 was originally specified for "both unicast and multicast" but
   has since then been deprecated.

   These extensions are in widespread use wherever BGP is used to
   distribute unicast topology information.  Multicast-enabled networks
   that use BGP should use Multiprotocol BGP to distribute multicast
   reachability information explicitly even if the topologies are
   congruent to make an explicit statement about multicast reachability.
   A number of significant multicast transit providers even require
   this, by doing the RPF lookups solely based on explicitly advertised
   multicast address family.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.2.%20%20OSPF%2FIS-IS%20Multi-Topology%20Extensions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2" name="section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  OSPF/IS-IS Multi-Topology Extensions</span>

   Similar to BGP, some Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) also provide
   the capability for signalling differing topologies, for example IS-IS
   multi-topology extensions [<a href="#ref-M-ISIS" title='"M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in IS-IS"'>M-ISIS</a>].  These can be used for a
   multicast topology that differs from unicast.  Similar but not so
   widely implemented work exists for OSPF [<a href="rfc4915.html" title='"Multi-Topology (MT) Routing in OSPF"'>RFC4915</a>].

   It is worth noting that inter-domain incongruence and intra-domain
   incongruence are orthogonal, so one doesn't require the other.
   Specifically, inter-domain incongruence is quite common, while intra-
   domain incongruence isn't, so you see much more deployment of MBGP
   than MT-ISIS/OSPF.  Commonly deployed networks have managed well
   without protocols handling intra-domain incongruence.  However, the
   availability of multi-topology mechanisms may in part replace the
   typically used workarounds such as tunnels.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.3.%20%20Issue%3A%20Overlapping%20Unicast%2FMulticast%20Topology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.3" name="section-2.2.3">2.2.3</a>.  Issue: Overlapping Unicast/Multicast Topology</span>

   An interesting case occurs when some routers do not distribute
   multicast topology information explicitly while others do.  In
   particular, this happens when some multicast sites in the Internet
   are using plain BGP while some use MBGP.

   Different implementations deal with this in different ways.
   Sometimes, multicast RPF mechanisms first look up the multicast
   routing table, or M-RIB ("topology database") with a longest prefix
   match algorithm, and if they find any entry (including a default
   route), that is used; if no match is found, the unicast routing table
   is used instead.

   An alternative approach is to use longest prefix match on the union
   of multicast and unicast routing tables; an implementation technique
   here is to copy the whole unicast routing table over to the multicast
   routing table.  The important point to remember here, though, is to



<span class="grey">Savola                       Informational                      [Page 9]</span></pre>

   not override the multicast-only routes; if the longest prefix match
   would find both a (copied) unicast route and a multicast-only route,
   the latter should be treated as preferable.

   Another implemented approach is to just look up the information in
   the unicast routing table, and provide the user capabilities to
   change that as appropriate, using for example copying functions
   discussed above.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.4.%20%20Summary"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.4" name="section-2.2.4">2.2.4</a>.  Summary</span>

   A congruent topology can be deployed using unicast routing protocols
   that provide no support for a separate multicast topology.  In intra-
   domain that approach is often adequate.  However, it is recommended
   that if inter-domain routing uses BGP, multicast-enabled sites should
   use MP-BGP SAFI=2 for multicast and SAFI=1 for unicast even if the
   topology was congruent to explicitly signal "yes, we use multicast".

   The following table summarizes the approaches that can be used to
   distribute multicast topology information.

                          +----------------+--------------+
                          | Inter-domain   | Intra-domain |
   +--------------------- +----------------+--------------+
   | MP-BGP SAFI=2        |      Yes       |     Yes      |
   | MP-BGP SAFI=3        |  Doesn't work  | Doesn't work |
   | IS-IS multi-topology | Not applicable |     Yes      |
   | OSPF multi-topology  | Not applicable | Few implem.  |
   +----------------------+----------------+--------------+

   "Not applicable" refers to the fact that IGP protocols can't be used
   in inter-domain routing.  "Doesn't work" means that while MP-BGP
   SAFI=3 was defined and could apply, that part of the specification
   has not been implemented and can't be used in practice.  "Yes" lists
   the mechanisms which are generally applicable and known to work.
   "Few implem." means that the approach could work but is not commonly
   available.

   To build a multicast distribution tree, the routing protocol needs to
   find out where the sources for the group are.  In case of SSM, the
   user specifies the source IP address or it is otherwise learned out
   of band.

   In ASM, the RPs know about all the active sources in a local PIM
   domain.  As a result, when PIM-SM or BIDIR-PIM is used in intra-
   domain the sources are learned as a feature of the protocol itself.

   Having a single PIM-SM domain for the whole Internet is an
   insufficient model for many reasons, including scalability,
   administrative boundaries, and different technical tradeoffs.
   Therefore, it is required to be able to split up the multicast
   routing infrastructures to smaller domains, and there must be a way
   to share information about active sources using some mechanism if the
   ASM model is to be supported.

   This section discusses the options of learning active sources that
   apply in an inter-domain environment.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.1.%20%20SSM"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.1" name="section-2.3.1">2.3.1</a>.  SSM</span>

   Source-specific Multicast [<a href="rfc4607.html" title='"Source-Specific Multicast for IP"'>RFC4607</a>] (sometimes also referred to as
   "single-source Multicast") does not count on learning active sources
   in the network.  Recipients need to know the source IP addresses
   using an out of band mechanism which are used to subscribe to the
   (source, group) channel.  The multicast routing uses the source
   address to set up the state and no further source discovery is
   needed.

   As of this writing, there are attempts to analyze and/or define out-
   of-band source discovery functions which would help SSM in particular
   [<a href="#ref-DYNSSM-REQ" title='"Requirements for discovery of dynamic SSM sources"'>DYNSSM-REQ</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.2.%20%20MSDP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.2" name="section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a>.  MSDP</span>

   Multicast Source Discovery Protocol [<a href="rfc3618.html" title='"Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)"'>RFC3618</a>] was invented as a stop-
   gap mechanism, when it became apparent that multiple PIM-SM domains
   (and RPs) were needed in the network, and information about the
   active sources needed to be propagated between the PIM-SM domains
   using some other protocol.

   MSDP is also used to share the state about sources between multiple
   RPs in a single domain for, e.g., redundancy purposes [<a href="rfc3446.html" title='"Anycast Rendevous Point (RP) mechanism using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) and Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)"'>RFC3446</a>].  The
   same can be achieved using PIM extensions [<a href="rfc4610.html" title='"Anycast-RP Using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)"'>RFC4610</a>].  See <a href="#section-2.5">Section 2.5</a>
   for more information.

   There is no intent to define MSDP for IPv6, but instead use only SSM
   and Embedded-RP [<a href="#ref-MCAST-ISSUES" title='"IPv6 Multicast Deployment Issues"'>MCAST-ISSUES</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.3.%20%20Embedded-RP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.3" name="section-2.3.3">2.3.3</a>.  Embedded-RP</span>

   Embedded-RP [<a href="rfc3956.html" title='"Embedding the Rendezvous Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address"'>RFC3956</a>] is an IPv6-only technique to map the address of
   the RP to the multicast group address.  Using this method, it is
   possible to avoid the use of MSDP while still allowing multiple
   multicast domains (in the traditional sense).

   The model works by defining a single RP address for a particular
   group for all of the Internet, so there is no need to share state
   about that with any other RPs.  If necessary, RP redundancy can still
   be achieved with Anycast-RP using PIM [<a href="rfc4610.html" title='"Anycast-RP Using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)"'>RFC4610</a>].

   PIM-SM and BIDIR-PIM configuration mechanisms exist, which are used
   to configure the RP addresses and the groups that are to use those
   RPs in the routers.  This section outlines the approaches.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.1.%20%20Manual%20RP%20Configuration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.1" name="section-2.4.1">2.4.1</a>.  Manual RP Configuration</span>

   It is often easiest just to manually configure the RP information on
   the routers when PIM-SM is used.

   Originally, static RP mapping was considered suboptimal since it
   required explicit configuration changes every time the RP address
   changed.  However, with the advent of anycast RP addressing, the RP
   address is unlikely to ever change.  Therefore, the administrative
   burden is generally limited to initial configuration.  Since there is
   usually a fair amount of multicast configuration required on all
   routers anyway (e.g., PIM on all interfaces), adding the RP address
   statically isn't really an issue.  Further, static anycast RP mapping
   provides the benefits of RP load sharing and redundancy (see
   <a href="#section-2.5">Section 2.5</a>) without the complexity found in dynamic mechanisms like
   Auto-RP and Bootstrap Router (BSR).

   With such design, an anycast RP uses an address that is configured on
   a loopback interface of the routers currently acting as RPs, and
   state is distributed using PIM [<a href="rfc4610.html" title='"Anycast-RP Using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)"'>RFC4610</a>] or MSDP [<a href="rfc3446.html" title='"Anycast Rendevous Point (RP) mechanism using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) and Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)"'>RFC3446</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5110.html">RFC 5110</a>               Multicast Routing Overview           January 2008</span>


   Using this technique, each router might only need to be configured
   with one, portable RP address.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.2.%20%20Embedded-RP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.2" name="section-2.4.2">2.4.2</a>.  Embedded-RP</span>

   Embedded-RP provides the information about the RP's address in the
   group addresses that are delegated to those who use the RP, so unless
   no other ASM than Embedded-RP is used, the network administrator only
   needs to configure the RP routers.

   While Embedded-RP in many cases is sufficient for IPv6, other methods
   of RP configuration are needed if one needs to provide ASM service
   for other than Embedded-RP group addresses.  In particular, service
   discovery type of applications may need hard-coded addresses that are
   not dependent on local RP addresses.

   As the RP's address is exposed to the users and applications, it is
   very important to ensure it does not change often, e.g., by using
   manual configuration of an anycast address.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.3.%20%20BSR%20and%20Auto-RP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.3" name="section-2.4.3">2.4.3</a>.  BSR and Auto-RP</span>

   BSR [<a href="rfc5059.html" title='"Bootstrap Router (BSR) Mechanism for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)"'>RFC5059</a>] is a mechanism for configuring the RP address for
   groups.  It may no longer be in as wide use with IPv4 as it was
   earlier, and for IPv6, Embedded-RP will in many cases be sufficient.

   Cisco's Auto-RP is an older, proprietary method for distributing
   group to RP mappings, similar to BSR.  Auto-RP has little use today.

   Both Auto-RP and BSR require some form of control at the routers to
   ensure that only valid routers are able to advertise themselves as
   RPs.  Further, flooding of BSR and Auto-RP messages must be prevented
   at PIM borders.  Additionally, routers require monitoring that they
   are actually using the RP(s) the administrators think they should be
   using, for example, if a router (maybe in customer's control) is
   advertising itself inappropriately.  All in all, while BSR and
   Auto-RP provide easy configuration, they also provide very
   significant configuration and management complexity.

   It is worth noting that both Auto-RP and BSR were deployed before the
   use of a manually configured anycast-RP address became relatively
   commonplace, and there is actually relatively little need for them
   today unless there is a need to configure different properties (e.g.,
   sparse, dense, bidirectional) in a dynamic fashion.

   Having only one RP in a PIM-SM domain would be a single point of
   failure for the whole multicast domain.  As a result, a number of
   mechanisms have been developed to either eliminate the RP
   functionality or to enhance RPs' redundancy, resilience against
   failures, and to recover from failures quickly.  This section
   summarizes these techniques explicitly.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.5.1.%20%20Anycast%20RP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.1" name="section-2.5.1">2.5.1</a>.  Anycast RP</span>

   As mentioned in <a href="#section-2.3.2">Section 2.3.2</a>, MSDP is also used to share the state
   about sources between multiple RPs in a single domain, e.g., for
   redundancy purposes [<a href="rfc3446.html" title='"Anycast Rendevous Point (RP) mechanism using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) and Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)"'>RFC3446</a>].  The purpose of MSDP in this context
   is to share the same state information on multiple RPs for the same
   groups to enhance the robustness of the service.

   Recent PIM extensions [<a href="rfc4610.html" title='"Anycast-RP Using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)"'>RFC4610</a>] also provide this functionality.  In
   contrast to MSDP, this approach works for both IPv4 and IPv6.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.5.2.%20%20Stateless%20RP%20Failover"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.2" name="section-2.5.2">2.5.2</a>.  Stateless RP Failover</span>

   While Anycast RP shares state between RPs so that RP failure causes
   only small disturbance, stateless approaches are also possible with a
   more limited resiliency.  A traditional mechanism has been to use
   Auto-RP or BSR (see <a href="#section-2.4.3">Section 2.4.3</a>) to select another RP when the
   active one failed.  However, the same functionality could be achieved
   using a shared-unicast RP address ("anycast RP without state
   sharing") without the complexity of a dynamic mechanism.  Further,
   Anycast RP offers a significantly more extensive failure mitigation
   strategy, so today there is actually very little need to use
   stateless failover mechanisms, especially dynamic ones, for
   redundancy purposes.

   Because bidirectional PIM (see <a href="#section-2.1.3">Section 2.1.3</a>) does not switch to
   shortest path tree (SPT), the final multicast tree may be established
   faster.  On the other hand, PIM-SM or SSM may converge more quickly
   especially in scenarios (e.g., unicast routing change) where
   bidirectional needs to re-do the Designated Forwarder election.

   Previous sections have dealt with the components required by routers
   to be able to do multicast routing.  Obviously, the real users of
   multicast are the hosts: either sending or receiving multicast.  This
   section describes the required interactions with hosts.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.6.1.%20%20Hosts%20Sending%20Multicast"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6.1" name="section-2.6.1">2.6.1</a>.  Hosts Sending Multicast</span>

   After choosing a multicast group through a variety of means, hosts
   just send the packets to the link-layer multicast address, and the
   designated router will receive all the multicast packets and start
   forwarding them as appropriate.  A host does not need to be a member
   of the group in order to send to it [<a href="rfc1112.html" title='"Host extensions for IP multicasting"'>RFC1112</a>].

   In intra-domain or Embedded-RP scenarios, ASM senders may move to a
   new IP address without significant impact on the delivery of their
   transmission.  SSM senders cannot change the IP address unless
   receivers join the new channel or the sender uses an IP mobility
   technique that is transparent to the receivers.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.6.2.%20%20Hosts%20Receiving%20Multicast"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6.2" name="section-2.6.2">2.6.2</a>.  Hosts Receiving Multicast</span>

   Hosts signal their interest in receiving a multicast group or channel
   by the use of IGMP [<a href="rfc3376.html" title='"Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3"'>RFC3376</a>] and MLD [<a href="rfc3810.html" title='"Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6"'>RFC3810</a>].  IGMPv2 and MLDv1 are
   still commonplace, but are also often used in new deployments.  Some

   vendors also support SSM mapping techniques for receivers which use
   an older IGMP/MLD version where the router maps the join request to
   an SSM channel based on various, usually complex means of
   configuration.

   Multicast transmission in the link layer, for example Ethernet,
   typically includes some form of flooding the packets through a LAN.
   This causes unnecessary bandwidth usage and discarding unwanted
   frames on those nodes which did not want to receive the multicast
   transmission.

   Therefore a number of techniques have been developed, to be used in
   Ethernet switches between routers, or between routers and hosts, to
   limit the flooding.

   Some mechanisms operate with IP addresses, others with MAC addresses.
   If filtering is done based on MAC addresses, hosts may receive
   unnecessary multicast traffic (filtered out in the hosts' IP layer)
   if more than one IP multicast group addresses maps into the same MAC
   address, or if IGMPv3/MLDv2 source filters are used.  Filtering based
   on IP destination addresses, or destination and sources addresses,
   will help avoid these but requires parsing of the Ethernet frame
   payload.

   These options are discussed in this section.

   A proprietary solution, Cisco's RGMP [<a href="rfc3488.html" title='"Cisco Systems Router-port Group Management Protocol (RGMP)"'>RFC3488</a>] has been developed to
   reduce the amount of flooding between routers in a switched networks.
   This is typically only considered a problem in some Ethernet-based
   Internet Exchange points or VPNs.

   There have been proposals to observe and possibly react ("snoop") PIM
   messages [<a href="#ref-PIM-SNOOP" title='"PIM Snooping over VPLS"'>PIM-SNOOP</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.7.2.%20%20Host%2FRouter%20Flooding%20Reduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7.2" name="section-2.7.2">2.7.2</a>.  Host/Router Flooding Reduction</span>

   There are a number of techniques to help reduce flooding both from a
   router to hosts, and from a host to the routers (and other hosts).

   Cisco's proprietary CGMP [<a href="#ref-CGMP" title='"Cisco Group Management Protocol"'>CGMP</a>] provides a solution where the routers
   notify the switches, but also allows the switches to snoop IGMP
   packets to enable faster notification of hosts no longer wishing to
   receive a group.  Implementations of CGMP do not support fast leave
   behaviour with IGMPv3.  Due to IGMP report suppression in IGMPv1 and
   IGMPv2, multicast is still flooded to ports which were once members
   of a group as long as there is at least one receiver on the link.
   Flooding restrictions are done based on multicast MAC addresses.
   Implementations of CGMP do not support IPv6.

   IEEE 802.1D-2004 specification describes Generic Attribute
   Registration Protocol (GARP), and GARP Multicast Registration
   Protocol (GMRP) [<a href="#ref-GMRP" title='"GARP Multicast Registration Protocol"'>GMRP</a>] is a link-layer multicast group application of
   GARP that notifies switches about MAC multicast group memberships.
   If GMRP is used in conjunction with IP multicast, then the GMRP
   registration function would become associated with an IGMP "join".
   However, this GMRP-IGMP association is beyond the scope of GMRP.
   GMRP requires support at the host stack and it has not been widely
   implemented.  Further, IEEE 802.1 considers GARP and GMRP obsolete
   being replaced by Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP) and Multicast
   Multiple Registration Protocol (MMRP) that are being specified in

   bridges.  Some further information about GARP/GMRP is also available
   in <a href="rfc3488.html#appendix-B">Appendix B of [RFC3488]</a>.

   IGMP snooping [<a href="rfc4541.html" title='"Considerations for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Snooping Switches"'>RFC4541</a>] appears to be the most widely implemented
   technique.  IGMP snooping requires that the switches implement a
   significant amount of IP-level packet inspection; this appears to be
   something that is difficult to get right, and often the upgrades are
   also a challenge.  Snooping support is commonplace for IGMPv1 and
   IGMPv2, but fewer switches support IGMPv3 or MLD (any version)
   snooping.  In the worst case, enabling IGMP snooping on a switch that
   does not support IGMPv3 snooping breaks multicast capabilities of
   nodes using IGMPv3.

   Snooping switches also need to identify the ports where routers
   reside and therefore where to flood the packets.  This can be
   accomplished using Multicast Router Discovery protocol [<a href="rfc4286.html" title='"Multicast Router Discovery"'>RFC4286</a>],
   looking at certain IGMP queries [<a href="rfc4541.html" title='"Considerations for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Snooping Switches"'>RFC4541</a>], looking at PIM Hello and
   possibly other messages, or by manual configuration.  An issue with

   PIM snooping at LANs is that PIM messages can't be turned off or
   encrypted, leading to security issues [<a href="#ref-PIM-THREATS" title='"Host Threats to Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)"'>PIM-THREATS</a>].

   IGMP proxying [<a href="rfc4605.html" title='"Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) / Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)-Based Multicast Forwarding ("'>RFC4605</a>] is sometimes used either as a replacement of
   a multicast routing protocol on a small router, or to aggregate IGMP/
   MLD reports when used with IGMP snooping.

   A couple of mechanisms have been specified to improve the
   characteristics of the data that can be transported over multicast.

   We describe those mechanisms that have impact on the multicast
   routing infrastructure, e.g., require or specify router assistance or
   involvement in some form.  Purely end-to-end or host-based protocols
   are out of scope.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.%20%20Reliable%20Multicast"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" name="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Reliable Multicast</span>

   There has been some work on reliable multicast delivery so that
   applications with reliability requirements could use multicast
   instead of simple unreliable UDP.

   Most of the mechanisms are host-based and as such out of scope of
   this document, but one relevant from multicast routing perspective is
   Pragmatic Generic Multicast (PGM) [<a href="rfc3208.html" title='"PGM Reliable Transport Protocol Specification"'>RFC3208</a>].  It does not require
   support from the routers, bur PGM-aware routers may act in router
   assistance role in the initial delivery and potential retransmission
   of missing data.

   Multicast Security Working Group has been working on methods how the
   integrity, confidentiality, and authentication of data sent to
   multicast groups can be ensured using cryptographic techniques
   [<a href="rfc3740.html" title='"The Multicast Group Security Architecture"'>RFC3740</a>].
