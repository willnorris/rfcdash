Introduction

This Protocol is one of a set of International Standards produced to
facilitate the interconnection of open systems. The set of standards
covers the services and protocols re quired to achieve such
interconnection.  This Protocol is positioned with respect to other
related standards by the layers defined in the ISO 7498 and by the
structure defined in the ISO 8648. In particular, it is a protocol of
the Network Layer. This protocol permits Intermediate Systems within a
routeing Domain to exchange configuration and routeing information to
facilitate the operation of the route ing and relaying functions of
the Network Layer.  The protocol is designed to operate in close
conjunction with ISO 9542 and ISO 8473.  ISO 9542 is used to establish
connectivity and reachability between End Systems and Inter mediate
Systems on individual Subnetworks. Data is carried by ISO 8473.  The
related algo rithms for route calculation and maintenance are also
described.  The intra-domain ISIS routeing protocol is intended to
support large routeing domains consisting of combinations of many
types of subnetworks. This includes point-to-point links, multipoint
links, X.25 subnetworks, and broadcast subnetworks such as ISO 8802
LANs.  In order to support large routeing domains, provision is made
for Intra-domain routeing to be organised hierarchically. A large
domain may be administratively divided into areas.  Each system
resides in exactly one area. Routeing within an area is referred to as
Level 1 routeing. Routeing between areas is referred to as Level 2
routeing.  Level 2 Intermediate systems keep track of the paths to
destination areas. Level 1 Intermediate systems keep track of the
routeing within their own area. For an NPDU destined to another area,
a Level 1 Intermediate system sends the NPDU to the nearest level 2 IS
in its own area, re gardless of what the destination area is. Then the
NPDU travels via level 2 routeing to the destination area, where it
again travels via level 1 routeing to the destination End System.

Telecommunications and information exchange between systems
Intermediate system to Intermediate system Intra-Domain routeing
exchange protocol for use in Conjunction with the Protocol for
providing the Connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1%20Scope%20and%20Field%20of%20Application"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a> Scope and Field of Application</span>

This International Standard specifies a protocol which is used by
Network Layer entities operating ISO 8473 in In termediate Systems to
maintain routeing information for the purpose of routeing within a
single routeing domain. The protocol herein described relies upon the
provision of a connectionless-mode underlying service.11See ISO 8473
and its Addendum 3 for the mechanisms necessary to realise this
service on subnetworks based on ISO 8208, ISO 8802, and the OSI Data
Link Service.

This Standard specifies:

a)procedures for the transmission of configuration and
routeing information between network entities resid
ing in Intermediate Systems within a single routeing
domain;

b)the encoding of the protocol data units used for the
transmission of the configuration and routeing infor
mation;

c)procedures for the correct interpretation of protocol
control information; and

d)the functional requirements for implementations
claiming conformance to this Standard.

The procedures are defined in terms of:

a)the interactions between Intermediate system Network
entities through the exchange of protocol data units;
and

b)the interactions between a Network entity and an un
derlying service provider through the exchange of
subnetwork service primitives.

c)the constraints on route determination which must be
observed by each Intermediate system when each has
a routeing information base which is consistent with
the others.

For the purposes of this International Standard, the follow
ing definitions apply:
3.6.1
Area: A routeing subdomain which maintains de
tailed routeing information about its own internal
composition, and also maintains routeing informa
tion which allows it to reach other routeing subdo
mains. It corresponds to the Level 1 subdomain.
3.6.2
Neighbour: An adjacent system reachable by tra
versal of a single subnetwork by a PDU.
3.6.3
Adjacency: A portion of the local routeing infor
mation which pertains to the reachability of a sin
gle neighbour ES or IS over a single circuit.
Adjacencies are used as input to the Decision Proc
ess for forming paths through the routeing domain.
A separate adjacency is created for each neighbour
on a circuit, and for each level of routeing (i.e.
level 1 and level 2) on a broadcast circuit.
3.6.4
Circuit: The subset of the local routeing informa
tion base pertinent to a single local SNPA.
3.6.5
Link: The communication path between two
neighbours.
A Link is up when communication is possible
between the two SNPAs.
3.6.6
Designated IS: The Intermediate system on a
LAN which is designated to perform additional du
ties. In particular it generates Link State PDUs on
behalf of the LAN, treating the LAN as a
pseudonode.
3.6.7
Pseudonode: Where a broadcast subnetwork has n
connected Intermediate systems, the broadcast
subnetwork itself is considered to be a
pseudonode.
The pseudonode has links to each of the n Interme
diate systems and each of the ISs has a single link
to the pseudonode (rather than n-1 links to each of
the other Intermediate systems). Link State PDUs
are generated on behalf of the pseudonode by the
Designated IS. This is depicted below in figure 1.
3.6.8
Broadcast subnetwork: A subnetwork which sup
ports an arbitrary number of End systems and In

termediate systems and additionally is capable of
transmitting a single SNPDU to a subset of these
systems in response to a single SN_UNITDATA
request.
3.6.9
General topology subnetwork: A subnetwork
which supports an arbitrary number of End sys
tems and Intermediate systems, but does not sup
port a convenient multi-destination connectionless
trans</pre>

3.6.10
Routeing Subdomain: a set of Intermediate sys
tems and End systems located within the same
Routeing domain.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1%20System%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a> System Types</span>
There are the following types of system:
End Systems: These systems deliver NPDUs to other sys
tems and receive NPDUs from other systems, but do
not relay NPDUs. This International Standard does
not specify any additional End system functions be
yond those supplied by ISO 8473 and ISO 9542.
Level 1 Intermediate Systems: These systems deliver and
receive NPDUs from other systems, and relay
NPDUs from other source systems to other destina
tion systems. They route directly to systems within
their own area, and route towards a level 2 Interme
diate system when the destination system is in a dif
ferent area.
Level 2 Intermediate Systems: These systems act as Level 1
Intermediate systems in addition to acting as a sys
tem in the subdomain consisting of level 2 ISs. Sys
tems in the level 2 subdomain route towards a desti
nation area, or another routeing domain.
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2%20Subnetwork%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" name="section-6.2">6.2</a> Subnetwork Types</span>
There are two generic types of subnetworks supported.
a)broadcast subnetworks: These are multi-access
subnetworks that support the capability of addressing
a group of attached systems with a single NPDU, for
instance ISO 8802.3 LANs.
b)general topology subnetworks: These are modelled as
a set of point-to-point links each of which connects
exactly two systems.
There are several generic types of general topology
subnetworks:
1)multipoint links: These are links between more
than two  systems, where one system is a primary
system, and the remaining systems are secondary
(or slave) systems. The primary is capable of direct
communication with any of the secondaries, but
the secondaries cannot communicate directly
among themselves.
2)permanent point-to-point links: These are links
that stay connected at all times (unless broken, or
turned off by system management), for instance
leased lines or private links.
3)dynamically established data links (DEDs): these
are links over connection oriented facilities, for in
stance X.25, X.21, ISDN, or PSTN networks.
Dynamically established data links can be used in one
of two ways:
i)static point-to-point (Static): The call is estab
lished upon system management action and

cleared only on system management action (or
failure).
ii)dynamically assigned (DA): The call is estab
lished upon receipt of traffic, and brought
down on timer expiration when idle. The ad
dress to which the call is to be established is
determined dynamically from information in
the arriving NPDU(s). No ISIS routeing
PDUs are exchanged between ISs on a DA cir
cuit.
All subnetwork types are treated by the Subnetwork Inde
pendent functions as though they were connectionless
subnetworks, using the Subnetwork Dependent Conver
gence functions of ISO 8473 where necessary to provide a
connectionless subnetwork service. The  Subnetwork De
pendent functions do, however, operate differently on
connectionless and connection-oriented subnetworks.
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.3%20Topologies"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" name="section-6.3">6.3</a> Topologies</span>
A single organisation may wish to divide its Administrative
Domain into a number of separate Routeing Domains.
This has certain advantages, as described in ISO/TR 9575.
Furthermore, it is desirable for an intra-domain routeing
protocol to aid in the operation of an inter-domain routeing
protocol, where such a protocol exists for interconnecting
multiple administrative domains.
In order to facilitate the construction of such multi-domain
topologies, provision is made for the entering of static
inter-domain routeing information. This information is pro
vided by a set of Reachable Address Prefixes entered by
System Management at the ISs which have links which
cross routeing domain boundaries. The prefix indicates that
any NSAPs whose NSAP address matches the prefix may
be reachable via  the SNPA with which the prefix is associ
ated. Where the subnetwork to which this SNPA is con
nected is a general topology subnetwork supporting dy
namically established data links, the prefix also has associ
ated with it the required subnetwork addressing
information, or an indication that it may be derived from
the destination NSAP address (for example, an X.121 DTE
address may sometimes be obtained from the IDI of the
NSAP address).
The Address Prefixes are handled by the level 2 routeing al
gorithm in the same way as information about a level 1 area
within the domain. NPDUs with a destination address
matching any of the prefixes present on any Level 2 Inter
mediate System within the domain can therefore be relayed
(using level 2 routeing) by that IS and delivered out of the
domain. (It is assumed that the routeing functions of the
other domain will then be able to deliver the NPDU to its
destination.)
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.4%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.4" name="section-6.4">6.4</a> Addresses</span>
Within a routeing domain that conforms to this standard,
the Network entity titles of Intermediate systems shall be
structured as described in 7.1.1.
All systems shall be able to generate and forward data
PDUs containing NSAP addresses in any of the formats
specified by ISO 8348/Add.2. However,  NSAP addresses

of End systems should be structured as described in 7.1.1 in
order to take full advantage of ISIS routeing. Within such
a domain it is still possible for some End Systems to have
addresses assigned which do not conform to 7.1.1, provided
they meet the more general requirements of
ISO 8348/Add.2, but they may require additional configura
tion and be subject to inferior routeing performance.
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.5%20%20Functional%20Organisation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.5" name="section-6.5">6.5</a>  Functional Organisation</span>
The intra-domain ISIS routeing functions are divided into
two groups
-Subnetwork Independent Functions
-Subnetwork Dependent Functions
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.5.1%20Subnetwork%20Independent%20Functions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.5.1" name="section-6.5.1">6.5.1</a> Subnetwork Independent Functions</span>
The Subnetwork Independent Functions supply full-duplex
NPDU transmission between any pair of neighbour sys
tems. They are independent of the specific subnetwork or
data link service operating below them, except for recognis
ing two generic types of subnetworks:
-General Topology Subnetworks, which include
HDLC point-to-point, HDLC multipoint, and dynami
cally established data links (such as X.25, X.21, and
PSTN links), and
-Broadcast Subnetworks, which include ISO 8802
LANs.
The following Subnetwork Independent Functions are iden
tified
-Routeing. The routeing function determines NPDU
paths. A path is the sequence of connected systems
and links between a source ES and a destination ES.
The combined knowledge of all the Network Layer
entities of all the Intermediate systems within a route
ing domain is used to ascertain the existence of a path,
and route the NPDU to its destination. The routeing
component at an Intermediate system has the follow
ing specific functions:
7It extracts and interprets the routeing PCI in an
NPDU.
7It performs NPDU forwarding based on the desti
nation address.
7It manages the characteristics of the path. If a sys
tem or link fails on a path, it finds an alternate
route.
7It interfaces with the subnetwork dependent func
tions to receive reports concerning an SNPA
which has become unavailable, a system that has
failed, or the subsequent recovery of an SNPA or
system.
7It informs the ISO 8473 error reporting function
when the forwarding function cannot relay an
NPDU, for instance when the destination is un
reachable or when the NPDU would have needed

to be segmented and the NPDU requested no seg
mentation.
-Congestion control. Congestion control manages the
resources used at each Intermediate system.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.5.2%20Subnetwork%20Dependent%20Functions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.5.2" name="section-6.5.2">6.5.2</a> Subnetwork Dependent Functions</span>
The subnetwork dependent functions mask the characteris
tics of the subnetwork or data link service from the
subnetwork independent functions. These include:
-Operation of the Intermediate system functions of
ISO 9542 on the particular subnetwork, in order to
7Determine neighbour Network entity title(s) and
SNPA address(es)
7Determine the SNPA address(s) of operational In
termediate systems
-Operation of the requisite Subnetwork Dependent
Convergence Function as defined in ISO 8473 and its
Addendum 3, in order to perform
7Data link initialisation
7Hop by hop fragmentation over subnetworks with
small maximum SNSDU sizes
7Call establishment and clearing on dynamically es
tablished data links
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.6%20Design%20Goals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.6" name="section-6.6">6.6</a> Design Goals</span>
This International Standard supports the following design
requirements. The correspondence with the goals for OSI
routeing stated in ISO/TR 9575 are noted.
-Network Layer Protocol Compatibility. It is com
patible with ISO 8473 and ISO 9542. (See clause 7.5
of ISO/TR 9575),
-Simple End systems: It requires no changes to end
systems, nor any functions beyond those supplied by
ISO 8473 and ISO 9542. (See clause 7.2.1 of ISO/TR
9575),
-Multiple Organisations: It allows for multiple route
ing and administrative domains through the provision
of static routeing information at domain boundaries.
(See clause 7.3 of ISO/TR 9575),
-Deliverability It accepts and delivers NPDUs ad
dressed to reachable destinations and rejects NPDUs
addressed to destinations known to be unreachable.
-Adaptability. It adapts to topological changes within
the routeing domain, but not to traffic changes, except
potentially as indicated by local queue lengths. It
splits traffic load on multiple equivalent paths. (See
clause 7.7 of ISO/TR 9575),
-Promptness. The period of adaptation to topological
changes in the domain is a reasonable function of the
domain diameter (that is, the maximum logical dis

tance between End Systems within the domain) and
Data link speeds. (See clause 7.4 of ISO/TR 9575),
-Efficiency. It is both processing and memory effi
cient. It does not create excessive routeing traffic
overhead. (See clause 7.4 of ISO/TR 9575),
-Robustness. It recovers from transient errors such as
lost or temporarily incorrect routeing PDUs. It toler
ates imprecise parameter settings. (See clause 7.7 of
ISO/TR 9575),
-Stability. It stabilises in finite time to good routes,
provided no continuous topological changes or con
tinuous data base corruptions occur.
-System Management control. System Management
can control many routeing functions via parameter
changes, and inspect parameters, counters, and routes.
It will not, however, depend on system management
action for correct behaviour.
-Simplicity. It is sufficiently simple to permit perform
ance tuning and failure isolation.
-Maintainability. It provides mechanisms to detect,
isolate, and repair most common errors that may affect
the routeing computation and data bases. (See clause
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.8%20of%20ISO%2FTR%209575%29%2C"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.8" name="section-7.8">7.8</a> of ISO/TR 9575),</span>
-Heterogeneity. It operates over a mixture of network
and system types, communication technologies, and
topologies. It is capable of running over a wide variety
of subnetworks, including, but not limited to: ISO
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8802%20LANs%2C%20ISO%208208%20and%20X.25%20subnetworks%2C%20PSTN"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8802" name="section-8802">8802</a> LANs, ISO 8208 and X.25 subnetworks, PSTN</span>
networks, and the OSI Data Link Service. (See clause
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1%20of%20ISO%2FTR%209575%29%2C"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a> of ISO/TR 9575),</span>
-Extensibility. It accommodates increased routeing
functions, leaving earlier functions as a subset.
-Evolution. It allows orderly transition from algorithm
to algorithm without shutting down an entire domain.
-Deadlock Prevention. The congestion control compo
nent prevents buffer deadlock.
-Very Large Domains. With hierarchical routeing, and
a very large address space, domains of essentially un
limited size can be supported. (See clause 7.2 of
ISO/TR 9575),
-Area Partition Repair. It permits the utilisation of
level 2 paths to repair areas which become partitioned
due to failing level 1 links or ISs. (See clause 7.7 of
ISO/TR 9575),
-Determinism. Routes are a function only of the physi
cal topology, and not of history. In other words, the
same topology will always converge to the same set of
routes.
-Protection from Mis-delivery. The probability of
mis-delivering a NPDU, i.e. delivering it to a Trans
port entity in the wrong End System, is extremely low.

-Availability. For domain topologies with cut set
greater than one, no single point of failure will parti
tion the domain. (See clause 7.7 of ISO/TR 9575),
-Service Classes. The service classes of transit delay,
expense22Expense is referred to as cost in ISO 8473. The latter term is
not used here because of possible confusion with the more general usage
of the term to
indicate path cost according to any routeing metric.
, and residual error probability of ISO 8473
are supported through the optional inclusion of multi
ple routeing metrics.
-Authentication. The protocol is capable of carrying
information to be used for the authentication of Inter
mediate systems in order to increase the security and
robustness of a routeing domain. The specific mecha
nism supported in this International Standard how
ever, only supports a weak form of authentication us
ing passwords, and thus is useful only for protection
against accidental misconfiguration errors and does
not protect against any serious security threat. In the
future, the algorithms may be enhanced to provide
stronger forms of authentication than can be provided
with passwords without needing to change the PDU
encoding or the protocol exchange machinery.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.6.1%20Non-Goals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.6.1" name="section-6.6.1">6.6.1</a> Non-Goals</span>
The following are not within the design scope of the intra-
domain ISIS routeing protocol described in this Interna
tional Standard:
-Traffic adaptation. It does not automatically modify
routes based on global traffic load.
-Source-destination routeing. It does not determine
routes by source as well as destination.
-Guaranteed delivery. It  does not guarantee delivery
of all offered NPDUs.
-Level 2 Subdomain Partition Repair. It will not util
ise Level 1 paths to repair a level 2 subdomain parti
tion. For full logical connectivity to be available, a
connected level 2 subdomain is required.
-Equal treatment for all ES Implementations. The
End system poll function defined in 8.4.5 presumes
that End systems have implemented the Suggested ES
Configuration Timer option of ISO 9542. An End sys
tem which does not implement this option may experi
ence a temporary loss of connectivity following cer
tain types of topology changes on its local
subnetwork.
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.7%20Environmental%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.7" name="section-6.7">6.7</a> Environmental Requirements</span>
For correct operation of the protocol, certain guarantees are
required from the local environment and the Data Link
Layer.
The required local environment guarantees are:
a)Resource allocation such that the certain minimum re
source guarantees can be met, including

1)memory (for code, data, and buffers)
2)processing;
See 12.2.5 for specific performance levels required for
conformance
b)A quota of buffers sufficient to perform routeing func
tions;
c)Access to a timer or notification of specific timer expi
ration; and
d)A very low probability of corrupting data.
The required subnetwork guarantees for point-to-point links
are:
a)Provision that both source and destination systems
complete start-up before PDU exchange can occur;
b)Detection of remote start-up;
c)Provision that no old PDUs be received after start-up
is complete;
d)Provision that no PDUs transmitted after a particular
startup is complete are delivered out of sequence;
e)Provision that failure to deliver a specific subnetwork
SDU will result in the timely disconnection of the
subnetwork connection in both directions and that this
failure will be reported to both systems;  and
f)Reporting of other subnetwork failures and degraded
subnetwork conditions.
The required subnetwork guarantees for broadcast links are:
a)Multicast capability, i.e., the ability to address a subset
of all connected systems with a single PDU;
b)The following events are low probability, which
means that they occur sufficiently rarely so as not to
impact performance, on the order of once per  thou
sand PDUs
1)Routeing PDU non-sequentiality,
2)Routeing PDU loss due to detected corruption; and
3)Receiver overrun;
c)The following events are very low probability,
which means performance will be impacted unless
they are extremely rare, on the order of less than one
event per four years
1)Delivery of NPDUs with undetected data corrup
tion; and
2)Non-transitive connectivity, i.e. where system A
can receive transmissions from systems B and C,
but system B cannot receive transmissions from
system C.

The following services are assumed to be not available
from broadcast links:
a)Reporting of failures and degraded subnetwork condi
tions that result in NPDU loss, for instance receiver
failure. The routeing functions are designed to account
for these failures.

Subnetwork Independent
Components
The Subnetwork Independent Functions are broken down
into more specific functional components. These are de
scribed briefly in this sub-clause and in detail in clause 7.
This International Standard uses a functional decomposition
adapted from the model of routeing presented in clause 5.1
of ISO/TR 9575. The decomposition is not identical to that
in ISO/TR 9575, since that model is more general and not
specifically oriented toward a detailed description of intra-
domain routeing functions such as supplied by this proto
col.

The functional decomposition is shown below in figure 2.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.8.1%20Routeing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.8.1" name="section-6.8.1">6.8.1</a> Routeing</span>
The routeing processes are:
-Decision Process
-Update Process
NOTE  this comprises both the Information Collection
and Information Distribution components identified in
ISO/TR 9575.
-Forwarding Process
-Receive Process
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.8.1.1%20Decision%20Process"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.8.1.1" name="section-6.8.1.1">6.8.1.1</a> Decision Process</span>
This process calculates routes to each destination in the do
main.  It is executed separately for level 1 and level 2 route
ing, and separately within each level for each of the route
ing metrics supported by the Intermediate system. It uses
the Link State Database, which consists of information

from the latest Link State PDUs from every other Interme
diate system in the area, to compute shortest paths from this
IS to all other systems in the area  9in figure 2. The
Link State Data Base is maintained by the Update Process.
Execution of the Decision Process results in the determina
tion of [circuit, neighbour] pairs (known as adjacencies),
which are stored in the appropriate Forwarding Information
base  10  and used by the Forwarding process as paths
along which to forward NPDUs.
Several of the parameters in the routeing data base that the
Decision Process uses are determined by the implementa
tion. These include:
-maximum number of Intermediate and End systems
within the IS's area;
-maximum number of Intermediate and End system
neighbours of the IS, etc.,
so that databases can be sized appropriately. Also parame
ters such as
-routeing metrics for each circuit; and
-timers
can be adjusted for enhanced performance. The complete
list of System Management set-able parameters is listed in
clause 11.

This process constructs, receives and propagates Link State
PDUs. Each Link State PDU contains information about the
identity and routeing metric values of the  adjacencies of
the IS that originated the Link State PDU.
The Update Process receives Link State and Sequence
Numbers PDUs from the Receive Process  4in figure

mation base 6 and propagates routeing information to
other Intermediate systems  7and 8 .
General characteristics of the Update Process are:

For correct operation of the routeing protocol defined in
this international standard, systems deployed in a routeing
domain must meet the following requirements:
a)For all systems:
1)Each system in an area must have a unique sys
temID: that is, no two systems (IS or ES) in an
area can use the same ID value.
2)Each area address must be unique within the global
OSIE: that is, a given area address can be associ
ated with only one area.
3)All systems having a given value of area address
must be located in the same area.

b)Additional Requirements for Intermediate systems:
1)Each Level 2 Intermediate system within a route
ing domain must have a unique value for its ID
field: that is, no two level 2 ISs in a routeing do
main can have the same value in their ID fields.
c)Additional Requirements for End systems:
1)No two End systems in an area may have ad
dresses that match in all but the SEL fields.
d)An End system can be attached to a level 1 IS only if
its area address matches one of the entries in the adja
cent IS's manual</pre>

When a full NSAP address is encoded according to the pre
ferred binary encoding specified in ISO 8348/Add.2, the

IDI is padded with leading digits (if necessary) to obtain the
maximum IDP length specified for that AFI.
A Level 2 address prefix consists of a leading sub-string of
a full NSAP address, such that it matches a set of full
NSAP addresses that have the same leading sub-string.
However this truncation and matching is performed on the
NSAP represented by the abstract syntax of the NSAP ad
dress, not on the encoded (and hence padded) form.11An example of
prefix matching may be found in annex B, clause B.1.

Level 2 address prefixes are encoded in LSPs in the same
way as full NSAP addresses, except when the end of the
prefix falls within the IDP. In this case the prefix is directly
encoded as the string of semi-octets with no padding.

Unless otherwise stated, numerical comparison of addresses
shall be performed on the encoded form of the address, by

There are four routeing metrics defined, corresponding to
the four possible orthogonal qualities of service defined by
the QoS Maintenance field of ISO 8473. Each circuit ema
nating from an Intermediate system shall be assigned a
value for one or more of these metrics by System manage
ment. The four metrics are as follows:
a)Default metric: This is a metric understood by every
Intermediate system in the domain. Each circuit shall
have a positive integral value assigned for this metric.
The value may be associated with any objective func
tion of the circuit, but by convention is intended to
measure the capacity of the circuit for handling traffic,
for example, its throughput in bits-per-second.  Higher
values indicate a lower capacity.
b)Delay metric:  This metric measures the transit delay
of the associated circuit. It is an optional metric, which
if assigned to a circuit shall have a positive integral
value. Higher values indicate a longer transit delay.
c)Expense metric: This metric measures the monetary
cost of utilising the associated circuit. It is an optional
metric, which if assigned to a circuit shall have a posi
tive integral value22The path computation algorithm utilised in this
International Standard requires that all circuits be assigned a
positive value for a metric. Therefore, it is
not possible to represent a free circuit by a zero value of the expense
metric. By convention, the value 1 is used to indicate a free circuit.
. Higher values indicate a larger
monetary expense.
d)Error metric: This metric measures the residual error
probability of the associated circuit. It is an optional
metric, which if assigned to a circuit shall have a non-
zero value. Higher values indicate a larger probability
of undetected errors on the circuit.
NOTE - The decision process combines metric values by
simple addition.  It is important, therefore, that the values of
the metrics be chosen accordingly.
Every Intermediate system shall be capable of calculating
routes based on the default metric. Support of any or all of
the other metrics is optional. If an Intermediate system sup
ports the calculation of routes based on a metric, its update
process may report the metric value in the LSPs for the as
sociated circuit; otherwise, the IS shall not report the met
ric.
When calculating paths for one of the optional routeing
metrics, the decision process only utilises LSPs with a
value reported for the corresponding metric. If no value is

associated with a metric for any of the IS's circuits the sys
tem shall not calculate routes based on that metric.
NOTE - A consequence of the above is that a system reach
able via the default metric may not be reachable by another
metric.
See 7.4.2 for a description of how the forwarding process
selects one of these metrics based on the contents of the
ISO 8473 QoS Maintenance option.
Each of the four metrics described above may be of two
types: an  Internal metric or an External metric. Internal
metrics are used to describe links/routes to destinations in
ternal to the routeing domain. External metrics are used to
describe links/routes to destinations outside of the routeing
domain. These two types of metrics are not directly compa
rable, except the internal routes are always preferred over
external routes. In other words an internal route will always
be selected even if an external route with lower total cost
exists.

Instead of treating a broadcast subnetwork as a fully con
nected topology, the broadcast subnetwork is treated as a
pseudonode, with links to each attached system. Attached
systems shall only report their link to the pseudonode. The
designated Intermediate system, on behalf of the
pseudonode, shall construct Link State PDUs reporting the
links to all the systems on the broadcast subnetwork with a
zero value for each supported routeing metric33They are set to zero
metric values since they have already been assigned  metrics by the
link to the pseudonode. Assigning a non-zero value in the
pseudonode LSP would have the effect of doubling the actual value.
.
The pseudonode shall be identified by the sourceID of the
Designated Intermediate system, followed by a non-zero
pseudonodeID assigned by the Designated Intermediate
system. The pseudonodeID is locally unique to the Desig
nated Intermediate system.
Designated Intermediate systems are determined separately
for level 1 and level 2. They are known as the LAN Level 1
Designated IS and the LAN Level 2 Designated IS respec
tively. See 8.4.4.
An Intermediate system may resign as Designated Interme
diate System on a broadcast circuit either because it (or it's
SNPA on the broadcast subnetwork) is being shut down or
because some other Intermediate system of higher priority
has taken over that function. When an Intermediate system
resigns as Designated Intermediate System, it shall initiate a
network wide purge of its pseudonode Link State PDU(s)
by setting their Remaining Lifetime to zero and performing
the actions described in 7.3.16.4. A LAN Level 1 Desig
nated Intermediate System purges Level 1 Link State PDUs
and a LAN Level 2 Designated Intermediate System purges
Level 2 Link State PDUs.  An Intermediate system which
has resigned as both Level 1 and Level 2 Designated Inter
mediate System shall purge both sets of LSPs.

When an Intermediate system declares itself as designated
Intermediate system and it is in possession of a Link State
PDU of the same level issued by the previous Designated
Intermediate System for that circuit (if any), it shall initiate
a network wide purge of that (or those) Link State PDU(s)
as above.

Two Intermediate systems are not considered neighbours
unless each reports the other as directly reachable over one
of their SNPAs. On a Connection-oriented subnetwork
(either point-to-point or general topology), the two Interme
diate systems in question shall ascertain their neighbour re
lationship when a connection is established and hello PDUs
exchanged. A malfunctioning IS might, however, report an
other IS to be a neighbour when in fact it is not. To detect
this class of failure the decision process checks that each
link reported as up in a LSP is so reported by both Inter
mediate systems. If an Intermediate system considers a link
down it shall not mention the link in its Link State PDUs.
On broadcast subnetworks, this class of failure shall be de
tected by the designated IS, which has the responsibility to
ascertain the set of Intermediate systems that can all com
municate on the subnetwork. The designated IS shall in
clude these Intermediate systems (and no others) in the
Link State PDU it generates for the pseudonode represent
ing the broadcast subnetwork.

The Update process is capable of dividing a single logical
LSP into a number of separate PDUs for the purpose of
conserving link bandwidth and processing (see 7.3.4).  The
Decision Process, on the other hand, shall regard the LSP
with LSP Number zero in a special way. If the LSP with
LSP Number zero and remaining lifetime &gt; 0, is not present
for a particular system then the Decision Process shall not
process any LSPs with non-zero LSP Number which may
be stored for that system.
The following information shall be taken only from the LSP

The routeing algorithm used by the Decision Process is a
shortest path first (SPF) algorithm. Instances of the algo
rithm are run independently and concurrently by all Inter
mediate systems in a routeing domain. Intra-Domain route
ing of a PDU occurs on a hop-by-hop basis: that is, the al
gorithm determines only the next hop, not the complete
path, that a data PDU will take to reach its destination. To
guarantee correct and consistent route computation by
every Intermediate system in a routeing domain, this Inter
national Standard depends on the following properties:

a)All Intermediate systems in the routeing domain con
verge to using identical topology information; and
b)Each Intermediate system in the routeing domain gen
erates the same set of routes from the same input to
pology and set of metrics.
The first property is necessary in order to prevent inconsis
tent, potentially looping paths. The second property is nec
essary to meet the goal of determinism stated in 6.6.
A system executes the SPF algorithm to find a set of legal
paths to a destination system in the routeing domain. The
set may consist of:
a)a single path of minimum metric sum: these are
termed minimum cost paths;
b)a set of paths of equal minimum metric sum: these are
termed equal minimum cost paths; or
c)a set of paths which will get a PDU closer to its desti
nation than the local system: these are called down
stream paths.
Paths which do not meet the above conditions are illegal
and shall not be used.
The Decision Process, in determining its paths, also ascer
tains the identity of the adjacency which lies on the first
hop to the destination on each path. These adjacencies are
used to form the Forwarding Database,  which the forward
ing process uses for relaying PDUs.
Separate route calculations are made for each pairing of a
level in the routeing hierarchy (i.e. L1 and L2) with a sup
ported routeing metric. Since there are four routeing metrics
and two levels some systems may execute multiple in
stances of the SPF algorithm. For example,
-if an IS is a L2 Intermediate system which supports all
four metrics and computes minimum cost paths for all
metrics, it would execute the SPF calculation eight
times.
-if an IS is a L1 Intermediate system which supports all
four metrics, and additionally computes downstream
paths, it would execute the algorithm  4 W (number of
neighbours + 1) times.
Any implementation of an SPF algorithm meeting both the
static and dynamic conformance requirements of clause 12
of this International Standard may be used. Recommended
implementations are described in detail in Annex C.

Areas
An area may become partitioned as a result of failure of one
or more links in the area. However, if each of the partitions
has a connection to the level 2 subdomain, it is possible to
repair the partition via the level 2 subdomain, provided that
the level 2 subdomain itself is not partitioned. This is illus
trated in Figure 4.
All the systems A  I, R and P are in the same area n.
When the link between D and E is broken, the area be

comes partitioned. Within each of the partitions the Parti
tion Designated Level 2 Intermediate system is selected
from among the level 2 Intermediate systems in that parti
tion. In the case of partition 1 this is P, and in the case of
partition 2 this is R. The level 1 repair path is then estab
lished between between these two level 2 Intermediate sys
tems. Note that the repaired link is now between P and R,
not between D and E.
The Partition Designated Level 2 Intermediate Systems re
pair the partition by forwarding NPDUs destined for other
partitions of the area through the level 2 subdomain. They
do this by acting in their capacity as Level 1 Intermediate
Systems and advertising in their Level 1 LSPs adjacencies
to each Partition Designated Level 2 Intermediate System
in the area. This adjacency is known as a Virtual Adja
cency or Virtual Link. Thus other Level 1 Intermediate
Systems in a partition calculate paths to the other partitions
through the Partition Designated Level 2 Intermediate Sys
tem. A Partition Designated Level 2 Intermediate System
forwards the Level 1 NPDUs through the level 2 subdomain
by encapsulating them in 8473 Data NPDUs with its Virtual
Network Entity Title as the source NSAP and the adja
cent Partition Designated Level 2 Intermediate System's
Virtual Network Entity Title as the destination NSAP. The
following sub-clauses describe this in more detail.
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.10.1%20Partition%20Detection%20and%20Virtual%20Level%201"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2.10.1" name="section-7.2.10.1">7.2.10.1</a> Partition Detection and Virtual Level 1</span>
Link Creation
Partitions of a Level 1 area are detected by the Level 2 In
termediate System(s) operating within the area.  In order to
participate in the partition repair process, these Level 2 In
termediate systems must also act as Level 1 Intermediate
systems in the area. A partition of a given area exists when
ever two or more Level 2 ISs located in that area are re
ported in the L2 LSPs as being a Partition Designated
Level 2 IS. Conversely, when only one Level 2 IS in an
area is reported as being the Partition Designated Level 2

IS, then that area is not partitioned.  Partition repair is ac
complished by the Partition Designated Level 2 IS.  The
election of the Partition Designated Level 2 IS as described
in the next subsection must be done before the detection
and repair process can begin.
In order to repair a partition of a Level 1 area, the Partition
designated Level 2 IS creates a Virtual Network Entity to
represent the partition.  The Network Entity Title for this
virtual network entity shall be constructed from the first
listed area address from its Level 2 Link State PDU, and the
ID of the Partition Designated Level 2 IS.  The IS shall also
construct a virtual link (represented by a new Virtual Adja
cency managed object) to each Partition Designated Level 2
IS in the area, with the NET of the partition recorded in the
Identifier attribute.  The virtual links are the repair paths for
the partition.  They are reported by the Partition Designated
Level 2 IS into the entire Level 1 area by adding the ID of
each adjacent Partition Designated Level 2 IS to the In
termediate System Neighbours field of its Level 1 Link
State PDU.  The Virtual Flag shall be set True for these
Intermediate System neighbours.  The metric value for this
virtual link shall be the default metric value d(N) obtained
from this system's Level 2 PATHS database, where N is the
adjacent Partition Designated Level 2 IS via the Level 2
subdomain.
An Intermediate System which operates as the Partition
Designated Level 2 Intermediate System shall perform the
following steps after completing the Level 2 shortest path
computation in order to detect partitions in the Level 1 area
and create repair paths:
a)Examine Level 2 Link State PDUs of all Level 2 Inter

Update Process of all of the other Partition Designated
Level 2 Intermediate systems in other partitions of this

other Partition designated level 2 Intermediate sys
tems for this area (via the level 2 subdomain).
2)All the Partition Designated Level 2 Intermediate
systems for other partitions of this area can be re
ported as adjacencies in this system's Level 1 Link
State PDUs.
If a partition has healed, the IS shall destroy the associated
virtual network entity and virtual link by deleting the Vir
tual Adjacency.  The Partition Designated Level 2 IS de
tects a healed partition when another Partition Designated
Level 2 IS listed as a virtual link in its Level 1 Link State
PDU was not found after running the partition detection and
virtual link creation algorithm described above.
If such a Virtual Adjacency is created or destroyed, the IS
shall generate a partitionVirtualLinkChange notification.

Intermediate System
 The Partition Designated Level 2 IS is a Level 2 IS which:
-reports itself as attached by the default metric in its
LSPs;
-reports itself as implementing the partition repair op
tion;
-operates as a Level 1 IS in the area;
-is reachable via Level 1 routeing without traversing
any virtual links; and
-has the lowest ID
The election of the Partition Designated Level 2 IS is per
formed by running the decision process algorithm after the
Level 1 decision process has finished, and before the
Level 2 decision process to determine Level 2 paths is exe
cuted.
In order to guarantee that the correct Partition Designated
Level 2 IS is elected, the decision process is run using only
the Level 1 LSPs for the area, and by examining only the
Intermediate System Neighbours whose Virtual Flag is
FALSE.  The results of this decision process is a set of all
the Level 1 Intermediate Systems in the area that can be
reached via Level 1, non-virtual link routeing.  From this
set, the Partition Designated Level 2 IS is selected by
choosing the IS for which
-IS Type (as reported in the Level 1 LSP) is Level 2
Intermediate System;

-ATT  indicates attached by the default metric;
-P indicates support for the partition repair option;  and
-ID is the lowest among the subset of attached Level 2
Intermediate Systems.

If an Intermediate system takes part in level 1 routeing, and
determines (by looking at the area address) that a given des
tination is reachable within its area, then that destination
will be reached exclusively by use of level 1 routeing. In
particular:
a)Level 1 routeing is always based on internal metrics.
b)Amongst routes in the area, routes on which the re
quested QoS (if any) is supported are always preferred
to routes on which the requested QoS is not supported.
c)Amongst routes in the area of the same QoS, the short
est routes are preferred. For determination of the
shortest path, if a route with specific QoS support is
available, then the specified QoS metric is used, other
wise the default metric is used.
d)Amongst routes of equal cost, load splitting may be
performed.
If an Intermediate system takes part in level 1 routeing,
does not take part in level 2 routeing, and determines (by
looking at the area address) that a given destination is not
reachable within its area, and at least one attached level 2
IS is reachable in the area, then that destination will be
reached by routeing to a level 2 Intermediate system as fol
lows:
a)Level 1 routeing is always based on internal metrics.
b)Amongst routes in the area to attached level 2 ISs,
routes on which the requested QoS (if any) is sup
ported are always preferred to routes on which the re
quested QoS is not supported.
c)Amongst routes in the area of the same QoS to at
tached level 2 ISs, the shortest route is preferred. For
determination of the shortest path, if a route on which
the specified QoS is available, then the specified QoS
metric is used, otherwise the default metric is used.

d)Amongst routes of equal cost, load splitting may be
performed.
If an Intermediate system takes part in level 2 routeing and
is attached, and the IS determines (by looking at the area
address) that a given destination is not reachable within its
area, then that destination will be reached as follows:
a)Routes on which the requested QoS (if any) is sup
ported are always preferred to routes on which the re
quested QoS is not supported.
b)Amongst routes of the same QoS, routes are priori
tised as follows:
1)Highest precedence: routes matching the area ad
dress of any area in the routeing domain
2)Medium precedence: Routes matching a reachable
address prefix with an internal metric. For destina
tions matching multiple reachable address prefix
entries all with internal metrics, the longest prefix
shall be preferred.
3)Lowest precedence: Routes matching a reachable
address prefix with an external metric. For destina
tions matching multiple reachable address prefix
entries all with external metrics, the longest prefix
shall be preferred.
c)For routes with equal precedence as specified above,
the shortest path shall be preferred. For determination
of the shortest path, a route supporting the specified
QoS is used if available; otherwise a route using the
default metric shall be used. Amongst routes of equal
cost, load splitting may be performed.

A Level 2 Intermediate system may have a number of
Reachable Address managed objects created by System
management. When a Reachable Address is in state On
and its parent Circuit is also in state On, the name and
each of its defined routeing metrics shall be included in
Level 2 LSPs generated by this system.
Metrics assigned to Reachable Address managed objects
may be either Internal or External.
A reachable address is considered to be active when all
the following conditions are true:
a)The parent circuit is in state On;
b)the Reachable Address is in state On; and
c)the parent circuit is of type broadcast or is in data link
state Running.
Whenever a reachable address changes from being inac
tive to active a signal shall be generated to the Update
process to cause it to include the Address Prefix of the
reachable address in the Level 2 LSPs generated by that
system as described in 7.3.9.
Whenever a reachable address changes from being active
to inactive, a signal shall be generated to the Update

process to cause it to cease including the Address Prefix of
the reachable address in the Level 2 LSPs.

In such cases, a system may use multiple LSPs to convey
this information. Each LSP in the set carries the same
sourceID field (see clause 9), but sets its own LSP Num
ber field individually. Each of the several LSPs is handled
independently by the Update Process, thus allowing distri

Decision Process recognises that they all pertain to a com

NOTE - Even if the amount of information is small enough
to fit in a single LSP, a system may optionally choose to use
several LSPs to convey it; use of a single LSP in this situ

NOTE - In order to minimise the transmission of redundant

NOTE - These parameters should be set consistently by sys
tem management. If this is not done, some adjacencies will
fail to initialise.
The IS shall treat the LSP with LSP Number zero in a spe
cial way, as follows:
a)The following fields are meaningful to the decision
process only when they are present in the LSP with
LSP Number zero:
1)The setting of the LSP Database Overload bit.
2)The value of the IS Type field.
3)The Area Addresses option. (This is only present
in the LSP with LSP Number zero, see below).
b)When the values of any of the above items are
changed, an Intermediate System shall re-issue the
LSP with LSP Number zero, to inform other Interme
diate Systems of the change. Other LSPs need not be
reissued.
Once a particular adjacency has been assigned to a particu
lar LSP Number, it is desirable that it not be moved to an
other LSP Number. This is because moving an adjacency
from one LSP to another can cause temporary loss of

connectivity to that system. This can occur if the new ver
sion of the LSP which originally contained information
about the adjacency (which now does not contain that infor
mation) is propagated before the new version of the other
LSP (which now contains the information about the adja
cency). In order to minimise the impact of this, the follow
ing restrictions are placed on the assignment of information
to LSPs.
a)The Area Addresses option field shall occur only in
the LSP with LSP Number  zero.
b)Intermediate System Neighbours options shall occur
after the Area Addresses option and before any End
System (or in the case of Level 2, Prefix) Neigh
bours options.
c)End System (or Prefix) Neighbour options (if any)
shall occur after any Area Address or Intermediate
System Neighbour options.
NOTE  In this context, after means at a higher octet
number from the start of the same LSP or in an LSP with
a higher LSP Number.
NOTE  An implementation is recommended to ensure
that the number of LSPs generated for a particular system
is within approximately 10% of the optimal number
which would be required if all LSPs were densely packed
with neighbour options. Where possible this should be
accomplished by re-using space in LSPs with a lower
LSP Number for new adjacencies. If it is necessary to
move an adjacency from one LSP to another, the
SRMflags (see 7.3.15) for the two new LSPs shall be
set as an atomic action.44If the two SRMflags are not set atomically, a
race condition will exist in which one of the two LSPs may be
propagated quickly, while the other waits for
an entire propagation cycle. If this occurs, adjacencies will be
falsely eliminated from the topology and routes may become unstable for
period of time
potentially as large as maximumLSPGeneratonInterval.

When some event requires changing the LSP information
for a system, the system shall reissue that (or those) LSPs
which would have different contents. It is not required to
reissue the unchanged LSPs. Thus a single End system ad
jacency change only requires the reissuing of the LSP con
taining the End System Neighbours option referring to
that adjacency. The parameters max</pre>

This International Standard makes use of the checksum
function defined in ISO 8473.
The source IS shall compute the LSP Checksum when the
LSP is generated. The checksum shall never be modified by
any other system. The checksum allows the detection of
memory corruptions and thus prevents both the use of in
correct routeing information and its further propagation by
the Update Process.
The checksum shall be computed over all fields in the LSP
which appear after the Remaining Lifetime field. This
field (and those appearing before it) are excluded so that the
LSP may be aged by systems without requiring re-
computation.

As an additional precaution against hardware failure, when
the source computes the Checksum, it shall start with the
two checksum variables (C0 and C1) initialised to what
they would be after computing for the systemID portion
(i.e. the first 6 octets) of its Source ID. (This value is com
puted and stored when the Network entity is enabled and
whenever systemID changes.) The IS shall then resume
Checksum computation on the contents of the PDU after
the first ID Length octets of the Source ID field.
NOTE - All Checksum calculations on the LSP are per
formed treating the Source ID field as the first octet. This
procedure prevents the source from accidentally sending out
Link State PDUs with some other system's ID as source.

The IS shall store the generated Link State PDU in the Link

with the same LSP Number generated by this system. The
IS shall then set all SRMflags for that Link State PDU, in
dicating it is to be propagated on all circuits with Intermedi
ate System adjacencies.
An Intermediate system shall ensure (by reserving re
sources, or otherwise) that it will always be able to store
and internalise its own non-pseudonode zeroth LSP. In the
event that it is not capable of storing and internalising one
of its own LSPs it shall enter the overloaded state as de
scribed in 7.3.19.1.

ways be able to store and internalise all its own (zero and

When an existing Link State PDU is re-transmitted (with
the same or a different sequence number), but with the
same information content (i.e. the variable length part) as a

databases, the order of the information in the variable

NOTE - If a sequence of changes result in the state of the

quirement to preserve the ordering. It is only required when
there have been no changes whatever. This allows the re
ceiver to detect that there has been no change in the infor

of the variable length part, and hence not re-run the decision
process.

For each Link State PDU, and for each circuit over which
routeing messages are to be exchanged (i.e. not on DA cir
cuits), there are two flags:
Send Routeing Message (SRMflag)  if set, indicates that
Link State PDU should be transmitted on that cir
cuit.  On broadcast circuits SRMflag is cleared as
soon as the LSP has been transmitted, but on non-
broadcast circuits SRMflag is only cleared on recep
tion of a Link State PDU or Sequence Numbers
PDU as described below.
        SRMflag shall never be set for an LSP with se
quence number zero, nor on a circuit whose exter
nalDomain attribute is True (See 7.3.15.2).
Send Sequence Numbers (SSNflag)  if set, indicates that
information about that Link State PDU should be in
cluded in a Partial Sequence Numbers PDU trans
mitted on that circuit.  When the Sequence Numbers
PDU has been transmitted SSNflag is cleared.  Note
that the Partial Sequence Numbers PDU serves as an
acknowledgement that a Link State PDU was re
ceived.
        SSNflag shall never be set on a circuit whose ex
ternalDomain attribute is True.

shall perform the following functions
a)Perform the following PDU acceptance tests:
1)If the LSP was received over a circuit whose ex
ternalDomain attribute is True, the IS shall dis
card the PDU.
2)If the ID Length field of the PDU is not equal to
the value of the IS's routeingDomainIDLength,

the PDU shall be discarded and an iDField
LengthMismatch notification generated.
3)If this is a level 1 LSP, and the set of areaRe
ceivePasswords is non-null, then perform the
following tests:
i)If the PDU does not contain the Authentica
tion Information field then the PDU shall be
discarded and an authenticationFailure no
tification generated.
ii)If the PDU contains the Authentication In
formation field, but the Authentication
Type is not equal to Password, then the
PDU shall be accepted unless the IS imple
ments the authenticatiion procedure indicated
by the Authentication Type. In this case
whether the IS accepts or ignores the PDU is
outside the scope of this International Stan
dard.
iii)Otherwise, the IS shall compare the password
in the received PDU with the passwords in the
set of areaReceivePasswords, augmented
by the value of the areaTransmitPassword.
If the value in the PDU matches any of these
passwords, the IS shall accept the PDU for
further processing. If the value in the PDU
does not match any of the above values, then
the IS shall ignore the PDU and generate an
authenticationFailure notification.
4)If this is a level 2 LSP, and the set of domainRe
ceivePasswords is non-null, then perform the
following tests:
i)If the PDU does not contain the Authentica
tion Information field then the PDU shall be
discarded and an authenticationFailure no
tification generated.
ii)If the PDU contains the Authentication In
formation field, but the Authentication
Type is not equal to Password, then the
PDU shall be accepted unless the IS imple
ments the authenticatiion procedure indicated
by the Authentication Type. In this case
whether the IS accepts or ignores the PDU is
outside the scope of this International Stan
dard.
iii)Otherwise, the IS shall compare the password
in the received PDU with the passwords in the
set of domainReceivePasswords, aug
mented by the value of the domainTransmit
Password. If the value in the PDU matches
any of these passwords, the IS shall accept the
PDU for further processing. If the value in the
PDU does not match any of the above values,
then the IS shall ignore the PDU and generate
an authenticationFailure notification.
b)If the LSP has zero Remaining Lifetime, perform the
actions described in 7.3.16.4.
c)If the source S of the LSP is an IS or pseudonode for
which all but the last octet are equal to the systemID

of the receiving Intermediate System, and the receiv
ing Intermediate System does not have that LSP in its
database, or has that LSP, but no longer considers it to
be in the set of LSPs generated by this system (e.g. it
was generated by a previous incarnation of the sys
tem), then initiate a network wide purge of that LSP as
described in 7.3.16.4.
d)If the source S of the LSP is a system (pseudonode or
otherwise) for which the first ID Length octets are
equal to the systemID of the receiving Intermediate
system, and the receiving Intermediate system has an
LSP in the set of currently generated LSPs from that
source in its database (i.e. it is an LSP generated by
this Intermediate system), perform the actions de
scribed in 7.3.16.1.
e)Otherwise, (the source S is some other system),
1)If the LSP is newer than the one in the database, or
if an LSP from that source does not yet exist in the
database:
i)Store the new LSP in the database, overwriting
the existing database LSP for that source (if
any) with the received LSP.
ii)Set SRMflag for that LSP for all circuits
other than C.
iii)Clear SRMflag for C.
iv)If C is a non-broadcast circuit, set SSNflag
for that LSP for C.
v)Clear SSNflag for that LSP for the circuits
other than C.
2)If the LSP is equal to the one in the database (same
Sequence Number, Remaining Lifetimes both zero
or both non-zero, same checksums):
i)Clear SRMflag for C.
ii)If C is a non-broadcast circuit, set SSNflag
for that LSP for C.
3)If the LSP is older than the one in the database:
i)Set SRMflag for C.
ii)Clear SSNflag for C.
When storing a new LSP, the Intermediate system shall first
ensure that it has sufficient memory resources to both store
the LSP and generate whatever internal data structures will
be required to process the LSP by the Update Process.  If
these resources are not available the LSP shall be ignored.
It shall neither be stored nor acknowledged. When an LSP
is ignored for this reason the IS shall enter the Waiting
State. (See 7.3.19).
When attempting to store a new version of an existing LSP
(with the same LSPID), which has a length less than or
equal to that of the existing LSP, the existing LSP shall be
removed from the routeing information base and the new
LSP stored as a single atomic action. This ensures that such
an LSP (which may be carrying the LSP Database Overload
indication from an overloaded IS) will never be ignored as
a result of a lack of memory resources.

When a Sequence Numbers PDU (Complete or Partial, see
7.3.17) is received on circuit C the IS shall perform the fol
lowing functions:
a)Perform the following PDU acceptance tests:
1)If the SNP was received over a circuit whose ex
ternalDomain attribute is True, the IS shall dis
card the PDU.
2)If the ID Length field of the PDU is not equal to

3)If this is a level 1 SNP and the set of areaRe
ceivePasswords is non-null, then perform the
following tests:
i)If the PDU does not contain the Authentica
tion Information field then the PDU shall be
discarded and an authenticationFailure no
tification generated.
ii)If the PDU contains the Authentication In
formation field, but the Authentication
Type is not equal to Password, then the
PDU shall be accepted unless the IS imple
ments the authenticatiion procedure indicated
by the Authentication Type. In this case
whether the IS accepts or ignores the PDU is
outside the scope of this International Stan
dard.
iii)Otherwise, the IS shall compare the password
in the received PDU with the passwords in the
set of areaReceivePasswords, augmented
by the value of the areaTransmitPassword.
If the value in the PDU matches any of these
passwords, the IS shall accept the PDU for
further processing. If the value in the PDU
does not match any of the above values, then
the IS shall ignore the PDU and generate an
authenticationFailure notification.
4)If this is a level 2 SNP, and the set of domainRe
ceivePasswords is non-null, then perform the
following tests:
i)If the PDU does not contain the Authentica
tion Information field then the PDU shall be
discarded and an authenticationFailure no
tification generated.
ii)If the PDU contains the Authentication In
formation field, but the Authentication
Type is not equal to Password, then the
PDU shall be accepted unless the IS imple
ments the authenticatiion procedure indicated
by the Authentication Type. In this case
whether the IS accepts or ignores the PDU is
outside the scope of this International Stan
dard.

iii)Otherwise, the IS shall compare the password
in the received PDU with the passwords in the
set of domainReceivePasswords, aug
mented by the value of the domainTransmit
Password. If the value in the PDU matches
any of these passwords, the IS shall accept the
PDU for further processing. If the value in the
PDU does not match any of the above values,
then the IS shall ignore the PDU and generate
an authenticationFailure notification.
b)For each LSP reported in the Sequence Numbers
PDU:
1)If the reported value equals the database value and
C is a non-broadcast circuit, Clear SRMflag for C
for that LSP.
2)If the reported value is older than the database
value, Clear SSNflag, and Set SRMflag.
3)If the reported value is newer than the database
value, Set SSNflag, and if C is a non-broadcast
circuit Clear SRMflag.
4)If no database entry exists for the LSP, and the re
ported Remaining Lifetime, Checksum and Se
quence Number fields of the LSP are all non-
zero, create an entry with sequence number 0 (see
7.3.16.1), and set SSNflag for that entry and cir
cuit C.  Under no circumstances shall SRMflag be
set for such an LSP with zero sequence number.
NOTE - This is because possessing a zero sequence
number LSP is semantically equivalent to having no
information about that LSP.  If such LSPs were
propagated by setting SRMflag it would result in an
unnecessary consumption of both bandwidth and
memory resources.
c)If the Sequence Numbers PDU is a Complete Se
quence Numbers PDU, Set SRMflags for C for all
LSPs in the database (except those with zero sequence
number or zero remaining lifetime) with LSPIDs
within the range specified for the CSNP by the Start
LSPID and End LSPID fields, which were not men
tioned in the Complete Sequence Numbers PDU (i.e.
LSPs this system has, which the neighbour does not
claim to have).

a)If C is a broadcast circuit, then
1)If this Intermediate system is a Level 1 Designated

The Update Process is responsible for determining, given a
received link state PDU, whether that received PDU repre
sents new, old, or duplicate information with respect to
what is stored in the database.

It is also responsible for generating the information upon
which this determination is based, for assigning a sequence
number to its own Link State PDUs upon generation, and
for correctly adjusting the Remaining Lifetime field upon
broadcast of a link state PDU generated originally by any
system in the domain.

The sequence number is a 4 octet unsigned value. Sequence
numbers shall increase from zero to (SequenceModulus
- 1). When a system initialises, it shall start with sequence
number 1 for its own Link State PDUs.55It starts with 1 rather than 0
so that the value 0 can be reserved to be guaranteed to be less than
the sequence number of any actually generated Link State
PDU. This is a useful property for Sequence Numbers PDUs.

The sequence numbers the Intermediate system generates
for its Link State PDUs with different values for LSP num
ber are independent. The algorithm for choosing the num
bers is the same, but operationally the numbers will not be
synchronised.
If an Intermediate system R somewhere in the domain has
information that the current sequence number for source S
is greater than that held by S, R will return to S a Link State
PDU for S with R's value for the sequence number. When S
receives this LSP it shall change its sequence number to be
the next number greater than the new one received, and
shall generate a link state PDU.

number, but the sequence number is already equal to

It is possible for an LSP generated by a system in a previ
ous incarnation to be alive in the domain and have the same
sequence number as the current LSP.
To ensure database consistency among the Intermediate
Systems, it is essential to distinguish two such PDUs. This
is done efficiently by comparing the checksum on a re
ceived LSP with the one stored in memory.
If the sequence numbers match, but the checksums do not
and the LSP is not in the current set of LSPs generated by
the local system, then the system that notices the mismatch
shall treat the LSP as if its Remaining Lifetime had expired.
It shall store one of the copies of the LSP, with zero written
as the Remaining Lifetime, and flood the LSP.
If the LSP is in the current set of LSPs generated by the lo
cal system then the IS shall change the LSP's sequence
number to be the next number greater than that of the re
ceived LSP and regenerate the LSP.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.3.16.3%20Remaining%20Lifetime%20field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3.16.3" name="section-7.3.16.3">7.3.16.3</a> Remaining Lifetime field</span>
When the source generates a link state PDU, it shall set the
Remaining Lifetime to MaxAge.
When a system holds the information for some time before
successfully transmitting it to a neighbour, that system shall
decrement the Remaining Lifetime field according to the
holding time. Before transmitting a link state PDU to a
neighbour, a system shall decrement the Remaining Life
time in the PDU being transmitted by at least 1, or more
than 1  if the transit time to that neighbour is estimated to
be greater than one second. When the Remaining Lifetime
field reaches 0, the system shall purge that Link State PDU
from its database. In order to keep the Intermediate Sys
tems' databases synchronised, the purging of an LSP due to
Remaining Lifetime expiration is synchronised by flooding
an expired LSP. See 7.3.16.4.
If the RemainingLifetime of the received LSP is zero it
shall be processed as described in 7.3.16.4. If the Remain
ing Lifetime of the received LSP is non-zero, but there is an
LSP in the database with the same sequence number and
zero Remaining Lifetime, the LSP in the database shall be
considered most recent. Otherwise, the PDU with the larger
sequence number shall be considered the most recent.
If the value of Remaining Lifetime is greater than
MaxAge, the LSP shall be processed as if there were a
checksum error.

When the Remaining Lifetime on an LSP in memory be
comes zero, the IS shall
a)set all SRMflags for that LSP, and
b)retain only the LSP header.
c)record the time at which the Remaining Lifetime for
this LSP became zero. When ZeroAgeLifetime has
elapsed since the LSP Remaining Lifetime became
zero, the LSP header shall be purged from the data
base.
NOTE - A check of the checksum of a zero Remaining Life
time LSP succeeds even though the data portion is not pre
sent
When a purge of an LSP with non-zero Remaining Lifetime
is initiated, the header shall be retained for MaxAge.
If an LSP from source S with zero Remaining Lifetime is
received on circuit C :
a)If no LSP from S is in memory, then the IS shall
1)send an acknowledgement of the LSP on circuit C,
but
2)shall not retain the LSP after the acknowledgement
has been sent.

b)If an LSP from S is in the database, then
1)If the received LSP is newer than the one in the da
tabase (i.e. received LSP has higher sequence
number, or same sequence number and database
LSP has non-zero Remaining Lifetime) the IS
shall:
i)overwrite the database LSP with the received
LSP, and note the time at which the zero Re
maining Lifetime LSP was received, so that
after ZeroAgeLifetime has elapsed, that LSP
can be purged from the database,
ii)set SRMflag for that LSP for all circuits other
than C,
iii)clear SRMflag for C,
iv)if C is a non-broadcast circuit, set SSNflag
for that LSP for C, and
v)clear SSNflag for that LSP for the circuits
other than C.
2)If the received LSP is equal to the one in the data
base (i.e. same Sequence Number, Remaining
Lifetimes both zero) the IS shall:
i)clear SRMflag for C, and
ii)if C is a non-broadcast circuit, set SSNflag
for that LSP for C.
3)If the received LSP is older than the one in the da
tabase (i.e. received LSP has lower sequence num
ber) the IS shall:
i)set SRMflag for C, and
ii)clear SSNflag for C.
c)If this system (or pseudonode) is S and there is an un-
expired LSP from S (i.e. its own LSP) in memory,
then the IS:
1)shall not overwrite with the received LSP, but
2)shall change the sequence number of the un-
expired LSP from S as described in 7.3.16.1,
3)generate a new LSP; and

The update process is responsible for making sure the latest
link state PDUs reach every reachable Intermediate System
in the domain.
On point-to-point links the Intermediate system shall send
an explicit acknowledgement encoded as a Partial Sequence
Numbers PDU (PSNP) containing the following informa
tion:
a)source's ID
b)PDU type (Level 1 or 2)
c)sequence number

d)Remaining Lifetime
e)checksum
This shall be done for all received link state PDUs which
are newer than the one in the database, or duplicates of the
one in the database. Link state PDUs which are older than
that stored in the database are answered instead by a newer
link state PDU, as specified in 7.3.14 above.
On broadcast links, instead of explicit acknowledgements
for each link state PDU by each Intermediate system, a spe
cial PDU known as a Complete Sequence Numbers PDU
(CSNP), shall be multicast periodically by the Designated
Intermediate System. The PDU shall contain a list of all
LSPs in the database, together with enough information so
that Intermediate systems receiving the CSNP can compare
with their LSP database to determine whether they and the
CSNP transmitter have synchronised LSP databases.  The
maximum sized Level 1 or Level 2 Sequence Numbers
PDU which may be generated by a system is controlled by
the values of originating</pre>

mation required to be transmitted in a single CSNP may be
greater than will fit in a single PDU. Therefore each CSNP
carries an inclusive range of LSPIDs to which it refers. The
complete set of information shall be conveyed by transmit
ting a series of individual CSNPs, each referring to a subset
of the complete range. The ranges of the complete set of
CSNPs shall be contiguous (though not necessarily trans
mitted in order) and shall cover the entire range of possible
LSPIDs.
The  LAN Level 1 Designated Intermediate System shall
periodically multicast complete sets of Level 1 CSNPs to
the multi-destination address AllL1ISs. The LAN Level 2
Designated Intermediate System shall periodically multicast
complete sets of Level 2 CSNPs to the multi-destination ad
dress AllL2ISs.
Absence of an LSPID from a Complete Sequence Numbers
PDU whose range includes that LSPID indicates total lack
of information about that LSPID.
If an Intermediate system, upon receipt of a Complete Se
quence Numbers PDU, detects that the transmitter was out
of date, the receiver shall multicast the missing information.
NOTE - Receipt of a link state PDU on a link is the same as
successfully transmitting the Link State PDU on that link, so
once the first Intermediate system responds, no others will,
unless they have already transmitted replies.
If an Intermediate system detects that the transmitter had
more up to date information, the receiving Intermediate sys
tem shall multicast a Partial Sequence Numbers PDU
(PSNP), containing information about LSPs for which it has
older information. This serves as an implicit request for the
missing information. Although the PSNP is multicast, only
the Designated Intermediate System of the appropriate level
shall respond to the PSNP.
NOTE - This is equivalent to the PSNP being transmitted di
rectly to the Designated Intermediate System, in that it
avoids each Intermediate System unnecessarily sending the
same LSP(s) in response. However, it has the advantage of
preserving the property that all routeing messages can be re

ceived on the multi-destination addresses, and hence by a
LAN adapter dedicated to the multi-destination address.
When a non-broadcast circuit (re)starts, the IS shall:
a)set SRMflag for that circuit on all LSPs, and
b)send a Complete set of Complete Sequence Numbers
PDUs on that circuit.

An Intermediate System shall not continue to operate for an
extended period with corrupted routeing information. The
IS shall therefore operate in a fail-stop manner. If a failure

a)On expiration of this timer the IS shall re-check the

checksum of any LSP is incorrect, the notification

One way to achieve this is to disable and re-enable the

NOTE  On point to point links, this requires at least
that a CSNP be transmitted.
b)On completion of these checks the decision process
shall be notified of an event (even if any newly gener

As a result of network mis-configuration, or certain transi
tory conditions, it is possible that there may be insufficient
memory resources available to store a received Link State
PDU. When this occurs, an IS needs to take certain steps to
ensure that if its LSP database becomes inconsistent with
the other ISs', that these ISs do not rely on forwarding
paths through the overloaded IS.

When an LSP cannot be stored, the LSP shall be ignored
and Waiting State shall be entered. A timer shall be started
for waitingTime seconds, and the Intermediate System
shall generate and flood its own LSP with zero LSP number
with the LSP Database Overload Bit set. This prevents

this Intermediate system from being considered as a for
warding path by other Intermediate Systems.
It is possible that although there are sufficient resources to
store an LSP and permit the operation of the Update Proc
ess on that LSP, the Decision Process may subsequently re
quire further resources in order to complete. If these re
sources are not available, the Intermediate system shall then
(i.e. during the attempt to run the Decision Process) enter
Waiting State until such time as they are available and
waitingTime seconds have elapsed since the last LSP was
ignored by the Update Process.
An implementation shall partition the available memory re
sources between the Level 1 and Level 2 databases. An

The only portion of the database relevant to the  Decision
Process is the data portion of the Link State PDUs.
The Update Process additionally uses the fields Sequence
Number, Remaining Lifetime, and variable SRMflag.
The Remaining Lifetimes in the stored link state PDUs can
either be periodically decremented, or converted upon re
ceipt into an internal timestamp, and converted back into a
Remaining Lifetime upon transmission.
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.3.20.1%20Synchronisation%20with%20the%20Decision%20Process"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3.20.1" name="section-7.3.20.1">7.3.20.1</a> Synchronisation with the Decision Process</span>
Since the Update Process and the Decision Process share
the Link State Database, care must be taken that the Update
Process does not modify the Link State Database while the
Decision Process is running.
There are two approaches to this. In one approach, the De
cision Process signals when it is running. During this time,
the Update Process queues incoming Link State PDUs, and
does not write them into the Link State Database. If more
Link State PDUs arrive than can fit into the queue allotted
while the Decision Process is running, the Update Process
drops them and does not acknowledge them.
Another approach is to have two copies of the Link State
Database  one in which the Decision Process is comput
ing, and the other in which the Update Process initially cop
ies over the first database, and in which all new Link State
PDUs are written. Additionally, depending on the hashing
scheme, it is likely that a second copy of the address hash
table will be required, so that the Update Process can do a
rehash occasionally for efficiency.
When the Decision Process is ready to run again, it locks
the new copy of the Link State Database, leaving the Up
date Process to copy over the information into the first area,
and write new updates while the Decision Process runs
again.
The advantage of the first approach is that it takes less
memory. The advantage of the second approach is that Link
State PDUs will never need to be dropped.
NOTE - If the decision process is implemented according to
the specification in C.2, a finer level of parallelism is possi
ble, as described below.

Arrival of a Link State PDU for a system before that system
has been put into TENT is permitted. The new Link State
PDU is used when that system is eventually put into TENT.
Similarly, arrival of a new Link State PDU for a system af
ter that system has been put into PATHS is permitted. That
system has already been completely processed. The arrival
of the new Link State PDU is noted and the decision process
re-executed when the current execution has completed. An
in-progress execution of the decision process shall not be
abandoned, since this could prevent the decision process
from ever completing.

Arrival of a Link State PDU for a system between that sys
tem being put on TENT and being transferred to PATHS
shall be treated as equivalent to one of the previous two
cases (for example, by buffering, or taking some corrective
action).

Implementations shall have a buffer management strategy
that does not prevent other clients of the buffering service
from acquiring buffers due to excessive use by the Update
Process. They shall also ensure that the Update Process
does not consume all the available bandwidth of links. In
particular no type of traffic should experience starvation for
longer than its acceptable latency. Acceptable latencies are
approximately as follows:
-Hello traffic  Hello timer W 0.5
-Data Traffic  10 seconds.
NOTE - The first of these requirements can be met by re
stricting the Update process to the use of a single buffer on
each circuit for transmission. This may also cause the sec
ond requirement to be met, depending on the processor
speed.

MaxAge  This is the amount of time that may elapse

        MaxAge is an architectural constant equal to 20

ZeroAgeLifetime - This is the minimum amount of time
for which the header of an expired LSP shall be re
tained after it has been flooded with zero Remaining
Lifetime.  A very safe value for this would be
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2%20W%20MaxAge."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a> W MaxAge.  </span>However all that is required is that
the header be retained until the zero Remaining Life

        ZeroAgeLifetime is an architectural constant with
a value of 1 minute.
maximumLSPGenerationInterval  This is the maxi
mum amount of time allowed to elapse between gen
eration of Link State PDUs by a source. It shall be
less than MaxAge.
        Setting this parameter too fast adds overhead to the
algorithms (a lot of Link State PDUs). Setting this
parameter too slow (and not violating constraints)
causes the algorithm to wait a long time to recover
in the unlikely event that incorrect Link State infor

        A reasonable setting is 15 minutes.

minimumLSPGenerationInterval  This is the minimum
time interval between generation of Link State
PDUs.  A source Intermediate system shall wait at
least this long before re-generating one of its own
Link State PDUs.
        Setting this too large causes a delay in reporting new
information. Setting this too small allows too much
overhead.
        A reasonable setting is 30 seconds.

Let DEST = the Network Layer destination address of the
PDU to be forwarded, or the next entry in the source route
ing field, if present. It consists of sub-fields Area Address,
ID, and SEL.
NOTE - The SEL field in the destination address is not ex
amined by Intermediate Systems. It is used by End Systems
to select the proper Transport entity to which to deliver NS
DUs.
This system's (the one examining this PDU for proper for
warding decision) address consists of sub-fields area ad
dress  and ID.
a)If the local system type is a level 1 Intermediate sys
tem, or the local system type is a level 2 Intermediate
system and AttachedFlagk = False, then:
1)If the Area Address in the PDU to be forwarded
matches any one of the area addresses of this IS,
then consult the level 1 forwarding database to de
termine the adjacency which is the next hop on the
path to the NPDU's destination. Forward the
NPDU on this adjacency.
2)Otherwise, consult the level 1 forwarding database
to determine the adjacency which is the next hop
on the path to the nearest level 2 is in the area, and
forward the NPDU on this adjacency.
b)If the local system type is Level 2, and Attached

1)If the Area Address in the PDU to be forwarded

then consult the level 1 forwarding database to de

If this Intermediate system is the Partition Designated
Level 2 IS for this partition, and the PDU is being for
warded onto the special adjacency to a Partition Designated
Level 2 Intermediate system in a different partition of this
area, encapsulate the complete PDU as the data field of a
data NPDU (i.e., with an additional layer of header), mak
ing this system the Source address and the other Partition
Designated Level 2 Intermediate system (obtained from the
identifier attribute of the Virtual Adjacency managed ob
ject) the Destination Address field in the outer PDU
header. Set the QoS Maintenance field of the outer PDU
to indicate forwarding via the default routeing metric (see
table 1). Then forward the encapsulated PDU onto an adja
cency ADJ, obtained by calling the Forward procedure, de
scribed below.
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.4.3.3%20The%20Procedure%20Forward"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.4.3.3" name="section-7.4.3.3">7.4.3.3</a> The Procedure Forward</span>
This procedure chooses, from a Level 1 forwarding data
base  if level is level1, or from a Level 2 forwarding da
tabase  if level is level2, an adjacency on which to for
ward NPDUs for destination dest. A pointer to the adja
cency is returned in adj, and the procedure returns the value
True. A destination of 0 at level 1 selects the adjacency
for the nearest level 2 IS computed as described in 7.2.9.1.
If there are multiple possible adjacencies, as a result of mul
tiple minimum cost paths, then one of those adjacencies
shall be chosen. An implementation may chose the adja
cency at random, or may use the possible adjacencies in
round robin fashion.
If there is no entry in the selected forwarding database for
the address dest, and the NPDU originated from the a local
Transport entity  and the system has one or more Intermedi
ate System adjacencies, then one of those is chosen at ran
dom (or in round robin fashion) and the procedure returns
the value True. Otherwise the procedure returns the value
False.66This is done so that a system in the overloaded state will
still be able to originate or forward NPDUs. If a system with a partial
routeing information base
were prohibited from attempting to forward to an unknown destination,
system management would be unable to either communicate with this system, or
route through it, for the purpose of diagnosing and/or correcting the
underlying fault.

NOTE -  Since the local adjacency database is pre-loaded
into the decision process, there will always be an entry in
the forwarding database for destinations to which an adja
cency exists.
NOTE - The PDU to be forwarded may require fragmenta
tion, depending on which circuit it is to be forwarded over.
Generating Redirect PDUs

In addition to forwarding an NPDU, the IS shall inform the
local ISO 9542 protocol machine to generate a Redirect
PDU if the PDU is being forwarded onto the same circuit
from which it came, and if the source SNPA address of the
NPDU indicates that the NPDU was received from an End
System.

The Receive Process is passed information from any of the
following sources.
-received PDUs with the NLPID of Intra-Domain
routeing,
-configuration information from the ISO 9542 protocol
machine,
-ISO 8473 data PDUs handed to the routeing function
by the ISO 8473 protocol machine.
When an area is partitioned, a level 2 path is used as a
level 1 link to repair the partitioned area. When this occurs,
all PDUs (between the neighbours which must utilise a
multi-hop path for communication) shall be encapsulated in
a data NPDU, addressed to the Intra-Domain routeing se
lector. Control traffic (LSPs, Sequence Numbers PDUs)
shall also be encapsulated, as well as data NPDUs that are
to be passed between the neighbours.
NOTE - It is not necessary to transmit encapsulated IIH
PDUs over a virtual link, since virtual adjacencies are estab

Functions
The Subnetwork Dependent Functions mask the charac
teristics of the different kinds of Subnetworks from the
Subnetwork Independent Routeing Functions. The only
two types of circuits the Subnetwork Independent Functions
recognise are broadcast and general topology.
The Subnetwork Dependent Functions include:
-The use of the ISO 8473 Subnetwork Dependent
Convergence Functions (SNDCF) so that this proto
col may transmit and receive PDUs over the same
subnetwork types, using the same techniques, as does
ISO 8473.
-Co-ordination with the operation of the ESIS proto
col (ISO 9542) in order to determine the Network
layer addresses (and on Broadcast subnetworks, the
subnetwork points of attachment) and identities (End
System or Intermediate System) of all adjacent neigh
bours. This information is held in the Adjacency data
base. It is used to construct Link State PDUs.
-The exchange of IIH PDUs. While it is possible for an
Intermediate System to identify that it has an Interme
diate System neighbour by the receipt of an ISO 9542
ISH PDU, there is no provision within ISO 9542 to in
dicate whether the neighbour is a Level 1 or a Level 2
Intermediate System. Specific PDUs (LAN Level 1,

a Domain Boundary
Routeing information (e.g. Link State PDUs) is not ex
changed across a routeing domain boundary. All routeing
information relating to a circuit connected to another route
ing domain is therefore entered via the Reachable Address
managed objects. This information is disseminated to the
rest of the routeing domain via Link State PDUs as de
scribed in 7.3.3.2. This has the effect of causing NPDUs
destined for NSAPs which are included in the
addressPrefixes of the Reachable Addresses to be re
layed to that Intermediate System at the domain boundary.
On receipt of such an NPDU the Intermediate system shall
forward it onto the appropriate circuit, based on its own
Link State information. However in the case of multi-
destination subnetworks (such as an ISO 8208 subnetwork
using Dynamic Assignment, a broadcast subnetwork, or a
connectionless subnetwork) it is necessary to ascertain ad
ditional subnetwork dependent addressing information in
order to forward the NPDU to a suitable SNPA. (This may
be the target End system or an Intermediate system within
the other domain.)
In general the SNPA address to which an NPDU is to be
forwarded can be derived from the destination NSAP of the
NPDU. It may be possible to perform some algorithmic ma
nipulation of the NSAP address in order to derive the
SNPA address. However there may be some NSAPs where

this is not possible. In these cases it is necessary to have
pre-configured information relating an address prefix to a
particular SNPA address.
This is achieved by additional information contained in the
Reachable Address managed object. The mappingType
attribute may be specified as Manual, in which case a
particular SNPA address or set of SNPA addresses is speci
fied in the SNPA Address characteristic.  Alternatively the
name of an SNPA address extraction algorithm may be
specified.

This is done to ensure that an adjacency will only be

the result that some LSPs and SNPs (i.e. those longer

Functions of ISO 8473 (this may be on system management

tor specifying ISO 8473 in the first octet of Call Userdata.
In the case of a static circuit, an SVC shall be established

In the case of a DA circuit, the call establishment proce
dures are initiated by the arrival of traffic for the circuit.

A dynamically assigned circuit has multiple adjacencies,
and can therefore establish SVCs to multiple SNPAs. In
general the SNPA address to which a call is to be estab
lished can be derived from the NSAP to which an NPDU is
to be forwarded. In the case where all the NSAPs accessible
over the ISO 8208 subnetwork have IDIs which are their
SNPA addresses, the correct SNPA can be ascertained by
extracting the IDI. However there may be some NSAPs,
which it is required to reach over the ISO 8208 subnetwork,
whose IDI does not correspond to the SNPA address of
their point of attachment to the ISO 8208 subnetwork. The
IDI may refer to some other SNPA address which is sub-
optimally connected to the target NSAP (or not even con
nected at all), or the IDP may not contain an X.121 address
at all (e.g. ISO DCC scheme). In these cases the IS shall
have pre-configured information relating an IDP (or address
prefix) to a particular SNPA address to call.
This is achieved, as described in 8.1, by additional informa
tion contained in the Reachable Address managed object.
The address extraction algorithm may be specified to ex
tract the IDI portion where the IDI is the required X.121 ad
dress. An example of a set of Reachable Addresses is
shown in Table 8.

b)For the X.121 IDI address prefix 37 aaaaa, don't
call aaaaa, but call B instead.
c)For all IDPs based on SNPAs with DNIC D (i.e. with

e)Anything else (* in table 8)  call one of the SNPA

NOTE - If a DA circuit is defined with a reachable address
prefix which includes the addresses reachable over a DCM
or STATIC circuit, the cost(s) for the DA circuit must be
greater than those of the STATIC circuit. If this is not the
case, the DA circuit may be used to establish a call to the re
mote SNPA supporting the STATIC circuit, which would
then (wrongly) assume it was the STATIC circuit.

When an NPDU is to be forwarded on a dynamically as
signed circuit, for destination NSAP address D, the IS shall:
a)Calculate D's subnetwork address, either as explicitly
stated in the circuit database, or as extracted from the
IDP.
1)If this system is an ES and there is an entry in the
RedirectCache or ReversePathCache for D, use the
subnetwork address in the cache entry.
2)If this system is an ES or Level 2 Intermediate sys
tem, and the address matches one of the listed
reachable address prefixes (including *, if pre
sent),  the subnetwork address is that specified ac
cording to the mappingType attribute (either
Manual, indicating that the set of addresses in
the sNPAAddresses attribute of that Reachable
Address are to be used, or Algorithm, indicating
that it is to be extracted from the IDP using the
specified algorithm). If multiple SNPA addresses
are specified, and there is already an adjacency up
to one of those SNPA addresses, then choose that
subnetwork address, otherwise choose the
subnetwork address with the oldest timestamp  as
described in 8.3.2.4.
3)If the address does not match one of the listed
reachable address prefixes (and there is no * en
try), invoke the ISO 8473 Discard PDU function.
b)Scan the adjacencies for one already open to D's
subnetwork address (i.e. reserveTimer has not yet
expired). If one is found, transmit the NPDU on that
adjacency.
c)If no adjacency has a call established to the required
subnetwork address, but there is a free adjacency, at

tempt to establish the call using that subnetwork ad
dress.
d)If there is no free adjacency invoke the ISO 8473 Dis
card PDU function.
NOTE  Where possible, when an adjacency is reserved
(when an SVC has been cleared as a result of the
idleTimer expiring, but the reserveTimer has not yet ex
pired), resources within the subnetwork service provider
should be reserved, in order to minimise the probability
that the adjacency will not be able to initiate a call when
required.

The Reachable Address managed objects may contain a set
of SNPA addresses, each of which has an associated time-
stamp. The time-stamps shall be initialised to infinitely
old.
Some of the SNPAs in this set may be unreachable. If a call
attempt fails to one of the SNPA addresses listed, the IS
shall mark that entry in the list with the time of the latest
failed attempt. When an SNPA address is to be chosen from
the list, the IS shall choose the one with the oldest time-
stamp , unless the oldest time-stamp is more recent than
recallTimer. If the oldest time-stamp is more recent than
recallTimer, all SNPAs in the set shall be assumed tempo
rarily unreachable and no call attempt is made. The IS shall
instead invoke the ISO 8473 Discard PDU function.
When attempting to establish a connection to a single spe
cific subnetwork address (not through one of a set of SNPA
addresses), if a call attempt to a particular SNPA address,
A, fails for any reason, the IS shall invoke the ISO 8473
Discard PDU function. Additionally the adjacency on
which the call attempt was placed shall be placed in
Failed state, and the recall timer set. Until it expires, the
IS shall not attempt call establishment for future NPDUs to
be forwarded over subnetwork address A, but instead the IS
shall invoke the ISO 8473 Discard PDU function.
When the recall timer expires, the IS shall free the adja
cency for calls to a different destination or retry attempts to
subnetwork address A.
NOTE - If an implementation can store the knowledge of
SNPA addresses that have failed along with the time since
the attempt was made in a location other than the adjacency
on which the call was attempted, then that adjacency can be
used for other calls.

structed from the address of one of the points of attachment.
(It need not be. The whole subdomain could be multi-
homed by using both SNPA addresses, or some other IDP
could be chosen; e.g. ISO DCC.) Traffic to the subdomain
from some other SNPA will cause a call to be established to
the SNPA corresponding to the IDP of the addresses in the
subdomain. Traffic from the subdomain may use either of
the SNPAs depending on the routeing decisions made by

the subdomain. This is illustrated in the diagram below (fig
ure 5).
Figure 5 - B.xB.yC.zISO 8208 SubnetworkBACExample for reverse path
forwarding
The subdomain is attached to the connection-oriented
subnetwork via SNPAs A and B. The addresses on the
subdomain are constructed using the SNPA address of B as
the IDI. If traffic for C.z is sent from B.x, a call will be es
tablished from A to C. The reverse traffic from C.z to B.x
will cause another call to be established from C to B. Thus
two SVCs have been established where only one is re
quired.
This problem is prevented by the local system retaining a
cache (known as the ReversePathCache) of NSAP ad
dresses from which traffic has been received over each ad
jacency. When it has traffic to forward over the connection-
oriented subnetwork, the IS shall it first check to see if the
destination NSAP is in the cache of any of its adjacencies,
and if so forwards the traffic over that adjacency. An NSAP
shall only be added to the cache when the remote SNPA ad
dress of the adjacency over which it is received differs from
the SNPA address to be called which would be generated
by checking against the Circuit Reachable Addresses man
aged objects. If the cache is full, the IS shall overwrite the
least recently used entry. The ReversePathCache, if imple
mented, shall have a size of at least one entry. The IS shall
purge the cache when the adjacency is taken down (i.e.
when the reserve timer expires).

STATIC and DA circuits are equivalent to point to point
links, and as such permit the operation of ISO 9542 as de
scribed for point to point links in 8.2.
For DA circuits, it is impractical to use ISO 9542 to obtain
configuration information, such as the location of Interme
diate systems, since this would require calls to be estab
lished to all possible SNPA addresses.
The IS shall not send ISO 9542 ISH PDUs on a DA circuit.
The IS shall take no action on receipt of an ESH PDU or
ISH PDU, and the circuit shall complete initialisation with
out waiting  for their arrival.
The IS shall not send Point to point IIH PDU on DA cir
cuits. The IS shall ignore receipt of a point-point IIH PDU.
(This would only occur if a STATIC or DA circuit became

erroneously connected to an SVC being used for a DA cir
cuit.)

NOTE - An example of a topology where this could occur is

A LAN Designated Intermediate System is the highest pri

There are, in general, two LAN Designated Intermediate
Systems on each LAN, namely the LAN Level 1 Desig
nated Intermediate System and the LAN Level 2 Desig
nated Intermediate System. They are elected as follows.
a)Level 1 Intermediate systems elect the LAN Level 1
Designated Intermediate System.
b)Level 2 Only Intermediate systems (i.e. Level 2 Inter
mediate Systems which have the Circuit manual</pre>

When an Intermediate system resigns as LAN Level 1 or

An Intermediate system shall not declare itself to be a LAN
Designated Intermediate system of any type until it has at
least one Up End system (not including Manual Adjacen

When there is a change in the topology or configuration of

This is achieved as follows.
When the circuit is enabled, or the Intermediate system de

An IS shall enter an End system into the adjacency database
when an ESH PDU is received from a new data link ad
dress. If an ESH PDU is received with the same data link
address as a current adjacency, but with a different NSAP
address, the new address shall be added to the adjacency,
with a separate timer. A single ESH PDU may contain more
than one NSAP address. When a new data link address or
NSAP address is added to the adjacency database, the IS
shall generate an adjacencyStateChange (Up) notifica
tion on that adjacency.
The IS shall set a timer for the value of the Holding Time
field in the received ESH PDU. If another ESH PDU is not
received from the ES before that timer expires, the ES shall
be purged from the database, provided that the Subnetwork
Independent Functions associated with initialising the adja

Octets in a PDU are numbered starting from 1, in increasing

is the least significant bit and is pictured on the right. When
consecutive octets are used to represent a number, the lower
octet number has the most significant value.

Addresses
Network Layer addresses (NSAP addresses, NETs, area ad
dresses and Address Prefixes) are encoded in PDUs accord
ing to the preferred binary encoding specified in
ISO 8348/Add.2; the entire address, taken as a whole is rep
resented explicitly as a string of binary octets. This string is
conveyed in its entirety in the address fields of the PDUs.
The rules governing the generation of the preferred binary
encoding are described in ISO 8348/Add.2. The address so
generated is encoded with the most significant octet (i.e. the
AFI) of the address being the first octet transmitted, and the
more significant semi-octet of each pair of semi-octets in

the address is encoded in the more significant semi-octet of
each octet (i.e. in the high order 4 bits). Thus the address
/371234 is encoded as

When PDUs are transmitted as a result of timer expiration,
there is a danger that the timers of individual systems may
become synchronised. The result of this is that the traffic
distribution will contain peaks. Where there are a large
number of synchronised systems, this can cause overload
ing of both the transmission medium and the systems re
ceiving the PDUs. In order to prevent this from occurring,
all periodic timers, the expiration of which can cause the
transmission of PDUs, shall have jitter introduced as de
fined in the following algorithm.
CONSTANT
Jitter = 25;
(* The percentage jitter as defined in the architectural
constant Jitter *)
Resolution = 100;
(* The timer resolution in milliseconds *)

PROCEDURE Random(max : Integer): Integer;
 (* This procedure delivers a Uniformly distributed
random integer R such that 0 &lt; R &lt; max  *)

PROCEDURE
DefineJitteredTimer(baseTimeValueInSeconds: Integer;
expirationAction : Procedure);

VAR
baseTimeValue, maximumTimeModifier, waitTime :
Integer;
nextexpiration : Time;

BEGIN
baseTimeValue := baseTimeValueInSeconds * 1000 /
Resolution;
maximumTimeModifier := baseTimeValue * Jitter /
100; (* Compute maximum possible jitter *)
WHILE running DO
BEGIN
(* First compute next expiration time *)
randomTimeModifier :=
Random(maximumTimeModifier);
waitTime := baseTimeValue -
randomTimeModifier;
nextexpiration := CurrentTime + waitTime;
(* Then perform expiration Action *)
expirationAction;
WaitUntil(nextexpiration);
END (* of Loop *)
END (* of DefineJitteredTimer *)
Thus the call DefineJitteredTimer(HelloTime, SendHel
loPDU); where HelloTime is 10 seconds, will cause the
action SendHelloPDU to be performed at random inter
vals of between 7.5 and 10 seconds. The essential point of
this algorithm is that the value of randomTimeModifier is
randomised within the inner loop. Note that the new expira
tion time is set immediately on expiration of the last inter
val, rather than when the expiration action has been com
pleted.

The time resolution shall be less than or equal to 100 milli
seconds. It is recommended to be less than or equal to 10
milliseconds. The time resolution is the maximum interval
that can elapse without there being any change in the value
of the timer. The periodic transmission period shall be ran
dom or pseudo-random in the specified range, with uniform
distribution across similar implementations.

ISO 9542
This International Standard places certain requirements on
the use of ISO 9542 by Intermediate systems which go be
yond those mandatory requirements stated in the
conformance clause of ISO 9542. These requirements are:
a)The IS shall operate the Configuration Information
functions on all types of subnetworks supported by the
IS. This includes the reception of ESH PDUs, and the
reception and transmission of ISH PDUs.
b)The IS shall enable the All Intermediate Systems
multi-destination subnetwork address.

Many of the attributes defined herein represent the values
of timers. They specify the interval between certain events
in the operation of the routeing state machines. If the value
of one of these characteristics is changed to a new value t
while the routeing state machine is in operation the imple
mentation shall take the necessary actions to ensure that for
any time interval which was in progress when the corre
sponding attribute was changed, the next expiration of that
interval takes place t seconds from the original start of that
interval, or immediately, whichever is the later.

Where this action is necessary it is indicated in the applica
ble behaviour clause of the GDMO.  See 11.2.16
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.1.3%20Resource%20Limiting%20Characteristics"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.1.3" name="section-11.1.3">11.1.3</a> Resource Limiting Characteristics</span>
Certain attributes place limits on some resource, such as
max</pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">imum</pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">SVC</pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage">Adjacencies. In general, implementa
tions may allocate memory resources up to this limit when
the managed object is enabled and it may be impossible to
change the allocation without first disabling and re-enabling
the corresponding Network entity. Therefore this Interna
tional Standard only requires that system management shall
be able to change these attributes when the managed object
is disabled (i.e. in the state off).
However some implementations may be able to change the
allocation of resources without first disabling the Network
entity. In this case it is permitted to increase the value of
the characteristic at any time, but it shall not be decreased
below the currently used value of the resource. For exam
ple, maximumSVCAdjacencies shall not be decreased
below the current number of SVCs which have been cre
ated.
Characteristics of this type are indicated in the behaviour
clause of the GDMO.  See 11.2.16.

resettingTimer-B BEHAVIOUR
DEFINED AS This attribute specifies the interval be
tween certain events in the operation of the protocol
state machine.  If the value of this attribute is
changed to a new value t  while the protocol state
machine is in operation, the implementation shall
take the necessary steps to ensure that for any time
interval which was in progress when the correspond
ing attribute was changed, the next expiration of the
that interval takes place t seconds from the original
start of that interval, or immediately, whichever is
later. The precision with which this time shall be im
plemented shall be  the same as that associated with
the basic operation of the timer attribute;

replaceOnlyWhileDisabled-B BEHAVIOUR
DEFINED AS This attribute shall only permit the RE
PLACE operation to be performed on it while the
MO is in the Disabled Operational State.  An at
tempt to perform a REPLACE operation while the
MO is in the Enabled Operation State shall fail with
the generation of the constraintViolation specific er

resourceLimiting-B BEHAVIOUR
DEFINED AS This attribute places limits on some re
source".  In general implementations may allocate
reources up to this limit when the managed object is
enabled and it may be impossible to change the allo
cation without first disabling and re-enabling the
managed object.  Therefore this International Stan
dard only requires that it shall be possible to perform
a REPLACE operation on this attribute while the
MO is disabled.  However some implementations
may be able to to change the allocation of resources
without first disabling the MO.  In this case it is per
mitted to increase the value of the atribute at any
time, but it shall not be decreased below the cur
rently used" value of the resource. Where an at
tempt to perform a REPLACE operation fails either
because the MO is enabled, or because an attempt
has been made to decrease the value, the REPLACE
operation shall fail with the generation of the con
straintViolation specific error.;

This International Standard requires that the following per
formance criteria be met. These requirements apply regard
less of other demands on the system; if an Intermediate sys
tem has other tasks as well, those will only get resources
not required to meet these criteria.
Each Intermediate system implementation shall specify (in
its PICS):
a)the maximum number of other Intermediate systems it
can handle. (For L1 Intermediate systems that means
Intermediate systems in the area; for L2 Intermediate
systems that is the sum of Intermediate systems in the
area and Intermediate systems in the L2 subdomain.)
Call this limit N.
b)the maximum supported forwarding rate in ISO 8473
PDUs per second.

process
The implementation shall guarantee the update process
enough resources to process N LSPs per 30 seconds. (Re
sources = CPU, memory, buffers, etc.)
In a stable topology the arrival of a single new LSP on a
circuit shall result in the propagation of that new LSP over
the other circuits of the IS within one second, irrespective
of the forwarding load for ISO 8473 data PDUs.

process
The implementation shall guarantee the decision process
enough resources to complete (i.e. start to finish) within 5
seconds, in a stable topology while forwarding at the maxi
mum rate. (For L2 Intermediate Systems, this applies to the
two levels together, not each level separately.)
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.2.5.3%20Reception%20and%20Processing%20of%20PDUs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.2.5.3" name="section-12.2.5.3">12.2.5.3</a> Reception and Processing of PDUs</span>
An ideal Intermediate system would be able to correctly
process all PDUs, both control and data, with which it was
presented, while simultaneously running the decision proc
ess and responding to management requests. However, in
the implementations of real Intermediate systems some
compromises must be made. The way in which these com
promises are made can dramatically affect the correctness

of operation of the Intermediate system. The following gen
eral principles apply.
a)A stable topology should result in stable routes when
forwarding at the maximum rated forwarding rate.
b)Some forwarding progress should always be made (al
beit over incorrect routes) even in the presence of a
maximally unstable topology.
In order to further characterise the required behaviour, it is
necessary to identify the following types of traffic.
a)IIH traffic. This traffic is important for maintaining In
termediate system adjacencies and hence the Interme
diate system topology. In order to prevent gratuitous
topology changes it is essential that Intermediate sys
tem adjacencies are not caused to go down errone
ously. In order to achieve this no more than
ISISHoldingMultiplier - 1 IIH PDUs may be
dropped between any pair of Intermediate systems. A
safer requirement is that no IIH PDUs are dropped.
The rate of arrival of IIH PDUs is approximately con
stant and is limited on Pointto-Point links to 1/iSIS</pre>

number of Intermediate systems on the LAN (assum
ing the worst case that they are all Level 2 Intermedi
ate systems).
b)ESH PDU traffic. This traffic is important for main
taining End system adjacencies, and has relatively low
processing latency. As with IIH PDUs, loss of End
system adjacencies will cause gratuitous topology
changes which will result in extra control traffic.
The rate of arrival of ESH PDUs on Pointto-Point
links is limited to approximately 1/Default</pre>

rate is approximately n/DefaultESHelloTimer
where n is the number of End systems on the LAN.
The maximum rate during polling is limited to ap
proximately n/pollESHelloRate averaged over a pe
riod of about 2 minutes. (Note that the actual peak ar
rival rate over a small interval may be much higher
than this.)
c)LSP (and SNP) traffic. This traffic will be
retransmitted indefinitely by the update process if it is
dropped, so there is no requirement to be able to proc
ess every received PDU. However, if a substantial
proportion are lost, the rate of convergence to correct
routes will be affected, and bandwidth and processing
power will be wasted.
On Point-to-Point links the peak rate of arrival is lim
ited only by the speed of the data link and the other
traffic flowing on that link. The maximum average
rate is determined by the topology.
On LANs the rate is limited at a first approximation to
a maximum rate of  1000/min</pre>

The maximum background rate of LSP traffic (for a
stable topology) is dependent on the maximum sup
ported configuration size and the settings of
maximumLSPGenerationInterval. For these pur
poses the default value of 900 seconds can be as
sumed. The number of LSPs per second is then very
approximately (n1 + n2 +ne/x)/900 where n1 is the
number of level 1 Intermediate systems, n2 the num
ber of level 2 Intermediate systems, ne the number of
End system IDs and x the number of ID which can be
fitted into a single LSP.
NOTE  This gives a value around 1 per second for
typical maximum configurations of:

d)Data Traffic. This is theoretically unlimited and can
arrive at the maximum data rate of the Pointto-Point
link or LAN (for ISO 8802.3 this is 14,000 PDUs per
second). In practice it will be limited by the operation
of the congestion avoidance and control algorithms,
but owing to the relatively slow response time of these
algorithms, substantial peaks are likely to occur.
An Intermediate system shall state in its PICS its
maximum forwarding rate. This shall be quoted under
at least the following conditions.
1)A stable topology of maximum size.
2)A maximally unstable topology. This figure shall
be non-zero, but may reasonably be as low as 1
PDU per second.
The following constraints must be met.
a)The implementation shall be capable of receiving the
maximum rate of ISH PDUs without loss whenever
the following conditions hold
1)The data forwarding traffic rate averaged over any
period of one second does not exceed the rate
which the implementation claims to support
2)The ESH and LSP rates do not exceed the back
ground (stable topology) rate.
b)If it is unavoidable that PDUs are dropped, it is a goal
that the order of retaining PDUs shall be as follows
(i.e. It is least desirable for IIH PDUs to be dropped).
1)IIH PDUs
2)ESH PDUs
3)LSPs and SNPs
4)data PDUs.

However, no class of traffic shall be completely
starved. One way to achieve this is to allocate a queue
of suitable length to each class of traffic and place the
PDUs onto the appropriate queue as they arrive. If the
queue is full the PDUs are discarded. Processor re
sources shall be allocated to the queues to ensure that
they all make progress with the same priorities as
above. This model assumes that an implementation is
capable of receiving PDUs and selecting their correct
queue at the maximum possible data rate (14,000
PDUs per second for a LAN). If this is not the case,
reception of data traffic at a rate greater than some
limit (which must be greater than the maximum rated
limit) will cause loss of some IIH PDUs even in a sta
ble topology. This limit shall be quoted in the PICS if
it exists.
NOTE - Starting from the stable topology condition at maxi
mum data forwarding rate, an increase in the arrival rate of
data PDUs will initially only cause some data NPDUs to be
lost. As the rate of arrival of data NPDUs is further in
creased a point may be reached at which random PDUs are
dropped. This is the rate which must be quoted in the PICS

Sufficient processor resources shall be allocated to the
transmission process to enable it to keep pace with recep
tion for each PDU type. Where prioritisation is required, the
same order as for reception of PDU types applies.

The supplier of a protocol implementation which is claimed
to conform to International Standard ISO 10589, whether as
a level 1 or level 2 Intermediate system implementation,
shall complete the applicable Protocol Implementation
Conformance Statement (PICS) proforma.
A completed PICS proforma is the PICS for the implemen
tation in question. The PICS is a statement of which capa
bilities and options of the protocol have been implemented.
The PICS can have a number of uses, including use:
-by the protocol implementor, as a check-list to reduce
the risk of failure to conform to the standard through
oversight;
-by the supplier and acquirer  or potential acquirer
 of the implementation, as a detailed indication of
the capabilities of the implementation, stated relative
to the common basis for understanding provided by
the standard PICS proforma;
-by the user  or potential user  of the implementa
tion, as a basis for initially checking the possibility of
interworking with another implementation (note that,
while interworking can never be guaranteed, failure to
interwork can often be predicted from incompatible
PICS's);
-by a protocol tester, as the basis for selecting appropri
ate tests against which to assess the claim for
conformance of the implementation.

The first part of the PICS proforma  Implementation
Identification and Protocol Summary  is to be completed
as indicated with the information necessary to identify fully
both the supplier and the implementation.
The main part of the PICS proforma is a fixed-format ques
tionnaire divided into subclauses each containing a group of
individual items. Answers to the questionnaire items are to
be provided in the rightmost column, either by simply
marking an answer to indicate a restricted choice (usually
Yes or No), or by entering a value or a set or range of val
ues. (Note that there are some items where two or more
choices from a set of possible answers can apply: all rele
vant choices are to be marked.)
Each item is identified by an item reference in the first col
umn; the second column contains the question to be an
swered; the third column contains the reference or refer
ences to the material that specifies the item in the main
body of the standard. the remaining columns record the
status of the item  whether support is mandatory, optional
or conditional  and provide the space for the answers: see
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.3.4%20%20below."></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3.4" name="appendix-A.3.4">A.3.4</a>  below.</span>
A supplier may also provide  or be required to provide
further information, categorised as either Additional Infor
mation or Exception Information. When present, each kind
of further information is to be provided in a further sub
clause of items labelled A&lt;i&gt; or X&lt;i&gt; respectively for
cross-referencing purposes, where &lt;i&gt; is any unambiguous
identification for the item (e.g. simply a number): there are
no other restrictions on its format and presentation.
A completed PICS proforma, including any Additional In
formation and Exception Information, is the Protocol Im
plementation Conformance Statement for the implementa
tion in question.
NOTE - Where an implementation is capable of being con
figured in more than one way, a single PICS may be able to
describe all such configurations. However, the supplier has
the choice of providing more than one PICS, each covering
some subset of the implementation's configuration capabili
ties, in case this makes for easier and clearer presentation of
the information.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.3.2%20Additional%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3.2" name="appendix-A.3.2">A.3.2</a> Additional Information</span>
Items of Additional Information allow a supplier to provide
further information intended to assist the interpretation of
the PICS. It is not intended or expected that a large quantity
will be supplied, and a PICS can be considered complete

without any such information. Examples might be an out
line of the ways in which a (single) implementation can be
set up to operate in a variety of environments and configu
rations.
References to items of Additional information may be en
tered next to any answer in the questionnaire, and may be
included in items of Exception Information.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.3.3%20Exception%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3.3" name="appendix-A.3.3">A.3.3</a> Exception Information</span>
It may occasionally happen that a supplier will wish to an
swer an item with mandatory or prohibited status (after any
conditions have been applied) in a way that conflicts with
the indicated requirement. No pre-printed answer will be
found in the Support column for this, but the Supplier may
write the desired answer into the Support column. If this is
done, the supplier is required to provide an item of Excep
tion Information containing the appropriate rationale, and a
cross-reference from the inserted answer to the Exception
item.
An implementation for which an Exception item is required
in this way does not conform to ISO 10589.
NOTE - A possible reason for the situation described above
is that a defect report is being progressed, which is expected
to change the requirement that is not met by the implemen
tation.

The PICS proforma contains a number of conditional items.
These are items for which the status  mandatory, optional
or prohibited  that applies is dependent upon whether or
not certain other items are supported, or upon the values
supported for other items. In many cases, whether or not the
item applies at all is conditional in this way, as well as the
status when the item does apply.
Individual conditional items are indicated by a conditional
symbol in the Status column as described in A.3.4.2 below.
Where a group of items are subject to the same condition
for applicability, a separate preliminary question about the
condition appears at the head of the group, with an instruc
tion to skip to a later point in the questionnaire if the Not
Applicable answer is selected.
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.3.4.2%20Conditional%20symbols%20and%20conditions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3.4.2" name="appendix-A.3.4.2">A.3.4.2</a> Conditional symbols and conditions</span>
A conditional symbol is of the form c.&lt;n&gt; or c.G&lt;n&gt; where
&lt;n&gt; is a numeral. For the first form, the numeral identifies
a condition appearing in a list at the end of the subclause
containing the item. For the second form, c.G&lt;n&gt;, the nu
meral identifies a condition appearing in the list of global
conditions at the end of the PICS.
A simple condition is of the form:if &lt;p&gt; then &lt;s1&gt; else &lt;s2&gt;

where &lt;p&gt; is a predicate (see A.3.4.3 below), and &lt;s1&gt; and
&lt;s2&gt; are either basic status symbols (M,O,O.&lt;n&gt;, or X) or

the symbol . An extended condition is of the formif &lt;p1&gt; then &lt;s1&gt; else &lt;s2&gt;
else if &lt;p2&gt; then &lt;s2&gt;
[else if &lt;p3&gt; ...]
else &lt;sn&gt;

where &lt;p1&gt; etc. are predicates and &lt;s1&gt; etc. are basic
status symbols or .
The status symbol applicable to an item governed by a sim
ple condition is &lt;s1&gt; if the predicate of the condition is
true, and &lt;s2&gt; otherwise; the status symbol applicable to an
item governed by an extended condition is &lt;si&gt; where &lt;pi&gt;
is the first true predicate, if any, in the sequence &lt;p1&gt;,
&lt;p2&gt;..., and &lt;sn&gt; if no predicate is true.
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.3.4.3%20Predicates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3.4.3" name="appendix-A.3.4.3">A.3.4.3</a> Predicates</span>
A simple predicate in a condition is either
a)a single item reference; or
b)a relation containing a comparison operator (=, &lt;, etc.)
with one (or both) of its operands being an item refer
ence for an item taking numerical values as its answer.
In case (a) the predicate is true if the item referred to is
marked as supported, and false otherwise. In case (b), the
predicate is true if the relation holds when each item refer
ence is replaced by the value entered in the Support column
as answer to the item referred to.
Compound predicates are boolean expressions constructed
by combining simple predicates using the boolean operators
AND, OR and NOT, and parentheses, in the usual way. A
compound predicate is true if and only if the boolean ex
pression evaluates to true when the simple predicates are in
terpreted as described above.
Items whose references are used in predicates are indicated
by an asterisk in the Item column.
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.3.4.4%20Answering%20conditional%20items"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3.4.4" name="appendix-A.3.4.4">A.3.4.4</a> Answering conditional items</span>
To answer a conditional item, the predicate(s) of the condi
tion is (are) evaluated as described in A.3.4.3 above, and
the applicable status symbol is determined as described in
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.3.4.2.%20If%20the%20status%20symbol%20is%20%20this%20indicates%20that%20the"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3.4.2" name="appendix-A.3.4.2">A.3.4.2</a>. If the status symbol is  this indicates that the</span>
item is to be marked in this case; otherwise, the Support
column is to be completed in the usual way.
When two or more basic status symbols appear in a condi
tion for an item, the Support column for the item contains
one line for each such symbol, labelled by the relevant sym
bol. the answer for the item is to be marked in the line la
belled by the symbol selected according to the value of the
condition (unselected lines may be crossed out for added
clarity).
For example, in the item illustrated below, the N/A column
would be marked if neither predicate were true; the answer

line labelled M: would be marked if item A4 was marked as supported,
and the answer line labelled O: would be marked if
the condition including items D1 and B52 applied.Item

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.1%20Matching%20of%20Address%20Prefixes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.1" name="appendix-B.1">B.1</a> Matching of Address Prefixes</span>
The following example shows how address prefixes may be
matched according to the rules defined in 7.1.4.
The prefix
        37-123
matches both the full NSAP addresses
        37-1234::AF&lt; and
        37-123::AF&lt;
which are encoded as
        3700000000001234AF&lt; and
        3700000000000123AF&lt;
respectively.
This can be achieved by first converting the address to be
compared to an internal decoded form (i.e. any padding, as
indicated by the particular AFI, is removed), which corre
sponds to the external representation of the address. The
position of the end of the IDP must be marked, since it can
no longer be deduced. This is done by inserting the semi-
octet F after the last semi-octet of the IDP. (There can be
no confusion, since the abstract syntax of the IDP is deci
mal digits).
Thus the examples above become in decoded form
        371234FAF&lt; and
        37123FAF&lt;
 and the prefix 37-123 matches as a leading sub-string of
both of them.
For comparison purposes the prefix is converted to the in
ternal decoded form as above.
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.2%20Addressing%20and%20Routeing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.2" name="appendix-B.2">B.2</a> Addressing and Routeing</span>
In order to ensure the unambiguous identification of Net
work and Transport entities across the entire OSIE, some
form of address administration is mandatory. ISO
8348/Add.2 specifies a hierarchical structure for network
addresses, with a number of top-level domains responsible
for administering addresses on a world-wide basis. These
address registration authorities in turn delegate to sub-
authorities the task of administering portions of the address
space. There is a natural tendency to repeat this sub-
division to a relatively fine level of granularity in order to
ease the task of each sub-authority, and to assign responsi
bility for addresses to the most localised administrative

body feasible. This results in (at least in theory) reduced
costs of address administration and reduced danger of mas
sive address duplication through administrative error. Fur
thermore, political factors come into play which require the
creation of sub-authorities in order to give competing inter
ests the impression of hierarchical parity. For example at
the top level of the ISO geographic address space, every
country is assigned an equally-sized portion of the address
space even though some countries are small and might in
practice never want to undertake administration of their
own addresses. Other examples abound at lower levels of
the hierarchy, where divisions of a corporation each wish to
operate as an independent address assignment authority
even though this is inefficient operationally and may waste
monumental amounts of potential address space.
If network topologies and traffic matrices aligned naturally
with the hierarchical organisation of address administration
authorities, this profligate use of hierarchy would pose little
problem, given the large size (20 octets) of the N-address
space. Unfortunately, this is not usually the case, especially
at higher levels of the hierarchy. Network topologies may
cross address administration boundaries in many cases, for
example:
-Multi-national Corporations with a backbone network
that spans several countries
-Community-of-interest networks, such as academic or
research networks, which span organisations and ge
ographies
-Military networks, which follow treaty alignments
rather than geographic or national administrations
-Corporate networks where divisions at times operate
as part of a contractor's network, such as with trade
consortia or government procurements.
These kinds of networks also exhibit rich internal topolo
gies and large scale (105 systems), which require sophisti
cated routeing technology such as that provided by this In
ternational Standard. In order to deploy such networks ef
fectively, a considerable amount of address space must be
left over for assignment in a way which produces efficient
routes without undue consumption of memory and
bandwidth for routeing overhead11This is just a fancy way of saying
that hierarchical routing, with its natural effect on address
assignment, is a mandatory requirement for such net
works.
.
Similarly important is the inter-connection of these net
works via Inter-domain routeing technology. If all of the as
signment flexibility of the addressing scheme is exhausted
in purely administrative hierarchy (at the high-order end of
the address) and in Intra-Domain routeing assignment (at
the low end of the address) there may be little or no address

space left to customise to the needs of inter-domain routing.
The considerations for how addresses may be structured for
the Intra- and Inter-domain cases are discussed in more de
tail in the following two clauses.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.2.1%20Address%20Structure%20for%20Intra-domain"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.2.1" name="appendix-B.2.1">B.2.1</a> Address Structure for Intra-domain</span>
Routeing
The IS-IS Intra-domain routeing protocol uses a preferred
addressing scheme. There are a number of reasons the de
signers of this protocol chose to specify a single address
structure, rather than leaving the matter entirely open to the
address assignment authorities and the routeing domain ad
ministrators:
a)If one address structure is very common and known a
priori, the forwarding functions can be made much
faster;
b)If part of the address is known to be assigned locally
to an end system, then the routeing can be simpler, use
less memory, and be potentially faster, by not having
to discriminate based on that portion of the address.
c)If part of the address can be designated as globally
unique by itself (as opposed to only the entire address
having this property) a number of benefits accrue:
1)Errors in address administration causing duplicate
addresses become much less likely
2)Automatic and dynamic NSAP address assignment
becomes feasible without global knowledge or
synchronisation
3)Routeing on this part of the address can be made
simple and fast, since no address collisions will oc
cur in the forwarding database.
d)If a part of the address can be reserved for assignment
purely on the basis of topological efficiency (as op
posed to political or address administration ease), hier
archical routeing becomes much more memory and
bandwidth efficient, since the addresses and the topol
ogy are in close correspondence.
e)If an upper bound can be placed on the amount of ad
dress space consumed by the Intra-domain routeing

scheme, then the use of address space by Inter-domain
routeing can be made correspondingly more flexible.
The preferred address format of the Intra-domain ISIS
protocol achieves these goals by being structured into two
fixed-sized fields as follows shown in figure 91#ID#81Used by level 1
routeingKey:Used by level 2 routeingID
SEL
HO-DSP
IDP
IDP     Initial Domain Part
HO-DSP  High Order Domain Specific Part
ID      System Identifier
SEL     NSAP Selector
Figure 9 - Preferred Address Format

 below:
The field marked IDP in the figure is precisely the IDP
specified in  ISO 8348/Add.2. The field marked HO-DSP
is that portion of the DSP from ISO 8348/Add.2 whose
structure, assignment, and meaning are not specified or
constrained by the Intra-domain ISIS routeing protocol.
However, the design presumes that the routeing domain ad
ministrator has at least some flexibility in assigning a por
tion of the HO-DSP field. The purpose and usage of the
fields specified by the Intra-domain ISIS routeing protocol
is explained in the following paragraphs.
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.2.1.1%20The%20IDP%20%2B%20HO-DSP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.2.1.1" name="appendix-B.2.1.1">B.2.1.1</a> The IDP + HO-DSP</span>
Since the Intra-domain ISIS protocol is customised for op
eration with ISO 8473, all addresses are specified to use the
preferred binary encoding of ISO 8348/Add.2.
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.2.1.2%20The%20Selector%20%28SEL%29%20Field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.2.1.2" name="appendix-B.2.1.2">B.2.1.2</a> The Selector (SEL) Field</span>
The SEL field is intended for two purposes. Its main use is
to allow for multiple higher-layer entities in End systems
(such as multiple transport entities) for those systems which
need this capability. This allows up to 256 NSAPs in a sin
gle End system. The advantage of reserving this field exclu
sively for local system administration the Intra-domain
routing functions need not store routeing information about,
nor even look at this field. If each individual NSAP were
represented explicitly in routing tables, the size of these ta
bles would grow with the number of NSAPs, rather than
with the number of End systems. Since Intra-domain rout
ing routes to systems, explicit recording of each NSAP
brings no efficiency benefit and potentially consumes large
amounts of memory in the Intermediate systems.
A second use for the SEL field is in Intermediate systems.
Certain ISIS functions require that PDUs be encapsulated
and sent to the Network Entity in an Intermediate system
rather than to an NSAP and upward to a Transport entity.
An example of this is the Partition Repair function of this
International Standard. In order to use a level 2 path as if it
were a single subnetwork in a level 1 area, PDUs are encap

sulated and addressed to an IS on the other side of the parti
tion11This is a gross oversimplification for the purpose of
illustrating the need for the SEL field. See 7.2.10.
.  By reserving certain values of the SEL field in Inter
mediate systems for direct addressing of Intermediate sys
tem Network entities, the normal addressing and relaying
functions of other Intermediate systems can be transpar
ently used for such purposes.
<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.2.1.3%20The%20Identifier%20%28ID%29%20Field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.2.1.3" name="appendix-B.2.1.3">B.2.1.3</a> The Identifier (ID) Field</span>
The ID field is a flat, large identifier space for identifying
OSI systems. The purpose of this field is to allow very fast,
simple routeing to a large (but not unconstrained) number
of End systems in a routeing domain. The Intra-Domain IS
IS protocol uses this field for routeing within a area. While
this field is only required to be unambiguous within a single
area, if the values are chosen to be globally unambiguous
the Intra-domain ISIS design can exploit this fact in the
following ways.
First, a certain amount of parallelism can be obtained dur
ing relaying. An IS can be simultaneously processing the ID
field along with other fields (i.e. IDP, HO-DSP). If the ID
is found in the forwarding table, the IS can initiate forward
ing while checking to make sure that the other fields have
the expected value. Conversely, if the ID is not found the
IS can assume that either the addressed NSAP is unreach
able or exists only in some other area or routeing domain.
In the case where the ID is not globally unique, the for
warding table can indicate this fact and relaying delayed
until the entire address is analysed and the route looked up.
Second, a considerable savings can be obtained in manual
address administration for all systems in the routeing do
main. If the ID is chosen from the ISO 8802 48-bit address
space, the ID is known to be globally unique. Furthermore,
since LAN systems conforming to ISO 8802 often have
their 48-bit MAC address stored in ROM locally, each sys
tem can be guaranteed to have a globally unambiguous
NET and NSAP(s) without centralised address administra
tion at the area level.22Note, however, that the use of the ISO 8802
addresses does not avoid the necessity to run ISO 9542 or to maintain
tables mapping NSAP addresses to
MAC (i.e. SNPA) addresses on the ISO 8802 subnetwork. This is because
there is no guarantee that a particular MAC address is always enabled (the LAN
controller may be turned off) or that a system has only a single MAC address.
  This not only eliminates administra
tive overhead, but also drastically reduces the possibility of
duplicate NSAP addresses, which are illegal, difficult to di
agnose, and often extremely difficult to isolate.
An alternative to a large, flat space for the lowest level of
routeing would be to hierarchically subdivide this field to
allow more levels of routeing within a single routeing do
main. The designers of the Intra-domain ISIS protocol
considered that this would lead to an inferior routeing archi
tecture, since:
a)The cost of memory in the ISs was sufficiently reason
able that large (e.g. 104 system) areas were quite fea
sible, thus requiring at least 2 octets per level to ad
dress
b)Two levels of routeing within a routeing domain were
sufficient (allowing domains of 106107 systems) be
cause it was unlikely that a single organisation would
wish to operate and manage a routeing domain much
larger than that.

c)Administrative boundaries often become the dominant
concern once routeing domains reach a certain size.
d)The additional burdens and potential for error in man
ual address assignment were deemed serious enough
to permit the use of a large, flat space.
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.3%20Use%20of%20the%20HO-DSP%20field%20in"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.3" name="appendix-B.3">B.3</a> Use of the HO-DSP field in</span>
Intra-domain routeing
Use of a portion of the HO-DSP field provides for hierar
chical routeing within a routeing domain. A value is as
signed to a set of ISs in order to group the ISs into a single
area for the usual benefits of hierarchical routeing:
a)Limiting the size of routeing tables in the ISs;
b)conserving bandwidth by hierarchical summarisation
of routeing information;
c)designating portions of the network which are to have
optimal routeing within themselves; and
d)moderate firewalling of portions of the routeing do
main from failures in other portions.
It is important to note that the assignment of HO-DSP val
ues is intended to provide the routeing domain administra
tor with a mechanism to optimise the routeing within a
large routeing domain. The Intra-domain ISIS designers
did not intend the HO-DSP to be entirely consumed by
many levels of address registration authority. Reserving the
assignment of a portion of the HO-DSP field to the route
ing domain administrator also allows the administrator to
start with a single assigned IDP+HO-DSP and run the
routing domain as a single area. As the routeing domain
grows, the routeing domain administrator can then add ar
eas without the need to go back to the address administra
tion authority for further assignments. Areas can be added
and re-assigned within the routeing domain without involv
ing the external address administration authority.
A useful field to reserve as part of the HO-DSP would be 2
octets,permitting up to 65,536 areas in a routeing domain.
This is viewed as a reasonable compromise between route
ing domain size and address space consumption. The field
may be specified as flat for the same reasons that the ID
field may be flat.

Inter-domain Routeing
It is in the Inter-domain arena where the goals of routeing
efficiency and administrative independence collide most
strongly. Although the OSI Routeing Framework explicitly
gives priority in Inter-domain routeing to considerations of
autonomy and firewalls over efficiency, it must be feasible
to construct an Inter-Domain topology that both produces
isolable domains and relays data at acceptable cost. Since

no routeing information is exchanged across domain
boundaries with static routeing, the practicality of a given
Inter-domain topology is essentially determined by the size
of the routeing tables that are present at the boundary ISs. If
these tables become too large, the memory needed to store
them, the processing needed to search them, and the
bandwidth needed to transmit them  within the routeing do
main all combine to disallow certain forms of
interconnection.
Inter-domain routeing primarily computes routes to other
routeing domains33This International Standard also uses static
Inter-domain tables for routeing to individual End systems across
dynamically assigned circuits, and also to
End systems whose addresses do not conform to the address construction rules.
. If there is no correspondence between
the address registration hierarchy and the organisation of
routeing domains (and their interconnection) then the task
of static table maintenance quickly becomes a nightmare,
since each and every routeing domain in the OSIE would
need a table entry potentially at every boundary IS of every
other routeing domain. Luckily, there is some reason to be
lieve that a natural correspondence exists, since at least at
the global level the address registration authorities fall
within certain topological regions. For example, most of the
routeing domains which obtained their IDP+HO-DSP
from a hierarchy of French authorities are likely to reside in
France and be more strongly connected with other routeing
domains in France that with routeing domains in other
countries.
There are enough exceptions to this rule, however, to be a
cause for concern. The scenarios cited in B.2 all exist today
and may be expected to remain common for the foreseeable
future. Consider as a practical case the High Energy Phys
ics Network (HEPnet), which contains some 17000 End
systems, and an unknown number of intermediate systems44The number of
ISs is hard to estimate since some ISs and links are in fact shared
with other networks, such as the similarly organised NASA Space
Physics network, or SPAN.
.
This network operates as a single routeing domain in order
to provide a known set of services to a known community
of users, and is funded and cost-justified on this basis. This
network is international in scope (at least 10 countries in
North America, Europe, and the far east) and yet its topol
ogy does not map well onto existing national boundaries.
Connectivity is richer between CERN and FERMIlab, for
example than between many points within the U.S.
More importantly, this network has rich connectivity with a
number of other networks, including the PDNs of the vari
ous countries, the NSFnet in the U.S., the international
ESnet (Energy Sciences Network), the general research
Internet, and military networks in the U.S. and elsewhere.
None of these other networks shares a logical part of the
NSAP address hierarchy with HEPnet55It is conceivable that ISO would
sanction such networks by assigning a top-level IDI from the ISO
non-geographic AFI, but this is unlikely and would
only exacerbate the problem if many such networks were assigned
top-level registrations.
 .  If the only method
of routing from the HEPnet to these other networks was to
place each within one and only one of the existing registra
tion authorities, and to build static tables showing these re
lationships, the tables would clearly grow as O(n2).
It seems therefore, that some means must be available to as
sign addresses in a way that captures the Inter-Domain to
pology, and which co-exists cleanly with both the adminis
trative needs of the registration authorities, and the algo
rithms employed  by both the Intra- and Inter-domain

routeing protocols. As alluded to in an earlier clause, it
seems prudent to leave some portion of the address space
(most likely from the HO-DSP part) sufficiently undefined
and flexible that various Inter-domain topologies may be
efficiently constructed.

Equal Cost Paths
An algorithm invented by Dijkstra (see references) known
as shortest path first (SPF), is used as the basis for the
route calculation. It has a computational complexity of the
square of the number of nodes, which can be decreased to
the number of links in the domain times the log of the num
ber of nodes for sparse networks (networks which are not
highly connected).
A number of additional optimisations are possible:
a)If the routeing metric is defined over a small finite
field (as in this International Standard), the factor of
log n may be removed by using data structures which
maintain a separate list of systems for each value of
the metric rather than sorting the systems by logical
distance.
b)Updates can be performed incrementally without re
quiring a complete recalculation. However, a full up
date must be done periodically to recover from data
corruption, and studies suggest that with a very small
number of link changes (perhaps 2) the expected com
putation complexity of the incremental update exceeds
the complete recalculation. Thus, this International
Standard specifies the algorithm only for the full up
date.
c)If only End system LSP information has changed, it is
not necessary to re-compute the entire Dijkstra tree for
the IS. If the proper data structures exist, End Systems
may be attached and detached as leaves of the tree and
their forwarding information base entries altered as
appropriate
The original SPF algorithm does not support load splitting
over multiple paths. The algorithm in this International
Standard does permit load splitting by identifying a set of
equal cost paths to each destination rather than a single
least cost path.

shortest paths from the system S performing the cal

aN,d(N),{Adj(N)}q, where:
        N is a system Identifier. In the level 1 algorithm, N is
a 7 octet ID. For a non-pseudonode it is the 6 octet
system ID, with a 0 appended octet.  For a
pseudonode it is a true 7 octet quantity, comprised of
the 6 octet Designated Intermediate System ID and
the extra octet assigned by the Designated Interme
diate System.  In the level 2 algorithm it is either a

the level 1 algorithm), or it is a variable length ad
dress prefix (which will always be a leaf, i.e. End
system, in PATHS).
        d(N) is N's distance from S (i.e. the total metric
value from N to S).

{Adj(N)} is a set of valid adjacencies that S may use
for forwarding to N.
        When a system is placed on PATHS, the path(s)
designated by its position in the graph is guaranteed
to be a shortest path.
TENT  This is a list of triples of the form
aN,d(N),{Adj(N)}q, where N, d(N) and {Adj(N)} are
as defined above for PATHS.
        TENT can intuitively be thought of as a tentative
placement of a system in PATHS. In other words,
the triple aN,x,{A}q in TENT means that if N were
placed in PATHS, d(N) would be x, but N cannot be
placed on PATHS until it is guaranteed that no path
shorter than x exists.
        The triple aN,x,{A,B}q in TENT means that if N
were placed in PATHS, d(N) would be x via either
adjacency A or B
NOTE - As described above, (see 7.2.6), it is suggested that
the implementation keep the database TENT as a set of lists
of triples of the form a*,Dist,*q, for each possible distance
Dist.  In addition it is necessary to be able to process those
systems which are pseudonodes before any non-
pseudonodes at the same distance Dist.

Internal metrics are not comparable to external metrics.
Therefore, the cost of the path from N to S for external
routes (routes to destinations outside of the routing domain)
may include both internal and external metrics. The cost of
the path from N to S (called d(N) below in database
PATHS) may therefore be maintained as a two-
dimensioned vector quantity (specifying internal and exter
nal metric values). In incrementing d(N) by 1, if the internal
metric value is less than the maximum value
MaxPathMetric, then the internal metric value is incre
mented by one and the external metric value left un
changed; if the internal metric value is equal to the maxi
mum value MaxPathMetric, then the internal metric value
is set to 0 and the external metric value is incremented by 1.
Note that this can be implemented in a straightforward
manner by maintaining the external metric as the high order
bits of the distance.
NOTE - In the code of the algorithm below, the current path
length is held in a variable tentlength. This variable is a
two-dimensional quantity tentlength=(internal,external)
and is used for comparing the current path length with d(N)
as described above.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/C.2.3%20Overview%20of%20the%20Algorithm"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-C.2.3" name="appendix-C.2.3">C.2.3</a> Overview of the Algorithm</span>
The basic algorithm, which builds PATHS from scratch,
starts out by putting the system doing the computation on
PATHS (no shorter path to SELF can possibly exist).
TENT is then pre-loaded from the local adjacency data
base.
Note that a system is not placed in PATHS unless no
shorter path to that system exists. When a system N is
placed in PATHS, the path to each neighbour M of N,

through N, is examined, as the path to N plus the link from
N to M. If aM,*,*q is in PATHS, this new path will be
longer, and thus ignored.
If aM,*,*q is in TENT, and the new path is shorter, the old
entry is removed from TENT and the new path is placed in
TENT. If the new path is the same length as the one in
TENT, then the set of potential adjacencies {adj(M)}  is set
to the union of the old set (in TENT) and the new set
{adj(N)}. If M is not in TENT, then the path is added to
TENT.
Next the algorithm finds the triple aN,x,{Adj(N)}q in
TENT, with minimal x.
NOTE - This is done efficiently because of the optimisation
described above. When the list of triples for distance Dist is
exhausted, the algorithm then increments Dist until it finds a
list with a triple of the form a*,Dist,*q.
N is placed in PATHS. We know that no path to N can be
shorter than x at this point because all paths through sys
tems already in PATHS have already been considered, and
paths through systems in TENT will have to be greater than
x because x is minimal in TENT.
When TENT is empty, PATHS is complete.

The Decison Process Algorithm must be run once for each
supported routeing metric.  A Level 1 Intermediate System
runs the algorithm using the Level 1 LSP database to com
pute Level 1 paths.  In addition a Level 2 Intermediate Sys
tem runs the algorithm using the Level 2 LSP database to
compute Level 2 paths.
If this system is a Level 2 Intermediate System which sup
ports the partition repair optional function the Decision
Process algorithm for computing Level 1 paths must be run
twice for the default  metric.  The first execution is done to
determine which of the area's manual</pre>

termine if the area is partitioned and will create virtual

termediate Systems in the area in order to repair the Level 1

Step 0:  Initialise TENT and PATHS to empty.  Initialise
tentlength to (0,0).
(tentlength is the pathlength of elements in TENT
we are examining.)
a)Add aSELF, 0, Wq to PATHS, where W is a special
value indicating traffic to SELF is passed up to Trans
port (rather than forwarded).
b)Now pre-load TENT with the local adjacency data
base. (Each entry made to TENT must be marked as
being either an End system or an Intermediate System
to enable the check at the end of Step 2 to be made
correctly.) For each adjacency Adj(N), (including
Manual Adjacencies, or for Level 2 enabled Reach

able Addresses) on enabled circuits, to system N of
SELF in state Up, compute

i)For all broadcast circuits in state On, find the LSP
with LSP number zero and with the first  7 octets of

zero).
a)If this LSP is present, and the LSP Database Over

for each neighbour N (both Intermediate System and
End system) of the system P. If the LSP Database
Overload bit is set, only consider the End system
neighbours of the system P. d(P) is the second ele

and metrick(P,N) is the cost of the link from P to N as
reported in P's Link State PDU

for a system which is a pseudonode in preference
to one for a non-pseudonode. If there are no more
elements in the list  for tentlength increment ten
tlength and repeat  Step 2.
2)Remove aP,tentlength,{Adj(P)}q from TENT.
3)Add aP,d(P),{Adj(P)}q  to PATHS.
4)If this is the Level 2 Decision Process running, and
the system just added to PATHS listed itself as
Partition Designated Level 2 Intermediate system,
then additionally add aAREA.P, d(P), {adj(P)}q to
PATHS, where AREA.P is the Network Entity
Title of the other end of the Virtual Link, obtained
by taking the first AREA listed in P's Level 2 LSP
and appending P's ID.

Congestion Control and Avoidance
(This annex is informative)

The transmit management subroutine handles congestion
control. Transmit management consists of the following
components:
Square root limiter. Reduces buffer occupancy
time per PDU by using a square root limiter algo
rithm. The square root limiter also queues PDUs for
an output circuit, and prevents buffer deadlock by
discarding PDUs when the buffer pool is exhausted.
Clause D.1.1 specifies the Square Root Limiter
Process.
Originating PDU limiter. Limits originating NPDU
traffic when necessary to ensure that transit NPDUs
are not rejected. An originating NPDU is an NPDU
resulting from an NSDU from the Transport at this
ES. A transit NPDU is an NPDU from another sys
tem to be relayed to another destination ES.
Flusher. Flushes PDUs queued for an adjacency that
has gone down.
Information for higher layer (Transport) congestion control
procedures is provided by the setting of the congestion ex
perienced bit in the forwarded data NPDUs.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/D.1.1%20Square%20Root%20Limiter"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-D.1.1" name="appendix-D.1.1">D.1.1</a> Square Root Limiter</span>
The square root limiter discards a data NPDU by calling the
ISO 8473 discard PDU function with the reason  PDU
Discarded due to Congestion when the number of data
NPDUs on the circuit output queue exceeds the discard
threshold, Ud.  Ud is given as follows:=
where:
Nb = Number of Routeing Layer buffers
(maximumBuffers) for all output circuits.
Nc = Number of active output circuits (i.e. Circuits in state
On).
The output queue is a queue of buffers containing data
NPDUs which have been output to that circuit by the for
warding process, and which have not yet been transmitted
by the circuit. It does not include NPDUs which are held
by the data link layer for the purpose of retransmission.
Where a data NPDU is to be fragmented by this Intermedi
ate system over this circuit, each fragment shall occupy a

separate buffer and shall be counted as such in the queue
length. If the addition of all the buffers required for the
fragmentation of a single input data NPDU would cause the
discard threshold for that queue to be exceeded, it is recom
mended that all those fragments (including those which
could be added without causing the threshold to be ex
ceeded) be discarded.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/D.1.2%20Originating%20PDU%20Limiter"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-D.1.2" name="appendix-D.1.2">D.1.2</a> Originating PDU Limiter</span>
TEMPORARY NOTE - Strictly this function is an End Sys
tem function. However it is closely coupled to the routeing
function, particularly in the case of real systems which are
performing the functions of both an Intermediate System
and an End System (i.e. systems which can both initiate and
terminate data NPDUs and perform relaying functions).
Therefore, until a more appropriate location for this infor
mation can be determined, this function is described here.
The originating PDU limiter first distinguishes between
originating NPDUs and transit NPDUs. It then imposes a
limit on the number of buffers that originating NPDUs can
occupy on a per circuit basis. In times of heavy load, origi
nating NPDUs may be rejected while transit NPDUs con
tinue to be routed. This is done because originating NPDUs
have a relatively short wait, whereas transit NPDUs, if re
jected, have a long wait  a transport retransmission period.
The originating PDU limiter accepts as input:
-An NSDU received from Transport Layer
-A transmit complete signal from the circuit for an ISO
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8473%20Data%20PDU."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8473" name="section-8473">8473</a> Data PDU.</span>
The originating PDU limiter produces the following as out
put:
-PDU accepted
-PDU rejected
-Modifications to originating PDU counter
There is a counter, N, and an originating PDU limit,
originatingQueueLimit, for each active output circuit.
Each N is initialised to 0. The originatingQueueLimit is
set by management to the number of buffers necessary to
prevent the circuit from idling.
<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/D.1.3%20Flusher"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-D.1.3" name="appendix-D.1.3">D.1.3</a> Flusher</span>
The flusher ensures that no NPDU is queued on a circuit
whose state is not ON, or on a non-existent adjacency, or
one whose state is not  Up.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/D.2%20Congestion%20Avoidance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-D.2" name="appendix-D.2">D.2</a> Congestion Avoidance</span>

The Forwarding Process supplies and manages the buffers
necessary for relaying. PDUs shall be discarded if buffer
thresholds are exceeded. If the average queue length on the
input circuit or the forwarding processor or the output cir
cuit exceeds QueueThreshold, the congestion experi
enced bit shall be set in the QoS maintenance option of the
forwarded data PDU (provided the QoS maintenance option
is present).
