<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/I.%20INTRODUCTION"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-I" name="appendix-I">I</a>. INTRODUCTION</span>

    The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a protocol for file
transfer betweet HOSTs (including terminal IMPs), on the ARPA
Computer Network (ARPANET). The primary function of FTP is to
transfer files efficiently and reliably among HOSTs and to allow
the convenient use of remote file storage capabilities.

    The objectives of FTP are 1) to promote sharing of files
(computer programs and/or data), 2) fo encourage indirect or
implicit (via programs) use of remote computers, 3) to shield a
user from variations in file storage systems among HOSTs, and
4) to transfer data reliably and efficiently. FTP, though usable
directly by user at a terminal, is designed mainly for use by
programs.

    The attempt in this specification is to satisfy the diverse
needs of users of maxi-HOSTs, mini-HOSTs, TIPs, and the
Datacomputer, with a simple, elegant, and easily implemented
protocol design.

    This paper assumes knowledge of the following protocols:

         1) The HOST-HOST Protocol (NIC #8246)

         2) The initial Connection Protocol (NIC #7101)

         3) The TELNET Protocol (NWG/RFC #318, NIC #9348)

II. DISCUSSION

    In this section, the terminology and the FTP model are
discussed. The terms defined in this section are only those that
have special significance in FTP.

11.A. Terminology

ASCII               The USASCII character set as defined in NIC
                    #7104. In FTP, ASCII characters are defined
                    to be the lower half of an eight bit code set
                    (i.e., the most significant bit es zero).

access controls     Access controls define users' access
                    privileges to the use of a system, and to the
                    files in that system. Access controls are
                    necessary to prevent unauthorized or
                    accidental use of files. It is the
                    prerogative of a user-FTP process to provide
                    access controls.

byte size           The byte size specified for the transfer of
                    data. The data connection is opened with
                    this byte size. Data connection byte size is
                    not necessarily the byte size in which data
                    is to be stored in a system, and may not be
                    related to the structure of data.

data connection     A simplex connection over which data is
                    transferred, in a specified byte size, mode
                    and type. The data transferred may be a part
                    of a file, an entire file or a number of
                    files. The data connection may be in either
                    direction (server-to-user or user-to server).

data socket         The socket on which a User-FTP process
                    "listens" for a data connection.

EOF                 The end-of-file conidition that defines the
                    end of a file being transferred.

EOR                 The end-of-record condition that defines the
                    end of a record being transferred.

error recovery      A procedure that allows a user to recover
                    form certain errors such as failure of either
                    Host system or transfer process In FTP,
                    error recovery may involve restarting a file
                    transfer at a given checkpoint

FTP commands        A set of commands that comprise the control
                    information flowing from the user-FTP to the
                    server-FTP process.

file                An ordered set of computer data (including
                    programs) of arbitrary length uniquely
                    identified by a pathname.

mode                The mode in which data is to be transferred
                    via the data connection. The mode defines
                    the data format including EOR and EOF. The
                    transfer modes defined in FTP are described
                    in Section III.A.

NVT                 The Network Virtual Terminal as defined in
                    the ARPANET TELNET Protocol.

NVFS                The Network Virtual File System. A concept
                    which defines a standard network file system
                    with standard commands and pathname
                    conventions. FTP only partially embraces the
                    NFS concept at this time.

pathname            Pathname is defined to be the character
                    string which must be input to a file system
                    by a user in order to identify a file.
                    Pathname normally contains device and/or
                    directory names, and file name specification.
                    FTP does not yet specify a standard pathname
                    convention. Each user must follow the file
                    naming conventions of hte file systems he
                    wishes to use.

record              A sequential file may be structured as a
                    number of contiguous parts called records.
                    Record structures are supported by FTP but
                    are not mandatory.

reply               A reply is an acknowledgment (positive or
                    negative) sent from server to user via the
                    telnet connections in response to FTP
                    commands. The general form of a reply is a
                    completion code (including error codes)
                    followed by an ASCII text string. The codes
                    are for use by programs and the text is for
                    human users.

server-FTP process  A process or set of processes which perform
                    the function of file transfer in cooperation
                    with a user-FTP process. The server-FTP
                    process must interpret and respond to user
                    commands and initiate the data connection.

server site         A HOST site wich has a server-FTP process.

server-TELNET       A TELNET process which listens on a specified
                    socket for an ICP initiated by a user-TELNET,
                    and perform in accordance with the ARPANET
                    TELNET Protocol.

TELNET connections  The full-duplex communication path between a
                    user-TELNET and a server-TELNET. The TELNET
                    connections are established via the standard
                    ARPANET initial Connection Protocol (ICP).

type                The data representation type used for data
                    transfer and storage. Type implies certain
                    transformations between the time of data
                    storage and data transfer. The
                    representation types defined in FTP are
                    described in Section III.B.

user                A process on behalf of a human being or a

user site           A HOST site satisfying any of the following
                    conditions: 1) The site where a user is
                    located, 2) a site where a user-FTP process
                    is located, 3) a site to which a data
                    connection is made by a server. In the
                    normal case, the sites defined by 1, 2, and 3

                    process 1) initiates the ICP (via a
                    user-TELNET, 2) initiates FTP commands and
                    3) "listens" on the data socket for the data

                    TIPs and other mini-HOSTs) a user-FTP process

II.B. The FTP Model

    With the above definitions in mind, the following model
(shown in Figure 1) may be diagrammed for an FTP service.


                            TELNET
                          connections
File      Server    Server&lt;------------ User     User      File
Systems&lt;-&gt;  FTP  &lt;-&gt;TELNET FTP Commands TELNET&lt;-&gt;FTP    &lt;-&gt;System
          Process         ------------&gt;          Process

                                                  Data
                 &lt;------------------------------&gt;Socket
                        Data Connection(s)         |
                                                   |
                                                  USER




Notes:  1. The data connection may be in either direction.

        2. The data connection need not exist all of the time.

        3. The distinctions between user-FTP and user-TELNET,
           and between server-FTP and server-TELNET may not
           be as clear-cut as shown above. For example, a user-
           TELNET may be directly driven by the user.



                FIGURE 1 Model for FTP Use


    In the model described in Figure 1, the user-TELNET
initiates the TELNET connection. Standard FTP commands are then
generated by the user and transmitted to the server site via the TELNET
connections. FTP commands are in ASCII, in accordance with NVT
conventions and the TELNET protocol. Note that commands may be initiated
by the user directly through the user-TELNET or via a user-FTP process.
Standard replies are sent from the server to the user in response to the
commands over the TELNET connections.

    The FTP commands specify the parameters for teh data
connection (data socket, byte size, transfer mode, and representation
type), and the nature of file system operation (store, retrieve, append,
delete, etc.). The user-FTP process or its designate should "listen" on



<span class="grey">                                                                [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-6" id="page-6" name="page-6"> </a>
<span class="grey">The File Transfer Protocol                                  July 8, 1972</span>


the specified data socket, and it is the server's responsibility to
initiate the data connection and data transfer in accordance with the
specified data connection parameters. It should be noted that the data
socket need not be in the same HOST that initiates the FTP commands via
the TELNET connection, but the user or his user-FTP process must ensure
a "listen" on the specified data socket. A practical example of such
file transfer to third HOSTs is a maxi-HOST user (who may actually be a
TIP user) whishing to transmit a file to or from an I/O device attached
to a TIP. It should also be noted that two data connections, one for
send and the other for receive, may exist simultaneously.

    The protocol requires that the TELNET connections be open
while data transfer is in progress. It is the responsibility of the user
to close the TELNET connections when finished using the FTP service. The
server may abort data transfer if the TELNET connections are closed.

III. DATA TRANSFER FUNCTIONS

    Data and files are transferred only via the data connection.
The data transfer of data is governed by FTP data transfer commands
received on the TELNET connections. The data transfer functions include
establishing the data connection to the specified data socket in the
specified HOST (using the specified byte size), transmitting and
receiving data in the specified representation type and transfer mode,
handling EOR and EOF conditions and error recovery (where applicable).

III.A Establishing Data Connection

    The user site shall "listen" on the specified data socket.
The FTP request command determines the direction of data transfer, and
the socket number (odd or even) which is to be used in establishing the
data connection. The server on receiving the appropriate store or
retrieve request shall initiate the data connection to the specified
user data socket in the specified byte size (default byte size is 8
bits) and send a reply indicating that file transfer may proceed. Prior
to this the server should send a reply indicating the server socket for
the data connection. The user may use this server socket information to
ensure the security of his data transfer. The server may send this reply
either before of after initiating the data connection.

    The byte size for the data connection is specified by the
TYPE (ASCII is 8 bits), or TYPE and BYTE commands. It is not required by
the protocol that servers accept all possible byte size. The user of
various byte size is for efficiency in data transfer and servers may
implement only those byte size for which their data transfer is
efficient. It is however recommended that servers implement at least the
byte size of 8 bits.




<span class="grey">                                                                [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey">The File Transfer Protocol                                  July 8, 1972</span>


    After the data transfer is completed, it is the server's
responsibility to close the data connection except when the user is
sender of data. The data connection shall be closed under any of the
following conditions:

    1) server receives an abort command form user.

    2) EOF in stream mode indicated by closing data connection.

    3) the socket or byte size specification is changed.

    4) any of the TELNET connections are closed.

    5) an irrecoverable error condition.

    It should be noted that two simultaneous data connections
(for send and receive) may exist. It is a server option, however, to
close the data connection after each instance of file transfer.

III.B Data Representation and Storage

    Data is transferred from a storage device in sending HOST to
a storage device in receiving HOST. Often it is necessary to perform
certain transformations on the data because data storage representations
in the two systems are different. For example, NVT-ASCII has different
data storage representations in different systems. PDP-10's generally
store NVT-ASCII as five 7-bit ASCII characters, left justified in a 36
bit word. 360's store NVT-ASCII as 8-bit EBCDIC codes. Multics stores
NVT-ASCII as four 9-bit characters in a 36-bit word. It may desirable to
convert characters into the standard NVT-ASCII representation when
transmitting text between disimilar systems. The sending and receiving
site would have to perform the necessary transformations between the
standard representation and their internal representations.

    A different problem in representation arises when
transmitting binary data (not character codes) between HOST systems with
different word length. it is not always clear how the sender should send
data, and the receiver store it. For example, when transmitting 32-bit
bytes from a 32-bit word-length system to a 36-bit word-length system,
it may be desirable (for reasons of efficiency and usefulness) o store
the 32-bit bytes right justified in a 36-bit word in the latter system.
In any case, the user should have the option of specifying data
representation and transformation functions. It should be noted that FTP
provides for very limited data types reprentations.  Transformations
desired beyond this limited capability should be performed by the user
directly or via the use of the Data Reconfiguration Service (DRS, RFC
#138, NIC #6715). Additional representation types may be defined later
if there is a demonstrable need.



<span class="grey">                                                                [Page 7]</span></pre>

    Data representations are handled in FTP by a user specifying
a representation type. The type may also specify a fixed transfer byte
size. For example in ASCII and Print File representations, the transfer
byte size must be 8 bits. Only in the Image and Local Byte
representations the byte size specified by the BYTE command is to be
used. The following data representation types are currently defined in
FTP:

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20ASCII"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. ASCII  </span>          The sender converts data form its internal
                    character representation to the standard
                    ARPANET ASCII form. The receiver converts
                    the data from the standard form to its own
                    internal form. The data is transferred in
                    the standard form. The transfer byte size
                    must be 8 bits. This type would be used for
                    transfer of text files. This is be default
                    type, and it is recommended that this type be
                    implemented by all.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Image"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Image  </span>          The sender transforms data from contiguous
                    bits to bytes for transfer. The receiver
                    transforms the bytes into bits, storing them
                    contiguously independent of the byte size
                    chosen for data transfer. Typical uses for
                    the Image type are transfer of executable
                    programs between like machines, and transfer
                    of binary (non-text) data. It is recommended
                    that this type be implemented by all for some
                    byte size preferably including the 8 bit byte
                    size.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20Local%20Byte"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. Local Byte  </span>     This representation allows for efficient
                    storage, use, and retrieval of data. The
                    mann in which data is to be transformed
                    depends on the byte size for data transfer,
                    and the particular HOST being used. The
                    transformation scheme for different byte size
                    is to be well publicized b all server sites.
                    This transformation shall be invertible
                    (i.e., if a file is stored using a certain
                    transfer byte size, an identical file must be
                    retrievable using the same byte size and
                    representation type). It is the user's
                    responsibility to keep track of the
                    representation type and byte size used for
                    his transfer. Typical uses of the Local Byte
                    type are in efficient storage and retrieval
                    of files, and transfer of structured binary

                    data. This type may be identical to the
                    image type for byte size which are integral
                    multiples of or factors of the computer word
                    length-

   ASCII            file in a form suitable for printing at the
                    server site. The byte size must be 8 bits.
                    The transformation may not be invertible.
                    This type is different from ASCII in that
                    TABs, FFs and other ASCII format effector
                    characters may be replaced by SPs, LFs, and
                    other substitute characters. The print file
                    conversions are to be well publicized by all
                    server sites. This type would be used when
                    the file is destined for an ASCII printer.
                    This type in some systems may be identical to
                    the ASCII type. It is recommended that this
                    type be implemented by all.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20EBCDIC%20Print"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>. EBCDIC Print  </span>   The server site will transform the EBCDIC
   File             file into a form suitable for printing at the
                    server site. The byte size must be 8 bits.
                    the transformation may not be invertible.
                    This type would be used when the file is
                    destined for an EBCDIC printer. Only systems
                    which use EBCDIC for their internal character
                    representation need accept this type.

    It should be noted that a serving HOST need not accept all
representation types and/or byte size, but it must inform the user of
the fact by sending an appropriate reply.

III.C File Structure and Transfer Modes

    The only file structures supported directly in FTP at the
present time are record structures. However, the use of record
structures is not mandatory. A user with no record structure in his file
should be able to store and retrieve his file at any HOST. A user
wishing to transmit a record structured file must send the appropriate
FTP 'STRU' command (the default assumption is no record structure). A
serving HOST need not accept record structures, but it must inform the
user of this fact by sending an appropriate reply. Any record structure
information in the data stream may subsequently be discarded by the
receiver.






<span class="grey">                                                                [Page 9]</span></pre>

    All data transfer must end with an EOF. The EOF is defined
by the data transfer mode. For files that have record structures, an EOR
is also defined by the transfer mode. Only the transfer modes and
representation type combinations that have EOR defined may be used for
transfer or files with record structures. Records may be of zero length
but they must be contained in file boundaries. The relationship between
files and records is heirarchical and an EOF implies an EOR.

    The following data transfer modes are defined in FTP:

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Stream"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Stream  </span>         The file is transmitted as a stream of bytes of the
                    specified byte size. The EOF is signalled by
                    closing the data connection. Any representation
                    type and byte size may be used in the stream mode
                    but record structures are possible only with the
                    ASCII representation type. The convention is that
                    the ASCII character CR (Carriage Return, Code 13.)
                    followed by LF (Line Feed, Code 10.) Indicates an
                    EOR in stream mode and ASCII representation type.
                    This is the default mode, and it is recommended
                    that this mode be implemented by all.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Text"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Text  </span>           The file is ASCII text transmitted as sequence of
                    8-bit bytes in the ASCII representation type.
                    Record structures are allowed in this mode. The
                    EOR and EOF are defined by the presence of special
                    "TELNET-control" codes (most significant bit set
                    of one) in the data stream. The EOR code is 192
                    (octal 300, hex C0). The EOF code os 193 (octal
                    301, hex C1). The byte size for transfer is 8
                    bits.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20Block"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. Block  </span>          The file is transmitted as a series of data blocks
                    preceded by one or more header bytes. The header
                    bytes contain a count field and descriptor code.
                    The count field indicates the total length of the
                    data block in bytes, thus marking the beginning of
                    the next data block (there are no filler bits).
                    The descriptor code defines last file block (EOF),
                    last record block (EOR), restart marker (see
                    section III.D), or suspect data (i.e. the data
                    being transferred is suspected of errors and is
                    not reliable). Record structures are allowed in
                    this mode, and any representation type or byte
                    size may be used. The header consists of integral
                    number of bytes whose length is greater than or
                    equal to 24 bits. Only the least significant 24
                    bits (right-jusified) of header shall have

                      0   An ordinary block of data.
                      1   End of data block is EOR.
                      2   End of data block is EOF.
                      3   Suspected errors in data block.
                      4   Data block is a restart marker.

                    The restart marker is imbedded in the data stream
                    as integral number of 8-bit bytes (representing
                    printable ASCII characters) right-justified in
                    integral number of data bytes greater than 8 bits.
                    For example if the byte size is 7 bits, the
                    restart marker byte would be one byte
                    right-justified per two 7-bit bytes as shown
                    below:

                      Two 7-bit bytes

                    |           | Marker Char|
                    |           |    8 bits  |

                    For byte size of 16 bits or more, two more
                    marker bytes shall be packed right-justified. The
                    end of the marker may be delimited by the
                    character SP (code 32.). If marker characters do
                    no exactly fit an integral byte, the unused
                    character slots should contain the ASCII character
                    SP (code 32.). For example, to transmit a six
                    character marker in a 36-bit byte size, the
                    following three 36.bit bytes would be sent:

                    |   Zero    |  Descriptor  |               |
                    |   12 bits |  code=4      | Byte count=2  |

                    in the standard Hasp-compressed data format
                    (document to be issued by Bob Braden, UCLA). This
                    mode achieves considerable compression of data for
                    print files. Record structures are allowed in the
                    Hasp mode.

III.D Error Recovery and Restart

    There is no provision for detecting bits lost or scrambled
in data transfer. This issue is perhaps handled best at the NCP level
where it benefits most users. However, a restart procedure is provided
to protect user from system failures (such as failure of either HOST,
FTP-process, or the IMP subnet).

    The restart procedure is defined only for the block mode of
data transfer. It requires the sender of data to insert a special marker
code in teh data stream with some marker information. The marker
information has meaning only to the sender, but must consist of
printable ASCII characters. The printable ASCII characters are defined
to be codes 33. through 126. (i.e., not including codes 0. through 31.
and the characters SP and DEL). The marker could represent a bit-count,a
record-count, or any other information by wich a system may identify a
data checkpoint. The receiver of data, if it implements the restart
procedure, would then mark the corresponding position of this marker in
the receiving system, and return this information to the user.

    In the event of a system failure, the user can restart the
data transfer by identifying the marker point with the FTP restart
procedure. The following examples Illustrate the use of the restart
procedure.

    1. When server is the sender of data, the server-FTP process
inserts an appropriate marker block in the data stream at a convenient
data point. The user-FTP process receiving the data, marks the
coressponding data point in its file system and conveys the last known
sender and receiver marker information to the user. In the event of
system failure, the user or user-FTP process restarts the server at the






<span class="grey">                                                               [Page 12]</span></pre>

last server marker by sending a restart command with the server's marker
code at its argument.  The restart command is transmitted over the
TELNET connection and is immediately followed by the command (such as
store or retrieve) which was being executed when the system failure
occured.

    2. When user is the sender of data, the user-FTP process
inserts the appropriate marker block in the data stream. The server-FTP
process receiving the data, marks the corresponding data point in its
file system. The server does not store this marker but conveys the last
known sender and receiver marker information to the user over the TELNET
connections by appropriate reply codes. The user or the user-FTP process
then restarts transfer in a manner identical to that described in the
first example.

IV. FILE TRANSFER FUNCTIONS

    The TELNET connections on which FTP commands and replies are
transmitted, are initiated by the user-FTP process via an ICP to a
standard server socket. FTP commands are then transmitted from user to
server, and replies are transmitted from server to user.  The user file
transfer functions invoive sending the FTP commands, interpreting the
replies received and transferring data over the data connection in the
specified manner. The server file transfer functions involve accepting
and interpreting FTP commands, sending replies, setting up the data
connection, and transferring data.

IV.A FTP Commands

    FTP commands are ASCII terminated by the ASCII
character sequence CRLF (Carriage Return follow by Line Feed).  The
command codes themselves are ASCII alpabetic characters terminated by
the ASCII character 'space' (code = 32.). For convenience, the command
codes are defined to be four (or less) ASCII alphanumeric characters
(including both upper and lower case alphabetic characters). The command
codes and the semantics of commands are described in this section, but
the detailed syntax of commands is specified in Section V.b, the reply
sequence are discussed in Section V.C, and scenarios illustrating the
use of commands are provided in Section V.D.

    FTP commands may be partitioned as those specifying
access-control identifiers, data transfer parameters, or FTP service
requests.

IV.A.1 Access Control Commands

The following commands specify access control identifiers
       (command codes are shown in parentheses).

       User name (USER) - The argument field is an ASCII string
       identifying the user. The user identification is that wich is
       required by the server for access to its file system. This
       command will normally be the first command transmitted by the
       user after the TELNET connections are made (some servers may
       require this). Additional identification information in the form
       of pasword command may also be required by some servers.

       Password (PASS) - The argument field is an ASCII string
       identifying the user's password. This command must be immediately
       preceded by the user name command, and together it completes the
       user's identifecation for access control.

IV.A.2 Data Transfer Commands

       All data transfer parameters have default values, and the
       commands specifying data transfer parameters are required only if
       the default parameter values are to be changed.  The default
       value is teh last specified value, or if no value has been
       specified, the standard default value specified here. This
       implies that the server must "remember" the applicable default
       values. The commands may be in any order except that they must
       precede the FTP service request. The following commands specify
       data transfer parameters.

       Byte size (BYTE) - The argument is an ASCII-represented decimal
       integer (1 through 255), specifying the byte size for the data
       connection for local byte and image representation types. The
       default byte size is 8 bits.  The byte size is always 8 bits in
       the ASCII and Print file representation types. A server may
       reject specific byte size/type combinations by sending an
       appropriate reply.

       Data socket (SOCK) - The argument is a HOST-socket specification
       for the data socket to be used in data connection. There may be
       two data sockets, one from server to user and the other for user
       to server data transfer. An odd socket number defines a send
       socket and an even socket number defines a receive socket. The
       default HOST is the user HOST to which TELNET connections are
       made. The default data sockets are (U+4) and (U+5) where U is the
       socket number used in the TELNET ICP and the TELNET connections
       are on sockets (U+2) and (U+3).

<span class="grey">The File Transfer Protocol                                  July 8, 1972</span>


       Representation Type (TYPE) - The argument is a single ASCII
       character code specifying the representation types described in
       section III.B. The following codes are assigned for type:

          A - ASCII
          I - Image
          L - Local Byte
          P - Print file in ASCII
          E - EBCDIC print file

       The default representation type is ASCII

       File Structure (STRU) - The argument is a single ASCII character
       code specifying file structure described in section III.C. The
       following codes are assigned for structure:

          F - File (no record structure)
          R - Record structure

       The default structure is File (i.e., no records).

       Transfer Mode (MODE) - The argument is a single ASCII character
       code specifying the data transfer modes described in Section
       III.C. The following codes are assigned for transfer modes:

          S - Stream (bytes, close is EOF)
          B - Block (Header with descriptor and count)
          T - Text (TELNET control mode for EOR, EOF)
          H - Hasp (specially formatted compressed data)

       The default transfer mode is Stream.

IV.A.3 FTP Service Commands.

       The FTP service commands define the file transfer or the file
       system function requested by the user. The argument of an FTP
       service command will normally be a pathname.  the syntax of
       pathnames must conform to server site conventions (with standard
       defaults applicable), except that ASCII characters must be used
       (in conformance with the TELNET Protool). The suggested default
       handling is to use the last specified device directory or file
       name, or the standard default defined for local users. The
       commands may be in any order except that a "rename from" command,
       must be followed by a "rename to" command, and some servers may
       require an "allocate" command before a "store" command. The data
       when transferred in response to FTP service commands shall always
       be over the data connection. The following commands specify FTP
       service requests:



<span class="grey">                                                               [Page 15]</span></pre>

<span class="grey">The File Transfer Protocol                                  July 8, 1972</span>


       Retrieve (RETR) - This command achieves the transfer of a copy of
       file specified in pathname, from server to user site. The status
       and contents of a file at server site shall be unaffected.

       Store (STOR) - This command achieves the transfer of a copy of
       file from user to server site. If file specified in pathname
       exists at the server site, then its contents shall be replaced by
       the contents of the file being transferred. A new file is created
       at the server site if the file specified in pathname does not
       already exist.

       Append (with create) (APPE) - This command achieves the transfer
       of data from using to serving site. If file specified in pathname
       exists at the server site, then the data transferred shall be
       appended to that file, otherwise the file specified in pathname
       shall be created at the server site.

       Rename from (RNFR) - This command specifies the file which is to
       be renamed. This command must be immediately followed by a
       "rename to" command specifying the new file pathname.

       Delete (DELE) - This command causes teh file specified in
       pathname to be deleted at the server site. If an extra level of
       protection is desired (such as the query, "Do you really wish to
       delete?"), it should be provided by the user-FTP process.

       List (LIST) - This command causes a list to be sent from server
       to user site. If pathname specifies a directory, the server
       should transfer a list of files in the specified directory. If
       pathname specifies a file then server should send current
       information on the file. This command may be used to obtain the
       contents of a file directory (the response should be sent in
       ASCII type) or test the existence of a file and its current
       status.

       Allocate (ALLO) - This command my be required by some servers to
       reserve sufficient storage to accomodate the new file to be
       transferred. The command field shall be a decimal integer
       representing the number of bytes (of size specified by the byte
       size command) of storage to be reserved for the file. This
       command shall be followed by a store or append command. The ALLO
       command should be treated as a NO-OP (no operation) by thuse
       servers which do not require that the maximum size of the file be
       declared beforehand.

       Restart (REST) - The argument field represents the server marker
       at which file transfer is to be restarted. This command does not
       cause file transfer but "spaces" over the file to the specified



<span class="grey">                                                               [Page 16]</span></pre>

       data checkpoint. This command shall be immediately followed by
       the appropriate FTP service command which shall cause file
       transfer to resume.

       Status (STAT) - This command shall cause a status response to be
       sent over the TELNET connection in form of a reply.  The command
       may have an argument field such as a pathname.  if the argument
       is a pathname, the command is analogous to the "list" command
       except that data shall be transferred in ASCII on the TELNET
       connection. If no argument is specified, the server should return
       general status information about the server FTP process. This may
       include service availability, the current settings for the
       relevant FTP parameters (including default settings), and the
       status of command execution and connections.

       Abort (ABOR) - This command indicates to the server to abort the
       previous FTP service command and any associated transfer of data.
       The abort command should be preceded by the TELNET SYNCH
       condition (indicated by the combination of the DATA MARK and the
       INS). No action is to be taken if the previous command has been
       completed (including data transfer). The TELNET connections is
       not to be closed by the server, but the data connection may be
       closed. An appropriate reply should be sent by the server.

       Logout (BYE) - This command terminates a USER and if file
       transfer is not in progress, closes the TELNET connection.  If
       file transfer is in progress, the connection will remain open for
       result response and will then close.  During the interim a new
       USER command (and no other command) is acceptable.

       An unexpected close on TELNET connection will cause the server to
       take the effective action of an abort (ABOR) and a logout (BYE).

IV.B FTP Replies

    The server sends FTP replies to user over the TELNET
connections in response to FTP commands. The FTP replies constitute the
acknowledgement or completion code (including errors). The FTP-server
replies are formatted for human or program interpretation. The replies
consist of a leading three digit numeric code followed by a space
followed by a text explanation of the code. The numeric codes are
assigned by groups and for ease of interpretation by programs in a
manner consistent with other protocols such as the RJE protocol. The
three digits of the code are to be interpredet as follows:







<span class="grey">                                                               [Page 17]</span></pre>

<span class="grey">The File Transfer Protocol                                  July 8, 1972</span>


a) The first digit specifies type of response as indicated below:

   000 These replies are purely informative and constitute
       neither a positive nor a negative acknowledgement.

   1xx informative replies to status inrequiries. These constitute
       a positive acknowledgment to the status command.

   2xx Positive acknowledgment of previous command or other
       successful action.

   3xx Incomplete information. Activity cannot proceed without
       further specification and input.

   4xx Unsuccessful reply. The request is correctly specified
       but the server is unsuccessful in corretly fulfilling
       it.

   5xx Incorrect or illegal command. The command or its
       parameters were invalid or incomplete from a syntactic
       viewpoint, or the command its inconsistent with a previous
       command. The command in question has been completely
       ignored.

   6xx - 9xx Reserved for future expansion.

b) The second digit specifies the general category to which
   the response refers:

   x00-x29 General purpose replies, not assignable to other
       categories.

   x30 Primary access. Informative replies to the "log-on"
       attempt.

   x40 Secondary access. The primary server is commenting on its
       ability to access a secondary service.

   x5x FTP results.

   x6x RJE resutls.

   x7x-x9x Reserved for future expansion.

c) the final digit specifies a particular message type. Since the code
is designed for an automaton process to interpret, it is not necessary
for every variation of a reply to have a unique number. Only the basic
meaning of replies need have unique numbers. The text of a reply can
explain the specific reason for that reply to a human user.

    Each TELNET line (ended by CRLF) from the server is intended
to be a complete reply message. if it is necessary to continue the text
of a reply onto following lines, then those continuation replies contain
the special reply code of three spaces. It should be noted that text of
replies are intended for a human user. Only the reply codes and in some
instances the first line of text are intended for programs.

    The assigned reply codes relating to FTP are:

V.A. Connections

    The server-FTP process at the server site shall "listen" on
Socket 3, via its server-TELNET. The user or user-FTP process at the
user site shall initiate the full-duplex TELNET connections via its
user-TELNET performing the ARPANET standard initial connection protocol
(ICP) to server socket 3. The TELNET connections shall be closed by the
user site upon completion of use.

    The user site shall "listen" on the specified data socket or
sockets (a send and/or a receive socket). The server site shall initiate
the data connection using the specified data socket and byte size. The
direction of data connection and the data socket used shall be
determined by the FTP service command. The server shall send a reply to
the user indicating the server data socket so that the user may ensure
the security of data transfer. This can be done at any time prior to the
first transfer of data over a data connection.

    The data connection shall be closed by the server site under
the conditions described is Section III.A. The server should in general
send a reply before closing the data connection to avoid problems at the
user end.

V.B. Commands

    The commands are ASCII character strings transmitted over
the TELNET connections as described in section IV.A. The command
functions and semantics are described in sections IV.A.1, IV.A.2,
IV.A,3, and IV.A.4. The command syntax is specified here.

<span class="grey">The File Transfer Protocol                                  July 8, 1972</span>


    The commands begin with a command code followed by an
argument field. The command codes are four of less ASCII alphabetic
characters. Upper and lower case alphabetic characters are to be treated
identically. Thus any of the following may represent the retrieve
command:

    RETR Retr retr ReTr rETr

The command codes and the argument fields are separated by one or more
spaces.

    The argument field consists of a variable length ASCII
character string ending with the character sequence CRLF (Carriage
Return immediately followed by Line Feed). In the following section on
syntax it should be stressed that all characters in the argument field
are ASCII characters. Thus a decimal integer shall mean an ASCII
represented decimal integer.

    The following are all the currently defined FTP commands:

         USER &lt;user name&gt; CRLF
         PASS &lt;password&gt; CRLF
         BYTE &lt;byte size&gt; CRLF
         SOCK &lt;HOST-socket&gt; CRLF
         TYPE &lt;type code&gt; CRLF
         STRU &lt;structure code&gt; CRLF
         MODE &lt;mode code&gt; CRLF

         APPE &lt;pathname&gt; CRLF

         STAT &lt;pathname&gt; CRLF
         ABOR &lt;empty&gt; CRLF
          Bye &lt;empty&gt; CRLF

    The syntax of the above argument fields (using BNF notation
where aplicable) is:

     &lt;username&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;
     &lt;password&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;
     &lt;string&gt; ::= &lt;empty&gt; | &lt;char&gt; | &lt;char&gt;&lt;string&gt;
     &lt;char&gt; ::= any of the 128 ASCII characters except CR and LF.
     &lt;marker&gt; ::= &lt;pr string&gt;

     &lt;empty&gt; ::= the null string (specifies use of default).

V.C Sequencing of Commands and Replies

    The communication between the user and server is intended to
be an alternating dialogue. As such, the user issues an FTP
command and the server responds with a prompt primary reply. The
user should wait for this initial primary success of failure
response before sending further commands.

    A second type of reply is sent asynchronously with respect
to user commands. These replies may for example report on the
progress or completion of file transfer and as such are secondary
replies to file transfer commands.

    The third class of replies are informational and spontaneous
replies which may arrive at any time. These replies are listed
below as spontaneous.
