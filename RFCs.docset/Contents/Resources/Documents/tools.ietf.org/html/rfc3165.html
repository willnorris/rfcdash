<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that allow the
   delegation of management scripts to distributed managers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20The%20SNMP%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  The SNMP Management Framework</span>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in <a href="rfc2571.html">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="rfc1155.html" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>RFC1155</a>], STD 16, <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="rfc1212.html" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>RFC1212</a>] and <a href="rfc1215.html">RFC 1215</a>
      [<a href="rfc1215.html" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>RFC1215</a>].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
      58, <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="rfc2578.html" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="rfc2579.html" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC</a>
      <a href="rfc2580.html">2580</a> [<a href="rfc2580.html" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="rfc1157.html" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>].  A second version of the
      SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   The Script MIB module defined in this memo can be used to delegate
   management functions to distributed managers.  Management functions
   are defined as management scripts written in a management scripting
   language.  This MIB makes no assumptions about the language itself
   and even allows distribution of compiled native code, if an
   implementation is able to execute native code under the control of
   this MIB.

   The Script MIB defines a standard interface for the delegation of
   management functions based on the Internet management framework.  In
   particular, it provides the following capabilities:

   1. Capabilities to transfer management scripts to a distributed
      manager.

   2. Capabilities for initiating, suspending, resuming and terminating
      management scripts.

   3. Capabilities to transfer arguments for management scripts.

   4. Capabilities to monitor and control running management scripts.

   5. Capabilities to transfer the results produced by running
      management scripts.

   This memo does not address any additional topics like the generation
   of notifications or how to address remote agents from a Script MIB
   implementation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Terms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Terms</span>

   This section defines the terms used throughout this memo.

   o  A `distributed manager' is a processing entity which is capable of
      performing network management functions.  For the scope of this
      memo, a distributed manager is assumed to implement the Script
      MIB.

   o  A `higher-level manager', or just `manager', is a processing
      entity or human who initiates and controls the operations
      performed by one or more distributed managers.

   o  A `management script' is a set of instructions written in an
      executable language which implements a management function.

   o  A `management scripting language' is a language used to write
      management scripts.  The term scripting language does not imply
      that the language must have the characteristics of scripting
      languages (e.g., string orientation, interpretation, weak typing).
      The MIB defined in this memo also allows to control management
      scripts written in arbitrary compiled system programming
      languages.

   o  A `distributed manager' can be decomposed into an `SNMP entity'
      which implements the Script MIB defined in this memo and the `
      runtime system' that executes scripts.  The Script MIB sees the
      runtime system as the managed resource which is controlled by the
      MIB.

      The runtime system can act as an SNMP application, according to
      the SNMP architecture defined in <a href="rfc2571.html">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].  For example,
      a runtime system which sends SNMP requests to other SNMP entities
      will act as a command generator application.  The SNMP
      applications in the runtime system may use the same SNMP engine
      which also serves the command responder application used to
      implement the Script MIB, but they are not required to do so.

   o  A `launch button' is the conceptual button used to start the
      execution of a management script.  It assigns control parameters
      to a management script.  In particular, it defines the ownership
      of the scripts started from a launch button.  The ownership can be
      used by the language runtime system to enforce security profiles
      on a running management script.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Requirements%20and%20Design%20Issues"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Requirements and Design Issues</span>

   This section discusses some general requirements that have influenced
   the design of the Script MIB.

   o  The Script MIB must not make any assumptions about specific
      languages or runtime systems.

   o  The Script MIB must provide mechanisms that help to avoid new
      management problems (e.g., script version problems).

   o  The Script MIB must provide SNMP interfaces to all functions
      required to delegate management scripts.  However, other protocols
      might be used in addition if they provide a significant
      improvement in terms of convenience for implementation or
      performance.

   o  The Script MIB must be organized so that access can be controlled
      effectively by using view-based access control [<a href="rfc2575.html" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>].

   The following sections discuss some design issues in more detail.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Script%20Languages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Script Languages</span>

   The Script MIB defined in this memo makes no assumption about the
   script language.  This MIB can therefore be used in combination with
   different languages (such as Tcl or Java) and/or different versions
   of the same language.  No assumptions are made about the format in
   which management scripts are transferred.

   The Script MIB provides access to information about the language
   versions supported by a Script MIB implementation so that a manager
   can learn about the capabilities provided by an implementation.
   Languages and language versions are identified as follows:

   1. The language is identified by an object identifier.  Object
      identifier for well-known languages will be registered by the
      Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  Enterprise specific
      languages can also be registered in the enterprise specific OID
      subtree.

   2. A particular version of a language is identified by a language
      version number.  The combination of a language object identifier
      and a language version is in most cases sufficient to decide
      whether a script can be executed or not.






<span class="grey">Levi &amp; Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-7" id="page-7" name="page-7"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3165.html">RFC 3165</a>                       Script MIB                    August 2001</span>


   3. Different implementations of the same language version might have
      differences due to ambiguities in the language definition or
      additional language features provided by an implementor.  An
      additional object identifier value is provided which identifies
      the organization which provides the implementation of a language.
      This might be used by scripts that require a particular
      implementation of a language.

   4. Finally, there might be different versions of a language
      implementation.  A version number for the language implementation
      is provided so that the manager can also distinguish between
      different implementations from the same organization of a
      particular language version.

   The version numbers can either be used by a manager to select the
   language version required to execute a particular script or to select
   a script that fits the language versions supported by a particular
   Script MIB implementation.

   An additional table lists language extensions that provide features
   not provided by the core language.  Language extensions are usually
   required to turn a general purpose language into a management
   language.  In many cases, language extensions will come in the form
   of libraries that provide capabilities like sending SNMP requests to
   remote SNMP agents or accessing the local MIB instrumentation.  Every
   extension is associated with a language and carries its own version
   numbers.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Script%20Transfer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Script Transfer</span>

   There are two different ways to transfer management scripts to a
   distributed manager.  The first approach requires that the manager
   pushes the script to the distributed manager.  This is therefore
   called the `push model'.  The second approach is the `pull model'
   where the manager tells the distributed manager the location of the
   script and the distributed manager retrieves the script itself.

   The MIB defined in this memo supports both models.  The `push model'
   is realized by a table which allows a manager to write scripts by
   sending a sequence of SNMP set requests.  The script can be split
   into several fragments in order to deal with SNMP message size
   limitations.

   The `pull model' is realized by the use of Uniform Resource Locators
   (URLs) [<a href="rfc2396.html" title='" Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC2396</a>] that point to the script source.  The manager writes
   the URL which points to the script source to the distributed manager





<span class="grey">Levi &amp; Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                     [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-8" id="page-8" name="page-8"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3165.html">RFC 3165</a>                       Script MIB                    August 2001</span>


   by sending an SNMP set request.  The distributed manager is then
   responsible for retrieving the document using the protocol specified
   in the URL.  This allows the use of protocols like FTP [<a href="rfc959.html" title='"File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC959</a>] or
   HTTP [<a href="rfc2616.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>] to transfer large management scripts efficiently.

   The Script MIB also allows management scripts that are hard-wired
   into the Script MIB implementation.  Built-in scripts can either be
   implemented in a language runtime system, or they can be built
   natively into the Script MIB implementation.  The implementation of
   the `push model' or the `pull model' is not required.

   Scripts can be stored in non-volatile storage.  This allows a
   distributed manager to restart scripts if it is restarted (off-line
   restart).  A manager is not required to push scripts back into the
   distributed manager after a restart if the script is backed up in
   non-volatile storage.

   Every script is identified by an administratively assigned name.
   This name may be used to derive the name which is used to access the
   script in non-volatile storage.  This mapping is implementation
   specific.  However, the mapping must ensure that the Script MIB
   implementation can handle scripts with the same administrative name
   owned by different managers.  One way to achieve this is to use the
   script owner in addition to the script name in order to derive the
   internal name used to refer to a particular script in non-volatile
   storage.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Script%20Execution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Script Execution</span>

   The Script MIB permits execution of several instances of the same or
   different management scripts.  Script arguments are passed as OCTET
   STRING values.  Scripts return a single result value which is also an
   OCTET STRING value.  The semantic interpretation of result values is
   left to the invoking manager or other management scripts.  A script
   invoker must understand the format and semantics of both the
   arguments and the results of the scripts that it invokes.

   Scripts can also export complex results through a MIB interface.
   This allows a management application to access and use script results
   in the same manner as it processes any other MIB data.  However, the
   Script MIB does not provide any special support for the
   implementation of MIBs through scripts.

   Runtime errors terminate active scripts.  An exit code and a human
   readable error message is left in the MIB.  A notification containing
   the exit code, the error message and a timestamp is generated when a
   script terminates with an error exit code.

   Script arguments and results do not have any size limitations other
   than the limits imposed by the SMI and the SNMP protocol.  However,
   implementations of this MIB might have further restrictions.  A
   script designer might therefore choose to return the results via
   other mechanisms if the script results can be very large.  One
   possibility is to return a URL as a script result which points to the
   file containing the script output.

   Executing scripts have a status object attached which allows script
   execution to be suspended, resumed, or aborted.  The precise
   semantics of the suspend and resume operations are language and
   runtime system dependent.  Some runtime systems may choose to not
   implement the suspend/resume operations.

   A history of finished scripts is kept in the MIB.  A script invoker
   can collect results at a later point in time (offline operation).
   Control objects can be used to control how entries in the history are
   aged out if the table fills up.

   This section presents the structure of the MIB.  The objects are
   arranged into the following groups:

   o  language group (smLangTable, smExtsnTable)

   o  script group (smScriptTable)

   o  script code group (smCodeTable)

   o  script launch group (smLaunchTable)

   o  running script group (smRunTable)

   The smLanguageGroup is used to provide information about the
   languages and the language extensions supported by a Script MIB
   implementation.  This group includes two tables.  The smLangTable
   lists all languages supported by a Script MIB implementation and the
   smExtsnTable lists the extensions that are available for a given
   language.

   The smScriptGroup consists of a single table, called the
   smScriptTable.  The smScriptTable lists all scripts known to a Script
   MIB implementation.  The smScriptTable contains objects that allow
   the following operations:

   o  download scripts from a URL (pull model)

   o  read scripts from local non-volatile storage

   o  store scripts in local non-volatile storage

   o  delete scripts from local non-volatile storage

   o  list permanent scripts (that can not be changed or removed)

   o  read and modify the script status (enabled, disabled, editing)

   A status object called smScriptOperStatus allows a manager to obtain
   the current status of a script.  It is also used to provide an error
   indication if an attempt to invoke one of the operations listed above
   fails.  The status change of a script can be requested by modifying
   the associated smScriptAdminStatus object.

   The source of a script is defined by the smScriptSource object.  This
   object may contain a URL pointing to a remote location which provides
   access to the management script.  The script source is read from the
   smCodeTable (described below) or from non-volatile storage if the
   smScriptSource object contains an empty URL.  The smScriptStorageType
   object is used to distinguish between scripts read from non-volatile
   storage and scripts read from the smCodeTable.

   Scripts are automatically loaded once the smScriptAdminStatus object
   is set to `enabled'.  Loading a script includes retrieving the script
   (probably from a remote location), compiling the script for languages
   that require a compilation step, and making the code available to the
   runtime system.  The smScriptOperStatus object is used to indicate
   the status of the loading process.  This object will start in the
   state `retrieving', switch to the state `compiling' and finally reach
   the state `enabled'.  Errors during the retrieval or compilation
   phase will result in an error state such as `compilationFailed'.

   The smCodeGroup consists of a single table, called the smCodeTable,
   which provides the ability to transfer and modify scripts via SNMP
   set requests.  In particular, the smCodeTable allows the following
   operations:

   o  download scripts via SNMP (push model)

   o  modify scripts via SNMP (editing)

   The smCodeTable lists the code of a script.  A script can be
   fragmented over multiple rows of the smCodeTable in order to handle
   SNMP message size limitations.  Modifications of the smCodeTable are
   only possible if the associated smScriptOperStatus object has the
   value `editing'.  The Script MIB implementation reloads the modified
   script code once the smScriptOperStatus changes to `enabled' again.

   The implementation of the smCodeGroup is optional.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.%20%20Launch%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" name="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Launch Group</span>

   The smLaunchGroup contains a single table, the smLaunchTable.  An
   entry in the smLaunchTable represents a launch button which can be
   used to start a script.  The smLaunchTable allows the following
   operations:

   o  associate a script with an owner used during script execution

   o  provide arguments and parameters for script invocation

   o  invoke scripts with a single set operation

   The smLaunchTable describes scripts and their parameters that are
   ready to be launched.  An entry in the smLaunchTable attaches an
   argument to a script and control values which, for example, define
   the maximum number of times that a script invoked from a particular
   row in the smLaunchTable may be running concurrently.

   An entry in the smLaunchTable also defines the owner which will be
   used to associate permissions with the script execution.

   The smRunGroup contains a single table, called the smRunTable, which
   lists all scripts that are currently running or have terminated
   recently.  The smRunTable contains objects that allow the following
   operations:

   o  control running scripts (suspend, resume, abort)

   o  retrieve results from recently terminated scripts

   o  control the remaining maximum lifetime of a running script

   o  control how long script results are accessible

   Every row in the smRunTable contains the argument passed during
   script invocation, the result produced by the script and the script
   exit code.  The smRunTable also provides information about the
   current run state as well as start and end time-stamps.  There are
   three writable objects in the smRunTable.  The smRunLifeTime object
   defines the maximum time a running script may run before it is
   terminated by the Script MIB implementation.  The smRunExpireTime
   object defines the time that a completed script can stay in the
   smRunTable before it is aged out.  The smRunControl object allows
   running scripts to be suspended, resumed, or aborted.

       DESCRIPTION
           "This MIB module defines a set of objects that allow to
            delegate management scripts to distributed managers."
       REVISION    "200108210000Z"
       DESCRIPTION
           "Revised version, published as <a href="rfc3165.html">RFC 3165</a>.

            This revision introduces several new objects: smScriptError,
            smScriptLastChange, smLaunchError, smLaunchLastChange,
            smLaunchRowExpireTime, smRunResultTime, and smRunErrorTime.

            The following existing objects were updated: the maximum
            value of smRunLifeTime now disables the timer, an
            autostart value was added to the smLaunchAdminStatus
            object, and a new expired state was added to the
            smLaunchOperStatus object.

            A new smScriptException notification has been added to
            support runtime error notifications.

            Created new conformance and compliance statements that
            take care of the new objects and notifications.

            Clarifications have been added in several places to remove
            ambiguities or contradictions that were discovered and
            reported by implementors."

            - `enabled' indicates that the script is available and can
               be started by a launch table entry.

            - `editing' indicates that the script can be modified in the
              smCodeTable.

            - `retrieving' indicates that the script is currently being
              loaded from non-volatile storage or a remote system.

            - `compiling' indicates that the script is currently being
              compiled by the runtime system.

            - `noSuchScript' indicates that the script does not exist
              at the smScriptSource.

            - `accessDenied' indicates that the script can not be loaded
              from the smScriptSource due to a lack of permissions.

            - `wrongLanguage' indicates that the script can not be
               loaded from the smScriptSource because of a language
               mismatch.

            - `wrongVersion' indicates that the script can not be loaded
              from the smScriptSource because of a language version
              mismatch.

            - `compilationFailed' indicates that the compilation failed.

            - `noResourcesLeft' indicates that the runtime system does
              not have enough resources to load the script.

            - `unknownProtocol' indicates that the script could not be
              loaded from the smScriptSource because the requested
              protocol is not supported.

            - `protocolFailure' indicates that the script could not be

            non-volatile or permanent storage.

            The storage type of this row always complies with the value
            of this entry if the value of the corresponding RowStatus
            object is `active'.

            However, the storage type of the script controlled by this
            row may be different, if the value of this entry is
            `non-volatile'. The script controlled by this row is written
            into local non-volatile storage if the following condition

            (a) the URL contained in the smScriptSource object is empty

                and
            (c) the smScriptOperStatus is `enabled'

            Setting this object to `volatile' removes a script from
            non-volatile storage if the script controlled by this row
            has been in non-volatile storage before. Attempts to set
            this object to permanent will always fail with an
            inconsistentValue error.

            The value of smScriptStorageType is only meaningful if the
            value of the corresponding RowStatus object is `active'.

       DESCRIPTION
           "This object is used to start the execution of scripts.
            When retrieved, the value will be the value of smRunIndex
            for the last script that started execution by manipulating
            this object. The value will be zero if no script started
            execution yet.

            A script is started by setting this object to an unused
            smRunIndex value. A new row in the smRunTable will be
            created which is indexed by the value supplied by the
            set-request in addition to the value of smLaunchOwner and
            smLaunchName. An unused value can be obtained by reading
            the smLaunchRunIndexNext object.

            Setting this object to the special value 0 will start
            the script with a self-generated smRunIndex value. The
            consequence is that the script invoker has no reliable
            way to determine the smRunIndex value for this script
            invocation and that the invoker has therefore no way
            to obtain the results from this script invocation. The
            special value 0 is however useful for scheduled script
            invocations.

            If this object is set, the following checks must be

            performed:

            1) The value of the smLaunchOperStatus object in this
               entry of the smLaunchTable must be `enabled'.
            2) The values of smLaunchScriptOwner and
               smLaunchScriptName of this row must identify an
               existing entry in the smScriptTable.
            3) The value of smScriptOperStatus of this entry must
               be `enabled'.
            4) The principal performing the set operation must have
               read access to the script. This must be checked by
               calling the isAccessAllowed abstract service interface
               defined in <a href="rfc2271.html">RFC 2271</a> on the row in the smScriptTable
               identified by smLaunchScriptOwner and smLaunchScriptName.
               The isAccessAllowed abstract service interface must be
               called on all columnar objects in the smScriptTable with
               a MAX-ACCESS value different than `not-accessible'. The
               test fails as soon as a call indicates that access is
               not allowed.
            5) If the value provided by the set operation is not 0,
               a check must be made that the value is currently not
               in use. Otherwise, if the value provided by the set
               operation is 0, a suitable unused value must be
               generated.
            6) The number of currently executing scripts invoked
               from this smLaunchTable entry must be less than
               smLaunchMaxRunning.

            Attempts to start a script will fail with an
            inconsistentValue error if one of the checks described
            above fails.

            Otherwise, if all checks have been passed, a new entry
            in the smRunTable will be created indexed by smLaunchOwner,
            smLaunchName and the new value for smRunIndex. The value
            of smLaunchArgument will be copied into smRunArgument,
            the value of smLaunchLifeTime will be copied to
            smRunLifeTime, and the value of smLaunchExpireTime
            will be copied to smRunExpireTime.

            The smRunStartTime will be set to the current time and
            the smRunState will be set to `initializing' before the
            script execution is initiated in the appropriate runtime
            system.

            Note that the data type and the range of this object must
            be consistent with the smRunIndex object. Since this
            object might be written from the scheduling MIB, the

   This section presents some examples that explain how a manager can
   use the Script MIB defined in this memo.  The purpose of these
   examples is to explain the steps that are normally used to delegate
   management scripts.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.%20%20Pushing%20a%20Script%20via%20SNMP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Pushing a Script via SNMP</span>

   This example explains the steps performed by a manager to push a
   script into a distributed manager.

   1. The manager first checks the smLangTable and the smExtsnTable in
      order to select the appropriate script or language.

   2. The manager creates a row in the smScriptTable by issuing an SNMP
      set-request.  The smScriptRowStatus object is set to
      `createAndWait' and the smScriptSource object is set to an empty
      string.  The smScriptLanguage object is set to the language in
      which the script was written.  The smScriptStorageType object is
      set to `volatile' to indicate that the script will be loaded via
      the smCodeTable.  The smScriptOwner is set to a string which
      identifies the principal who owns the new row.  The smScriptName
      defines the administratively assigned unique name for the script.

   3. The manager sets the smScriptRowStatus object to `active' and the
      smScriptAdminStatus object to `editing'.

   4. The manager pushes the script to the distributed manager by
      issuing a couple of SNMP set-requests to fill the smCodeTable.

   5. Once the whole script has been transferred, the manager sends a
      set-request to set the smScriptAdminStatus object to `enabled'.
      The Script MIB implementation now makes the script accessible to
      the runtime system.  This might include the compilation of the
      script if the language requires a compilation step.

   6. The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value is
      either `enabled' or one of the error status codes.  The script can
      only be used if the value of smScriptOperStatus is `enabled'.

   7. If the manager wants to store the script in local non-volatile
      storage, it should send a set-request which changes the
      smScriptStorageType object to `nonVolatile'.

   This example explains the steps performed by a manager to cause a
   distributed manager to pull a script from a URL.

   1. The manager first checks the smLangTable and the smExtsnTable in
      order to select the appropriate script or language.

   2. The manager creates a row in the smScriptTable by issuing an SNMP
      set-request.  The smScriptRowStatus object is set to
      `createAndWait' and the smScriptSource object is set to the URL
      which points to the script source.  The smScriptLanguage object is
      set to the language in which the script was written.  The
      smScriptOwner is set to a string which identifies the principal
      who owns the new row.  The smScriptName defines the
      administratively assigned unique name for the script.

   3. The manager sets the smScriptRowStatus object to `active'.

   4. The manager sends a set-request to set the smScriptAdminStatus
      object to `enabled'.  The Script MIB implementation now makes the
      script accessible to the runtime system.  This causes a retrieval
      operation to pull the script from the URL stored in
      smScriptSource.  This retrieval operation might be followed by a
      compile operation if the language requires a compilation step.

   5. The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value is
      either `enabled' or one of the error status codes.  The script can
      only be used if the value of smScriptOperStatus is `enabled'.

   6. If the manager wants to store the script in local non-volatile
      storage, it should send a set-request which changes the
      smScriptStorageType object to `nonVolatile'.

   This section explains how a manager can modify a script by sending
   SNMP set-requests.

   1. First, the script is de-activated by setting the
      smScriptAdminStatus to `disabled'.

   2. The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value is
      `disabled'.

   3. The manager sets smScriptSource to an empty string and
      smScriptAdminStatus to `editing'.  This makes the script source
      available in the smCodeTable.

   4. The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value is
      `editing'.

   5. The manager sends SNMP set-requests to modify the script in the
      smCodeTable.

   6. The manager sends a set-request to set the smScriptAdminStatus
      object to `enabled'.  The Script MIB implementation now makes the
      script accessible to the runtime system.  This might include the
      compilation of the script if the language requires a compilation
      step.

   7. The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value is

      only be used if the value of smScriptOperStatus is `enabled'.

   This section explains how a manager can remove a script from a
   distributed manager.

   1. First, the manager sets the smScriptAdminStatus to `disabled'.
      This will ensure that no new scripts can be started while running
      scripts finish their execution.

   2. The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value is
      `disabled'.

   3. The manager sends an SNMP set-request to change the
      smScriptRowStatus object to `destroy'.  This will remove the row
      and all associated resources from the Script MIB implementation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.5.%20%20Creating%20a%20Launch%20Button"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.5" name="section-7.5">7.5</a>.  Creating a Launch Button</span>

   This section explains how a manager can create a launch button for
   starting a script.

   1. The manager, who is identified by an smLaunchOwner value, first
      chooses a name for the new row in the smLaunchTable.  The manager
      sends an SNMP set-request to set the smLaunchRowStatus object for
      this smLaunchOwner and smLaunchName to `createAndWait'.

   2. The manager fills the new smLaunchTable row with all required
      parameters.  The smLaunchScriptOwner and smLaunchScriptName values
      point to the script that should be started from this launch
      button.

   3. The manager sets the smLaunchRowStatus object to `active'.

   4. The manager sends a set-request to change smLaunchAdminStatus to
      `enabled' once the new smLaunchTable row is complete.

   5. The manager polls the smLaunchOperStatus object until the value is
      `enabled'.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.6.%20%20Launching%20a%20Script"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.6" name="section-7.6">7.6</a>.  Launching a Script</span>

   This section explains the suggested way to launch a script from a
   given launch button.

   1. The manager first retrieves the value of smLaunchRunIndexNext from
      the launch button selected to start the script.

   2. The manager sends an SNMP set-request to set the smLaunchStart
      object to the value obtained in step 1.  This will launch the
      script if all necessary pre-conditions are satisfied (see the
      definition of smLaunchStart for more details).  The manager can
      also provide the smLaunchArgument in the same set-request that is
      used to start the script.  Upon successful start, a new row will
      be created in the smRunTable indexed by smLaunchOwner,
      smLaunchName and the value written to smLaunchStart.

   3. The manager polls the smRunState object until the value is either
      `executing' (the default case), `suspended' or `terminated'.

   The first step is not required.  A manager can also try to guess an
   unused value for smRunIndex if the manager wants to start the script
   in a single transaction.  A manager can also use the special value 0
   if it does not care about the smRunIndex.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.7.%20%20Suspending%20a%20Running%20Script"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.7" name="section-7.7">7.7</a>.  Suspending a Running Script</span>

   This section explains how a manager can suspend a running script.

   1. The manager sets the smRunControl object of the running script or
      the smLaunchControl object of the launch button used to start the
      running script to `suspend'.  Setting smLaunchControl will suspend
      all running scripts started from the launch button while
      smRunControl will only suspend the running script associated with
      the smRunControl instance.

   2. The manager polls the smRunState object until the value is either
      `suspended', `executing', or `terminated'.  If the value is

      failed.  The value `terminated' can be received in cases where the
      suspend operation failed and the running script terminated between
      the polls.

   Note that the set operation in the first step can lead to an

   failed (e.g., because the runtime system does not support
   suspend/resume).  There is no need to poll smRunState in this case.

   This section explains how a manager can resume a suspended script.

   1. The manager sets the smRunControl object of the running script or
      the smLaunchControl object of the launch button used to start the
      running script to `resume'.  Setting smLaunchControl will resume
      all running scripts started from the launch button while
      smRunControl will only resume the running script associated with
      the smRunControl instance.

   2. The manager polls the smRunState object until the value is either
      `suspended', `executing', or `terminated'.  If the value is
      `executing', then the resume operation was successful.  If the
      value is `suspended', then the attempt to resume the script
      failed.  The value `terminated' can be received in cases where the
      resume operation was successful and the running script terminated
      between the polls.

   Note that the set operation in the first step can lead to an
   inconsistentValue error which indicates that the resume operation
   failed (e.g., because the runtime system does not support
   suspend/resume).  There is no need to poll smRunState in this case.

   This section explains two ways to terminate a running script.  The
   first approach is as follows:

   1. The manager sets the smRunControl object of the running script or
      the smLaunchControl object of the launch button used to start the
      running script to `abort'.  Setting smLaunchControl will abort all
      running scripts started from the launch button while smRunControl
      will only abort the running script associated with the
      smRunControl instance.

   2. The manager polls the smRunState object until the value is
      `terminated'.

   The second way to terminate a script is to set the smRunLifeTime to
   zero which causes the runtime system to terminate the script with a
   `lifeTimeExceeded' exit code:

   1. The manager changes the value of smRunLifeTime to 0.  This causes
      the Script MIB implementation to abort the script because the
      remaining life time has expired.

   2. The manager polls the smRunState object until the value is
      `terminated'.

   Note that changing the smRunLifeTime value can also be used to
   increase the permitted lifetime of a running script.  For example, a
   manager can choose to set smRunLifeTime to a small fixed time
   interval and increase the value periodically.  This strategy has the
   nice effect that scripts terminate automatically if the manager loses
   contact with the Script MIB engine.

   This section explains how a manager can remove a terminated script.

   1. The manager changes the smRunExpireTime to 0.  This causes the
      Script MIB implementation to destroy the smRunTable entry of the
      terminated script.

   This section explains how a manager can remove a launch button from a
   distributed manager.

   1. First, the manager sets the smLaunchAdminStatus to `disabled'.
      This will ensure that no new scripts can be started from this
      launch button while running scripts finish their execution.

   2. The manager polls the smLaunchOperStatus object until the value is
      `disabled'.

   3. The manager sends an SNMP set-request to change the
      smLaunchRowStatus object to `destroy'.  This will remove the row
      and all associated resources from the Script MIB implementation.

   The first example demonstrates how to configure VACM to give the
   members of the VACM group "guest" limited access to the Script MIB.
   The MIB views defined below give the members of the "guest" group a
   sandbox where they can install and start their own scripts, but not
   access any other scripts maintained by the Script MIB implementation.

      vacmAccessReadView."guest"."".usm.authNoPriv = "guestReadView"
      vacmAccessWriteView."guest"."".usm.authNoPriv = "guestWriteView"

   The guestReadView grants read access to the smLangTable, the
   smExtsnTable and to all the table entries owned by "guest":

      guestReadView:
          smLangTable                       (included)
          smExtsnTable                      (included)
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."guest"     (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."guest"        (included)

   The guestWriteView grants write access to all the table entries owned
   by "guest":

      guestWriteView:
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."guest"     (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."guest"        (included)

   This example demonstrates how VACM can be used to share a repository
   of scripts between the members of the "senior" and the members of the
   "junior" VACM group:

      vacmAccessReadView."junior"."".usm.authNoPriv = "juniorReadView"

      juniorReadView:

          smRunObjects.*.*.*."junior"       (included)
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."utils"     (included)

      juniorWriteView:
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."junior"    (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."junior"       (included)

   The definitions above allow the members of the "junior" VACM group to
   start the scripts owned by "utils" in addition to the script the
   members of the "junior" VACM group installed themselves.  This is
   accomplished by giving the members of "junior" read access to scripts
   in "utils".  This allows members of "junior" to create entries in the
   smLaunchTable which refer to scripts in "utils", and to launch those
   scripts using these entries in the smLaunchTable.

      vacmAccessReadView."senior"."".usm.authNoPriv = "seniorReadView"
      vacmAccessWriteView."senior"."".usm.authNoPriv = "seniorWriteView"

      seniorReadView:
          smLangTable                       (included)

          smRunObjects.*.*.*."senior"       (included)
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."utils"     (included)

   The definitions for the members of the "senior" VACM group allow to
   start the scripts owned by "utils" in addition to the script the
   members of the "senior" VACM group installed themself.  The third
   write access rule in the seniorWriteView also grants the permission
   to install scripts owned by "utils".  The members of the "senior"
   VACM group therefore have the permissions to install and modify
   scripts that can be called by the members of the "junior" VACM group.

   This example demonstrates how VACM can be used to allow the members
   of the "junior" VACM group to launch scripts that are executed with
   the permissions associated with the "emergency" owner.  This works by
   adding the following rules to the juniorReadView and the
   juniorWriteView:

      juniorReadView:
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."emergency" (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."emergency"    (included)

   The rules added to the juniorReadView grant read access to the
   scripts, the launch buttons and the results owned by "emergency".
   The rules added to the juniorWriteView grant write permissions to the
   smLaunchStart and smLaunchArgument variables owned by "emergency".
   Members of the "junior" VACM group can therefore start scripts that
   will execute under the owner "emergency".

      seniorReadView:
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."emergency" (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."emergency"    (included)

      seniorWriteView:

          smRunObjects.*.*.*."emergency"    (included)

   The rules added to the seniorReadView and the seniorWriteView will
   give the members of the "senior" VACM group the rights to install
   emergency scripts and to configure appropriate launch buttons.

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for
   maintaining a MIB module (IANA-LANGUAGE-MIB) which provides OID
   registrations for well-known languages.  The IANA language registry
   is intended to reduce interoperability problems by providing a single
   list of well-known languages.  However, it is of course still
   possible to register languages in private OID spaces.  Registering
   languages in private OID spaces is especially attractive if a
   language is used for experimentation or if a language is only used in
   environments where the distribution of MIB modules with the language
   registration does not cause any maintenance problems.

   Any additions or changes to the list of languages registered via IANA
   require Designated Expert Review as defined in the IANA guidelines
   [<a href="rfc2434.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>RFC2434</a>].  The Designated Expert will be selected by the IESG Area
   Director for the IETF Operations and Management Area.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="rfc2574.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2574</a>] and the View-
   based Access Control Model <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="rfc2575.html" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

   This MIB provides the ability to distribute applications written in
   an arbitrary language to remote systems in a network.  The security
   features of the languages available in a particular implementation
   should be taken into consideration when deploying an implementation
   of this MIB.

   To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security
   administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM)
   defined in <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="rfc2575.html" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>] for tables in which multiple users may
   need to independently create or modify entries, the initial index is
   used as an "owner index".  Such an initial index has a syntax of
   SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName
   or groupName as defined in VACM, in accordance with a security
   policy.

   All entries in related tables belonging to a particular user will
   have the same value for this initial index.  For a given user's
   entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the
   information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers
   (except for the "column" subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded
   owner index.  To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of
   the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the
   value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion,
   and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask "wildcarding" the column subidentifier.
   More elaborate configurations are possible.

   The VACM access control mechanism described above provides control
   over SNMP access to Script MIB objects.  There are a number of other
   access control issues that are outside of the scope of this MIB.  For
   example, access control on URLs, especially those that use the file
   scheme, must be realized by the underlying operating system.  A
   mapping of the owner index value to a local operating system security

      script.

   -  Removed the requirement that smRunError is a zero-length string
      while the smRunExitCode has the value `noError'.

   -  Added new smScriptLastChange, smLaunchLastChange, smRunResultTime,
      and smRunErrorTime objects.

   -  Added some additional boilerplate text to the security
      considerations section.

   -  Added a new smLaunchRowExpireTime object and a new `expired' state
      to the smLaunchOperStatus object.

   -  Clarified that the smRunState object reports the actual state if
      attempts to suspend or resume scripts fail.

   -  Clarified the conditions under which set operations to
      smLaunchControl and smRunControl can lead to inconsistentValue
      errors.

   -  Added procedures for suspending/resuming/removing running scripts
      to <a href="#section-7">section 7</a>.

   -  Added text to the smScriptStorageType description to better
      highlight the difference between the storage type of the script
      row entry and the script itself.

   -  Updated the smCompliances statement to not require write access to
      the smCodeText object after row creation.

   -  Deprecated smCompliance, smScriptGroup, smLaunchGroup, smRunGroup,
      smNotificationsGroup and created smCompliance2, smScriptGroup2,
      smLaunchGroup2, smRunGroup2 and smNotificationsGroup2 that take
      care of the new objects and notifications.
