Abstract

   This document is a revision to [<a href="rfc1632.html">RFC 1632</a>]: A Revised Catalog of
   Available X.500 Implementations and is based on the results of data
   collection via a WWW home page that enabled implementors to submit
   new or updated descriptions of currently available implementations of
   X.500, including commercial products and openly available offerings.
   [<a href="rfc1632.html">RFC 1632</a>] is a revision of [<a href="rfc1292.html">RFC 1292</a>].  We contacted each
   contributor to [<a href="rfc1632.html">RFC 1632</a>] to request an update and published the URL
   of the WWW home page survey template in several mailing lists to
   encourage the submission of new product descriptions.

   This document contains detailed description of 31 X.500
   implementations - DSAs, DUAs, and DUA interfaces.

   This document catalogs currently available implementations of X.500,
   including commercial products and openly available offerings.  For
   the purposes of this survey, we classify X.500 products as,

      DSA

         A DSA is an OSI application process that provides the Directory
         functionality,

      DUA

         A DUA is an OSI application process that represents a user in
         accessing the Directory and uses the DAP to communicate with a
         DSA, and

      DUA Interface

         A DUA Interface is an application process that  represents a
         user in accessing the Directory using either DAP but supporting
         only a  subset of the DAP functionality or a protocol different
         from DAP to communicate with a  DSA or DUA.

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document contains a listing of implementations
   cross referenced by keyword.  This list should aid in identifying
   implementations that meet your criteria.

   To compile this catalog, the IDS Working Group solicited input from
   the X.500 community by publishing a URL for a set of on-line
   description forms deployed on the WWW as a home page on an InterNIC
   server. This URL

   direct input to the Integrated Directory Services (IDS) Working Group
   (ietf-ids@umich.edu) or to the authors.  IDS will produce new

   ratified.  This will be determined by the IDS chairpersons.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1%20%20Purpose"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>  Purpose</span>

   The Internet has experienced a steady growth in X.500 piloting
   activities. This document hopes to provide an easily accessible
   source of information on X.500 implementations for those who wish to
   consider X.500 technology for deploying a Directory service.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>  Scope</span>

   This document contains descriptions of both free and commercial X.500
   implementations.  It does not provide instructions on how to install,
   run, or manage these implementations.  The descriptions and indices
   are provided to make the readers aware of available options and thus
   enable more informed choices.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3%20Disclaimer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a> Disclaimer</span>

   Implementation descriptions were written by implementors and vendors,
   and not by the editors. We worked with the description authors to
   ensure uniformity and readability, but cannot guarantee the accuracy
   or completeness of the descriptions, nor the stability of the
   implementations.

   Keywords are abbreviated attributes of the X.500 implementations.
   The list of keywords defined below was derived from the
   implementation descriptions themselves.  Implementations were indexed
   by a keyword either as a result of: (1) explicit, not implied,
   reference to a particular capability in the implementation
   description text, or (2) input from the implementation description
   author(s).

NAME

   Critical Angle X.500 Enabler

   (CAIx500e)

ABSTRACT

   The X.500 Enabler product allows an LDAP-only directory server to be
   integrated into X.500 environments, by transparently converting X.500
   DAP and DSP requests into LDAP requests.

   The initial release scheduled for 4Q96 will allow for connections
   from X.500-capable clients and servers to an LDAP-capable server, and
   will support the following features:

      * LDAP version 2, as defined in <a href="rfc1777.html">RFC 1777</a>,

      * all attributes defined for LDAPv2, with the exception of
        certificates  and revocation lists,

      * X.500(1988) DAP and DSP protocols over TCP/IP (using  <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC</a>
        <a href="rfc1006.html">1006</a>),

      * the following operations: Bind (with  none or simple
        credentials), Read, Compare, List, Search, Abandon, AddEntry,
        ModifyEntry, RemoveEntry and ModifyRDN,

      * the X.500(1993) critical extensions field, to aid in
        deployments incorporating 1993 DSAs.

   This release will be available for Solaris 2.5 (SPARC and Intel) and
   Windows NT 4.0 Server (Intel).

   The product is expected to enter a public beta test period in
   September 1996.  Beta test evaluation copies will be free (limited to
   two copies per site) but will be set to expire in December 1996.

   Released versions of X.500 Enabler will be licensed per server, and
   will be distributed over the Internet.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   The X.500 enabler accepts DAP and DSP connections.

   It supports Bind (with none or simple credentials), Read, Compare,
   List, Search, Abandon, AddEntry, ModifyEntry, RemoveEntry and

   It supports the attributes and object classes defined in X.520 and
   X.521.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1993 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   The X.500 Enabler will accept connections from X.500(1993) DUAs and
   DSAs.

   It supports the X.511(1993) critical extension mechanism.

   Non-critical protocol fields which do not map onto LDAPv2 are
   ignored.

   Attribute and object classes from X.520(1993) and X.521(1993) are
   supported, including collective.  Operational attributes from X.501
   are supported, with the exception of subschema.

   As LDAPv3-based servers become available, it is expected that the
   X.500 Enabler will be upgraded to map more of the X.500(1993)
   protocol onto LDAPv3.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   [<a id="ref-RFC 1006" name="ref-RFC 1006">RFC 1006</a>] is the supported transport service.

   The product supports the object classes and attributes defined in <a href="rfc1274.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc1274.html">1274</a>.

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs

   [No information provided. -- Ed.]

INTEROPERABILITY

   The X.500 Enabler is being tested with public-domain X.500 and LDAP
   clients and servers, and with the various X.500 clients and servers
   connected to the PARADISE project, such as from the ISODE Consortium.

   Critical Angle intends to do interoperability testing with commercial
   LDAP-only servers as they become available.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   This product will be used to connect LDAP-only servers, such as
   University of Michigan's slapd, and many vendor's forthcoming
   commercial LDAP server products, into the PARADISE project directory,
   so that they can be accessed by LDAP and X.500 DUAs throughout the
   project.

NAME

   cxdua

   Chromatix, Inc.  10451 Twin Rivers Rd, Suite 265 Columbia, MD 21044

ABSTRACT

   The CXDUA is a Windows 3.1 DUA that has been derrived from a highly
   portable and flexible Unix based Administrative Directory User Agent.
   The goal of the original design was to support features to assist a
   directory administrator in managing the directory.  These features
   include a highly portable GUI, Entry Templates, Entry Lists, Batch
   Operations and Directory Control Functions.

   Both the Windows and the Unix versions support strong authentication.

   The Unix DUA has been used in various DMS and NSA pilot projects.

NAME

   DC X500

   Data Connection Ltd
   100 Church Street
   Enfield
   Middlesex
   EN2 6BQ
   UK

ABSTRACT

   DC X500 provides a truly scalable X.500 based enterprise directory
   server with the necessary architectural flexibility to enable
   integration with existing database and directory technologies.

   From a pure X.500 standpoint, DC X500 provides a full function
   state-of-the-art DSA implementation.

      * Architected from scratch according to the 1993 X.500
        standards (i.e. not a 1988 DSA with 1993 features grafted on)

      * Support for all the key X.500 OSI protocols:

         * Directory Access Protocol (DAP) for user access

         * Directory System Protocol (DSP) for distributed DSA
           comunications

         * Directory Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP) to support
           replication between servers to give improved performance
           in a distributed network

      * Support of the 1993 Basic Access Control and  Simplified
        Access Control models

      * Support for the key Internet  X.500 related standards:

         * integrated Lightweight DAP (LDAP)for DUA access

         * Madman MIBs for easy integration with SNMP

   The DC X500 architecture is based on Data Connection's underlying
   product architecture which has evolved since 1987 and includes:

         * genuine multi-threaded implementation

         * true  portability (the product is available on a range of
           operating systems e.g Windows NT, AIX, HP-UX. OS/2 etc and it
           is possible to port the core  technology to any
           hardware/software platform)

         * secure service recording for operation tracking and billing

         * support for system monitoring (both alarms and statistics)

   Key product features include:

         * Name resolution and integrated use of Search Indices based on
           2-3 trees leads to high performance operation evaluation
           (subsecond response times on  million entry DSAs)

         * Generic schema support based on 1993 concepts that allows
           customers to tailor the schema to meet their precise data
           structuing requirements

         * System recycle time is minimised (e.g. DC X500 can be backed
           up while running and  search indices are dynamically updated),
           helping achieve the goal of continuous (24x7) availability
           and high reliability.

         * No artificial software constraints are imposed resulting in a
           truly scalable product - assuming the availability of the
           necessary hardware DC X500 can be configured  to support
           millions of entries in a single DSA.

   DC X500 is certified for used within the Paradise Pilot project.  The
   product has also undergone interoperability testing at the EuroSInet
   interoperability workshops in Europe.

NAME

   DE

ABSTRACT

   DE (Directory Enquiries) is intended to be a simple-to-use DUA
   interface, suitable for the naive user, and suitable for running as a
   public access dua.  it will work on any terminal.  The user is
   presented with a series of (verbose) prompts asking for person's name
   department organization  country.  There is extensive on-line help.
   The matching algorithms are such that near matches are presented to
   the user before less good matches.

   There have been a few minor enhancements since the description in
   [<a href="rfc1632.html">RFC 1632</a>].  The power searching feature still sets DE apart from
   most other DUAs - this allows a user to search for an entry even when
   they do not know the name of the organisation in which the person
   works - you still have to specify the country.  DE also allows UFN
   style searching.  DE uses slightly different search algorithms
   depending on whether it is accessing part of the Directory mastered
   by a Quipu DSA - Quipu DSAs tend to use lots of replication and so
   encourage searching.  DE incorporates a QOS feature where it
   maintains a database of past information availability and DSA
   responsiveness.  Translations exist into at least 4 different
   languages.

   DE runs over ISODE DAP and University of Michigan LDAP.  There is a
   version of DE, called DOS-DE, which has been ported to DOS, and this
   uses LDAP.

   DE was funded by the COSINE PARADISE project, and DE is used as the
   PARADISE public access dua. You can test the software by telnet to
   directory.ja.net and logging in as dua -- no password required.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   DE tries to cater well for the general case, at the expense of not
   dealing with the less typical.  The main manifestation of this is
   that the current version does not handle searching under localities
   very well.

   It can handle photographs and reproduce sound attributes if these are
   dealt with by ancillary programs.

   Digital X.500 Directory Server Digital Equipment Corporation

   This single entry covers a number of different products

ABSTRACT

   The Digital X.500 Directory Services product set includes a directory
   server product and a variety directory user agents, as well as a
   directory synchronizer utility.

   The Digital X.500 Directory Server product provides a high
   performance DSA implemented according to the 1993 edition of the
   standard. The InfoBroker Server product extends this to provide the
   server component for LDAP and WWW user agents.  Features of these
   servers include:

         * Integrated multi-protocol support allowing concurrent DAP,
           DSP, DISP and DOP access over OSI and TCP/IP (using [RFC
           1006]) protocols.

         * Indexed database (DIB) to support high-performance searching
           and sophisticated matching including approximate match.

         * A DIB based on the 1993 edition Extended Information Models.

         * Support for chaining and referrals in support of a
           distributed DIB

         * Support for the 1993 edition Basic Access Control scheme.

         * Configurable schema based on the 1993 edition (including
           attributes, object classes, structure rules, name forms).

         * Support for 1993 edition Shadowing using the DISP and DOP
           protocol, including both incremental and on-change features
           for high performance.

         * Remote management to control DSAs and log significant events.

         * Support for the LDAP protocols using the InfoBroker Server
           product across either TCP/IP  or DECnet transport protocols.

         * A Look-up Daemon that accepts requests from Web Browsers,
           allowing access to the directory from any web browser.

         * Both X/OPEN XDS/XOM and LDAP APIs.

         * An award winning documentation set.

   The Digital X.500 Administration Facility, X.500 Information Manager
   and InfoBroker Client products provide MS-Windows, Motif and command
   line interfaces to access and manage the information stored in the
   X.500 directory, including:

         * Support for different ways of accessing the directory, either
           by browsing or searching based on an  extensible set of
           filters.

         * Support for bulk load, unload and reload of entries.

         * Driven off the same configurable schema information as the
           DSA allowing extensibility of window layouts and text to
           support customer-defined object classes and attributes.

   The Synchronizer-500 is an X.500 DUA which:

   * Enables bi-directional synchronization between X.500 and
     virtually ANY other non-X.500 directory facilitating common
     management.

   * Maps incoming data into X.500 using flexible configuration
     files

   * Facilitates creation of a multivendor electronic mail
     database, creating addresses in the appropriate syntax for
     any mail system.

   * Provides uniqueness checking on mnemonic O/R addresses,
     preventing address duplication

NAME

   DIR.X (tm) V3.1 Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG

ABSTRACT

   DIR.X V3.1 is Siemens Nixdorf's Directory Service product compliant
   with the 1988 ITU-T X.500 recommendations. Siemens Nixdorf has
   supplied its Directory Service product as the GDS (Global Directory
   Service) component to OSF DCE.  However, DIR.X V3.1 has a number of
   features and enhancements which are not available in the GDS
   component of OSF DCE.

   DIR.X V3.1 is a distributed, replicated Directory Service. It
   consists of DSA, DUA and a tools package including comfortable
   administration and management utilities. DIR.X implements the
   protocol stack ranging from LDAP, DAP, DSP over ACSE, ROSE,
   Presentation, Session down to [<a href="rfc1006.html">RFC 1006</a>]. On transport layer it
   supports TCP/IP and OSI LAN/WAN protocols.

   Data stored by DIR.X can be accessed via

      * the MS-Windows user interfaces DIR.D/ORG.D which are
        available as separate products from Siemens Nixdorf

      * any third-party LDAP or DAP browser

      * directory applications using the standardized X/Open XDS/XOM
        APIs (Directory Service / OSI Abstract Data Manipulation).
        The Siemens Nixdorf implementation was the first to gain
        XPG4-certification.

      * a command-line administration program

      * a menu-driven administration  program

      * WWW

      * a shell interface

      * the Query-by-mail interface of SNI's directory
        synchronization product DIR.X-SYNC

   DIR.X enables

      * The storage of globally-unique, tree-like name structures
        which can be mapped onto organizations.

      * The use of several alternative names (aliases) for one and
        the same directory entry.

      * Search queries that allow the user to select objects on the
        basis of specific attributes and their values, as with a
        "Yellow Pages" telephone directory

      * Treemanagement functions which can cover entire subtrees.

      * The creation and automatic updating of copies ("shadows")
        from remote computers.

      * Access protection at attribute level, which regulates access
        on an object-specific basis.

      * The storage of unstructured attributes (graphics, pixels).

   The tools package of DIR.X V3.1 includes:

      * gdssetup: A simple-to-use tool for the generation and
        initialization of a directory configuration.

      * gdshdsch: Enables the directory administrator to modify the
        directory schema off-line.

      * X.500 MIB access via SNMP

      * gdscp: A TCL based administration tool for UNIX clients with
        full XDS functionality

      * gdshd: A powerful import/export tool

   Additional features include:

      * support for ISO 8859-1 characters

      * dynamic schema modifications

      * caching.

NAME

   DIR.X (tm) V4.0 Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG

ABSTRACT

   DIR.X V4.0 is Siemens Nixdorf's Directory Service product compliant
   with the 1993 ITU-T X.500 recommendations. The implementation
   incorporates SNI's experience of 10 years development, support and
   maintenance of the DIR.X products conformant to the 1988 Directory
   Standards, and has the following main features:

      * It conforms to the 1993 Directory standards, with particular
        emphasis on the requirements for interoperability with other
        X.500 implementations

      * The implementation is scaleable: it handles small-scale
        workgroup directories as well as very large directories for
        backbone solutions in large organisations

      * The implementation is extensible: new functionality can
        easily be incorporated

      * Existing databases and proprietary directory services can be
        accessed or integrated with the implementation.

      * Particular emphasis is placed on ease of administration of
        the Directory Service a service based on DIR.X V4.0 can be
        administered effectively from a central site, including the
        management of configuration and monitoring options

      * The implementation has a high throughput performing well not
        only on small systems, but also on high-performance backend
        servers, handling hundreds of requests in parallel on a
        multiprocessor machine.

   DIR.X V4.0 is a distributed, replicated Directory Service. It
   consists of:

      * DSA

      * DUA

      * Command-line DUA using a TCL (Tool Control Language) shell
        interface (dirxcp)

      * Management centre (dirxadm)

NAME

DIR.X-SYNC (tm) V2.0 Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG

ABSTRACT

   DIR.X-SYNC V2.0 enables the synchronization of existing e-mail
   address directories in the X.500-based DIR.X directory service. The
   standard DIR.X, DIR.X-SYNC and DIR.D (all available from Siemens
   Nixdorf) products are the foundations on which the corporate
   directory solutions can be tailored to meet the customer's needs. The
   corporate directory then becomes the universal information system
   within the company.

   The user can access corporate directory information in different
   ways:

      * Using DIR.D, SNI's Windows client for the X.500 service, PC
        users can gain easy access to the DIR.X server containing the
        corporate directory data. The data found can  be transferred
        to other applications by means of DDE, drag and drop or cut
        and paste. (See DIR.D V2.6 for further information).

      * Query by mail: Authorized users can access data stored in the
        central or distributed directory system over their own mail
        system. DIR.X-SYNC retrieves the inquiry transmitted by mail
        and directs it on to the X.500 service. The search results
        are then delivered back to the user by mail. Using a WWW
        interface based on TCL scripts

   Query by mail does not require additional software on the end system.
   Each mail system connected to the X.400 backbone (e.g. MS-Mail,
   cc:Mail etc.) can use this function. DIR.X-SYNC currently supports
   the address formats of the following e-mail systems:

      * MAIL.X-OD V2.3

      * MAIL.2000 V1.2, AKOM

      * MS-Mail

      * cc:Mail

      * Intelligent Messaging Mail (Banyan)

   The standardized ISO-10021 interface for X.400 addresses is
   supported, enabling need for extension. This means that any type of
   system capable of generating this format (e.g. WordPerfect, Lotus
   Notes) can be connected. Address acknowledgment is carried out in ISO
   format.

   Functions for the administrator:

      * Export: Addresses can be exported from local directories.
        They are delivered as mail messages in ASCII format to the
        DIR.X-SYNC server.

      * Upload: The upload server stores the exported local addresses
        in DIR.X as globally valid X.400 addresses.

      * Query by Mail: DIR.X-SYNC enables mail members to send a
        search to the DIR.X-SYNC server by e-mail. Using this
        function, authorized administrators of the synchronized
        directories can acquire copies of the corporate directory
        data.

      * Administration of the DIR.X-SYNC server with an
        administration tool which can be used via command line or a
        command file.

   Other features include:

      * Replication and distribution: In addition to the central
        solution with a single corporate directory server, DIR.X-SYNC
        also supports replicated or distributed data storage in
        DIR.X-SYNC server.

      * Authentication/Authorization: To prevent unauthorized use of
        the corporate directory system, the O/R addresses of the
        authorized administrators and users are configured by the
        DIR.X-SYNC administrator. When a query by mail or an update
        arrives, the sender address is compared with this address.

      * Logging: In the case of error, e.g. incorrect file format,
        the sender (and the administrator  configurable) are informed
        of the fault by mail. At the same time, the error message is
        saved in a log file for the DIR.X-SYNC administrator. In
        addition, a "history  file" enables the monitoring of the
        uploads that have run or are currently running

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

      DIR.X-SYNC is a directory application.

NAME

   Forum LOOK'UP (tm)

   Telis Systemes &amp; Communications

ABSTRACT

   Forum LOOK'UP (tm) is a Corporate directory solution based on the
   X.500 recommendations. It includes:

      * a Directory System Agent (DSA),

      * Directory User Agents (DUAs).

      * local network connections

      * remote workstation access

      * a WEB and videotex access

      * data  updating tools

      * a directory editing tool

   Forum LOOK'UP is a product based on PIZARRO, the research prototype
   developed at INRIA by Christian Huitema's team, and commercialized by
   Telis, a member of the France Telecom group.

   Characteristics of the DSA are:

      * The DAP and DSP protocols are provided conformant with X.500
        (88).

      * The DIB is maintained in ASN.1 encoded format in the Unix
        file system.

      * Utilities are provided to load and dump the DIB from and to
        ASCII text files.

      * As an option, an ORACLE V7 database can also be used.

      * The DIT structure is held in main memory. Frequently used
        attributes may be held in inverted tables in memory to speed
        up searches.

      * Knowledge management: knowledge on managed domains is stored
        in Forum LOOK'UP specific attributes of the DSA entries.



<span class="grey">Apple &amp; Rossen               Informational                     [Page 80]</span></pre>

      * Schema: The X.500 (88), X.400 (88) and most of the Cosine and
        Internet Schema are supported. Object class and attribute
        definitions are enforced. Users may define their own.

      * Simple authentication is provided strong authentication and
        signed operations have been tested operationally through
        Telis's participation in PASSWORD, a VALUE project with aim
        to pilot a European security infrastructure for network
        applications.

      * Access control : the DSA offers a mechanism defined by Telis
        that is functionally equivalent to a profile of the X500 '93
        access control mechanism. The mechanism is based on the
        notion of administrative domains (autonomous and semi-
        autonomous). A domain defines the user groups (categories)
        and their access rights (consult, modify) to specified
        attribute types. The access rights are defined in
        prescriptive and entry ACI attributes.

      * Phonetic searches : administrators may specify a language
        (English, French, ...) for a subtree of the DIT. Approximate
        (phonetic) searches will then be carried out in the given
        language. The software loads a rule database to which new
        languages and new rules may be added easily.

      * Management: a Forum LOOK'UP DSA object has been defined to
        allow operational parameters of the DSA to be managed via
        DAP. Forum LOOK'UP conforms to X.500 (88) as specified in
        poaragraph 9 of X.519 Administration tools are provided :

      * to generate usage statistics automatically and distribute
        these by mail to administrators

      * to replicate subtrees of the DIT to other FORUM LOOK'UP
        DSAs and automatically update shadow copies,

      * to extract hardcopy listings from the database in an Excel
        compatible format for "paper" directories, all the
        management tasks are performed through a GUI (X/Motif).

      * The GUI includes a "dashboard" for monitoring of servers and
        the hardware they are installed on.

      * The DUAs include a graphical directory browser with powerful
        search functionality for PCs and Macintosh.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

      * The DIT structure and inverted attribute tables are stored in
        main memory.

      * The recommended main memory size for a DSA is 1kb per node,
        i.e., 10 Mb for a database of 10,000 objects.

      * The current recommended maximum for the proprietary database
        (based on the Unix file system) is a database size of the order
        of 100,000 objects.

      * For a larger database one unique server (up to 300,000 objects),
        the use of the Oracle database is recommended

      * Of the selected attribute types defined in X.500 (88), the
        searchGuide attribute is not supported

      * neither are the following attributes from the Cosine and
        Internet Schema [<a href="rfc1274.html">RFC 1274</a>]: OtherMailbox, MailPreferenceOption
        and the various quality attributes.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   Forum LOOK'UP includes a transport stack for TP0 with TCP/IP [RFC
   1006] and X.25. The stack has been ported to SunNet OSI for TP4 with
   CLNP.

   DUAs on a LAN (Novell Netware, Microsoft Lan Manager, IBM Lan Server)
   can access the DSA without the need for IP on every Workstation. A
   module (called SOLO server) available on Novell, OS/2 and UNIX allows
   to have an IP or X.25 stack only on the file server. It is in charge
   of forwarding the request to a DSA.

   A direct access (DUA / DSA) through IP, X.25, PSTN or ISDN is also
   available.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   Forum LOOK'UP can easily be ported to any UNIX machine.

   It currently runs on: Sun Solaris and Hewlett Packard.

   A port on IBM AIX is to be completed.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   The Forum LOOK'UP server is portable to any UNIX-like operating
   system.  X/Motif is the interface used for management.

   The DUAs are available on Windows and Macintosh.

   ORACLE V7 can be used as a database (option).

   FX*500 is a core component of Firefoxs product suite for mail,
   messaging and directories.

   FX*500 provides a Directory System Agent (DSA) which adheres to the
   latest 1993 X.500 standards.

   FX*500 may be used in conjunction with the Firefox FX*400 messaging
   products or may be combined with a range of Directory User Agent and
   Gateway products in order to satisfy a broad range of directory
   requirements.

   FX*500 affords unique integration opportunities with Novell's NetWare
   Directory Service (NDS) by offering the option of true dynamic
   directory integration between NDS and X.500.

   FX*500 provides support for key features of the X.500 1993 standard
   while continuing to support interworking with 1988 based directory
   user agents and system agents. The main 1993 features of X.500
   supported by FX*500 are:

      * Basic Access Control

      * The 1993 DSA Information Model

      * Replication and Shadowing

   In summary, FX*500 supports:

      * 1988 and 1993 X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP)

      * 1988 and 1993 X.500 Directory System Protocol (DSP)

      * 1993 X.500 Directory Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP)

      * 1993 Basic (or Simplified) Access Control

      * the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), as defined
        by [<a href="rfc1777.html">RFC 1777</a>]

      * configuration of knowledge information for distributed
        operation using 1993 operational attributes

      * local management services, including a knowledge
        configuration application and extensive diagnostic facilities

      * an extended set of management applications

      * operation in a wide variety of network environments including
        connectivity over X.25, TCP/IP [<a href="rfc1006.html">RFC 1006</a>] and OSI LANs.

      * an application developer's toolkit

   The optional application developer's toolkit includes:

      * the X/Open Directory Services (XDS) API to support directory
        user agent applications

      * a Gateway (G-XDS) API which is based on a simplified version
        of the XDS API syntax and allows developers to implement
        gateways to existing/ proprietary directory databases

      * a Network Management Interface (NMI) to support management
        applications and integration with management services.

   FX*500 is delivered with a schema defined to support the Common Use
   and MHS (X.402) Schemas defined by UK GOSIP V4. The subschema for
   FX*500 can be modified by the customer and updated dynamically.

   FX*500 provides for search optimisation by supporting keyed search
   whereby specific attributes can be identified as 'keyed' through
   local configuration data. This optimisation avoids the need to do a
   "brute force" search which requires a traversal of all the nodes of a
   subtree. Approximate match search filters are also supported by using
   a phonetic search based on the "Soundex" algorithm.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   FX*500 meets both the static and dynamic requirements implied by
   <a href="#section-9.2">section 9.2</a> of X.519 1988.

   From <a href="#section-9.2">section 9.2</a> of X.519 1988 regarding DSA conformance:

      * FX*500 supports both the directoryAccessAC and
        directorySystemAC application contexts.

      * The FX*500 DSA can act as a first level DSA

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   FX*500 utilises the Firefox FX*STACK product to provide an OSI stack
   for use over local or wide-area networks.  This enables the X.500
   DAP, DSP and DISP protocols operate over a range of different network
   types. The current network options are:

      * OSI LANs are supported by Transport Class 4 over CLNP (ISO
        8473), including the ES-IS routing protocol.

      * X.25 networks are supported in either a Connection-Oriented
        Network Service (CONS) or a Connection-Less Network Service
        (CLNS) environment.

         * For CONS, Transport Classes 0, 2 and 4 are supported over
           X.25(1984).

         * For CLNS, Transport Class 4 is supported over CLNP (ISO
           8473) utilising X.25 as a subnetwork.

      * TCP/IP networks are supported by an implementation of [RFC
        1006], which supports Transport Class 0 over TCP/IP.

NAME

   ISODE Consortium Release 3.0 X.500(1993) Directory ISODE Consortium
   Ltd.

ABSTRACT

   This implementation is a source release of an X.500(1993) Directory
   System Agent (DSA). It has been designed an implemented as an X.500
   1993 DSA not as a 1988 DSA with '93 extensions.  Emphasis has been
   placed on providing support for a flexible information model, access
   control, X.509 security features, and standard replication.

   The 1993 DSA offers a strong technical foundation on which to build
   an information and messaging infrastructure that relies on robust and
   scalable directory services. The implementation of this DSA
   incorporates the experience gained through the development, support,
   and maintenance of the earlier QUIPU, as well as operational
   experience and standards support.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   The DSA is aligned to the 1988 ISO IS and the NIST OIW Directory
   Implementors Guide Version 1. X.500(1993) features such as
   replication, access control, as well as X.509 certification are also
   available.  Interoperability testing with other DSAs has been
   performed.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1993 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   Please contact the ISODE Consortium if you wish to obtain our
   protocol information conformance statements. PICS may also be
   available from member organizations for their binary products.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Interoperability with several other DSAs has been demonstrated in
   pilot operation and at Eurosinet in October 1995.

   At Eurosinet, X.500 interoperability testing used the X.500 DAP
   (Directory Access) and DSP (Directory System) protocols. Successful
   testing was done between the ISODE Consortium X.500(1993) DSA and
   DSAs from four other vendors including Siemens-Nixdorf and Bull. The
   ISODE Consortium was the only vendor to bring an X.500(93) compliant
   DSA to the workshop for the scheduled X.500(93) testing.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Connectivity to the global research pilots (PARADISE etc.) has been
   demonstrated. It is expected that this system will be used
   extensively in a wide range of pilot activities.  DUA Connectivity,
   and DSA Connectivity.

BUGS

   Bugs should be reported to the ISODE Consortium via email.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   None

NAME

   LDAP

   University of Michigan

ABSTRACT

   UM-LDAP is an implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol. LDAP is a draft Internet standard directory service
   protocol that runs over TCP/IP. It can be used to provide a stand-
   alone directory service, or to provide lightweight access to the
   X.500 directory.  LDAP is defined by [<a href="rfc1777.html">RFC 1777</a>] and [<a href="rfc1778.html">RFC 1778</a>].

   The UM-LDAP package includes the following components:

      * slapd - a stand-alone LDAP directory server

      * slurpd - a stand-alone LDAP replication server

      * ldapd - an LDAP-to-X.500 gateway server

      * centipede - an LDAP centroid generation and maintenance
        program

      * libldap - an LDAP client library

      * liblber - a lightweight BER/DER encoding/decoding library

      * ldif tools - data conversion tools for use with slapd

      * in.xfingerd - a finger-to-LDAP gateway server

      * go500 - a gopher-to-LDAP gateway server for searching

      * go500gw - a gopher-to-LDAP gateway server for searching and
        browsing

      * rcpt500 - an email-to-LDAP query responder

      * mail500 - an LDAP-capable mailer

      * fax500 - an LDAP-capable mailer that supports remote printing

      * LDAP tools - A collection of shell-based LDAP utility
        programs

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   The U-M LDAP distribution is a complete implementation of the LDAP
   protocol.  The LDAP protocol does not support access to all X.500
   features and operations.  The operations supported are bind, search,
   compare, add, delete, modify, modify RDN, and abandon.  Note that
   read and list operations can be emulated using the search operation.
   Size and time limits may be specified, as may alias dereferencing and
   searching, but all X.500 service controls are not supported.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1993 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   Since the LDAP protocol itself has not yet been updated to support
   any 1993-specific X.500 features, this implementation does support
   any 1993 features yet either.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   Believed to be compliant with:

      [<a href="rfc1274.html">RFC 1274</a>], [<a href="rfc1777.html">RFC 1777</a>], [<a href="rfc1778.html">RFC 1778</a>], [<a href="rfc1779.html">RFC 1779</a>], [<a href="rfc1781.html">RFC 1781</a>]

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs

   Includes an implementation of the LDAP API, as defined in [<a href="rfc1823.html">RFC 1823</a>].
   Search filters used within UM-LDAP comply with [<a href="rfc1558.html">RFC 1558</a>].

INTEROPERABILITY

   The current implementation of the X.500-backended LDAP server (ldapd)
   is known to work with ISODE-based DAP libraries and the QUIPU DSA.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DUA connectivity should be possible to all pilots.

BUGS

   Bug reports should be sent to bug-ldap@umich.edu.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   None, aside from those mentioned above under completeness.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   LDAP clients use TCP to communicate with the LDAP server.  The LDAP
   server normally uses [<a href="rfc1006.html">RFC 1006</a>] with TCP/IP to communicate with the
   DSA, though any other transport mechanism for DSA communication
   supported by ISODE should be possible.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   The complete UM-LDAP package has been ported to a wide variety of
   UNIX systems, including: Sun3 and SPARCs running SunOS 4.1.x or
   Solaris 2.x, DECStations running Ultrix 4.3, HP 9000 series running
   HP-UX 9.05, IBM RS6000 running AIX 3.2.5, PCs running SCO, FreeBSD,
   NetBSD, or LINUX, DEC Alphas running OSF/1, and NeXTStatios running
   NeXTSTEP 3.2.  The complete package has also been ported to VMS.  In
   addition, the LDAP client libraries and some client programs have
   been ported to Apple Macintosh and PCs running MSDOS or Windows.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   The complete UM-LDAP package has been ported to a wide variety of
   UNIX systems, including: SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.x, Ultrix 4.3, HP-UX
   9.05, AIX 3.2.5, SCO, FreeBSD, NetBSD, LINUX, OSF/1, and NeXTSTEP
   3.2.  It has also been ported to VMS.  In addition, the LDAP client
   libraries and some clients have been ported to Macintosh (System 7),
   MSDOS (some TCP/IP stacks), and Microsoft Windows 3.1, 95, and NT.

NUMBER OF IMPLEMENTATIONS IN THE FIELD

   Unknown; used by almost all Internet X.500 sites.

NAME

   maX.500 :: Macintosh DUA Interface

   University of Michigan

ABSTRACT

   maX.500 is a Directory User Agent (client) for Apple Macintosh.  It
   is widely used within Paradise and other Internet X.500 pilots.
   maX.500 supports searching, browsing, and modifying directory
   entries.  Display of textual information, playing of audio, and
   viewing of both black-and-white (fax) and color (JPEG) images are
   supported.  Communication with directory servers is via the
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) over TCP/IP.  maX.500
   works both with standalone LDAP directory servers (such as slapd) and
   with X.500-backended LDAP servers (such as ldapd).

   maX.500 is a native Macintosh application, and has a friendly
   interface.  It requires System Software version 6.0.5 or later and
   Apple's MacTCP or Open Transport TCP/IP networking. The current
   version of maX.500 is 2.0.2, although version 2.1 is in beta test.

   The latest information about maX.500 can always be found on the
   maX.500 Home Page at this URL:
   <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/max500/">http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/max500/</a>

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   maX.500 works over LDAP, and is subject to LDAP's limitations.  The
   bind, search, compare, add, delete, abandon, modify, and modifyrdn
   operations are all used by maX.500. Size and time limits may be
   specified, as may alias dereferencing control.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1993 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   maX.500 currently uses LDAP as defined in [<a href="rfc1777.html">RFC 1777</a>], which does not
   support any 1993-specific X.500 features.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

      Believed to be compliant with:

      [<a href="rfc1274.html">RFC 1274</a>], [<a href="rfc1777.html">RFC 1777</a>], [<a href="rfc1778.html">RFC 1778</a>], [<a href="rfc1779.html">RFC 1779</a>], [<a href="rfc1781.html">RFC 1781</a>]

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs

   Search filters comply with [<a href="rfc1558.html">RFC 1558</a>].

   Uses the LDAP API, as defined in [<a href="rfc1823.html">RFC 1823</a>].

INTEROPERABILITY

   maX.500 is known to work with the U-M LDAP servers (ldapd and slapd).
   It has also been tested with other commerical LDAP servers, such as
   Control Data's server.  maX.500 has been used with a wide variety of
   DSAs (always through an LDAP server).

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DUA connectivity should be possible to all pilots.

BUGS

   Bug reports should be sent to max500-bugs@umich.edu.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   maX.500 does not support modification of "photo" (fax), "jpegPhoto",
   or "audio" attributes.  Versions of maX.500 before 2.1 did not
   support a fully functional browse facility.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   maX.500 is an LDAP client, and as such is uses TCP to communicate
   with the LDAP server.  Apple's MacTCP control panel or Open Transport
   TCP/IP networking is required.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   maX.500 runs on Apple Macintosh Plus or later Macintosh computers,
   including PowerMacs. It requires 600K of free RAM.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   maX.500 requires Apple System Software 6.0.5 or later (System 7
   preferred) and MacTCP 1.1 or later (2.0.6 preferred).  maX.500 2.1,
   which is currently in beta test, will run natively on the PowerMac
   and use the native Open Transport networking interface if it is
   installed.

NAME

   NonStop Directory Services (NSDS)
   Tandem Computers, Inc.

ABSTRACT

   The Tandem NonStop Directory Services (NSDS) product provides a
   distributed open directory service on Tandem platforms.  It is an
   industrial strength implementation incorporating the Tandem product
   fundementals of resilience, linear extensibility, fault-tolerance, and
   continuous availability. NSDS runs on the NonStop Kernel Guardian
   Personality which includes support for Tandem system characteristics
   such as data integrity, process persistence, and server classes.  NSDS
   supports access over X.25 WAN, LAN and TCP/IP networks.

   NSDS is a port of OSF's DCE GDS Reference Implementation, with Tandem
   enhancements including 1993 X.500 Simplified Access Control. Tandem
   server class management provides fault events, tracing, accounting and
   configuration services for NSDS. TM/MP (Transaction Management) is
   used to protect all file operations that affect the integrity of the
   directory entries in the DIB.

   Major Features Include:

      * X/Open Directory Services (XDS) API and X/Open Object
        Management (XOM) interface in conformance with X/Open CAE
        Specifications, and an additional Tandem extension package

      * 1988 Edition X.500 Conformant DAP and DSP, capable of inter-
        operating with 1993 Edition DUA or DSA implementations

      * Simplified Access Control as specified in the 1993 edition of
        the X.500 standard.

      * Unprotected Simple Authentication (name and password in
        clear)

      * Character set support for T61 Printables, IA5 and Teletex
        Strings

      * The DSA-SC server class performs the functions of a DSA.
        Multiple processes are used for fault tolerance and load
        balancing.

      * The DUA-ACCESS server class handles communications between
        local applications and remote DSA's using DAP across an OSI
        stack.

      * The DSA-ACCESS server class handles communications from
        remote DUAs or DSAs to the DSA-SC server class using the
        Tandem OSI stack implementation which includes [<a href="rfc1006.html">RFC 1006</a>]
        support for TCP/IP networks.

      * The DSA-CHAIN server class handles chaining communications
        between the DSA-SC server class and remote DSAs.

      * NSDS GUI Viewer supports administration/management of an NSDS
        DIB on a PC Windows workstation.  The NSDS GUI Viewer is
        supported by a persistent server process on the Tandem
        NonStop Kernel.  The  GUI Viewer allows a directory entry and
        a complete set of attributes and values to be inserted
        anywhere in the directory tree (DIT), to be deleted or
        changed, read or searched based on distinguished name
        components, with or without wild-card.

      * NSDS SCRIPTOR allows customers to explore features of the XDS
        programmatic interface in advance of writing their XOM/XDS
        application. NSDS SCRIPTOR is a menu-driven batch interface
        to XDS functions.

      * A BulkUnload/BulkLoad utility allows a branch of the DIB to
        be dumped to an editable flat file and restored from that
        file.  The flat file can be modified before being bulk-loaded
        into a DIB which may conform to a different schema
        definition.

      * Support for the LDAP protocol.

      * Messaging-Based Directory Query (MDQ) provides a text-based
        query interface to the directory from an X.400 messaging
        system, such as Tandem OSI/MHS, via the XAPIA compliant GPI
        interface.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988  (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   NSDS complies with the '88 CCITT X.500 and ISO 9594 standard, and
   part of '93 X.500 standard.

   NSDS DSA and DUA are compliant with OIW Agreements, with the
   following features yet to be implemented:

      * Strong Authentication               (Sections <a href="#section-6.6.2">6.6.2</a> and <a href="#section-8.4">8.4</a>e)

      * Priority Service Control            (<a href="#section-7.4">Section 7.4</a>)

NAME

   PMDF-X500

   from:

   Innosoft International, Inc. 1050 East Garvey Ave. South West
   Covina, California  91790

   Phone:  +1 818-919-3600 email: sales@innosoft.com

ABSTRACT

   PMDF-X500 is Innosoft's implementation of the X.500 standards for
   Directory Services. PMDF-X500 is based upon the ISODE Consortium
   code-base. The core of PMDF-X500 is the Directory System Agent (DSA)
   server. This server provides directory information to Directory User
   Agents (DUA) using either OSI or TCP/IP networking protocols. Since
   PMDF-X500 is based on a widely used implementation, it interoperates
   particularly well with a whole host of X.500-based products from other
   sources.

   In order to facilitate initial loading of directory data as well as
   ongoing coordination with other directory services, PMDF-X500 includes
   tools to import from and export directory information to Entry
   Description File (EDF) files. EDF files are flat text files.
   PMDF-X500 provides directory coordination functions using EDF files
   for the following directories:

      * X.500 DSAs supporting LDAP access

      * cc:Mail

      * Digital's DDS

      * GroupWise

      * Microsoft Mail

      * PMDF  generic databases

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   OSI directory services as specified in CCITT X.500 Recommendations
   and ISO 9594 use the Directory Access Protocol (DAP) and the
   Directory System Protocol (DSP).

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1993 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   PMDF-X500 does not yet support the 1993 changes to the X.500
   standard.  Support for the 1993 X.500 recommendations is planned for
   a future release of PMDF-X500.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   PMDF-X500 supports DAP and DSP accesses using Internet protocols as
   specified in [<a href="rfc1006.html">RFC 1006</a>]. In addition, the Internet community has
   proposed two lightweight alternatives to DAP called Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is specified in [<a href="rfc1777.html">RFC 1777</a>],
   and Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP),
   which is specified in [<a href="rfc1798.html">RFC 1798</a>]. LDAP and CLDAP, which are currently
   specified to run over TCP/IP, are much simpler protocols than DAP and
   were designed to reduce the cost of entry associated with using X.500
   protocols in client applications. PMDF-X500 includes both LDAP and
   CLDAP servers.

   The LDAP server accesses X.500 directory information using DAP to
   communicate with X.500 DSAs. PMDF-X500 provides an LDAP server which
   translates LDAP requests into DAP requests to communicate with X.500
   DSAs. CLDAP defines a very low overhead method for accessing X.500
   directory information. CLDAP is suitable for providing access to
   information that does not require access controls.

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs

   [No information provided. -- Ed.]

INTEROPERABILITY

   PMDF-X500 interoperates with a large number of DUAs and DSAs. This is
   demonstated by the fact that PMDF-X500 is DSA used by several Internet
   White Pages Project participants. PMDF-X500 DSA interoperability
   includes at least all of the DSA that are used in the White Pages
   Project.

   PMDF-X500 is delivered with several DUAs and in addition is know to
   support the DUAs from Unisys and Digital Equipment Corporation as well
   as the publically available DUAs MaX500, Cello, Swix, and the NASA
   DUA.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   PMDF-X500 is used by several sites that are participants of the
   Internet White Pages Project include the Innosoft DSA.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   [No information provided. -- Ed.]

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   DAP and DSP are layered on top of the OSI protocol suite. PMDF-X500
   supports this protocol suite over multiple network transports. For a
   pure OSI protocol stack, DECnet/OSI can be used to provide the lower
   layers of the stack. In addition, PMDF-X500 supports running OSI upper
   layer protocols over a TCP/IP transport in accordance with [<a href="rfc1006.html">RFC 1006</a>].
   It is important to note that while [<a href="rfc1006.html">RFC 1006</a>] specifies TCP/IP as a
   transport, all of the OSI upper layer protocols are always used with
   DAP and DSP.

ABSTRACT

   waX.500 :: Windows Access to X.500

   waX.500 is a (currently 16-bit) DUA that run on Microsoft Windows
   (3.1, Win95, &amp; WinNT).  It uses libldap.dll which uses the winsock
   (v1.1) interface.  It works on any vendors tcp/ip stack that I've
   seen so far (some configuration may be required).

   waX.500 was developed by the University of Michigan for use by its
   faculty, staff and students. UM's online directory is an X.500
   directory containing 50,000+ entries.

   I keep the following Web page up to date with respect to latest

NAME

   X500-DS

   X500-DUA

   Bull S.A.

ABSTRACT

   X500-DS and X500-DUA are integral part of the large Bull OSI offer.
   Although based on the DCE/GDS (Distributed Computing
   Environment/Global Directory Service) of OSF, those two products may
   be installed and used without the DCE environment. Some enhancements
   have been added for the user and the management facilities. X500-DS is
   designed to implement both the DUA and the DSA functions, whilst
   X500-DUA only provides the DUA functions.

   The X500-DUA package contains:

      * The standards APIs XOM (X/Open OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation
        API) and XDS (X/Open Directory Service API) for the
        development of portable applications,

      * A core DUA to translate all user's requests (bind, read,
        list, compare, modify, modifyRDN, search, add, remove, unbind
        ...) into the DAP protocol used for communication with
        distant DSAs,

      * The OSI standard high layers (ASN.1, ROSE, ACSE, Presentation
        and Session) for communication with the distant DSAs. The
        interface with the low layers is XTI. [<a href="rfc1006.html">RFC 1006</a>] is supported
        under XTI or the OSI Session,

      * A DUA Cache to improve performances when accessing remote
        DSAs,

      * A powerful management application facilitating the
        configuration of the product and controlling the operations,
        logs and traces,

      * A user application for the manipulations of the database

      * The support of the LDAP [<a href="rfc1777.html">RFC 1777</a>] thanks to an LDAP Server,

      * A DUA Server that allows to use A-Window-To-Directory (refer
        to this DUA product description) on a PC.

   The X500-DS package contains:

      * All components of the X500-DUA,

      * A core DSA to process all requests received from distant DUAs
        through DAP protocol or from distant DSAs through DSP
        protocol,

      * The support of the referral, chained and multi-casting modes
        of operation, access control lists and management of
        knowledge information (for distribution, shadows and  copies
        of sub-trees),

      * The support of the simple authentication and of the DCE
        authentication,

      * A management application for managing the schema information
        (creation, deletion and modification of object classes and of
        attribute types, management of the rules of the DIT).

      * A C-ISAM database that is specially designed for high
        performances: e.g. less than 10 ms to read an entry on an
        Escala at the XOM/XDS interface.

   These two products are easely installed, configured and administered
   thanks to the System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) screens of AIX.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   Compliant with EWOS and OIW Agreements

   Consists of both DUA and DSA implementation according to the '88
   CCITT X.500 and ISO 9594 standard. The X/Open standard XDS and XOM
   interface libraries are also provided. When the product is installed
   with the DCE environment, XDS and XOM interfaces are also used to
   access DCE/CDS (Local Cell Directory Service) transparently. A GDA
   (Global Directory Agent) serves then as the gateway between the DCE
   CDS and GDS.

COMPLIANCE with X.500-1993 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
