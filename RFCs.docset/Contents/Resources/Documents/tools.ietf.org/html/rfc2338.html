Abstract

   This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).
   VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns
   responsibility for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a
   LAN.  The VRRP router controlling the IP address(es) associated with
   a virtual router is called the Master, and forwards packets sent to
   these IP addresses.  The election process provides dynamic fail over
   in the forwarding responsibility should the Master become
   unavailable.  This allows any of the virtual router IP addresses on
   the LAN to be used as the default first hop router by end-hosts.  The
   advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher availability default
   path without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router
   discovery protocols on every end-host.

   There are a number of methods that an end-host can use to determine
   its first hop router towards a particular IP destination.  These
   include running (or snooping) a dynamic routing protocol such as
   Routing Information Protocol [<a href="#ref-RIP" title='"Routing Information Protocol"'>RIP</a>] or OSPF version 2 [<a href="#ref-OSPF" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>OSPF</a>], running
   an ICMP router discovery client [<a href="#ref-DISC" title='"ICMP Router Discovery Messages"'>DISC</a>] or using a statically
   configured default route.

   Running a dynamic routing protocol on every end-host may be
   infeasible for a number of reasons, including administrative
   overhead, processing overhead, security issues, or lack of a protocol
   implementation for some platforms.  Neighbor or router discovery

   protocols may require active participation by all hosts on a network,
   leading to large timer values to reduce protocol overhead in the face
   of large numbers of hosts.  This can result in a significant delay in
   the detection of a lost (i.e., dead) neighbor, which may introduce
   unacceptably long "black hole" periods.

   The use of a statically configured default route is quite popular; it
   minimizes configuration and processing overhead on the end-host and
   is supported by virtually every IP implementation.  This mode of
   operation is likely to persist as dynamic host configuration
   protocols [<a href="#ref-DHCP" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>DHCP</a>] are deployed, which typically provide configuration
   for an end-host IP address and default gateway.  However, this
   creates a single point of failure.  Loss of the default router
   results in a catastrophic event, isolating all end-hosts that are
   unable to detect any alternate path that may be available.

   The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is designed to
   eliminate the single point of failure inherent in the static default
   routed environment.  VRRP specifies an election protocol that
   dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the
   VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router controlling the IP
   address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Master,
   and forwards packets sent to these IP addresses.  The election
   process provides dynamic fail-over in the forwarding responsibility
   should the Master become unavailable.  Any of the virtual router's IP
   addresses on a LAN can then be used as the default first hop router
   by end-hosts.  The advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher
   availability default path without requiring configuration of dynamic

   The remainder of this document describes the features, design goals,
   and theory of operation of VRRP.  The message formats, protocol
   processing rules and state machine that guarantee convergence to a
   single Virtual Router Master are presented.  Finally, operational
   issues related to MAC address mapping, handling of ARP requests,
   generation of ICMP redirect messages, and security issues are
   addressed.

   This protocol is intended for use with IPv4 routers only.  A separate

   VRRP Router            A router running the Virtual Router Redundancy
                          Protocol.  It may participate in one or more
                          virtual routers.

   Virtual Router         An abstract object managed by VRRP that acts
                          as a default router for hosts on a shared LAN.
                          It consists of a Virtual Router Identifier and
                          a set of associated IP address(es) across a
                          common LAN.  A VRRP Router may backup one or
                          more virtual routers.

   IP Address Owner       The VRRP router that has the virtual router's
                          IP address(es) as real interface address(es).
                          This is the router that, when up, will respond
                          to packets addressed to one of these IP
                          addresses for ICMP pings, TCP connections,
                          etc.

   Primary IP Address     An IP address selected from the set of real
                          interface addresses.  One possible selection
                          algorithm is to always select the first
                          address.  VRRP advertisements are always sent
                          using the primary IP address as the source of
                          the IP packet.

   Virtual Router Master  The VRRP router that is assuming the
                          responsibility of forwarding packets sent to
                          the IP address(es) associated with the virtual
                          router, and answering ARP requests for these
                          IP addresses.  Note that if the IP address
                          owner is available, then it will always become
                          the Master.

   Virtual Router Backup  The set of VRRP routers available to assume
                          forwarding responsibility for a virtual router
                          should the current Master fail.

   This section outlines the set of features that were considered
   mandatory and that guided the design of VRRP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20IP%20Address%20Backup"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a> IP Address Backup</span>

   Backup of IP addresses is the primary function of the Virtual Router
   Redundancy Protocol.  While providing election of a Virtual Router
   Master and the additional functionality described below, the protocol
   should strive to:

    - Minimize the duration of black holes.
    - Minimize the steady state bandwidth overhead and processing
      complexity.
    - Function over a wide variety of multiaccess LAN technologies
      capable of supporting IP traffic.
    - Provide for election of multiple virtual routers on a network for
      load balancing
    - Support of multiple logical IP subnets on a single LAN segment.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2%20Preferred%20Path%20Indication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a> Preferred Path Indication</span>

   A simple model of Master election among a set of redundant routers is
   to treat each router with equal preference and claim victory after
   converging to any router as Master.  However, there are likely to be
   many environments where there is a distinct preference (or range of
   preferences) among the set of redundant routers.  For example, this
   preference may be based upon access link cost or speed, router
   performance or reliability, or other policy considerations.  The
   protocol should allow the expression of this relative path preference
   in an intuitive manner, and guarantee Master convergence to the most
   preferential router currently available.

   Once Master election has been performed then any unnecessary
   transitions between Master and Backup routers can result in a
   disruption in service.  The protocol should ensure after Master
   election that no state transition is triggered by any Backup router
   of equal or lower preference as long as the Master continues to
   function properly.

   Some environments may find it beneficial to avoid the state
   transition triggered when a router becomes available that is more
   preferential than the current Master.  It may be useful to support an
   override of the immediate convergence to the preferred path.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4%20Extensible%20Security"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" name="section-2.4">2.4</a> Extensible Security</span>

   The virtual router functionality is applicable to a wide range of
   internetworking environments that may employ different security
   policies.  The protocol should require minimal configuration and
   overhead in the insecure operation, provide for strong authentication
   when increased security is required, and allow integration of new
   security mechanisms without breaking backwards compatible operation.

   Sending IP packets on a multiaccess LAN requires mapping from an IP
   address to a MAC address.  The use of the virtual router MAC address
   in an extended LAN employing learning bridges can have a significant
   effect on the bandwidth overhead of packets sent to the virtual
   router.  If the virtual router MAC address is never used as the
   source address in a link level frame then the station location is
   never learned, resulting in flooding of all packets sent to the
   virtual router.  To improve the efficiency in this environment the
   protocol should: 1) use the virtual router MAC as the source in a
   packet sent by the Master to trigger station learning; 2) trigger a
   message immediately after transitioning to Master to update the
   station learning; and 3) trigger periodic messages from the Master to
   maintain the station learning cache.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.0%20VRRP%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.0" name="section-3.0">3.0</a> VRRP Overview</span>

   VRRP specifies an election protocol to provide the virtual router
   function described earlier.  All protocol messaging is performed
   using IP multicast datagrams, thus the protocol can operate over a
   variety of multiaccess LAN technologies supporting IP multicast.
   Each VRRP virtual router has a single well-known MAC address
   allocated to it.  This document currently only details the mapping to
   networks using the IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address.  The virtual router
   MAC address is used as the source in all periodic VRRP messages sent
   by the Master router to enable bridge learning in an extended LAN.

   A virtual router is defined by its virtual router identifier (VRID)
   and a set of IP addresses.  A VRRP router may associate a virtual
   router with its real addresses on an interface, and may also be
   configured with additional virtual router mappings and priority for
   virtual routers it is willing to backup.  The mapping between VRID
   and addresses must be coordinated among all VRRP routers on a LAN.



<span class="grey">Knight, et. al.             Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2338.html">RFC 2338</a>                          VRRP                        April 1998</span>


   However, there is no restriction against reusing a VRID with a
   different address mapping on different LANs.  The scope of each
   virtual router is restricted to a single LAN.

   To minimize network traffic, only the Master for each virtual router
   sends periodic VRRP Advertisement messages.  A Backup router will not
   attempt to pre-empt the Master unless it has higher priority.  This
   eliminates service disruption unless a more preferred path becomes
   available.  It's also possible to administratively prohibit all pre-
   emption attempts.  The only exception is that a VRRP router will
   always become Master of any virtual router associated with addresses
   it owns.  If the Master becomes unavailable then the highest priority
   Backup will transition to Master after a short delay, providing a
   controlled transition of the virtual router responsibility with
   minimal service interruption.

   VRRP defines three types of authentication providing simple
   deployment in insecure environments, added protection against
   misconfiguration, and strong sender authentication in security
   conscious environments.  Analysis of the protection provided and
   vulnerability of each mechanism is deferred to <a href="#section-10.0">Section 10.0</a> Security
   Considerations.  In addition new authentication types and data can be
   defined in the future without affecting the format of the fixed
   portion of the protocol packet, thus preserving backward compatible
   operation.

   The VRRP protocol design provides rapid transition from Backup to
   Master to minimize service interruption, and incorporates
   optimizations that reduce protocol complexity while guaranteeing
   controlled Master transition for typical operational scenarios.  The
   optimizations result in an election protocol with minimal runtime
   state requirements, minimal active protocol states, and a single
   message type and sender.  The typical operational scenarios are
   defined to be two redundant routers and/or distinct path preferences
   among each router.  A side effect when these assumptions are violated
   (i.e., more than two redundant paths all with equal preference) is
   that duplicate packets may be forwarded for a brief period during
   Master election.  However, the typical scenario assumptions are
   likely to cover the vast majority of deployments, loss of the Master
   router is infrequent, and the expected duration in Master election
   convergence is quite small ( &lt;&lt; 1 second ).  Thus the VRRP
   optimizations represent significant simplifications in the protocol
   design while incurring an insignificant probability of brief network
   degradation.

   The following figure shows a simple network with two VRRP routers
   implementing one virtual router.  Note that this example is provided
   to help understand the protocol, but is not expected to occur in

   The above configuration shows a very simple VRRP scenario.  In this
   configuration, the end-hosts install a default route to the IP
   address of virtual router #1 (IP A) and both routers run VRRP.  The
   router on the left becomes the Master for virtual router #1 (VRID=1)
   and the router on the right is the Backup for virtual router #1.  If
   the router on the left should fail, the other router will take over
   virtual router #1 and its IP addresses, and provide uninterrupted
   service for the hosts.

   Note that in this example, IP B is not backed up by the router on the
   left.  IP B is only used by the router on the right as its interface
   address.  In order to backup IP B, a second virtual router would have
   to be configured.  This is shown in the next section.

   The type field specifies the type of this VRRP packet.  The only
   packet type defined in this version of the protocol is:

       1      ADVERTISEMENT

   A packet with unknown type MUST be discarded.

   is an 8 bit unsigned integer field.

   The priority value for the VRRP router that owns the IP address(es)
   associated with the virtual router MUST be 255 (decimal).

   VRRP routers backing up a virtual router MUST use priority values
   between 1-254 (decimal).  The default priority value for VRRP routers
   backing up a virtual router is 100 (decimal).

   The priority value zero (0) has special meaning indicating that the
   current Master has stopped participating in VRRP.  This is used to
   trigger Backup routers to quickly transition to Master without having
   to wait for the current Master to timeout.

   The authentication type field identifies the authentication method
   being utilized.  Authentication type is unique on a per interface
   basis.  The authentication type field is an 8 bit unsigned integer.
   A packet with unknown authentication type or that does not match the
   locally configured authentication method MUST be discarded.

   The authentication methods currently defined are:

       0 - No Authentication
       1 - Simple Text Password
       2 - IP Authentication Header

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.6.1%20No%20Authentication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.6.1" name="section-5.3.6.1">5.3.6.1</a> No Authentication</span>

   The use of this authentication type means that VRRP protocol
   exchanges are not authenticated.  The contents of the Authentication
   Data field should be set to zero on transmission and ignored on
   reception.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.6.2%20Simple%20Text%20Password"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.6.2" name="section-5.3.6.2">5.3.6.2</a> Simple Text Password</span>

   The use of this authentication type means that VRRP protocol
   exchanges are authenticated by a clear text password.  The contents
   of the Authentication Data field should be set to the locally
   configured password on transmission.  There is no default password.
   The receiver MUST check that the Authentication Data in the packet
   matches its configured authentication string.  Packets that do not
   match MUST be discarded.

   Note that there are security implications to using Simple Text
   password authentication, and one should see the Security
   Consideration section of this document.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.6.3%20IP%20Authentication%20Header"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.6.3" name="section-5.3.6.3">5.3.6.3</a> IP Authentication Header</span>

   The use of this authentication type means the VRRP protocol exchanges
   are authenticated using the mechanisms defined by the IP
   Authentication Header [<a href="#ref-AUTH" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>AUTH</a>] using "The Use of HMAC-MD5-96 within ESP
   and AH" [<a href="#ref-HMAC" title='"The Use of HMAC-MD5-96 within ESP and AH"'>HMAC</a>].  Keys may be either configured manually or via a key
   distribution protocol.

   If a packet is received that does not pass the authentication check
   due to a missing authentication header or incorrect message digest,
   then the packet MUST be discarded.  The contents of the
   Authentication Data field should be set to zero on transmission and
   ignored on reception.

   The checksum field is used to detect data corruption in the VRRP
   message.

   The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement
   sum of the entire VRRP message starting with the version field.  For
   computing the checksum, the checksum field is set to zero.

   the Open Shortest Path First routing protocol [<a href="#ref-OSPF" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>OSPF</a>].  It is up to 8
   characters of plain text.  If the configured authentication string is
   shorter than 8 bytes, the remaining space MUST be zero-filled.  Any
   VRRP packet received with an authentication string that does not
   match the locally configured authentication string MUST be discarded.
   The authentication string is unique on a per interface basis.

   There is no default value for this field.

                           Values are True to allow preemption and
                           False to not prohibit preemption.  Default
                           is True.

                           Note: Exception is that the router that owns

   characters.

   A VRRP router implements an instance of the state machine for each
   virtual router election it is participating in.

   The purpose of this state is to wait for a Startup event.  If a
   Startup event is received, then:

    - If the Priority = 255 (i.e., the router owns the IP address(es)
      associated with the virtual router)

       o Send an ADVERTISEMENT
       o Broadcast a gratuitous ARP request containing the virtual

   While in this state, a VRRP router MUST do the following:

    - MUST NOT respond to ARP requests for the IP address(s) associated
      with the virtual router.

    - MUST discard packets with a destination link layer MAC address
      equal to the virtual router MAC address.

    - MUST NOT accept packets addressed to the IP address(es) associated

   ICMP Redirects may be used normally when VRRP is running between a
   group of routers.  This allows VRRP to be used in environments where
   the topology is not symmetric.

   The IP source address of an ICMP redirect should be the address the
   end host used when making its next hop routing decision.  If a VRRP
   router is acting as Master for virtual router(s) containing addresses
   it does not own, then it must determine which virtual router the
   packet was sent to when selecting the redirect source address.  One
   method to deduce the virtual router used is to examine the
   destination MAC address in the packet that triggered the redirect.

   It may be useful to disable Redirects for specific cases where VRRP
   is being used to load share traffic between a number of routers in a
   symmetric topology.

   When a host sends an ARP request for one of the virtual router IP
   addresses, the Master virtual router MUST respond to the ARP request
   with the virtual MAC address for the virtual router.  The Master
   virtual router MUST NOT respond with its physical MAC address.  This
   allows the client to always use the same MAC address regardless of
   the current Master router.

   When a VRRP router restarts or boots, it SHOULD not send any ARP
   messages with its physical MAC address for the IP address it owns, it
   should only send ARP messages that include Virtual MAC addresses.
   This may entail:

    - When configuring an interface, VRRP routers should broadcast a
      gratuitous ARP request containing the virtual router MAC address
      for each IP address on that interface.

    - At system boot, when initializing interfaces for VRRP operation;
      delay gratuitous ARP requests and ARP responses until both the IP
      address and the virtual router MAC address are configured.

   If Proxy ARP is to be used on a VRRP router, then the VRRP router
   must advertise the Virtual Router MAC address in the Proxy ARP
   message.  Doing otherwise could cause hosts to learn the real MAC
   address of the VRRP router.

   FDDI interfaces remove from the FDDI ring frames that have a source
   MAC address matching the device's hardware address.  Under some
   conditions, such as router isolations, ring failures, protocol
   transitions, etc., VRRP may cause there to be more than one Master
   router.  If a Master router installs the virtual router MAC address
   as the hardware address on a FDDI device, then other Masters'
   ADVERTISEMENTS will be removed from the ring during the Master
   convergence, and convergence will fail.

   To avoid this an implementation SHOULD configure the virtual router
   MAC address by adding a unicast MAC filter in the FDDI device, rather
   than changing its hardware MAC address.  This will prevent a Master
   router from removing any ADVERTISEMENTS it did not originate.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.2%20%20Operation%20over%20Token%20Ring"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.2" name="section-9.2">9.2</a>  Operation over Token Ring</span>

   Token ring has several characteristics which make running VRRP
   difficult. These include:

    - In order to switch to a new master located on a different bridge
      token ring segment from the previous master when using source
      route bridges, a mechanism is required to update cached source
      route information.

    - No general multicast mechanism supported across old and new token
      ring adapter implementations. While many newer token ring adapters
      support group addresses, token ring functional address support is
      the only generally available multicast mechanism. Due to the
      limited number of token ring functional addresses these may
      collide with other usage of the same token ring functional
      addresses.

   Due to these difficulties, the preferred mode of operation over token
   ring will be to use a token ring functional address for the VRID
   virtual MAC address. Token ring functional addresses have the two
   high order bits in the first MAC address octet set to B'1'.  They
   range from 03-00-00-00-00-80 to 03-00-02-00-00-00 (canonical format).
   However, unlike multicast addresses, there is only one unique
   functional address per bit position. The functional addresses
   addresses  03-00-00-10-00-00 through 03-00-02-00-00-00 are reserved
   by the Token Ring Architecture [<a href="#ref-TKARCH" title="Architecture Reference">TKARCH</a>] for user-defined
   applications.  However, since there are only 12 user-defined token
   ring functional addresses, there may be other non-IP protocols using
   the same functional address. Since the Novell IPX [<a href="#ref-IPX" title='"IPX Router Specification"'>IPX</a>] protocol uses

   the 03-00-00-10-00-00 functional address, operation of VRRP over
   token ring will avoid use of this functional address. In general,
   token ring VRRP users will be responsible for resolution of other
   user-defined token ring functional address conflicts.

   VRIDs are mapped directly to token ring functional addresses. In
   order to decrease the likelihood of functional address conflicts,
   allocation will begin with the largest functional address. Most non-
   IP protocols use the first or first couple user-defined functional
   addresses and it is expected that VRRP users will choose VRIDs
   sequentially starting with 1.

   VRID      Token Ring Functional Address
   ----      -----------------------------
      1             03-00-02-00-00-00
      2             03-00-04-00-00-00

      5             03-00-20-00-00-00
      6             03-00-40-00-00-00

     10             03-00-00-04-00-00
     11             03-00-00-08-00-00

   Or more succinctly, octets 3 and 4 of the functional address are
   equal to (0x4000 &gt;&gt; (VRID - 1)) in non-canonical format.

   Since a functional address cannot be used used as a MAC level source
   address, the real MAC address is used as the MAC source address in
   VRRP advertisements. This is not a problem for bridges since packets
   addressed to functional addresses will be sent on the spanning-tree
   explorer path [<a href="#ref-802.1D" title="ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1D">802.1D</a>].

   The functional address mode of operation MUST be implemented by
   routers supporting VRRP on token ring.

   Additionally, routers MAY support unicast mode of operation to take
   advantage of newer token ring adapter implementations which support
   non-promiscuous reception for multiple unicast MAC addresses and to
   avoid both the multicast traffic and usage conflicts associated with
   the use of token ring functional addresses. Unicast mode uses the
   same mapping of VRIDs to virtual MAC addresses as Ethernet.  However,
   one important difference exists. ARP request/reply packets contain
   the virtual MAC address as the source MAC address. The reason for
   this is that some token ring driver implementations keep a cache of
   MAC address/source routing information independent of the ARP cache.



<span class="grey">Knight, et. al.             Standards Track                    [Page 22]</span></pre>

   Hence, these implementations need have to receive a packet with the
   virtual MAC address as the source address in order to transmit to
   that MAC address in a source-route bridged network.

   Unicast mode on token ring has one limitation which should be
   considered.  If there are VRID routers on different source-route
   bridge segments and there are host implementations which keep their
   source-route information in the ARP cache and do not listen to
   gratuitous ARPs, these hosts will not update their ARP source-route
   information correctly when a switch-over occurs. The only possible
   solution is to put all routers with the same VRID on the same source-
   bridge segment and use techniques to prevent that bridge segment from
   being a single point of failure. These techniques are beyond the
   scope this document.

   For both the multicast and unicast mode of operation, VRRP
   advertisements sent to 224.0.0.18 should be encapsulated as described
   in [<a href="rfc1469.html" title='"IP over Token Ring LANs"'>RFC1469</a>].

   VRRP is designed for a range of internetworking environments that may
   employ different security policies.  The protocol includes several
   authentication methods ranging from no authentication, simple clear
   text passwords, and strong authentication using IP Authentication
   with MD5 HMAC.  The details on each approach including possible
   attacks and recommended environments follows.

   Independent of any authentication type VRRP includes a mechanism
   (setting TTL=255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP
   packets being injected from another remote network.  This limits most
   vulnerabilities to local attacks.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.1%20No%20Authentication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.1" name="section-10.1">10.1</a> No Authentication</span>

   The use of this authentication type means that VRRP protocol
   exchanges are not authenticated.  This type of authentication SHOULD
   only be used in environments were there is minimal security risk and
   little chance for configuration errors (e.g., two VRRP routers on a
   LAN).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.2%20Simple%20Text%20Password"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.2" name="section-10.2">10.2</a> Simple Text Password</span>

   The use of this authentication type means that VRRP protocol
   exchanges are authenticated by a simple clear text password.






<span class="grey">Knight, et. al.             Standards Track                    [Page 23]</span></pre>

   This type of authentication is useful to protect against accidental
   misconfiguration of routers on a LAN.  It protects against routers
   inadvertently backing up another router.  A new router must first be
   configured with the correct password before it can run VRRP with
   another router.  This type of authentication does not protect against
   hostile attacks where the password can be learned by a node snooping
   VRRP packets on the LAN.  The Simple Text Authentication combined
   with the TTL check makes it difficult for a VRRP packet to be sent
   from another LAN to disrupt VRRP operation.

   This type of authentication is RECOMMENDED when there is minimal risk
   of nodes on a LAN actively disrupting VRRP operation.  If this type
   of authentication is used the user should be aware that this clear
   text password is sent frequently, and therefore should not be the
   same as any security significant password.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.3%20IP%20Authentication%20Header"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.3" name="section-10.3">10.3</a> IP Authentication Header</span>

   The use of this authentication type means the VRRP protocol exchanges
   are authenticated using the mechanisms defined by the IP
   Authentication Header [<a href="#ref-AUTH" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>AUTH</a>] using "The Use of HMAC-MD5-96 within ESP
   and AH", [<a href="#ref-HMAC" title='"The Use of HMAC-MD5-96 within ESP and AH"'>HMAC</a>].  This provides strong protection against
   configuration errors, replay attacks, and packet
   corruption/modification.

   This type of authentication is RECOMMENDED when there is limited
   control over the administration of nodes on a LAN.  While this type
   of authentication does protect the operation of VRRP, there are other
   types of attacks that may be employed on shared media links (e.g.,
   generation of bogus ARP replies) which are independent from VRRP and
   are not protected.
