   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is
   unlimited.

Abstract

   The goal of this document is to provide information regarding the
   availability and capability of implementations of X.500.  Comments
   and critiques of this document, and new or updated descriptions of
   X.500 implementations are welcome.  Send them to the Directory
   Information Services Infrastructure (DISI) Working Group
   (disi@merit.edu) or to the editors.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document catalogs currently available implementations of X.500,
   including commercial products and openly available offerings.  It
   contains descriptions of Directory System Agents (DSA), Directory
   User Agents (DUA), and DUA client applications.  The latter can
   include such applications as browsers, DSA management tools, or
   lightweight DUAs that employ an application-level protocol to
   communicate with a DUA (which then in turn communicates with a DSA)
   to support user service.  <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document contains a
   listing of implementations cross referenced by keyword.  This list
   will aid in identifying particular implementations that meet your
   criteria.

   To compile this catalog, the DISI Working Group solicited input from
   the X.500 community by surveying several Internet mailing lists,
   including: iso@nic.ddn.mil, isode@nic.ddn.mil, osi-ds@cs.ucl.ac.uk,
   and disi@merit.edu.

   Readers are encouraged to submit comments regarding both the form and
   content  of  this  memo.  New submissions are always welcome.  Please
   direct input to the parties as described in the Status of  this  Memo
   section.  DISI will produce new versions of this document when a suf-
   ficient number of changes have been received.  This  will  be  deter-
   mined subjectively by the DISI chairperson.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1%20%20Purpose"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>  Purpose</span>

   The growth of existing X.500 pilot activities (e.g., White Pages
   Pilot Project) and the advent of new pilots (e.g., ARRNet Directory
   Services Project, NIST/GSA Pilot Project) are signals that X.500 is a
   viable directory service mechanism for the Internet community.  A
   goal of DISI is to enable the continued growth of X.500 by lowering
   the lack-of-information barrier.  This document takes one step toward
   that goal by providing an easily accessible source of information on
   X.500 implementations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>  Scope</span>

   This document contains descriptions of either commercially or freely
   available X.500 implementations.  It does not provide instructions on
   how to install, run, or manage these implementations.  Because the
   needs and computing environments of each organization differ vastly,
   no recommendations are given.  The descriptions and indices are
   provided to make the readers aware of existing options and to enable
   more informed choices.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3%20Disclaimer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a> Disclaimer</span>

   Implementation descriptions were written by implementors and vendors,
   and not by the members of DISI.  Although DISI has worked with the
   description authors to ensure readability, no guarantees can be made
   regarding the validity of descriptions or the value of said
   implementations.  Caveat emptor.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" name="section-1.4">1.4</a>  Overview</span>

   <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> contains introductory information.

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> contains a list of keywords, their definitions, and a cross
   reference of the X.500 implementations by these keywords.

   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> contains the X.500 implementation descriptions.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> lists the editors' addresses.

   The creation of this catalog would not have been possible without the
   efforts of the description authors and the members of the DISI
   Working Group.  The editors thank you for your hard work and
   constructive feedback.  A special thanks is also extended to the
   members of the NOCTools Working Group.  The "Network Management Tool
   Catalog" (<a href="rfc1147.html">RFC-1147</a>) served as a valuable example.  Bob Stine and Bob
   Enger made key suggestions that enabled us to learn from their
   experiences.

   The efforts of the editors were sponsored by Defense Advanced
   Research Projects Agency Contract Number DACA76-89-D-0002 (Field
   Operational X.500 Project), and U. S. Department of Energy Contract
   Number DE-AC03-76SF00098.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Keywords"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Keywords</span>

   Keywords are abbreviated attributes of the X.500 implementations.
   The list of keywords defined below was derived from the
   implementation descriptions themselves.  Implementations were indexed
   by a keyword either as a result of: 1) explicit, not implied,
   reference to a particular capability in the implementation
   description text, or 2) input from the implementation description
   author(s).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20%20Keyword%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>  Keyword Definitions</span>

   This section contains keyword definitions.  They have been organized
   and grouped by functional category.  The definitions are ordered
   first alphabetically by keyword category, and second alphabetically
   by implementation name within keyword category.

   The index is organized as follows: keywords appear in alphabetical
   order; implementations characterized by that keyword are listed
   alphabetically as well.  Note that a "*" is used to indicate that the
   particular implementation, or feature of the implementation, may not
   be available at this time.

   For formatting purposes, we have used the following abbreviations for
   implementation names: UWisc (University of Wisconsin), HP X.500 DDS
   (HP X.500 Distributed Directory Software), IS X.500 DSA/DSAM,
   DUA(Interactive Systems' X.500 DSA/DSAM, DUA).

ABSTRACT

   Alliance OSI includes XDS (API), DUA, DSA and DIB all as separate
   components.

   Touch's X.500 products have been designed for complete portability to
   any operating system or hardware environment.  The protocols include
   DAP and DSP of the OSI X.500 specification along with the required
   XDS, DUA, DSA and DIB components.  In addition to X.500, Touch sup-
   plies other OSI protocol layers including: ROSE, ACSE, Presentation,
   Session and any of the OSI lower layers (Transport, Network along
   with <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC-1006</a>).  Touch also supplies other application layer proto-
   cols such as X.400, FTAM, CMIP (and general network management), etc.

   The Alliance OSI X.500 is compliant with the CCITT X.500 1988 Recom-
   mendations. The ROSE/ACSE/Presentation/Session stack can be option-
   ally provided by Touch.

   The DUA may represent a single user, or may represent a group of
   users.  It may be attached to a given DSA within the same system but
   is also capable of invoking operations in Touch's or any other
   vendor's compliant DSA on a remote system.  The binding operation
   requires the user to give a distinguished name and password in order
   for the Directory to identify the user.  Once an association is esta-
   blished the user may invoke the following operations: READ, COMPARE,
   ABANDON, LIST, SEARCH, ADD_ENTRY, REMOVE_ENTRY, MODIFY_ENTRY,
   MODIFY_RDN.

   Due to the fact that access to the physical disk is in most  cases  a
   blocking  operation  (synchronous)  Touch  has separated the database
   processing (I/O process) from the DSA protocol entity.  This  separa-
   tion allows the DSA entity to continue processing during the frequent
   database accesses from the DSA. The DSA supports  all  the  Directory
   operations  as specified in the CCITT X.500 specification.  Chaining,
   Referral and Multicasting are provided and supported in the  Alliance
   OSI  DSA.   The DSA supports all the service control options included
   in the operation command arguments.  Filtering  conditions  are  sup-
   ported via the FILTER in the SEARCH operation.

   The Alliance OSI X.500 product supports all the NIST defined manda-
   tory X.500 and X.400 object classes and attributes.

   Alliance OSI X.500 supports all the mandatory Directory attribute
   types (and their associated abstract syntaxes) in the NIST Directory
   implementation profile. Touch has extended the Directory and allows
   users to define private attributes.  This means that a user can util-
   ize the Alliance OSI Directory for a general purpose, user defined
   database activity.

   Touch provides a full set of administration and Directory management
   facilities.

   Touch is in the process of integrating the X.500 product with the
   Worldtalk 400 product. Worldtalk 400 is Touch's end user X.400 mes-
   sage switch, providing gateways between proprietary mail systems
   (SMTP, Microsoft Mail, MHS, cc:mail, etc.) and X.400.  X.500 is a key
   component for a messaging network.

COMPLETENESS

   Strong Authentication is not supported however Simple Authentication
   is supported.

INTEROPERABILITY

   No interoperability testing has been completed as of yet.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Numerous OEMs are using the Alliance OSI X.500 product in product
   development as well as in pilot networks.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   Currently the Alliance OSI X.500 DIB has only been validated within a
   UNIX File System.  The protocol components are portable as is the
   interface between the DSA and the DIB.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   Alliance OSI X.500 can be utilized over TCP/IP and/or OSI Transport
   on LANs and WANs.  Currently X.500 has only been verified over OSI,
   however other Alliance OSI application layers have been configured
   over a <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC-1006</a> which is available as part of the Alliance OSI pro-
   duct line.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   Alliance OSI has been ported to numerous platforms ranging from IBM
   Mainframes MVS to Apple Macintosh.  For UNIX environments Touch has
   portations for 386 AT/Bus, SUN-3 and 4, Mips, and HP.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   As stated above, the Alliance OSI product have been ported to
   numerous systems.  In the UNIX environment the X.500 product exists
   on SUN OS 4.0 and greater, Mips RISC OS, Interactive 386 and HP-UX.

ABSTRACT

   The implementation consists of a set DUA library routines, a terminal
   interface, and a DSA. The implementation was developed in C on Sun 3
   workstations under the UNIX operating system. All underlying services
   are provided by the ISODE development package. The development pack-
   age is also used for encoding and decoding ASN.1 data as well as for
   other data manipulation services. Using the ISODE package the imple-
   mentation can be run over both OSI and TCP/IP protocols.

   The DSA provides full support for both DAP and DSP protocols, confor-
   mant with ISO 9594/CCITT X.500 standards. The DIB is maintained using
   a locally developed relational database system. The interface to the
   database system consists of a set of SQL-like C functions.  These are
   designed to allow straightforward replacement of the local database
   system with a more powerful commercial system. To achieve better per-
   formance several options are supported that permit loading of
   selected portions of the database into core. When these options are
   selected data can be retrieved more quickly from in-core tables; all
   modifications to the DIB are directly reflected in the in-core tables
   and the database.

COMPLETENESS

   To date the Read, Compare, List, Add Entry, and Remove Entry opera-
   tions have been implemented and are supported over both DAP and DSP;
   aliasing and replication are also supported.  The version under
   current development (available January '92) includes simple authenti-
   cation, access control, and the Search operation. The modify opera-

INTEROPERABILITY

   Have successfully interoperated with QUIPU and OSIWARE over the DAP.
   No DSP interoperability testing has been done.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Not tested.

BUGS

   Some testing in the near term future will be done to try to identify
   these, but presently it's not possible to give an accurate list of
   bugs.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   No limitations on file sizes, etc. The only side effects to creating
   large files should be in the area of performance. Specifically,
   optimization requires loading parts of the DIB in core so greater
   memory requirements will be necessary for achieving better perfor-
   mance with a large database.  Any platform the implementation can be
   ported to (generally any platform ISODE can be ported to) should sup-
   port all features.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC-1006</a>; TP4/CLNP (SunLink OSI) over 802 and X.25 (SunLink X.25).

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   It has been run on Sun-3, but there are no known reasons why it
   should not run on any hardware running the ISODE software.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   It requires UNIX and the ISODE software package.  It's been developed
   and tested with ISODE version 6.0 and Sun OS version 4.1.1.  Uses a
   locally developed relational DBMS that should be easily replaceable
   with commercially available relational systems.

AVAILABILITY

   While under continuing development, availability of the implementa-
   tion is limited to organizations making appropriate arrangements with
   NIST.  The implementation will be publicly available when development
   is completed.

ABSTRACT

   DCE/GDS (Distributed Computing Environment/Global Directory Service)
   was based on the original Siemens DIR.X product. It supports full DUA
   and DSA functions for globally unique identifications and for loca-
   tion of objects in the network. It also provides functions to answer
   queries (both yellow-page and white-page) about objects and attribute
   information.  The software implements full DAP and DSP protocols
   specified in X.519.  An ASN.1 compiler and required ACSE, ROSE,
   presentation, session and <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC-1006</a> protocols implementations are also
   included.

   The product has been successfully participated in X.500 Cebit Intero-
   perability tests at 1990 and 1991 Hanover Fairs. It also intero-
   perates with the ISODE QUIPU X.500 implementation.

COMPLETENESS

   Compliant with EWOS Agreements which is being harmonized with OIW
   Agreements.

   Strong authentication in X.509 is not yet implemented. (Password
   scheme is currently used.)

   Consists of both DUA and DSA implementation according to the 88 CCITT
   X.500 and ISO 9594 standard.  The X/Open standard XDS (version 1.0)
   and XOM (version 2.0) interface libraries are also provided.  XDS and
   XOM interfaces are also used to access DCE/CDS (Local Cell Directory
   Service) transparently. A GDA (Global Directory Agent) serves as the
   gateway between the DCE CDS and GDS.

ABSTRACT

   DE (Directory Enquiries) is intended to be a simple-to-use interface,
   suitable for the naive user, and suitable for running as a public
   access dua to provide lowest common denominator access to the Direc-
   tory.  It is a scrolling interface and will thus run on dumb termi-
   nals, even teletypes!  The user is asked to fill in up to 4 questions
   per query: person's name; department; organization; country.  The
   prompts are very verbose -- the intention is that the user should not
   be able get stuck, and information on how to get into the help system
   should always be on the screen.  The help screens (of which there are
   15) are aimed at the non-technical user.  Whilst the outwards appear-
   ance of the interface is simple, a lot of attention has being given
   to mapping the strings the user enters onto X.500 operations in such
   a way that the interface seems to do the "right thing".  An important
   characteristic is the way the interface tries a series of searches,
   gradually relaxing the matching criteria from exact (in some sense),
   to good, through to "fuzzy".  A considerable amount of configuration
   is possible to present the results in locally acceptable formats.

   DE was funded by the COSINE PARADISE project, and DE is used as the
   PARADISE public access dua.  You can test the software by telnet to
   128.86.8.56 and logging in as dua -- no password required.

COMPLETENESS

   The interface is a querying engine only.

INTEROPERABILITY

   DE is built with the ISODE software (release 7.0).  Its interopera-
   bility relies on the correctness of the Quipu libraries.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   The interface is in use as the COSINE Central DUA Service, and is
   used by a number of UK institutions as a public access dua (usually
   over X.29).  It is able to query entries in pilots throughout the
   world.  It is not able to query for entries which are in organiza-
   tions beneath locality entries under country entries.  It is not pos-
   sible to query for people who do not work for organizations.  The
   interface only searches for entries of the following type: organiza-
   tions, organizational units, people, roles, and rooms.

BUGS

   Send bug reports to:

           p.barker@cs.ucl.ac.uk
           helpdesk@paradise.ulcc.ac.uk

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   DE tries to cater well for the general case, at the expense of not
   dealing with the less typical.  The main manifestation of this is
   that the current version will not query under localities immediately
   under the country level.

   It is not possible to display photographs or reproduce sound attri-
   butes.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   Same as ISODE.  ISODE supports TCP/IP, TP0, and X.25.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   Should be the same as ISODE in general.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   DE requires the ISODE (current release 7.0) libraries.

AVAILABILITY

   DE is openly available as part of ISODE and as part of the COSINE DUA
   package.   Available by FTAM and FTP, source code freely available.

ABSTRACT

   This Directory User Agent interface was ported to the VMS operating
   system using ISODE 6.0. It is part of the results of collaboration
   project called ACIDO, between RedIRIS (national network R &amp; D in
   Spain) and the "Facultad de Informatica de Barcelona (Universidad
   Politecnica de Cataluna)".  The main objective of this development
   was to provide access to the directory to all those affiliated cen-
   tres to the Spanish National R &amp; D network using VMS machines. Any
   other use of this software it is no within RedIRIS objectives and
   therefore it is not RedIRIS responsibility.

COMPLETENESS

   The same as DUA (QUIPU 6.1).

INTEROPERABILITY

   QUIPU 6.1

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Used in RedIRIS Directory Pilot Project to access the DSAs (QUIPU).

BUGS

   You can report bugs to: isode@fib.upc.es

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   The interface is equivalent to the UNIX one except for the option
   -pipe which is not supported.

ABSTRACT

   The DIXIE protocol is used to give X.500 access to platforms that
   have only TCP/IP access.  The DIXIE server is an intermediate proto-
   col server that communicates with Internet clients on one side using
   a text-based UDP/TCP protocol and an X.500 DSA on the other side
   using DAP.  The protocol is fully described in <a href="rfc1246.html">RFC 1246</a>.  A subset of
   the X.500 DAP is exported to the clients through the DIXIE protocol.
   There is a DIXIE API provided in the form of a library of C-callable
   routines.

   The DIXIE protocol and server are being used by the following
   products/projects:

     UD, a simple command line white pages DUA for Unix machines (dis-
     tributed with the DIXIE server)

     maX.500, a white pages DUA for the Macintosh (available from the
     same place as the DIXIE server)

     Network monitoring of DSAs by our Network Operations Center

     Lookup and display of caller identification based on telephone
     caller ID (using ISDN).

COMPLETENESS

   The DIXIE protocol does not support access to all X.500 features and
   operations.  All DAP operations except Abandon are supported.  Gen-
   eral searches (including multiple component searches) are supported.
   The DIXIE protocol supports none and simple authentication.  A subset
   of the service controls are supported.

INTEROPERABILITY

   The current implementation of the DIXIE server works with the QUIPU
   DSA and DAP library.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   The DIXIE server has been tested in the Internet and PARADISE pilots.
   It provides full DUA Connectivity subject to the limitations dis-
   cussed above under completeness.

BUGS

   There are no known outstanding bugs.  But reports should be sent to
   x500@umich.edu.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   None, aside from those mentioned above under completeness.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   DIXIE clients use TCP or UDP to communicate with the DIXIE server.
   The DIXIE server uses <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC-1006</a> with TCP/IP to communicate with the
   DSA, though other transport mechanisms for DSA communication should
   be possible.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   The DIXIE server is known to run on Sun 3, Sun 4, and DEC 3100 plat-
   forms.  It should run on any UNIX platform.  The DIXIE library is
   known to run on the same platforms, and also on the Macintosh.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   The DIXIE server and library is known to run under SunOS 3.5, SunOS
   4.1.1, Ultrix 4.1 and 4.2.  The DIXIE library also runs on the Macin-
   tosh System Software 6 or later.

AVAILABILITY

   This software is openly available.  It may be obtained by anonymous
   FTP from terminator.cc.umich.edu in the directory ~ftp/x500. Documen-
   tation on the DIXIE protocol is provided along with the source code,
   which includes source for the DIXIE server, DIXIE library, and the UD
   client.

ABSTRACT

   DS-520 X.500 Distributed Directory Services for UNIX System V and
   DS-521 X.500 Directory User Agent (DUA) for UNIX System V form an
   integral part of the Retix OSI Networking Products family.  Designed
   for systems vendors, public carriers, and other OEMs, DS-520 is a
   complete high-performance implementation of X.500 in source code
   form, including a DUA, DSA Manager (DSAM), and DSA.  DS-521
   represents a subset of this product offering. It provides the DUA
   portal into the directory, which, for example, meets the needs of
   software vendors who plan to provide application packages with X.500
   Directory interaction capabilities. Within these two offerings, the
   DUA possesses two forms of interface. The first form, the DUA with
   User Interface, provides an interactive character-based user inter-
   face for users of Directory services.  The user agent provides access
   to the Directory via basic Directory service requests. The second
   form, the DUA with Programmatic Interface provides a standardized
   programmatic interface to application programs that must access
   Directory information. The interface is conformant to the X/Open
   Object Management (XOM) and X/Open Directory Services (XDS) stan-
   dards. This component provides all functionality related to Directory
   access and general OSI services down to the session layer. The DSAM
   provides an interactive character oriented user interface to a Direc-
   tory administrator.  The DSAM provides management functions either
   local to or remote from a DSA. Both the DUA and the DSAM are useful
   in the training, management, and manipulation of Directory entries
   maintaining operational and user attribute information. The DSA main-
   tains Directory database information and provides users the ability
   to read/compare, modify, search, and manage entries within the data-
   base. It maintains all or fragments of the Directory Information Base
   (DIB) and provides abstract service ports for DUAs and DSAs over DAP
   and DSP protocols respectively.

COMPLETENESS

   DS-520 represents a complete implementation of the 1988 X.500 Recom-
   mendations with the exception of strong authentication as outlined in
   X.509. It is conformant to NIST, EWOS, and UK GOSIP Directory pro-
   files. It provides session through application layer protocol support
   and hence incorporates ROSE, ACSE, Presentation, and Session within
   its product stack. In addition to including all the attribute types,
   syntaxes, and object classes defined in X.520 and X.521, the DS-520
   includes support for those specified in the 1988 X.400 Recommendation
   X.402, Annex A. Remote on-line management of the DSA is supported by
   means of Network Management Forum CMIP.

   DS-521 represents a complete implementation of the X/Open Object
   Management (OM) and X/Open Directory Services (XDS) standards. It
   also incorporates session through application layer protocol support
   and thus includes ROSE, ACSE, Presentation, and Session within its
   product stack.

INTEROPERABILITY

   The DS-520 has been tested to interoperate with Banyan (DAP), CDC
   (DSP), IBM, ICL, OSIWare, Nixdorff, Unisys (DSP), Wollongong (DAP),
   and 3-Com (DSP).

   The DS-521 subset has undergone no separate interoperability testing.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DSA Connectivity provided by the DS-520: The DSA provides complete
   support for the X.511 Abstract Service Definition, the directoryAc-
   cessAC and the directorySystemAC defined in the X.519 Protocol
   Specifications, and the Distributed Directory defined in the X.518
   Procedures for the Distributed Directory. It supports all the object
   classes, attribute types, and attribute syntaxes defined in X.520 and
   X.521. It does not support the Internet DSP however.

   DUA Connectivity provided by both the DS-520 and DS-521: The DUA pro-
   vides complete support for the X.511 Abstract Service Definition and
   the directoryAccessAC defined in the X.519 Protocol Specifications.
   The DUA with User Interface supports only a subset of the X.500
   attributes and object classes defined in X.520 and X.521. The DUA
   with Programmatic Interface, however, does support all the object
   classes, attribute types, and attribute syntaxes defined in these two
   recommendations.

BUGS

   Product Action Requests (PARs) stemming externally from customers and
   internally from customer service and quality assurance engineers are
   generated and published in the form of weekly reports. A description
   and status of these PARs are provided to customers possessing
   software maintenance agreements.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   DS-520 and DS-521 are source code products ported to UNIX System V
   Release 3 and 4. Makefiles to generate the system are provided for
   the AT&amp;T System V, SCO, and Interactive UNIX systems.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   DS-520 and DS-521 offer two main compile time configuration options
   and hence internetworking configurations. In the first of these, they
   interface to the UNIX System V Transport Library Interface (TLI).
   The TLI provides a path between the session layer of a UNIX OSI
   application process and an OSI transport provider installed in the
   UNIX kernel. The latter transport provider may take the form of a
   Retix Unix LAN (LT-610) or WAN (WT-325) transport product. The second
   main option utilizes the UNIX System V ACSE/Presentation Library
   interface (APLI and the A/P Library), which provides OSI ACSE and
   Presentation layer services. The Retix AP-240 Presentation syntax
   manager product serves to map the standard Retix Presentation layer
   interface to the AT&amp;T APLI. The APLI upper layers services may be
   provided by the Retix UL-220 product. UL-220 is the Retix implementa-
   tion of the AT&amp;T Open Networking Platform Upper Layer Services module
   and includes the A/P library, as well as the OSI ACSE, Presentation,
   and Session services.

   DS-520 and DS-521 may also run on top of the TCP/IP stack by means of
   the Retix MP-120 product. MP-120 is a STREAMS based driver that
   implements <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC-1006</a> and thus allows OSI applications to run over a
   network based on the Internet suite of protocols (TCP/IP). Its main
   function provides a conversion between the TCP stream to the data
   packets required by OSI Transport Class 0 protocol and vice versa. As
   part of this process, it converts TCP/IP 32-bit addresses to hex
   values for use with OSI applications.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   Being source code products ported to the UNIX System V Release 3  and
   4  operating system environment, DS-520 and DS-521 are hardware plat-
   form independent. They currently both have sample portations and test
   configurations on various Intel 80386 platforms running Unix System V
   Release 3 and 4.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   Currently, DS-520 and DS-521 include reference implementations for
   the AT&amp;T System V Release 4, SCO UNIX System V/386 Version 3.2.2, and
   the Interactive UNIX System V/386 Version 2.2 operating systems.
   Raima Corporation's db_Vista III Version 3.1 serves as the database
   engine for the Directory product.

ABSTRACT

   HP's Distributed Directory Software is a fully distributed Directory
   that supports both the DAP and DSP protocols, which were specified in
   the 1988 CCITT/ISO X.500 documents.  Besides implementing the stan-
   dard, we have also put in proprietary access control and replication.
   These additional features will be migrated to the standard definition
   at the time that they are stable.  Users are able to define their own
   attributes, objects classes and DIT structure rules.

   In order to make this software easy to use a set of menu driven
   screens have been provided.  There are easy to use data access and
   data management screens.  For system administrators, these is also a
   set for screens that are used to help configure the servers and
   manage the schema. Startup and Shutdown utilities are also included.

   For application developers an X/Open-APIA XDS API is provided, along
   with some helper routines that help reduce development time.  The XDS
   API includes the following functions:

           Bind
           Read
           Search
           Add
           Remove
           Unbind
           Version

   A subset of the X/Open-APIA Object Management (XOM) functions are
   available thru the interface.  The subset are those that are neces-
   sary to perform the directory operations.

   For bulk operations a batch interface is also available.

ABSTRACT

   maX.500 is a Macintosh X.500 directory application useful for
   displaying and modifying white pages information about people.  It
   runs on top of the DIXIE protocol (described in <a href="rfc1246.html">RFC 1246</a>).  maX.500
   is currently in production release 1.1 within the University of
   Michigan and several other places.

   Features include the ability to display and modify the following
   attributes: title, description, commonName, uid, mail, postalAddress,
   homePostalAddress, telephoneNumber, facsimileTelephoneNumber, home-
   Phone.  Photos can also be displayed.  The software also provides
   access to the finger protocol.  Various preferences are user-
   tailorable, including caching.

COMPLETENESS

   maX.500 uses the DIXIE protocol to access X.500 and thus is subject
   to the same completeness restrictions as DIXIE.  It provides Read,
   Search, and Modify capabilities.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Works with the DIXIE server, which works with the QUIPU DSA and DAP
   library.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   It has been tested (in conjunction with the DIXIE server) in both the
   Internet and PARADISE pilots.

BUGS

   No outstanding bugs are known.  But reports should be sent to
   x500@itd.umich.edu.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   maX.500 is heavily oriented to white pages information and thus gen-
   eral access to the DIXIE protocol is not provided.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   maX.500 uses the DIXIE protocol and thus TCP to communicate with the
   DIXIE server.  The Macintosh needs to have MacTCP installed.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   Mac Plus or newer machine with one megabyte or more of memory.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   Apple System Software 6.0 or above (including System 7), with MacTCP
   installed.

AVAILABILITY

ABSTRACT

   OSI-DSA provides a Directory System agent for controlled access to
   the OSI Directory Information Base.  It provides full support for the
   joint ISO/IEC IS-9594 International standard and CCITT X.500 Recom-
   mendations 1988 protocols necessary for implementing the Directory
   Information Base distributed across a number of DSA's.

   The product also includes an Administration User interface program,
   to allow a human administrator to construct and maintain the local
   Directory Information.

   Specific features provided by the Directory System Agent include:

       (i)    Support of the directoryAccessAC and directorySystemAC
              application contexts (i.e. both Directory Access Protocol
              (DAP) and Directory System Protocol (DSP)

       (ii)   Bind Security levels of none and simple unprotected.

       (iii)  Capability of acting as a first level DSA.

       (iv)   Support for chaining and multi-casting where necessary in
              handling distributed operations. Also supports the return
              of referrals.

       (v)    Support for all attribute types and syntaxes defined in
              X.520.  Users are also able to define their own attributes
              and syntaxes.

       (vi)   Support for all the object classes and attribute sets
              defined in X.521.  Users are also able to define their own
              object classes and attribute sets.  Support is also pro-
              vided for a NAME-BINDING specification, for defining the

              Directory Information Tree (DIT) structure.

       (vii)  An access control mechanism based on the ISO  access  con-
              trol  working  papers  to  allow for controlled access and
              maintenance of Directory entries and attributes.

       (viii) Logging of errors and significant Directory events, as
              well as optional trace information.

       (ix)   The OSI-DSA utilizes the services of ROSE (X.219) and ACSE
              (X.217) as defined in clause 8 of X.519

   The Administration program provides the following functions

       (i)    An interface to each of the basic Directory Operations of
              Read, Compare, List, Search, Add, Modify, ModifyRDN.

       (ii)   A Dump/Load utility to dump the information in the local
              DIB into an ASCII file and load it again into the DIB from
              such a file.

       (iii)  Knowledge Reference maintenance facilities to Add, Delete
              Modify and Read all types of Knowledge References.

       (iv)   Facilities to control the operation of local Directory
              processes.

       (v)    Control over the level of logging and tracing.

COMPLETENESS

   The OSI-DSA provides all functionality defined in, and is fully con-
   formant to, the joint ISO/IEC IS-9594 International standard and
   CCITT X.500 Recommendations 1988, and the NIST 1988 Stable agreements
   on Directory Services.

   The only exception is that no support is provided for strong authen-
   tication or digital signatures.

   Conformance with respect to clause 9 of X.519:

       (i)    The DSA supports both the directoryAccessAC and directo-
              rySystemAC application contexts.

       (ii)   The DSA is capable of acting as a first-level DSA.

       (iii)  The chained mode of operation as defined in X.518 is sup-
              ported.

              are supported.  Users are also able to define their own
              object classes and attribute sets.  Support is also pro-
              vided for a NAME-BINDING specification, for defining the
              Directory Information Tree (DIT) structure.

       (vii)  The DSA conforms to all the static requirements defined in
              clause 9.2.2 of X.519

       (viii) The DSA conforms to all the dynamic requirements defined
              in clause 9.2.3 of X.519

INTEROPERABILITY

   The product was demonstrated at "Interop 91" in San Jose, October
   1991 as part of the OSI Showcase demo involving several vendors'
   directory products.

   Informal interoperability has been achieved against the ISODE 6.0
   QUIPU Directory implementation.  Interoperability testing against
   other vendors is in progress.

   Formal interoperability testing is awaiting the soon to be completed
   OSInet X.500 interoperability test suite.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Not tested.

BUGS

   Full customer support is provided via your local Unisys Customer Ser-
   vices Organization.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   Results returned via the OSI-DSA are presently limited to 32K in the
   current release, which is in line with the 1988 NIST agreements.

   Patches for the Unix V.4 release may be made available on request to
   raise this limit to 1Mb.

   The product currently does not provide any support for replication,
   although development work is in progress, based on the current ISO
   Draft proposal for Replication.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   OSI-DSA runs over all communications environments supported by the
   Unisys OSI stack product (see Software platforms). Currently these
   support TP0, TP2, TP3 and TP4 over X.25 and TP4 over CLNP on 802.3
   and X.25.  Support for <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC1006</a> over TCP/IP is under development.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   The product is available on all Unisys Unix 6000 Series machines.

   Source code is available for portation to non-Unisys platforms.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   The product is distributed and supported for Unix System V.3 and Unix
   System V.4.

   On Unix V.3, it requires the Unisys Application Presentation Service
   OSI stack software (APS), and Unisys Transport Network Service
   software (TNS).  On Unix V.4, it requires the integrated Unisys OSI
   stack software product (STK).  These services are accessed via the
   ROSLI (ROSE) and APLI (ACSE) programming interfaces which are
   currently the subject of standardization efforts by XOpen and Unix
   International.

   A runtime version of either the Informix or Oracle relational data-
   base products is required for the Directory Information Base.

ABSTRACT

   OSI-DUA is a Unix C Program interface library. It allows OSI or user
   applications to access the services of an X.500 conformant Directory,
   by making calls to a library of C routines.

   Specific features provided by this program interface library are as
   follows:

       (i)    Connection to any remote X.500 conformant DSA via an OSI
              stack, or connection to a co-resident Unisys OSI DSA via
              IPC mechanisms.

       (ii)   All operations defined in the directoryAccessAC applica-
              tion context (Bind, UnBind, Read, Compare, Search, List,
              AddEntry, ModifyEntry, ModifyRDN, Abandon, DeleteEntry).

       (iii)  Directory Bind security levels of none and simple unpro-
              tected.

       (iv)   Execution of both blocking and non-blocking operations.
              (A non-blocking call to the library will return immedi-
              ately, allowing for results to be obtained once the opera-
              tion has completed)

       (v)    Acceptance of multiple concurrent non-blocked operations
              on the one user session.

       (vi)   The DUA utilizes the services of ROSE (X.219) and ACSE
              (X.217) as defined in clause 8 of X.519

COMPLETENESS

   When communicating with a Remote DSA the DUA library is fully confor-
   mant with the Directory Access Protocol detailed in the X.500
   Recommendations/IS-9594 standards.

   Conformance with respect to clause 9 of X.519:

       (i)    All operations defined in the  directoryAccessAC  applica-
              tion  context  (Bind, UnBind, Read, Compare, Search, List,
              AddEntry, ModifyEntry,  ModifyRDN,  Abandon,  DeleteEntry)
              are supported.

       (ii)   Directory Bind security levels of none and  simple  unpro-
              tected are supported.

       (iii)  The directoryAccessAC application context is supported  as
              specified in clause 7 of X.519.

       (iv)   The DUA conforms to the mapping onto used services as  de-
              fined in clause 8 of X.519.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Informal interoperability has been achieved against the ISODE 6.0
   QUIPU Directory implementation.  Interoperability testing against
   other vendors is in progress.

   Formal interoperability testing is awaiting the soon to be completed
   OSInet X.500 interoperability test suite.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   The present OSI-DUA does not provide for the  automatic  handling  of
   referrals  by  the  interface library. However interface routines are
   provided which allow referrals to be acted upon by the user  applica-
   tion.

   An XOpen XDS conformant interface is currently under development.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   OSI-DUA runs over all communications environments supported by the
   Unisys OSI stack product (see Software platforms). Currently these
   support TP0, TP2, TP3 and TP4 over X.25 and TP4 over CLNP on 802.3

ABSTRACT

   POD (POpup Directory) is an X.500 DUA interface for the X Window Sys-
   tem.  POD is a first attempt at a multiwindow directory tool. It
   offers a simplified interfaces to the basic X.500 operations of read,
   search, list and modify entry.

   POD does not provide any sophisticated access to the DSA.  Operations
   are performed synchronously.  The Directory is thus presented as is,
   i.e.  a hierarchical tree of information, with the user required to
   "navigate" the DIT in order to locate required information.

   POD is available as part of the ISODE release from version 6.0
   onwards.

COMPLETENESS

   88 standard: strong authentication not implemented

INTEROPERABILITY

   Believed to be compliant, though untested.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DUA Connectivity: POD is in use in many directory pilots, certainly
   including PARADISE and the Internet.

ABSTRACT

   psiwp is a Macintosh Front End to White Pages service.  It is a
   graphical user interface implementing a partial-DUA.  It is based on
   the ISODE QUIPU X.500 implementation and the Directory Assistance
   Protocol (DAP).

   psiwp is a Macintosh application tailored specifically to provide
   easy access to the Directory for the purposes of performing White
   Pages searches.  Implements User-Friendly Naming scheme developed in
   IETF OSI-DS Working Group.

   psiwp implements a Directory Assistance Protocol (DAP) client.

COMPLETENESS

   Compliant with X.500 standards to the extent that the QUIPU implemen-
   tation is.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Successfully interoperates with QUIPU DSAs

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Being used in the White Pages Pilot Project.

BUGS

   Support is available (for registered users of psiwp only) from
   psiwp-help@psi.com.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   psiwp is not a general-purpose DUA. It was designed to be a special-
   purpose front-end for performing White Pages searches and thus, in
   the interests of simplification, does not provide the full range of
   functionality supported by the X.500 standard. A Directory Assistance
   server (available as part of the ISODE distribution) must also be run
   by sites that do not want to run psiwp against either of the two
   White Pages Pilot Project service machines, wp1.psi.net and
   wp2.psi.net.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   Runs on Macintoshes as a Finder or MultiFinder application.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   Runs on Macintoshes that support MacTCP. Requires an ethernet board
   or AppleTalk connectivity. At least 1MB of memory is required, and
   while psiwp will run on most forms of Macintoshes, a Mac-II is recom-
   mended.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   Requires MacTCP 1.0 or later, and Finder (or Multifinder) 6.x (Finder
   7.0 WILL NOT WORK). Requires ISODE Version 6.8 or later.

AVAILABILITY

   psiwp is shareware available for anonymous ftp from uu.psi.com
   [136.161.128.3] in pilot/PSIWP.Hqx.  A nominal fee is charged upon
   registration as a PSIWP user.

   Source code to the psiwp application may be licensed from PSI Inc.

ABSTRACT

   QUIPU is part of the ISODE which is an openly available implementa-
   tion of the upper layers of OSI.  QUIPU provides a X.500 Directory
   System Agent (DSA) and a set of Directory User Agents (DUA) aimed at
   different terminal types and modes of interaction

   QUIPU was first publicly demonstrated at ESPRIT in November 1988.
   QUIPU is being used extensively in the European PARADISE project, the
   White Pages Pilot Project and the Australian pilot.  A QUIPU DSA is
   being used at the ROOT node of the Pilot DIT and is being used as
   most country level DSAs.

   QUIPU provides its own solutions to area not specified by the 1988
   standards such as replication and access control.

COMPLETENESS

   QUIPU is aligned to the 1988 ISO IS and the NIST OIW Directory Imple-
   mentors Guide Version 1, with the following exceptions:

       Strong authentication is not implemented.

       QUIPU does not enforce the bounds constraints on attributes,
       filters or APDU size.

       T.61 string formatting characters are not rejected.

       If a DN is supplied with no password in an unprotected simple
       bind, QUIPU does not always check to see if the DN exists.  If
       the DSA connected to can say authoritatively the DN does not
       exist, the association is rejected.  However, if a chain opera-
       tion is required to check the DN, the bind IS allowed.

       When comparing attributes of UTCtime syntax, if the seconds field
       is omitted, QUIPU does not perform the match correctly (i.e., the
       seconds field in the attribute values should be ignored, but  are
       not).

       QUIPU always supplies the optional Chaining argument ``origina-
       tor'' even if the CommonArgument ``requestor'' is used.

       QUIPU always supplies the optional Chaining argument ``target''
       even if the base object in the DAP arguments is the same.

       The object class ``without an assigned object identifier'' is not
       recognized unless the ``alias'' object class is also present.

       Non Specific Subordinate References are never followed by a QUIPU
       DSA, but they are passed on correctly to the client if generated.

INTEROPERABILITY

   QUIPU has interworked with a number of other implementations, and has
   no know problems in such interworking.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   QUIPU is in use in many directory pilots, certainly including PARAD-
   ISE and the White Pages Pilot Project.

BUGS

   Problems should be reported to quipu-support@cs.ucl.ac.uk.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   None.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   QUIPU users TP0 over X.25, CONS and TCP (using <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC-1006</a>) or TP4 over
   SunLink OSI.

   The DSA knows about the problems of unconnected networks and makes
   chain/refer choices based on the network connectivity.  Using this an
   X.25 only DSA can access data from an Internet only DSA by chaining
   operations through a DSA connected to both networks.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   [No information provided--Ed.]

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   The ISODE and QUIPU runs on native Berkeley (4.2, 4.3) and AT&amp;T Sys-
   tem V, in addition to various other UNIX-like operating systems.  No
   kernel modifications are required.

AVAILABILITY

   The ISODE is not proprietary, but it is not in the public domain.
   This was necessary to include a "hold harmless" clause in the
   release.  The upshot of all this is that anyone can get a copy of the
   release and do anything they want with it, but no one takes any
   responsibility whatsoever for any (mis)use.

DISTRIBUTION SITES

   The FTP or FTAM distributions of ISODE-7.0 consists of 3 files. The
   source and main ISODE-7.0 distribution is in the file isode-7.tar.Z
   which is approximately 4.7MB in size.

   LaTeX source for the entire document set can be found in the isode-
   7-doc.tar.Z file (3.5MB).  A list of documents can be found in the
   doc/ directory of the source tree.

   A Postscript version of the five volume manual can be found in the
   isode-7-ps.tar.Z file (4.7MB).

   1.  FTP
          If you can FTP to the Internet, then use anonymous FTP to
          uu.psi.com [136.161.128.3] to retrieve the files in BINARY
          mode from the isode/ directory.

   2.  NIFTP
          If you run NIFTP over the public X.25 or over JANET, and are
          registered in the NRS at Salford, you can use NIFTP with usen-
          rame "guest" and your own name as password, to access
          UK.AC.UCL.CS to retrieve the files from the &lt;SRC&gt; directory

   3.  FTAM on the JANET, IXI or PSS
          The sources are available by FTAM from UCL over X.25 using

                  JANET (DTE 00000511160013),
                  IXI   (DTE 20433450420113) or
                  PSS   (DTE 23421920030013)

ABSTRACT

   SD (Screen Directory) is an X.500 DUA interface for character mapped
   screens.  SD is an early attempt to provide quick, easy and user
   friendly access to the Directory.  The following directory operations
   are supported: read, search and list.

   SD does not provide any sophisticated access to the DSA.  Operations
   are performed synchronously.  The Directory is thus presented as is,
   i.e.  a hierarchical tree of information, with the user required to
   "navigate" the DIT in order to locate required information.

   SD is available as part of the ISODE release from version 6.0
   onwards.

COMPLETENESS

   88 standard: strong authentication not implemented

INTEROPERABILITY

   Believed to be compliant, though untested.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DUA Connectivity: SD is in use in many directory pilots, certainly
   including PARADISE and the Internet.

NAME

   UCOM.X 500 (tm)
   E3.X

LAST MODIFIED

   November, 1991

KEYWORDS

   API, Bull, Commercially Available, DEC Ultrix, DSA/DUA, HP, IBM PC,
   IBM RISC, Multiple Vendor Platforms, Philips, <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC-1006</a>, Siemens, Sun,
   UNIX, X.25

ABSTRACT

   UCOM.X 500 includes a Directory System Agent (DSA), a directory
   access API, and a set of Directory User Agents (DUAs) for different
   terminal types. UCOM.X 500 is a commercial product based on PIZARRO,
   the research prototype developed at INRIA by Christian Huitema's
   team.

   Some characteristics of the DSA are:

       - The DAP and DSP protocols are provided conformant with the 1988
       CCITT X.500 recommendations.

       - The DIB is maintained in ASN.1 encoded format in the Unix file
       system. Utilities are provided to load and dump the DIB from and
       to ASCII text files.

       - The DIT structure is held in main memory. Additionally, fre-
       quently used attributes may be held in inverted tables in memory
       to speed up searches.

       - Knowledge management: knowledge on managed domains is stored in
       UCOM.X specific attributes of the DSA entries.

       - All X.500 (88) as well as some X.400 (88) object classes,
       attributes and syntaxes are supported. Users may define their own
       classes and attribute types.

       - Schema management: object class and attribute definitions are
       enforced.

       - Simple authentication is provided; strong authentication is not
       currently supported.

       - Access control: private mechanisms are provided to allow access
       control lists to be specified for parts of the DIT, to control
       modifications, and to specify access restrictions on attributes.

   The UCOM.X 500 API provides the DAP protocol to applications access-
   ing the Directory. It is a synchronous API which automatically
   manages referrals. Several DUAs using the API, are available. These
   include command line and full screen interfaces for users with ordi-
   nary terminals, and an X-Windows user interface (12/91). An X/Open
   XDS API will be offered shortly.

   UCOM.X 500 is used by French research centers involved in PARADISE, a
   COSINE project. A distributed application to control document
   transfer in a large French hospital, has been built on the UCOM.X 500
   API. It is being used for distributed applications management in the
   French Post Office.

COMPLETENESS

   UCOM.X 500 conforms to 1988 X.500 series of recommendations, as
   specified in paragraph 9 of X.519, with the exception of strong
   authentication.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Interoperability tests with other implementations, e.g. QUIPU, have
   been made in the PARADISE project. UCOM.X 500 is used in the French
   PARADISE pilot.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DSA and DUA connectivity to the PARADISE pilots.  See caveats.

BUGS

   UCOM.X 500 is a commercial product. As such, it is supported and bugs
   are fixed when detected. Bug reports can be sent to our support team
   via electronic mail.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   The DIT structure is stored in main memory which means that the order
   of magnitude of the number of objects supported per DSA is 10,000. By
   1992 100,000 objects will be supported.

   Not all syntaxes defined in the COSINE and Internet Schema are
   currently supported, and the DUAs do not display photo attributes.
   The Internet DSP is not supported.

ABSTRACT

   ud is a command line based directory application useful for display-
   ing and modifying white pages information about people.  It runs on
   top of the DIXIE protocol (described in <a href="rfc1246.html">RFC 1246</a>).  ud was developed
   to run under Unix and is currently in beta release within U-M staff
   and a few other places that have heard of it.

   Features include the ability to display and modify the following
   attributes: title, description, commonName, uid, mail, postalAddress,
   homePostalAddress, telephoneNumber, facsimileTelephoneNumber, home-
   Phone.

COMPLETENESS

   ud uses the DIXIE protocol to access X.500 and thus is subject to the
   same completeness restrictions as DIXIE.  It provides Read, Search,
   and Modify capabilities.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Works with the DIXIE server, which works with the QUIPU DSA and DAP
   library.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   It has been tested (in conjunction with the DIXIE server) in both the
   Internet and PARADISE pilots.

BUGS

   No outstanding bugs are known.  But reports should be sent to
   x500@itd.umich.edu.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   ud is heavily oriented to white pages information and thus general
   access to the DIXIE protocol is not provided.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   ud uses the DIXIE protocol and thus TCP to communicate with the DIXIE
   server.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   ud is known to run on Sun 3s, Sun 4s, and Vaxen.

ABSTRACT

   VTT X.500 contains a full distributed DSA and a subroutine call to
   dua ( call_dua(parameters)). This subroutine is linked to user's pro-
   cess.  There are two ways for dua to communicate with our DSA called
   dsacvops: a fast communication through shared memory for dua and dsa
   in the same computer and a complete OSI-stack for communicating in
   DAP-protocol with remote dsa's which can be any implementation of
   X.500 dsa, not necessarily dsacvops.  DSA communicates with other
   dsas through a full OSI-stack with protocol DSP or with a shorter
   stack when both dsas are dsacvops-processes.  dsacvops contains a
   special purpose database DIB. VTT X500 contains caching of read and
   search results, access controls (as in Annex F of X.501), object
   classes and attribute types as in X.520 and X.521 and simple authen-
   tication with unprotected passwords in bind. The network level can be
   X.25 or TCP/IP. There are test duas, duacvops, duauser, with a simple
   user interface. Certificates for strong authentication are included
   to x509dua and x509duacvops. VTT X500 is realized with program
   development tools CVOPS and CASN, the code is in C-language and uses
   UNIX System V. The code is fairly easy to port to other operating
   systems.  VTT X500 was made for Smail e-mail product of Nokia Data
   Systems.

COMPLETENESS

   Complete DAP and DSP of 1988 X.500 Recommendations are implemented.
   There are the following omissions: multicasting is not implemented,
   strong authentication of calls to dsa (optional signing of DAP and
   DSP-calls, strong authentication in bind, security error, security
   parameters in common arguments), T61 alternative in CASE IGNORE and
   CASE EXACT STRING, Criteria-syntax, TeletexTerminalIdentifier syntax.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Interoperability with ISODE QUIPU 6.0 has been tested, no formal test
   suite was used.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Not tested: It should work in principle, but has not been tested.

BUGS

   No known bugs at the moment.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   Object identifiers for object classes and attribute types can
   currently have only the form {2 5 6 x} or {2 5 4 x}, x&lt;256. Changing
   the directory schema requires code writing.

ABSTRACT

   WIN/DS is an implementation of OSI Directory Services aligned with
   the ISO 1988 X.500 IS and NIST Stable Implementors Agreements. WIN/DS
   includes both a Directory User Agent (DUA) and a  Directory System
   Agent (DSA). The product supports all Directory Services operations,
   object classes and attributes.  It provides support for managing the
   Directory Information Tree (DIT) with facilities to control structure
   rules and their enforcement.  WIN/DS also provides solutions to areas
   not specified by the 1988 standards, such as replication and access
   control.

COMPLETENESS

   Wollongong closely follows the NIST OIW Stable Implementors' Agree-
   ments.  See also QUIPU.

INTEROPERABILITY

   WIN/DS has interoperated with other X.500 implementations at trade
   shows (CeBIT and Interop) and at strategic customer sites.

ABSTRACT

   The DUA process runs on 3Com's dual-stack OSI/TCP terminal server,
   scheduled to be released in mid-June 1991.  It provides Presentation
   Address resolution for names, on behalf of the VTP application: when
   the user attempts an outgoing connection ("VTP &lt;name&gt;" or "connect
   &lt;name&gt;"), &lt;name&gt; gets mapped to its Presentation Address.

   The DUA process supports the AddEntry, RemoveEntry, and Search opera-
   tions.  Via a menu-driven command, the system administrator can con-
   figure any of these operations, then send the request to the DSA.  He
   would use the AddEntry operation to enter a resource name and its
   corresponding physical address in the DIB, the DeleteEntry operation
   to remove the name and its physical address, and the Search operation
   (with "filter" as an option) for a display of all registered names
   or, given a name, a display of the name's physical address.

   Regarding unbinding from a DSA, the system administrator could use an
   UnbindDSA command or set a timer which, once expired, would automati-
   cally perform the unbinding.  The binding to a DSA, on the other
   hand, is transparent, provided the system administrator has set a DSA
   address.  The binding is triggered by either an outgoing connection
   attempt or an operation request sent to the DSA.

   The schema supported by the DUA consists of the following sequence of
   object classes: Country, Organization, OrganizationalUnit (up to 3
   levels of OrganizationalUnits are allowed), ApplicationProcess, and
   ApplicationEntity.  Their respective attributes are CountryName,
   OrganizationName, OrganizationUnitName, CommonName, and Presenta-
   tionAddress.  The CommonName of the ApplicationEntity is always "vt"
   for VTP and is transparent to the system administrator.

COMPLETENESS

   Compliance with the ISO/IEC 9594 standards.
   Handling referrals not yet implemented.
   Schema supported: Country, Organization, OrganizationalUnit,
                     ApplicationProcess, and ApplicationEntity.
   Authentication not supported.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Interoperability with the ISODE QUIPU Directory Service and any DSA
   which strictly meets the ISO/IEC 9495 standards.

BUGS

   [No information provided--Ed.]

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   Deleting an entry will fail if the DUA is interacting with a 6.0
   based version of QUIPU.  This is a bug in QUIPU, and version 7.0
   release will have it fixed.

   Adding a CountryName is disallowed if the DUA is bound to QUIPU.
   This decision was made because to add a country in QUIPU, one needs
   to bind as the manager of the DSA holding the root EDB file, and such
   information may not always be available to the system administrator.
   Also, our binding is done transparently.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   OSI environments with the complete OSI stack, supporting CLNS and
   TP4.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   3Com's OSI/TCP CS/2000 and CS/2100.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   The "SW/2000-OT Vers 1.0" software runs on 3Com's OSI/TCP CS/2000 and
   CS/2100, both stand-alone systems.

ABSTRACT

   Xdi is a Directory User Agent (DUA) for the X Window System.  In
   addition to providing a user-friendly interface,it supports Directory
   interactions of different levels of complexity. Users can select dif-
   ferent window screens to browse, search and modify the Directory.
   There are two different search screens for name based search and
   attribute based search. It is simple to use for novice users but is
   also useful for more advanced users to formulate complex search
   filters.  Xdi also supports "user-friendly naming" in many cases so
   that users are not required to know X.500 naming format.

COMPLETENESS

   The Xdi interface does not support accesses to Delete and Add DAP
   operations as in the 88 Directory Standard. Read, Search, and most
   Modify operations are fully supported. There are no facilities to
   modify the RDNs of entries. Strong authentication is not implemented.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Believed to be compliant. Only tested against ISODE/QUIPU DSAs.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   None known.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   Same as ISODE.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   This software has been tested on SUN4. It is expected that the
   software is portable to SUN3 and other UNIX machines.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   Xdi is expected to run on ISODE (release 6.8 upwards) in UNIX
   environment.  The 'xdi' directory has been designed to fit directly
   into the ISODE source tree. Xdi requires X11R4, the associated Xt
   toolkit and Athena widget libraries.  Also see the operating environ-
   ments of ISODE.

AVAILABILITY

   The Xdi software is available via anonymous FTP from
   thumper.bellcore.com in file pub/xdi.tar.Z. Source code and execut-
   ables can be freely distributed or modified for non-commercial and

ABSTRACT

   Xds is a DUA designed for users who have little or no knowledge of
   X.500. Its intended to be used, for example, by a receptionist who
   has to answer such queries as 'Could I have the telephone number of
   Andrew who works in Research?'. The display is customized for the
   particular organization and the results of the search are presented
   in the format of a business card. It is possible to customize the
   displayed information.

COMPLETENESS

   Xds does not provide user access to all the services provided by
   X.500.  Instead, Xds uses X.500 services to provide the specific
   functions for which it is designed to provide.

   Conforms to <a href="#section-9">section 9</a> of X.519.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Only tested against the QUIPU (ISODE) DSA.

ABSTRACT

   The xdua is a DUA designed to be used by DSA managers who have suffi-
   cient X.500 knowledge to manipulate the Directory Information Tree
   (DIT). It's typical use is to maintain the information stored on a
   DSA. The xdua has a Macintosh style interface.  This simplifies
   browsing the DIT hierarchy.  A user can traverse the DIT levels by
   using a standard mouse.  The xdua supports the X.500 operations of
   add, modify, delete, search and show.

COMPLETENESS

   Uses the QUIPU (ISODE) dsap interface to provide the X.500 opera-
   tions.

   Conforms to <a href="#section-9">section 9</a> of X.519.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Only tested against the QUIPU (ISODE) DSA.

ABSTRACT

   XLU (X LookUp) is an X.500 DUA interface for the X Window System.
   Developed from POD, XLU can be configured for many different styles
   of interaction. Example configurations are provided for single window
   and multiple window (POD-like) use.

   XLU implements the `User-Friendly Naming' search strategy and also
   has a form-filling search mode. Asynchronous directory operations are
   used.

   Full add and modify functions are provided, with the ability to
   tailor the modify screen to present simple subsets of the available
   attribute.

   At the time of writing (October 1991) XLU was in beta test.

COMPLETENESS

ABSTRACT

   xwp is a graphical user interface tailored specifically to provide
   easy access to the Directory for the purposes of performing White
   Pages searches. It is currently in use as one of user interfaces
   available on wp1.psi.net and wp2.psi.net, the two service machines
   for the White Pages Pilot Project.  Implements User-Friendly Naming
   scheme developed in IETF OSI-DS Working Group.

COMPLETENESS

   Compliant with X.500 standards to the extent that the QUIPU implemen-
   tation is.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Successfully interoperates with QUIPU DSAs.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   [No information provided--Ed.]

BUGS

   Bugs to ssd-help@psi.com

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   xwp is not a general-purpose DUA. It was designed to be a special-
   purpose front-end for performing White Pages searches and thus, in
   the interests of simplification, does not provide the full range of
   functionality supported by the X.500 standard.

ABSTRACT

   The xwp program is a simple browser for the QUIPU/X.500 directory.
   It uses OSF/Motif and the X Window System to provide a convenient
   user interface.

   The user interface consists of five different top-level windows: the
   main window, the search window, and three option windows.  The main
   window appears when the program is executed and all others are
   reached through its menus.  The main window contains Current Loca-
   tion, Current Descendents, Descendent Filter, Current Information,
   and Directory Status subwindows.  The contents of these subwindows
   show information about the current location of the browser in the
   directory tree.  The search window contains Search Area, Search
   Filter, and Search Results subwindows.

   The mouse pointer may be used in the main window to change the
   current location of the browser in the directory tree.  We can des-
   cend deeper into the tree by clicking the mouse when it points to a
   member of the Current Descendents list.  Doing this "moves" the
   browser to this new (one level deeper) location in the directory
   tree.  This causes the main window to be updated as follows: (1) the
   selected descendent becomes the new Current Location, (2) its descen-
   dents are listed in Current Descendents, and (3) its contents are
   displayed in Current Information.  Any problems and messages from the
   directory are displayed in the Directory Status portion of the main
   window.  To move the browser up the directory tree (i.e. towards the
   root), click the mouse pointer on one of the components of the
   Current Location.  In this way it is possible to move the browser to
   any location above its current position (i.e. to any ancestor) in one
   mouse click.  Doing this causes the main window to be updated as dis-
   cussed above.  Due to directory-imposed limits, it may not always be
   possible to display all the descendents of the current position.  In
   such cases (and others) it may be useful to impose a filter on the

   descendents to be listed.  To do this, position the mouse pointer in
   the Descendent Filter box and use the keyboard to type in the desired
   filter expression.  Typing &lt;RETURN&gt; in this box causes the Current
   Descendents list to be updated using the new filter.

   xwp was developed at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Computer
   Sciences Department. It is used in conjunction with the ECI mail user
   agent project.  xwp was written by Robert Lazarus, III.
