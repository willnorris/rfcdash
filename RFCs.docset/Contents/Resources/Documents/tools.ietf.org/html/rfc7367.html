Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
   Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) process for Mobile Ad Hoc
   Networks (MANETs).  The SMF-MIB module also reports state
   information, performance information, and notifications.  In addition
   to configuration, the additional state and performance information is
   useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   process implementing Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) [<a href="rfc6621.html" title='"Simplified Multicast Forwarding"'>RFC6621</a>]
   for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs).  SMF provides multicast
   Duplicate Packet Detection (DPD) and supports algorithms for
   constructing an estimate of a MANET Minimum Connected Dominating Set
   (MCDS) for efficient multicast forwarding.  The SMF-MIB module also
   reports state information, performance information, and
   notifications.  In addition to configuration, this additional state
   and performance information is useful to operators troubleshooting
   multicast forwarding problems.

   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,

   SMF provides methods for implementing DPD-based multicast forwarding
   with the optional use of CDS-based relay sets.  The CDS provides a
   complete connected coverage of the nodes comprising the MANET.  The
   MCDS is the smallest set of MANET nodes (comprising a connected
   cluster) that cover all the nodes in the cluster with their
   transmissions.  As the density of the MANET nodes increase, the
   fraction of nodes required in an MCDS decreases.  Using the MCDS as a
   multicast forwarding set then becomes an efficient multicast
   mechanism for MANETs.

   Various algorithms for the construction of estimates of the MCDS
   exist.  The Simplified Multicast Framework [<a href="rfc6621.html" title='"Simplified Multicast Forwarding"'>RFC6621</a>] describes some
   of these.  It further defines various operational modes for a node
   that is participating in the collective creation of the MCDS
   estimates.  These modes depend upon the set of related MANET routing
   and discovery protocols and mechanisms in operation in the specific
   MANET node.

   A SMF router's MIB module contains SMF process configuration
   parameters (e.g., specific CDS algorithm), state information (e.g.,
   current membership in the CDS), performance counters (e.g., packet
   counters), and notifications.

   This section describes the management model for the SMF node process.

   Figure 1 (reproduced from Figure 1 of [<a href="rfc6621.html" title='"Simplified Multicast Forwarding"'>RFC6621</a>]) shows the
   relationship between the SMF Relay Set Selection Algorithm and the
   related algorithms, processes, and protocols running in the MANET
   nodes.  The Relay Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA) can rely upon
   topology information acquired from the MANET Neighborhood Discovery
   Protocol (NHDP), from the specific MANET routing protocol running on
   the node, or from Layer 2 information passed up to the higher layer
   protocol processes.

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   Configuration Objects:  switches, tables, and objects that are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interfaces such as defined by this MIB module.

   Tunable Configuration Objects:  objects whose values affect timing or
      attempt bounds on the SMF Relay Set (RS) process.

   State Objects:  automatically generated values that define the
      current operating state of the SMF RS process in the router.

   Performance Objects:  automatically generated values that help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      CDS multicast process on the router and the overall multicast
      performance within the MANET routing domain.

   This section presents the structure of the SMF-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  smfMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the SMF process.

   o  smfMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the SMF-
      MIB module.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

      *  Capabilities Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         the device uses to advertise its local capabilities with
         respect to, e.g., the supported RSSAs.

      *  Configuration Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         configure specific options that determine the overall operation
         of the SMF process and the resulting multicast performance.

      *  State Group - Contains information describing the current state
         of the SMF process such as the Neighbor Table.

      *  Performance Group - Contains objects that help to characterize
         the performance of the SMF process, typically counters for
         statistical computations.

   o  smfMIBConformance - defines two, i.e., minimal and full,
      conformance implementations for the SMF-MIB module.

   The Textual Conventions defined within the SMF-MIB module:

   o  The SmfStatus is defined within the SMF-MIB module.  This contains
      the current operational status of the SMF process on an interface.

   The Textual Conventions defined for the SMF-MIB module and maintained
   by IANA are:

   o  The IANAsmfOpModeIdTC represents an index that identifies a
      specific SMF operational mode.  This Textual Convention is
      maintained by IANA in the IANA-SMF-MIB.

   o  The IANAsmfRssaIdTC represents an index that identifies, through
      reference, a specific RSSA available for operation on the device.
      This Textual Convention is maintained by IANA also in the IANA-
      SMF-MIB.

   The SMF device supports a set of capabilities.  The list of
   capabilities that the device can advertise is as follows:

   o  Operational Mode - topology information from NHDP, CDS-aware
      unicast routing, or Cross-layer from Layer 2.

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device.  Note that
      configuration, state, and performance objects related to a
      specific RSSA must be defined within a separate MIB module.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20The%20Configuration%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  The Configuration Group</span>

   The SMF device is configured with a set of controls.  Some of the
   prominent configuration controls for the SMF device are:

   o  Operational Mode - determines from where topology information is
      derived, e.g., NHDP, CDS-aware unicast routing, or Cross-layer
      from Layer 2.

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device.

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv4 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD (I-DPD or H-DPD, respectively).

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv6 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD.

   o  SMF Type Message TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then the SMF Type
      Message TLV MAY be included in the NHDP exchanges.

   o  SMF Address Block TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then the SMF
      Address Block TLV SHOULD be included in the NHDP exchanges.

   node and per-interface objects:

   o  Total multicast packets received.

   o  Total multicast packets forwarded.

   o  Total duplicate multicast packets detected.

   o  Per interface statistics table with the following entries:

   The SMF-MIB module contains a number of tables that record data
   related to:

   o  configuration and operation of packet forwarding on the local
      router,

   o  configuration and operation of local MANET interfaces on the
      router, and

   o  configuration and operation of various RSSAs for packet
      forwarding.

   The SMF-MIB module's tables are indexed via the following constructs:

   o  smfCapabilitiesIndex - the index identifying the combination of
      SMF mode and SMF RSSA available on this device.

   o  smfCfgAddrForwardingIndex - the index to configured multicast
      address lists that are forwarded by the SMF process.

   o  smfCfgIfIndex - the IfIndex of the interface on the local router
      on which SMF is configured.

   o  smfStateNeighborIpAddrType, smfStateNeighborIpAddr, and
      smfStateNeighborPrefixLen - the interface index set of specific
      one-hop neighbor nodes to this local router.

   These tables and their associated indexing are defined in the SMF-MIB
   module:

   o  smfCapabilitiesTable - identifies the resident set of (SMF
      Operational Modes, SMF RSSA algorithms) available on this router.
      This table has 'INDEX { smfCapabilitiesIndex }'.

   o  smfCfgAddrForwardingTable - contains information on multicast
      addresses that are to be forwarded by the SMF process on this
      device.  This table has 'INDEX { smfCfgAddrForwardingIndex }'.

   o  smfCfgInterfaceTable - describes the SMF interfaces on this device
      that are participating in the SMF packet forwarding process.  This
      table has 'INDEX { smfCfgIfIndex }'.

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB module [<a href="rfc3418.html" title='"Management Information Base (MIB) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC3418</a>] is defined as
   being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity
   as a whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the
   management entity and certain other system-wide data.  The SMF-MIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

   It is an expectation that SMF devices will implement the standard IP-
   MIB module [<a href="rfc4293.html" title='"Management Information Base for the Internet Protocol (IP)"'>RFC4293</a>].  Exactly how to integrate SMF packet handling
   and management into the standard IP-MIB module management are part of
   the experiment.

   The SMF-MIB module counters within the smfPerformanceGroup count
   packets handled by the system and interface local SMF process (as
   discussed above).  Not all IP (unicast and multicast) packets on a
   device interface are handled by the SMF process.  So the counters are
   tracking different packet streams in the IP-MIB and SMF-MIB modules.

   The smfCfgAddrForwardingTable is essentially a filter table (if
   populated) that identifies addresses/packets to be forwarded via the
   local SMF flooding process.  The IP Multicast MIB module in <a href="rfc5132.html">RFC 5132</a>
   [<a href="rfc5132.html" title='"IP Multicast MIB"'>RFC5132</a>] manages objects related to standard IP multicast, which
   could be running in parallel to SMF on the device.

   <a href="rfc5132.html">RFC 5132</a> manages traditional IP-based multicast (based upon multicast
   routing mechanisms).  The SMF-MIB module provides management for a
   MANET subnet-based flooding mechanism which, may be used for

   other multicast mechanisms that are IP route based.  SMF and the

          <a href="rfc5132.html">RFC 5132</a> manages traditional IP-based multicast (based
          upon multicast routing mechanisms).  The SMF-MIB module
          provides management for a MANET subnet-based flooding
          mechanism that may be used for multicast transport
          (through SMF broadcast) depending upon the MANET dynamics
          and other factors regarding the MANET subnet.  Further,
          they may coexist in certain MANET deployments
          using the smfCfgAddrForwardingTable to hand certain IP
          multicast addresses to the SMF process and other IP
          multicast packets to be forwarded by other
          multicast mechanisms that are IP route based.  SMF and
          the associated SMF-MIB module are experimental and these
          are some of the experiments to be had with SMF and
          the SMF-MIB module.

          This is the (conceptual) table containing information on
          multicast addresses that are to be forwarded by the SMF
          process.  This table represents an IP filters table for
          forwarding (or not) packets based upon their IP
          multicast address.

          The SMF process can be configured to forward only those
          multicast addresses found within the
          smfCfgAddrForwardingTable.  As such, addresses that are
          to be forwarded by the SMF process MUST be found within
          the address ranges configured within this table, unless
          this table is empty.

          Each row is associated with a range of multicast
          addresses, and ranges for different rows must be disjoint.
          Different rows MAY share a common
          smfCfgAddrForwardingGroupName to administratively
          associate different rows.

          The objects in this table are persistent and, when written,

   This section contains the IANA-SMF-MIB module.  This MIB module
   defines two Textual Conventions for which IANA SHOULD maintain and
   keep synchronized with the registry identified below within the
   IANAsmfOpModeIdTC and the IANAsmfRssaIdTC TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs.

   The IANAsmfOpModeIdTC defines an index that identifies through
   reference to a specific SMF operations mode.  The index is an integer
   valued named-number enumeration consisting of an integer and label.
   IANA is to create and maintain this Textual Convention.  Future
   assignments are made to anyone on a first come, first served basis.
   There is no substantive review of the request, other than to ensure
   that it is well-formed and does not duplicate an existing assignment.
   However, requests must include a minimal amount of clerical
   information, such as a point of contact (including an email address)
   and a brief description of the method being identified as a new SMF
   operations mode.

   The IANAsmfRssaIdTC defines an index that identifies through
   reference to a specific Reduced Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA).  The
   index is an integer valued named-number enumeration consisting of an
   integer and label.  IANA is to create and maintain this Textual
   Convention.

   Future assignments to the IANAsmfRssaIdTC for the index range 5-127
   require an RFC publication (either as an IETF submission or as an

   detail so that interoperability between independent implementations
   is possible.

   Future assignments to the IANAsmfRssaIdTC for the index range 128-239
   are private or local use only, with the type and purpose defined by
   the local site.  No attempt is made to prevent multiple sites from
   using the same value in different (and incompatible) ways.  There is
   no need for IANA to review such assignments (since IANA will not
   record these), and assignments are not generally useful for broad
   interoperability.  It is the responsibility of the sites making use
   of the Private Use range to ensure that no conflicts occur (within
   the intended scope of use).

   Future assignments to the IANAsmfRssaIdTC for the index range 240-255
   are to facilitate experimentation.  These require an RFC publication
   (either as an IETF submission or as an Independent submission
   [<a href="rfc5742.html" title='"IESG Procedures for Handling of Independent and IRTF Stream Submissions"'>RFC5742</a>]).  The category of RFC MUST be Experimental.  The RSSA
   algorithms MUST be documented in sufficient detail so that
   interoperability between independent implementations is possible.

       DESCRIPTION
           "An index that identifies through reference to a specific
            SMF operations mode.  There are basically three styles
            of SMF operation with reduced relay sets currently
            identified:
              Independent operation 'independent(1)' -
                  SMF performs its own relay
                  set selection using information from an associated
                  MANET NHDP process.

              CDS-aware unicast routing operation 'routing(2)'-
                  a coexistent unicast routing
                  protocol provides dynamic relay
                  set state based upon its own control plane
                  Connected Dominating Set (CDS) or neighborhood
                  discovery information.

              Cross-layer operation 'crossLayer(3)' -
                  SMF operates using neighborhood
                  status and triggers from a
                  cross-layer information base for dynamic relay
                  set selection and maintenance.

            IANA MUST update this Textual Convention accordingly.

            The definition of this Textual Convention with the
            addition of newly assigned values is updated
            periodically by the IANA, in the
            IANA-maintained registries.  (The

       DESCRIPTION
           "An index that identifies through reference to specific
            RSSAs.  Several are currently defined
            in the Appendices A, B, and C of <a href="rfc6621.html">RFC 6621</a>.

            Examples of RSSAs already identified within
            this Textual Convention (TC) are:

              Classical Flooding (cF(1)) - is the standard
                 flooding algorithm where each node in the next
                 retransmits the information on each of its interfaces.

              Source-Based Multipoint Relay (sMPR(2)) -
                 this algorithm is used by Optimized Link State Routing
                 (OLSR) and OLSR version 2 (OLSRv2) protocols for the
                 relay of link state updates and other control
                 information (<a href="rfc3626.html">RFC 3626</a>, <a href="rfc7181.html">RFC 7181</a>).  Since each router
                 picks its neighboring relays independently, sMPR
                 forwarders depend upon previous hop information
                 (e.g., source Media Access Control (MAC) address) to
                 operate correctly.

              Essential Connected Dominating Set (eCDS(3)) -
                 defined in <a href="rfc5614.html">RFC 5614</a>, this algorithm forms a single
                 CDS mesh for the SMF operating region.  Its
                 packet-forwarding rules are not dependent upon
                 previous hop knowledge in contrast to sMPR.

              Multipoint Relay Connected Dominating Set (mprCDS(4)) -
                 This algorithm is an extension to the basic sMPR
                 election algorithm that results in a shared
                 (non-source-specific) SMF CDS.  Thus, its forwarding

   This section discusses security implications of the choices made in
   this SMF-MIB module.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  'smfCfgAdminStatus' - this writable configuration object controls
      the operational status of the SMF process.  If this setting is
      configured inconsistently across the MANET multicast domain, then
      delivery of multicast data may be inconsistent across the domain;
      some nodes may not receive multicast data intended for them.

   o  'smfCfgRouterIDAddrType' and 'smfCfgRouterID' - these writable
      configuration objects define the ID of the SMF process.  These
      objects should be configured with a routable address defined on
      the local SMF device.  The smfCfgRouterID is a logical
      identification that MUST be configured as unique across
      interoperating SMF neighborhoods, and it is RECOMMENDED to be
      chosen as the numerically largest address contained in a node's

      'Neighbor Address List' as defined in NHDP.  A smfCfgRouterID MUST
      be unique within the scope of the operating MANET network
      regardless of the method used for selecting it.  If these objects
      are misconfigured or configured inconsistently across the MANET,
      then the ability of various RSSAs, e.g., eCDS, may be compromised.
      This would potentially result in some routers within the MANET not
      receiving multicast packets destine to them.  Hence, intentionally
      misconfiguring these objects could pose a form of Denial-of-
      Service (DoS) attack against the MANET.

   o  'smfCfgOpMode' - this writable configuration object defines the
      operational mode of the SMF process.  The operational mode defines
      how the SMF process receives its data to form its local estimate
      of the CDS.  It is recommended that the value for this object be
      set consistently across the MANET to ensure proper operation of
      the multicast packet forwarding.  If the value for this object is
      set inconsistently across the MANET, the result may be that
      multicast packet delivery will be compromised within the MANET.
      Hence, intentionally misconfiguring this object could pose a form
      DoS attack against the MANET.

   o  'smfCfgRssa' - this writable configuration object sets the
      specific RSSA for the SMF process.  If this object is set
      inconsistently across the MANET domain, multicast delivery of data
      will likely fail.  Hence, intentionally misconfiguring this object
      could pose a form DoS attack against the MANET.

   o  'smfCfgRssaMember' - this writable configuration object sets the
      'interest' of the local SMF node in participating in the CDS.
      Setting this object to 'never(3)' on a highly connected device
      could lead to frequent island formation.  Setting this object to
      'always(2)' could support data ex-filtration from the MANET
      domain.

   o  'smfCfgIpv4Dpd' - this writable configuration object sets the
      duplicate packet detection method, i.e., H-DPD or I-DPD, for
      forwarding of IPv4 multicast packets.  Forwarders may operate with
      mixed H-DPD and I-DPD modes as long as they consistently perform
      the appropriate DPD routines outlined in [<a href="rfc6621.html" title='"Simplified Multicast Forwarding"'>RFC6621</a>].  However, it
      is RECOMMENDED that a deployment be configured with a common mode
      for operational consistency.

   o  'smfCfgIpv6Dpd' - this writable configuration object sets the
      duplicate packet detection method for the forwarding of IPv6
      multicast packets.  Since IPv6 SMF does specify an option header,
      the interoperability constraints are not as loose as in the IPv4
      version, and forwarders SHOULD NOT operate with mixed H-DPD and
      I-DPD modes.  Hence, the value for this object SHOULD be
      consistently set within the forwarders comprising the MANET, else
      inconsistent forwarding may result unnecessary multicast packet
      dropping.

   o  'smfCfgMaxPktLifetime' - this writable configuration object sets
      the estimate of the network packet traversal time.  If set too
      small, this could lead to poor multicast data delivery ratios
      throughout the MANET domain.  This could serve as a form of DoS
      attack if this object value is set too small.

   o  'smfCfgDpdEntryMaxLifetime' - this writable configuration object
      sets the maximum lifetime (in seconds) for the cached DPD records
      for the combined IPv4 and IPv6 methods.  If the memory is running
      low prior to the MaxLifetime being exceeded, the local SMF devices
      should purge the oldest records first.  If this object value is
      set too small, then the effectiveness of the SMF DPD algorithms
      may become greatly diminished causing a higher than necessary
      packet load on the MANET.

   o  'smfCfgNhdpRssaMesgTLVIncluded' - this writable configuration
      object indicates whether or not the associated NHDP messages
      include the RSSA Message TLV.  It is highly RECOMMENDED that this
      object be set to 'true(1)' when the SMF operation mode is set to
      independent as this information will inform the local forwarder of
      the RSSA implemented in neighboring forwarders and is used to
      ensure consistent forwarding across the MANET.  While it is
      possible that SMF neighbors MAY be configured differently with
      respect to the RSSA and still operate cooperatively, but these
      cases will vary dependent upon the algorithm types designated and
      this situation SHOULD be avoided.

   o  'smfCfgNhdpRssaAddrBlockTLVIncluded' - this writable configuration
      object indicates whether or not the associated NHDP messages
      include the RSSA Address Block TLV.  The
      smfNhdpRssaAddrBlockTLVIncluded is optional in all cases as it
      depends on the existence of an address block that may not be
      present.  If this SMF device is configured with NHDP, then this
      object should be set to 'true(1)' as this TLV enables CDS relay
      algorithm operation and configuration to be shared among 2-hop
      neighborhoods.  Some relay algorithms require 2-hop neighbor
      configuration in order to correctly select relay sets.

   o  'smfCfgAddrForwardingTable' - the writable configuration objects
      in this table indicate which multicast IP addresses are to be
      forwarded by this SMF node.  Misconfiguration of rows within this
      table can limit the ability of this SMF device to properly forward
      multicast data.

   o  'smfCfgInterfaceTable' - the writable configuration objects in
      this table indicate which SMF node interfaces are participating in
      the SMF packet forwarding process.  Misconfiguration of rows
      within this table can limit the ability of this SMF device to
      properly forward multicast data.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  'smfNodeRsStatusIncluded' - this readable state object indicates
      whether or not this SMF node is part of the CDS.  Being part of

   o  'smfStateNeighborTable' - the readable state objects in this table
      indicate current neighbor nodes to this SMF node.  Exposing this
      information to an attacker could allow the attacker easier access
      to the larger MANET domain.

   The remainder of the objects in the SMF-MIB module are performance
   counter objects.  While these give an indication of the activity of
   the SMF process on this node, it is not expected that exposing these
   values poses a security risk to the MANET network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [<a href="rfc3410.html" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [<a href="rfc3414.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC3414</a>] with the AES cipher algorithm [<a href="rfc3826.html" title='"The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Cipher Algorithm in the SNMP User-based Security Model"'>RFC3826</a>].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [<a href="rfc5591.html" title='"Transport Security Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5591</a>] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [<a href="rfc5592.html" title='"Secure Shell Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5592</a>] or TLS/DTLS [<a href="rfc6353.html" title='"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC6353</a>].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   Simplified Multicast Forwarding [<a href="rfc6621.html" title='"Simplified Multicast Forwarding"'>RFC6621</a>] process on a Mobile Ad Hoc
   Network (MANET) router.  This MIB module, denoted SMF-MIB, also
   reports state and performance information and notifications.  This
   section provides some examples of how this MIB module can be used in
   MANET network deployments.  A fuller discussion of MANET network
   management use cases and challenges is out of scope for this
   document.

   SMF is designed to allow MANET routers to forward IPv4 and IPv6
   packets over the MANET and cover the MANET nodes through the
   automatic discovery of efficient estimates of the Minimum Connected
   Dominating Set (MCDS) of nodes within the MANET.  The MCDS is

   estimated using the Relay Set Selection Algorithms (RSSAs) discussed
   within this document.  In the following, three scenarios are listed
   where this MIB module is useful:

   o  For a Parking Lot Initial Configuration Situation - it is common
      for the vehicles comprising the MANET being forward deployed at a
      remote location, e.g., the site of a natural disaster, to be off-
      loaded in a parking lot where an initial configuration of the
      networking devices is performed.  The configuration is loaded into
      the devices from a fixed-location Network Operations Center (NOC)
      at the parking lot, and the vehicles are stationary at the parking
      lot while the configuration changes are made.  Standards-based
      methods for configuration management from the co-located NOC are
      necessary for this deployment option.  The set of interesting
      configuration objects for the SMF process are listed within this
      MIB module.

   o  For Mobile vehicles with Low Bandwidth Satellite Link to a Fixed
      NOC - Here the vehicles carrying the MANET routers carry multiple
      wireless interfaces, one of which is a relatively low-bandwidth
      on-the-move satellite connection that interconnects a fix NOC to
      the nodes of the MANET.  Standards-based methods for monitoring
      and fault management from the fixed NOC are necessary for this
      deployment option.

   o  For Fixed NOC and Mobile Local Manager in Larger Vehicles - for
      larger vehicles, a hierarchical network management arrangement is
      useful.  Centralized network management is performed from a fixed
      NOC while local management is performed locally from within the
      vehicles.  Standards-based methods for configuration, monitoring,
      and fault management are necessary for this deployment option.

   Here we provide an example of the simplest of configurations to
   establish an operational multicast forwarding capability in a MANET.
   This discussion only identifies the configuration necessary through
   the SMF-MIB module and assumes that other configuration has occurred.
   Assume that the MANET is to support only IPv4 addressing and that the
   MANET nodes are to be configured in the context of the Parking Lot
   Initialization case above.  Then, the SMF-MIB module defines ten
   configuration OIDs and two configuration tables, i.e., the
   smfCfgAddrForwardingTable and the smfCfgInterfaceTable.  Of the ten
   OIDs defined, all but one, i.e., the smfCfgRouterID, have DEFVAL
   clauses that allow for a functional configuration of the SMF process
   within the MANET.  The smfCfgRouterIDType defaults to 'ipv4' so the
   smfCfgRouterID can be set as, e.g., (assuming the use of the Net-SNMP
   toolkit),:

   snmpset [options] &lt;smfCfgRouterID_OID&gt;.0 a 192.0.2.100

   If the smfCfgAddrForwardingTable is left empty, then the SMF local
   forwarder will forward all multicast addresses.  So this table does
   not require configuration if you want to have the MANET forward all
   multicast addresses.

   All that remains is to configure at least one row in the
   smfCfgInterfaceTable.  Assume that the node has a wireless interface
   with an &lt;ifName&gt;='wlan0' and an &lt;ifIndex&gt;='1'.  All of the objects in
   the rows of the smfCfgInterfaceTable have a DEFVAL clause; hence,
   only the RowStatus object needs to be set.  So the SMF process will
   be activated on the 'wlan0' interface by the following network
   manager snmpset command:

   snmpset [options] &lt;smfCfgIfRowStatus&gt;.1 i active(1)

   At this point, the configured forwarder will begin a Classical
   Flooding algorithm to forward all multicast addresses IPv4 packets it
   receives.

   To provide a more efficient multicast forwarding within the MANET,
   the network manager could walk the smfCapabilitiesTable to identify
   other SMF Operational Modes, for example:

   snmpwalk [options] &lt;smfCapabilitiesTable&gt;

   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesIndex.1 = INTEGER: 1

   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesIndex.2 = INTEGER: 2

   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesOpModeID.1 = INTEGER: cfOnly(1)

   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesOpModeiD.2 = INTEGER: independent(2)

   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesRssaID.1 = INTEGER: cF(1)

   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesRssaID.2 = INTEGER: eCDS(3)

   In this example, the forwarding device also supports the Essential
   Connected Dominating Set (eCDS) RSSA with the forwarder in the
   'independent(2)' operational mode.  If the network manager were to
   then issue an snmpset, for example:

   snmpset [options] &lt;smfCfgOperationalMode&gt;.0 i 2

   then the local forwarder would switch its forwarding behavior from
   Classical Flooding to the more efficient eCDS flooding.

   This document defines two MIB modules:

   1.  SMF-MIB is defined in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> and is an experimental MIB
       module.

   2.  IANA-SMF-MIB is defined in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> and is an IANA MIB module
       that IANA maintains.

   Thus, IANA has completed three actions:

   IANA has allocated an OBJECT IDENTIFIER value and recorded it in the
   SMI Numbers registry in the subregistry called "SMI Experimental
   Codes" under the experimental branch (1.3.6.1.3).

   IANA has allocated an OBJECT IDENTIFIER value and recorded it in the
