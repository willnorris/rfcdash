Abstract

   In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Certificate
   Authorities (CAs) publish certificates, including end-entity
   certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and RPKI signed
   objects to repositories.  Relying Parties retrieve the published
   information from those repositories.  This document specifies a new
   RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) for this purpose.  RRDP was
   specifically designed for scaling.  It relies on an Update
   Notification File which lists the current Snapshot and Delta Files
   that can be retrieved using HTTPS (HTTP over Transport Layer Security
   (TLS)), and it enables the use of Content Distribution Networks
   (CDNs) or other caching infrastructures for the retrieval of these
   files.

   In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Certificate
   Authorities publish certificates [<a href="rfc6487.html" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>], RPKI signed objects
   [<a href="rfc6488.html" title='"Signed Object Template for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)"'>RFC6488</a>], manifests [<a href="rfc6486.html" title='"Manifests for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)"'>RFC6486</a>], and CRLs to repositories.  CAs may
   have an embedded mechanism to publish to these repositories, or they
   may use a separate Repository Server and publication protocol.  RPKI
   repositories are currently accessible using the rsync protocol
   [<a href="#ref-RSYNC" title='"rsync"'>RSYNC</a>], allowing Relying Parties to synchronize a local copy of the
   RPKI repository used for validation with the remote repositories
   [<a href="rfc6481.html" title='"A Profile for Resource Certificate Repository Structure"'>RFC6481</a>].

   rsync [<a href="#ref-RSYNC" title='"rsync"'>RSYNC</a>] has proven valuable in the early deployment of RPKI,
   because it allowed operators to gain experience without the need to
   invent a custom protocol.  However, operational experience has
   brought concerns to light that we wish to address here:

   o  rsync [<a href="#ref-RSYNC" title='"rsync"'>RSYNC</a>] is designed to limit the amount of data that needs
      to be transferred between client and server.  However, the server
      needs to spend significant resources in terms of CPU and memory
      for every connection.  This is a problem in an envisioned RPKI
      deployment where thousands of Relying Parties query a small number
      of central repositories, and it makes these repositories weak to
      denial-of-service attacks.

   o  A secondary concern is the lack of supported rsync server and
      client libraries.  In practice, all implementations have to make
      system calls to an rsync binary.  This is inefficient; it
      introduces fragility with regards to updates of this binary, makes
      it difficult to catch and report problems to operators, and
      complicates software development and testing.

   This document specifies an alternative repository access protocol
   based on Update Notification, Snapshot, and Delta Files that a
   Relying Party can retrieve over the HTTPS protocol.  This allows
   Relying Parties to either perform a full (re-)synchronization of
   their local copy of the repository using Snapshot Files or use Delta
   Files to keep their local repository updated after initial
   synchronization.  We call this the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol, or
   RRDP in short.

   RRDP was designed to support scaling in RPKI's asymmetric deployment.
   It is consistent (in terms of data structures) with the publication
   protocol [<a href="rfc8181.html" title='"A Publication Protocol for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)"'>RFC8181</a>] and treats publication events of one or more
   repository objects as discrete events that can be communicated to
   Relying Parties.  This approach helps to minimize the amount of data
   that traverses the network and thus helps minimize the amount of time
   until repository convergence occurs.  RRDP also provides a standards-

   based way to obtain consistent, point-in-time views of a single
   repository, eliminating a number of consistency-related issues.
   Finally, this approach allows these discrete events to be
   communicated as immutable files.  This enables Repository Servers to
   pre-calculate these files only once for all clients, thus limiting
   the CPU and memory investments required, and enables the use of a
   caching infrastructure to reduce the load on a Repository Server when
   a large number of Relying Parties are querying it.

   This document allows the use of RRDP as an additional repository
   distribution mechanism for RPKI.  In time, RRDP may replace rsync
   [<a href="#ref-RSYNC" title='"rsync"'>RSYNC</a>] as the only mandatory-to-implement repository distribution
   mechanism.  However, this transition is outside of the scope of this
   document.

   Certification Authorities in the RPKI use a Repository Server to
   publish their RPKI products, such as manifests, CRLs, signed
   certificates, and RPKI-signed objects.  This Repository Server may be
   remote or embedded in the Certificate Authority engine itself.
   Certificates in the RPKI that use a Repository Server that supports
   RRDP include a special Subject Information Access (SIA) pointer
   referring to an Update Notification File.

   The Update Notification File includes a globally unique session_id in
   the form of a version 4 Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID)
   [<a href="rfc4122.html" title='"A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"'>RFC4122</a>] and serial number that can be used by the Relying Party to
   determine if it and the repository are synchronized.  Furthermore, it
   includes a link to the most recent complete snapshot of current
   objects that are published by the Repository Server, and a list of
   links to Delta Files, for each revision starting at a point
   determined by the Repository Server, up to the current revision of
   the repository.

   A Relying Party that learns about an Update Notification File
   location for the first time can download it and then proceed to
   download the latest Snapshot File, thus creating a local copy of the

   repository that is in sync with the Repository Server.  The Relying
   Party records the location of this Update Notification File, the
   session_id, and the current serial number.

   Relying Parties are encouraged to re-fetch this Update Notification
   File at regular intervals, but not more often than once per minute.
   After re-fetching the Update Notification File, the Relying Party may
   find that there are one or more Delta Files available that allow it
   to synchronize its local repository with the current state of the
   Repository Server.  If no contiguous chain of deltas from the Relying
   Party's serial to the latest repository serial is available, or if
   the session_id has changed, the Relying Party performs a full
   resynchronization instead.

   As soon as the Relying Party fetches new content in this way, it
   could start a validation process.  An example of a reason why a
   Relying Party may not choose to do this immediately is because it has
   learned of more than one notification location, and it prefers to
   complete all its updates before validating.

   The Repository Server could use a caching infrastructure to reduce
   its load, particularly because snapshots and deltas for any given
   session_id and serial number contain an immutable record of the state
   of the Repository Server at a certain point in time.  For this
   reason, these files can be cached indefinitely.  Update Notification
   Files are polled by Relying Parties to discover if updates exist; for
   this reason, Update Notification Files may not be cached for longer
   than one minute.

   The accessLocation MUST be an HTTPS URI as defined in [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>] that

   When the Repository Server initializes, it performs the following
   actions:

   o  The server MUST generate a new random version 4 UUID (see
      <a href="rfc4122.html#section-4.1.3">Section 4.1.3 of [RFC4122]</a>) to be used as the session_id.

   o  The server MUST then generate a Snapshot File for serial number
      ONE for this new session that includes all currently known
      published objects that the Repository Server is responsible for.
      Note that this Snapshot File may contain zero publish elements at
      this point if no objects have been submitted for publication yet.

   o  This Snapshot File MUST be made available at a URL that is unique
      to this session_id and serial number, so that it can be cached
      indefinitely.  The format and caching concerns for Snapshot Files
      are explained in more detail in <a href="#section-3.5.2">Section 3.5.2</a>.

   o  After the Snapshot File has been published, the Repository Server
      MUST publish a new Update Notification File that contains the new
      session_id, has serial number ONE, has one reference to the
      Snapshot File that was just published, and contains no delta
      references.  The format and caching concerns for Update
      Notification Files are explained in more detail in <a href="#section-3.5.1">Section 3.5.1</a>.

   Whenever the Repository Server receives updates from a Certificate
   Authority, it MUST generate new snapshot and Delta Files within one
   minute.  If a Repository Server services a large number of
   Certificate Authorities, it MAY choose to combine updates from
   multiple CAs.  If a Repository Server combines updates in this way,
   it MUST ensure that publication never postponed for longer than one
   minute for any of the CAs involved.

   Updates are processed as follows:

   o  The new repository serial number MUST be one greater than the
      current repository serial number.

   o  A new Delta File MUST be generated for this new serial.  This
      Delta File MUST include all new, replaced, and withdrawn objects
      for multiple CAs, if applicable, as a single change set.

   o  This Delta File MUST be made available at a URL that is unique to
      the current session_id and serial number, so that it can be cached
      indefinitely.

   o  The format and caching concerns for Delta Files are explained in
      more detail in <a href="#section-3.5.3">Section 3.5.3</a>.

   o  The Repository Server MUST also generate a new Snapshot File for
      this new serial.  This file MUST contain all "publish" elements
      for all current objects.

   o  The Snapshot File MUST be made available at a URL that is unique
      to this session and new serial, so that it can be cached
      indefinitely.

   o  The format and caching concerns for Snapshot Files are explained
      in more detail in <a href="#section-3.5.2">Section 3.5.2</a>.

   o  Any older Delta Files that, when combined with all more recent
      Delta Files, will result in the total size of deltas exceeding the
      size of the snapshot MUST be excluded to avoid that Relying
      Parties download more data than necessary.

   o  A new Update Notification File MUST now be created by the
      Repository Server.  This new Update Notification File MUST include
      a reference to the new Snapshot File and all Delta Files selected
      in the previous steps.

   o  The format and caching concerns for Update Notification Files are
      explained in more detail in <a href="#section-3.5.1">Section 3.5.1</a>.

   If the Repository Server is not capable of performing the above for
   some reason, then it MUST perform a full re-initialization, as
   explained above in <a href="#section-3.3.1">Section 3.3.1</a>.

   When a Relying Party performs RPKI validation and learns about a
   valid certificate with an SIA entry for the RRDP protocol, it SHOULD
   use this protocol as follows.





<span class="grey">Bruijnzeels, et al.          Standards Track                    [Page 7]</span></pre>

   The Relying Party MUST download the Update Notification File, unless
   an Update Notification File was already downloaded and processed from
   the same location in this validation run or a polling strategy was
   used (see <a href="#section-3.4.4">Section 3.4.4</a>).

   It is RECOMMENDED that the Relying Party uses a "User-Agent" header
   explained in <a href="rfc7231.html#section-5.5.3">Section 5.5.3. of [RFC7231]</a> to identify the name and
   version of the Relying Party software used.  It is useful to track
   capabilities of Relying Parties in the event of changes to the RPKI
   standards.

   When the Relying Party downloads an Update Notification File, it MUST
   verify the file format and validation steps described in
   <a href="#section-3.5.1.3">Section 3.5.1.3</a>.  If this verification fails, the file MUST be
   rejected and RRDP cannot be used.  See <a href="#section-3.4.5">Section 3.4.5</a> for
   considerations.

   The Relying Party MUST verify whether the session_id matches the last
   known session_id for this Update Notification File location.  Note
   that even though the session_id is a random UUID value, it alone MUST
   NOT be used by a Relying Party as a unique identifier of a session
   but always together with the location of the Update Notification
   File.  The reason for this is that a malicious server can use an
   existing session_id from another Repository Server.

   If the session_id matches the last known session_id, then a Relying
   Party MAY download and process missing Delta Files as described in
   <a href="#section-3.4.2">Section 3.4.2</a>, provided that all Delta Files for serial numbers
   between the last processed serial number and the current serial
   number in the Update Notification File can be processed this way.

   If the session_id matches the last known session_id, but Delta Files
   were not used, then the Relying Party MUST download and process the
   Snapshot File on the Update Notification File as described in
   <a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a>.

   If the session_id does not match the last known session_id, the
   Relying Party MUST update its last known session_id to the value
   specified in the downloaded Update Notification File.  The Relying
   Party MUST then download and process the Snapshot File specified in
   the downloaded Update Notification File as described in
   <a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a>.

   If an Update Notification File contains a contiguous chain of links
   to Delta Files from the last processed serial number to the current
   serial number, then Relying Parties MUST attempt to download and
   process all Delta Files in order of serial number as follows.

   When the Relying Party downloads a Delta File, it MUST verify the
   file format and perform validation steps described in
   <a href="#section-3.5.3.3">Section 3.5.3.3</a>.  If this verification fails, the file MUST be
   rejected.

   Furthermore, the Relying Party MUST verify that the hash of the
   contents of this file matches the hash on the Update Notification
   File that referenced it.  In case of a mismatch of this hash, the
   file MUST be rejected.

   If a Relying Party retrieved a Delta File that is valid according to
   the above criteria, it performs the following actions:

   o  The Relying Party MUST verify that the session_id matches the
      session_id of the Update Notification File.  If the session_id
      values do not match, the file MUST be rejected.

   o  The Relying Party MUST verify that the serial number of this Delta
      File is exactly one greater than the last processed serial number
      for this session_id, and if not, this file MUST be rejected.

   o  The Relying Party SHOULD add all publish elements to a local
      storage and update its last processed serial number to the serial
      number of this Delta File.

   o  When a Relying Party encounters a "withdraw" element, or a
      "publish" element where an object is replaced, in a delta that it
      retrieves from a Repository Server, it MUST verify that the object
      to be withdrawn or replaced was retrieved from this same
      Repository Server before applying the appropriate action.  Failing
      to do so will leave the Relying Party vulnerable to malicious
      Repository Servers instructing it to delete or change arbitrary
      objects.

   If any Delta File is rejected, Relying Parties MUST process the
   current Snapshot File instead, as described in <a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a>.

   Snapshot Files MUST only be used if Delta Files are unavailable or

   When the Relying Party downloads a Snapshot File, it MUST verify the

   Once a Relying Party has learned about the location, session_id, and
   last processed serial number of the repository that uses the RRDP
   protocol, the Relying Party MAY start polling the Repository Server
   for updates.  However, the Relying Party MUST NOT poll for updates
   more often than once every 1 minute, and in order to reduce data
   usage, Relying Parties MUST use the "If-Modified-Since" header
   explained in <a href="rfc7232.html#section-3.3">Section 3.3 of [RFC7232]</a> in requests.

   If a Relying Party finds that updates are available, it SHOULD
   download and process the file as described in <a href="#section-3.4.1">Section 3.4.1</a> and
   initiate a new RPKI object validation process.  However, a detailed
   description of the RPKI object validation process itself is out of

   If a Relying Party experiences any issues with retrieving or
   processing any of the files used in this protocol, it will be unable
   to retrieve new RPKI data from the affected Repository Server.

   Relying Parties could attempt to use alternative repository access
   mechanisms, if they are available, according to the accessMethod
   element value(s) specified in the SIA of the associated certificate
   (see <a href="rfc6487.html#section-4.8.8">Section 4.8.8 of [RFC6487]</a>).

   Furthermore, Relying Parties may wish to employ re-try strategies
   while fetching RRDP files.  Relying Parties are also advised to keep
   old objects in their local cache so that validation can be done using
   old objects.

   It is also recommendable that re-validation and retrieval is
   performed pro-actively before manifests or CRLs go stale, or
   certificates expire, to ensure that problems on the side of the
   Relying Party can be identified and resolved before they cause major
   concerns.

   The Update Notification File is used by Relying Parties to discover
   whether any changes exist between the state of the repository and the
   Relying Party's cache.  It describes the location of the files
   containing the snapshot and incremental deltas, which can be used by
   the Relying Party to synchronize with the repository.

   A Repository Server MAY use caching infrastructure to cache the
   Update Notification File and reduce the load of HTTPS requests.
   However, since this file is used by Relying Parties to determine
   whether any updates are available, the Repository Server SHOULD
   ensure that this file is not cached for longer than 1 minute.  An
   exception to this rule is that it is better to serve a stale Update
   Notification File rather than no Update Notification File.

   How this is achieved exactly depends on the caching infrastructure
   used.  In general, a Repository Server may find certain HTTP headers
   to be useful, such as: "Cache-Control: max-age=60" (see <a href="rfc7234.html#section-5.2">Section 5.2
   of [RFC7234]</a>).  Another approach can be to have the Repository Server

   push out new versions of the Update Notification File to the caching
   infrastructure when appropriate.

   In case of a high load on a Repository Server or its distribution
   network, the Cache-Control HTTP header, or a similar mechanism, MAY
   be used to suggest an optimal (for the Repository Server) poll
   interval for Relying Parties.  However, setting it to an interval
   longer than 1 hour is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Relying parties SHOULD align
   the suggested interval with their operational practices and the
   expected update frequency of RPKI repository data and MAY discard the
   suggested value.

   Example Update Notification File:

     &lt;notification xmlns="http://www.ripe.net/rpki/rrdp"
           version="1"
           session_id="9df4b597-af9e-4dca-bdda-719cce2c4e28"

       &lt;delta serial="2" uri="https://host/9d-8/2/delta.xml" hash="EF"/&gt;
     &lt;/notification&gt;

   Note: URIs and hash values in this example are shortened because of
   formatting.

   The following validation rules MUST be observed when creating or
   parsing Update Notification Files:

   o  A Relying Party MUST reject any Update Notification File that is
      not well-formed or does not conform to the RELAX NG schema
      outlined in <a href="#section-3.5.4">Section 3.5.4</a> of this document.

   o  The XML namespace MUST be "<a href="http://www.ripe.net/rpki/rrdp">http://www.ripe.net/rpki/rrdp</a>".

   o  The encoding MUST be "US-ASCII".

   o  The version attribute in the notification root element MUST be
      "1".

   o  The session_id attribute MUST be a random version 4 UUID
      [<a href="rfc4122.html" title='"A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"'>RFC4122</a>], unique to this session.

   o  The serial attribute MUST be an unbounded, unsigned positive
      integer in decimal format indicating the current version of the
      repository.

   o  The Update Notification File MUST contain exactly one 'snapshot'
      element for the current repository version.

   o  If delta elements are included, they MUST form a contiguous
      sequence of serial numbers starting at a revision determined by
      the Repository Server, up to the serial number mentioned in the
      notification element.  Note that the elements may not be ordered.

   o  The hash attribute in snapshot and delta elements MUST be the
      hexadecimal encoding of the SHA-256 [<a href="#ref-SHS" title='"Secure Hash Standard (SHS)"'>SHS</a>] hash of the referenced
      file.  The Relying Party MUST verify this hash when the file is
      retrieved and reject the file if the hash does not match.

   A snapshot is intended to reflect the complete and current contents
   of the repository for a specific session and version.  Therefore, it
   MUST contain all objects from the repository current as of the time
   of the publication.

   A snapshot reflects the content of the repository at a specific point
   in time; for that reason, it can be considered immutable data.
   Snapshot Files MUST be published at a URL that is unique to the
   specific session and serial.

   Because these files never change, they MAY be cached indefinitely.
   However, in order to prevent these files from using a lot of space in
   the caching infrastructure, it is RECOMMENDED that a limited interval
   is used in the order of hours or days.

   To avoid race conditions where a Relying Party downloads an Update
   Notification File moments before it's updated, Repository Servers
   SHOULD retain old Snapshot Files for at least 5 minutes after a new
   Update Notification File is published.

   An incremental Delta File contains all changes for exactly one serial
   increment of the Repository Server.  In other words, a single delta
   will typically include all the new objects, updated objects, and
   withdrawn objects that a Certification Authority sent to the
   Repository Server.  In its simplest form, the update could concern
   only a single object, but it is RECOMMENDED that CAs send all changes
   for one of their key pairs (updated objects as well as a new manifest
   and CRL) as one atomic update message.

   Deltas reflect the difference between two consecutive versions of a
   repository for a given session.  For that reason, deltas can be
   considered immutable data.  Delta Files MUST be published at a URL
   that is unique to the specific session and serial.

   This protocol has been designed to replace rsync as a distribution
   mechanism of an RPKI repository.  However, it is also designed to
   coexist with existing implementations based on rsync, to enable
   smooth transition from one distribution mechanism to another.

   For every repository object listed in the Snapshot and Delta Files,
   both the hash of the object's content and the rsync URI [<a href="rfc5781.html" title='"The rsync URI Scheme"'>RFC5781</a>] of
   its location in the repository are listed.  This makes it possible to
   distribute the same RPKI repository, represented by a set of files on
   a filesystem, using both rsync and RRDP.  It also enables Relying
   Parties tools to query, combine, and consequently validate objects
   from repositories of different types.

   One of the design goals of RRDP was to minimize load on a Repository
   Server while serving clients.  To achieve this, neither the content
   nor the URLs of the Snapshot and Delta Files are modified after they
   have been published in the Update Notification File.  This allows
   their effective distribution by using either a single HTTP server or
   a CDN.

   The RECOMMENDED way for Relying Parties to keep up with the
   repository updates is to poll the Update Notification File for
   changes.  The content of that file is updated with every new serial
   version of a repository (while its URL remains stable).  To
   effectively implement distribution of the Update Notification File,
   an "If-Modified-Since" HTTP request header is required to be present
   in all requests for the Update Notification File (see <a href="#section-3.4.4">Section 3.4.4</a>).
   Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that Relying Party tools implement a
   mechanism to keep track of a previous successful fetch of an Update
   Notification File.

   Implementations of RRDP should also take care of not producing new
   versions of the repository (and subsequently, new Update
   Notification, Snapshot, and Delta Files) too often.  Usually the
   maintenance of the RPKI repository includes regular updates of
   manifest and CRL objects performed on a schedule.  This often results
   in bursts of repository updates during a short period of time.  Since
   the Relying Parties are required to poll for the Update Notification
   File not more often than once per minute (<a href="#section-3.4.4">Section 3.4.4</a>), it is not
   practical to generate new serial versions of the repository much more
   often than 1 per minute.  It is allowed to combine multiple updates,
   possibly from different CAs, into a new serial repository version
   (<a href="#section-3.3.2">Section 3.3.2</a>).  This will significantly shorten the size of the
   Update Notification File and total amount of data distributed to all
   Relying Parties.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20HTTPS%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  HTTPS Considerations</span>

   Note that a Man in the Middle (MITM) cannot produce validly signed
   RPKI data but can perform withhold or replay attacks targeting a
   Relying Party and keep the Relying Party from learning about changes
   in the RPKI.  Because of this, Relying Parties SHOULD do TLS
   certificate and host name validation when they fetch from an RRDP
   Repository Server.

   Relying Party tools SHOULD log any TLS certificate or host name
   validation issues found, so that an operator can investigate the
   cause.  However, such validation issues are often due to
   configuration errors or a lack of a common TLS trust anchor.  In

   these cases, it is better if the Relying Party retrieves the signed
   RPKI data regardless and performs validation on it.  Therefore, the
   Relying Party MUST continue to retrieve the data in case of errors.
   The Relying Party MAY choose to log encountered issues only when
   fetching the Update Notification File, but not when it subsequently
   fetches Snapshot or Delta Files from the same host.  Furthermore, the
   Relying Party MAY provide a way for operators to accept untrusted
   connections for a given host, after the cause has been identified.

   It is RECOMMENDED that Relying Parties and Repository Servers follow
   the Best Current Practices outlined in [<a href="rfc7525.html" title='"Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"'>RFC7525</a>] on the use of HTTP
   over TLS (HTTPS) [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>].  Relying Parties SHOULD do TLS
   certificate and host name validation using subjectAltName dNSName
   identities as described in [<a href="rfc6125.html" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>].  The rules and guidelines
   defined in [<a href="rfc6125.html" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>] apply here, with the following considerations:

   o  Relying Parties and Repository Servers SHOULD support the DNS-ID
      identifier type.  The DNS-ID identifier type SHOULD be present in
      Repository Server certificates.

   o  DNS names in Repository Server certificates SHOULD NOT contain the
      wildcard character "*".

   o  A Common Name (CN) field may be present in a Repository Server
      certificate's subject name but SHOULD NOT be used for
      authentication within the rules described in [<a href="rfc6125.html" title='"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC6125</a>].

   o  This protocol does not require the use of SRV-IDs.

   o  This protocol does not require the use of URI-IDs.

   Note, however, that this validation is done on a best-effort basis
   and serves to highlight potential issues, but RPKI object security
   does not depend on this.  Therefore, Relying Parties MAY deviate from
   the validation steps listed above.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   RRDP deals exclusively with the transfer of RPKI objects from a
   Repository Server to a Relying Party.  The trust relation between a
   Certificate Authority and its Repository Server is out of scope for
   this document.  However, it should be noted that from a Relying Party
   point of view, all RPKI objects (certificates, CRLs, and objects
   wrapped in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)) are already covered by
   object security mechanisms including signed manifests.  This allows
   validation of these objects even though the Repository Server itself
   is not trusted.  This document makes no change to RPKI validation
   procedures per se.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc8182.html">RFC 8182</a>        The RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)      July 2017</span>


   The original RPKI transport protocol is rsync, which offers no
   channel security mechanism.  RRDP replaces the use of rsync by HTTPS;
   while the channel security mechanism underlying RRDP (HTTPS) is not a
   cure-all, it does make some forms of denial-of-service attacks more
   difficult for the attacker.  HTTPS issues are discussed in more
   detail in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.

   Supporting both RRDP and rsync necessarily increases the number of
   opportunities for a malicious RPKI Certificate Authority to perform
   denial-of-service attacks on Relying Parties, by expanding the number
   of URIs which the Relying Party may need to contact in order to
   complete a validation run.  However, other than the relative cost of
   HTTPS versus rsync, adding RRDP to the mix does not change this
   picture significantly: with either RRDP or rsync a malicious
   Certificate Authority can supply an effectively infinite series of
   URIs for the Relying Party to follow.  The only real solution to this
   is for the Relying Party to apply some kind of bound to the amount of
   work it is willing to do.  Note also that the attacker in this
   scenario must be an RPKI Certificate Authority; otherwise, the normal
   RPKI object security checks would reject the malicious URIs.

   Processing costs for objects retrieved using RRDP may be somewhat
   different from the same objects retrieved using rsync: because RRDP
   treats an entire set of changes as a unit (one "delta"), it may not
   be practical to start processing any of the objects in the delta
   until the entire delta has been received.  With rsync, by contrast,
   incremental processing may be easy, but the overall cost of transfer
   may be higher, as may be the number of corner cases in which the
   Relying Party retrieves some but not all of the updated objects.
   Overall, RRDP's behavior is closer to a proper transactional system,
   which (probably) leads to an overall reliability increase.

   RRDP is designed to scale much better than rsync.  In particular,
   RRDP is designed to allow use of an HTTPS caching infrastructure to
   reduce load on primary Repository Servers and increase resilience
   against denial-of-service attacks on the RPKI publication service.
