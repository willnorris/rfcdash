Abstract

   This document describes the protocol design and architecture for
   Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).  EIGRP is a
   routing protocol based on Distance Vector technology.  The specific
   algorithm used is called "DUAL", a Diffusing Update Algorithm as
   referenced in "Loop-Free Routing Using Diffusing Computations"
   (Garcia-Luna-Aceves 1993).  The algorithm and procedures were
   researched, developed, and simulated by SRI International.

   This document describes the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing
   Protocol (EIGRP), a routing protocol designed and developed by Cisco
   Systems, Inc.  DUAL, the algorithm used to converge the control plane
   to a single set of loop-free paths is based on research conducted at
   SRI International [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Loop-Free Routing using Diffusing Computations"'>3</a>].  The Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) is the
   algorithm used to obtain loop freedom at every instant throughout a
   route computation [<a href="#ref-2" title='"A Unified Approach to Loop-Free Routing Using Distance Vectors or Link States"'>2</a>].  This allows all routers involved in a
   topology change to synchronize at the same time; the routers not
   affected by topology changes are not involved in the recalculation.
   This document describes the protocol that implements these functions.

   The following is a list of abbreviations and terms used throughout
   this document:

   ACTIVE State:
      The local state of a route on a router triggered by any event that
      causes all neighbors providing the current least-cost path to fail
      the Feasibility Condition check.  A route in Active state is
      considered unusable.  During Active state, the router is actively
      attempting to compute the least-cost loop-free path by explicit
      coordination with its neighbors using Query and Reply messages.

   Address Family Identifier (AFI):
      Identity of the network-layer protocol reachability information
      being advertised [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Address Family Numbers"'>12</a>].

   Autonomous System (AS):
      A collection of routers exchanging routes under the control of one
      or more network administrators on behalf of a single
      administrative entity.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7868.html">RFC 7868</a>                      Cisco's EIGRP                     May 2016</span>


   Base Topology:
      A routing domain representing a physical (non-virtual) view of the
      network topology consisting of attached devices and network
      segments EIGRP uses to form neighbor relationships.  Destinations
      exchanged within the Base Topology are identified with a Topology
      Identifier value of zero (0).

   Computed Distance (CD):
      Total distance (metric) along a path from the current router to a
      destination network through a particular neighbor computed using
      that neighbor's Reported Distance (RD) and the cost of the link
      between the two routers.  Exactly one CD is computed and
      maintained per the [Destination, Advertising Neighbor] pair.

   CR-Mode
      Conditionally Received Mode

   Diffusing Computation:
      A distributed computation in which a single starting node
      commences the computation by delegating subtasks of the
      computation to its neighbors that may, in turn, recursively
      delegate sub-subtasks further, including a signaling scheme
      allowing the starting node to detect that the computation has
      finished while avoiding false terminations.  In DUAL, the task of
      coordinated updates of routing tables and resulting best path
      computation is performed as a diffusing computation.

   Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL):
      A loop-free routing algorithm used with distance vectors or link
      states that provides a diffused computation of a routing table.
      It works very well in the presence of multiple topology changes
      with low overhead.  The technology was researched and developed at
      SRI International [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Loop-Free Routing using Diffusing Computations"'>3</a>].

   Downstream Router:
      A router that is one or more hops away from the router in question
      in the direction of the destination.

   EIGRP:
      Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol.

   Feasibility Condition:
      The Feasibility Condition is a sufficient condition used by a
      router to verify whether a neighboring router provides a loop-free
      path to a destination.  EIGRP uses the Source Node Condition
      stating that a neighboring router meets the Feasibility Condition
      if the neighbor's RD is less than this router's Feasible Distance.




<span class="grey">Savage, et al.                Informational                     [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-7" id="page-7" name="page-7"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7868.html">RFC 7868</a>                      Cisco's EIGRP                     May 2016</span>


   Feasible Distance (FD):
      Defined as the least-known total metric to a destination from the
      current router since the last transition from ACTIVE to PASSIVE
      state.  Being effectively a record of the smallest known metric
      since the last time the network entered the PASSIVE state, the FD
      is not necessarily a metric of the current best path.  Exactly one
      FD is computed per destination network.

   Feasible Successor:
      A neighboring router that meets the Feasibility Condition for a
      particular destination, hence, providing a guaranteed loop-free
      path.

   Neighbor/Peer:
      For a particular router, another router toward which an EIGRP
      session, also known as an "adjacency", is established.  The
      ability of two routers to become neighbors depends on their mutual
      connectivity and compatibility of selected EIGRP configuration
      parameters.  Two neighbors with interfaces connected to a common
      subnet are known as adjacent neighbors.  Two neighbors that are
      multiple hops apart are known as remote neighbors.

   PASSIVE state:
      The local state of a route in which at least one neighbor
      providing the current least-cost path passes the Feasibility
      Condition check.  A route in PASSIVE state is considered usable
      and not in need of a coordinated re-computation.

   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI):
      Information a router uses to calculate the global routing table to
      make routing and forwarding decisions.

   Reported Distance (RD):
      For a particular destination, the value representing the router's
      distance to the destination as advertised in all messages carrying
      routing information.  RD is not equivalent to the current distance
      of the router to the destination and may be different from it
      during the process of path re-computation.  Exactly one RD is
      computed and maintained per destination network.

   Sub-Topology:
      For a given Base Topology, a sub-topology is characterized by an
      independent set of routers and links in a network for which EIGRP
      performs an independent path calculation.  This allows each sub-
      topology to implement class-specific topologies to carry class-
      specific traffic.





<span class="grey">Savage, et al.                Informational                     [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-8" id="page-8" name="page-8"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7868.html">RFC 7868</a>                      Cisco's EIGRP                     May 2016</span>


   Successor:
      For a particular destination, a neighboring router that meets the
      Feasibility Condition and, at the same time, provides the least-
      cost path.

   Stuck In Active (SIA):
      A destination that has remained in the ACTIVE State in excess of a
      predefined time period at the local router (Cisco implements this
      as 3 minutes).

   Successor-Directed Acyclic Graph (SDAG):
      For a particular destination, a graph defined by routing table
      contents of individual routers in the topology, such that nodes of
      this graph are the routers themselves and a directed edge from
      router X to router Y exists if and only if router Y is router X's
      successor.  After the network has converged, in the absence of
      topological changes, SDAG is a tree.

   Topology Change / Topology-Change Event:
      Any event that causes the CD for a destination through a neighbor
      to be added, modified, or removed.  As an example, detecting a
      link-cost change, receiving any EIGRP message from a neighbor
      advertising an updated neighbor's RD.

   Topology Identifier (TID):
      A number that is used to mark prefixes as belonging to a specific
      sub-topology.

   Topology Table:
      A data structure used by EIGRP to store information about every
      known destination including, but not limited to, network prefix /
      prefix length, FD, RD of each neighbor advertising the
      destination, CD over the corresponding neighbor, and route state.

   Type, Length, Value (TLV):
      An encoding format for information elements used in EIGRP messages
      to exchange information.  Each TLV-formatted information element
      consists of three generic fields: Type identifying the nature of
      information carried in this element, Length describing the length
      of the entire TLV triplet, and Value carrying the actual
      information.  The Value field may, itself, be internally
      structured; this depends on the actual type of the information
      element.  This format allows for extensibility and backward
      compatibility.

   The Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) constructs least-cost paths to
   all reachable destinations in a network consisting of nodes and edges
   (routers and links).  DUAL guarantees that each constructed path is
   loop free at every instant including periods of topology changes and
   network reconvergence.  This is accomplished by all routers, which
   are affected by a topology change, computing the new best path in a
   coordinated (diffusing) way and using the Feasibility Condition to
   verify prospective paths for loop freedom.  Routers that are not
   affected by topology changes are not involved in the recalculation.
   The convergence time with DUAL rivals that of any other existing
   routing protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Algorithm%20Description"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Algorithm Description</span>

   DUAL is used by EIGRP to achieve fast loop-free convergence with
   little overhead, allowing EIGRP to provide convergence rates
   comparable, and in some cases better than, most common link state
   protocols [<a href="#ref-10" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>10</a>].  Only nodes that are affected by a topology change
   need to propagate and act on information about the topology change,
   allowing EIGRP to have good scaling properties, reduced overhead, and
   lower complexity than many other interior gateway protocols.

   Distributed routing algorithms are required to propagate information
   as well as coordinate information among all nodes in the network.
   Unlike basic Bellman-Ford distance vector protocols that rely on
   uncoordinated updates when a topology change occurs, DUAL uses a
   coordinated procedure to involve the affected part of the network
   into computing a new least-cost path, known as a "diffusing
   computation".  A diffusing computation grows by querying additional
   routers for their current RD to the affected destination, and it
   shrinks by receiving replies from them.  Unaffected routers send
   replies immediately, terminating the growth of the diffusing
   computation over them.  These intrinsic properties cause the
   diffusing computation to self-adjust in scope and terminate as soon
   as possible.

   One attribute of DUAL is its ability to control the point at which
   the diffusion of a route calculation terminates by managing the
   distribution of reachability information through the network.

   Controlling the scope of the diffusing process is accomplished by
   hiding reachability information through aggregation (summarization),
   filtering, or other means.  This provides the ability to create
   effective failure domains within a single AS, and allows the network
   administrator to manage the convergence and processing
   characteristics of the network.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Route%20States"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Route States</span>

   A route to a destination can be in one of two states: PASSIVE or
   ACTIVE.  These states describe whether the route is guaranteed to be
   both loop free and the shortest available (the PASSIVE state) or
   whether such a guarantee cannot be given (the ACTIVE state).
   Consequently, in PASSIVE state, the router does not perform any route
   recalculation in coordination with its neighbors because no such
   recalculation is needed.

   In ACTIVE state, the router is actively involved in re-computing the
   least-cost loop-free path in coordination with its neighbors.  The
   state is reevaluated and possibly changed every time a topology
   change is detected.  A topology change is any event that causes the
   CD to the destination over any neighbor to be added, changed, or
   removed from EIGRP's topology table.

   More exactly, the two states are defined as follows:

   o Passive

      A route is considered to be in the Passive state when at least one
      neighbor that provides the current least-total-cost path passes
      the Feasibility Condition check that guarantees loop freedom.  A
      route in the PASSIVE state is usable and its next hop is perceived
      to be a downstream router.

   o Active

      A route is considered to be in the ACTIVE state if neighbors that
      do not pass the Feasibility Condition check provide lowest-cost
      path, and therefore the path cannot be guaranteed loop free.  A
      route in the ACTIVE state is considered unusable and this router
      must coordinate with its neighbors in the search for the new loop-
      free least-total-cost path.

   In other words, for a route to be in PASSIVE state, at least one
   neighbor that provides the least-total-cost path must be a Feasible
   Successor.  Feasible Successors providing the least-total-cost path
   are also called "successors".  For a route to be in PASSIVE state, at
   least one successor must exist.



<span class="grey">Savage, et al.                Informational                    [Page 10]</span></pre>

   Conversely, if the path with the least total cost is provided by
   routers that are not Feasible Successors (and thus not successors),
   the route is in the ACTIVE state, requiring re-computation.

   Notably, for the definition of PASSIVE and ACTIVE states, it does not
   matter if there are Feasible Successors providing a worse-than-least-
   total-cost path.  While these neighbors are guaranteed to provide a
   loop-free path, that path is potentially not the shortest available.

   The fact that the least-total-cost path can be provided by a neighbor
   that fails the Feasibility Condition check may not be intuitive.
   However, such a situation can occur during topology changes when the
   current least-total-cost path fails and the next-least-total-cost
   path traverses a neighbor that is not a Feasible Successor.

   While a router has a route in the ACTIVE state, it must not change
   its successor (i.e., modify the current SDAG) nor modify its own
   Feasible Distance or RD until the route enters the PASSIVE state
   again.  Any updated information about this route received during
   ACTIVE state is reflected only in CDs.  Any updates to the successor,
   FD, and RD are postponed until the route returns to PASSIVE state.
   The state transitions from PASSIVE to ACTIVE and from ACTIVE to
   PASSIVE are controlled by the DUAL FSM and are described in detail in
   <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Feasibility%20Condition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Feasibility Condition</span>

   The Feasibility Condition is a criterion used to verify loop freedom
   of a particular path.  The Feasibility Condition is a sufficient but
   not a necessary condition, meaning that every path meeting the
   Feasibility Condition is guaranteed to be loop free; however, not all
   loop-free paths meet the Feasibility Condition.

   The Feasibility Condition is used as an integral part of DUAL
   operation: every path selection in DUAL is subject to the Feasibility
   Condition check.  Based on the result of the Feasibility Condition
   check after a topology change is detected, the route may either
   remain PASSIVE (if, after the topology change, the neighbor providing
   the least cost path meets the Feasibility Condition) or it needs to
   enter the ACTIVE state (if the topology change resulted in none of
   the neighbors providing the least cost path to meet the Feasibility
   Condition).

   The Feasibility Condition is a part of DUAL that allows the diffused
   computation to terminate as early as possible.  Nodes that are not
   affected by the topology change are not required to perform a DUAL
   computation and may not be aware a topology change occurred.  This
   can occur in two cases:



<span class="grey">Savage, et al.                Informational                    [Page 11]</span></pre>

   First, if informed about a topology change, a router may keep a route
   in PASSIVE state if it is aware of other paths that are downstream
   towards the destination (routes meeting the Feasibility Condition).
   A route that meets the Feasibility Condition is determined to be loop
   free and downstream along the path between the router and the
   destination.

   Second, if informed about a topology change for which it does not
   currently have reachability information, a router is not required to
   enter into the ACTIVE state, nor is it required to participate in the
   DUAL process.

   In order to facilitate describing the Feasibility Condition, a few
   definitions are in order.

   o  A successor for a given route is the next hop used to forward data
      traffic for a destination.  Typically, the successor is chosen
      based on the least-cost path to reach the destination.

   o  A Feasible Successor is a neighbor that meets the Feasibility
      Condition.  A Feasible Successor is regarded as a downstream
      neighbor towards the destination, but it may not be the least-cost
      path but could still be used for forwarding data packets in the
      event equal or unequal cost load sharing was active.  A Feasible
      Successor can become a successor when the current successor
      becomes unreachable.

   o  The Feasibility Condition is met when a neighbor's advertised
      cost, (RD) to a destination is less than the FD for that
      destination, or in other words, the Feasibility Condition is met
      when the neighbor is closer to the destination than the router
      itself has ever been since the destination has entered the PASSIVE
      state for the last time.

   o  The FD is the lowest distance to the destination since the last
      time the route went from ACTIVE to PASSIVE state.  It should be
      noted it is not necessarily the current best distance; rather, it
      is a historical record of the best distance known since the last
      diffusing computation for the destination has finished.  Thus, the
      value of the FD can either be the same as the current best
      distance, or it can be lower.

   A neighbor that advertises a route with a cost that does not meet the
   Feasibility Condition may be upstream and thus cannot be guaranteed
   to be the next hop for a loop-free path.  Routes advertised by
   upstream neighbors are not recorded in the routing table but saved in
   the topology table.

   DUAL operates with three basic message types: QUERY, UPDATE, and
   REPLY.

   o  UPDATE - sent to indicate a change in metric or an addition of a
      destination.

   o  QUERY - sent when the Feasibility Condition fails, which can
      happen for reasons like a destination becoming unreachable or the
      metric increasing to a value greater than its current FD.

   o REPLY - sent in response to a QUERY or SIA-QUERY

   In addition to these three basic types, two additional sub-types have
   been added to EIGRP:

   o  SIA-QUERY - sent when a REPLY has not been received within one-
      half of the SIA interval (90 seconds as implemented by Cisco).

   o  SIA-REPLY - sent in response to an SIA-QUERY indicating the route
      is still in ACTIVE state.  This response does not stratify the
      original QUERY; it is only used to indicate that the sending
      neighbor is still in the ACTIVE state for the given destination.

   When in the PASSIVE state, a received QUERY may be propagated if
   there is no Feasible Successor found.  If a Feasible Successor is
   found, the QUERY is not propagated and a REPLY is sent for the
   destination with a metric equal to the current routing table metric.
   When a QUERY is received from a non-successor in ACTIVE state, a
   REPLY is sent and the QUERY is not propagated.  The REPLY for the
   destination contains a metric equal to the current routing table
   metric.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.%20%20DUAL%20Finite%20State%20Machine%20%28FSM%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" name="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  DUAL Finite State Machine (FSM)</span>

   The DUAL FSM embodies the decision process for all route
   computations.  It tracks all routes advertised by all neighbors.  The
   distance information, known as a metric, is used by DUAL to select
   efficient loop-free paths.  DUAL selects routes to be inserted into a
   routing table based on Feasible Successors.  A successor is a
   neighboring router used for packet forwarding that has a least-cost
   path to a destination that is guaranteed not to be part of a routing
   loop.

   When there are no Feasible Successors but there are neighbors
   advertising the destination, a recalculation must occur to determine
   a new successor.

   The amount of time it takes to calculate the route impacts the
   convergence time.  Even though the recalculation is not processor
   intensive, it is advantageous to avoid recalculation if it is not
   necessary.  When a topology change occurs, DUAL will test for
   Feasible Successors.  If there are Feasible Successors, it will use
   any it finds in order to avoid any unnecessary recalculation.

   The FSM, which applies per destination in the topology table,
   operates independently for each destination.  It is true that if a
   single link goes down, multiple routes may go into ACTIVE state.
   However, a separate SDAG is computed for each destination, so loop-
   free topologies can be maintained for each reachable destination.

   The following describes in detail the state/event/action transitions
   of the DUAL FSM.  For all steps, the topology table is updated with
   the new metric information from either QUERY, REPLY, or UPDATE
   received.

   (1)  A QUERY is received from a neighbor that is not the current
        successor.  The route is currently in PASSIVE state.  As the
        successor is not affected by the QUERY, and a Feasible Successor
        exists, the route remains in PASSIVE state.  Since a Feasible
        Successor exists, a REPLY MUST be sent back to the originator of
        the QUERY.  Any metric received in the QUERY from that neighbor
        is recorded in the topology table and the Feasibility Check (FC)
        is run to check for any change to current successor.

   (2)  A directly connected interface changes state (connects,
        disconnects, or changes metric), or similarly an UPDATE or QUERY
        has been received with a metric change for an existing
        destination, the route will stay in the PASSIVE state if the
        current successor is not affected by the change, or it is no
        longer reachable and there is a Feasible Successor.  In either
        case, an UPDATE is sent with the new metric information if it
        has changed.

   (3)  A QUERY was received from a neighbor who is the current
        successor and no Feasible Successors exist.  The route for the
        destination goes into ACTIVE state.  A QUERY is sent to all
        neighbors on all interfaces that are not split horizon.  Split
        horizon takes effect for a query or update from the successor it
        is using for the destination in the query.  The QUERY origin
        flag is set to indicate the QUERY originated from a neighbor
        marked as successor for route.  The REPLY status flag is set for
        all neighbors to indicate outstanding replies.

   (4)  A directly connected link has gone down or its cost has
        increased, or an UPDATE has been received with a metric
        increase.  The route to the destination goes to ACTIVE state if
        there are no Feasible Successors found.  A QUERY is sent to all
        neighbors on all interfaces.  The QUERY origin flag is to
        indicate that the router originated the QUERY.  The REPLY status
        flag is set to 1 for all neighbors to indicate outstanding
        replies.

   (5)  While a route for a destination is in ACTIVE state, and a QUERY
        is received from the current successor, the route remains in
        ACTIVE state.  The QUERY origin flag is set to indicate that
        there was another topology change while in ACTIVE state.  This
        indication is used so new Feasible Successors are compared to
        the metric that made the route go to ACTIVE state with the
        current successor.

   (6)  While a route for a destination is in ACTIVE state and a QUERY
        is received from a neighbor that is not the current successor, a
        REPLY should be sent to the neighbor.  The metric received in
        the QUERY should be recorded.

   (7)  If a link cost changes, or an UPDATE with a metric change is
        received in ACTIVE state from a non-successor, the router stays
        in ACTIVE state for the destination.  The metric information in
        the UPDATE is recorded.  When a route is in the ACTIVE state,
        neither a QUERY nor UPDATE are ever sent.

   (8)  If a REPLY for a destination, in ACTIVE state, is received from
        a neighbor or the link between a router and the neighbor fails,
        the router records that the neighbor replied to the QUERY.  The
        REPLY status flag is set to 0 to indicate this.  The route stays
        in ACTIVE state if there are more replies pending because the
        router has not heard from all neighbors.

   (9)  If a route for a destination is in ACTIVE state, and a link
        fails or a cost increase occurred between a router and its
        successor, the router treats this case like it has received a
        REPLY from its successor.  When this occurs after the router
        originates a QUERY, it sets the QUERY origin flag to indicate
        that another topology change occurred in ACTIVE state.

   (10) If a route for a destination is in ACTIVE state, and a link
        fails or a cost increase occurred between a router and its
        successor, the router treats this case like it has received a
        REPLY from its successor.  When this occurs after a successor
        originated a QUERY, the router sets the QUERY origin flag to
        indicate that another topology change occurred in ACTIVE state.

   (11) If a route for a destination is in ACTIVE state, the cost of the
        link through which the successor increases, and the last REPLY
        was received from all neighbors, but there is no Feasible
        Successor, the route should stay in ACTIVE state.  A QUERY is
        sent to all neighbors.  The QUERY origin flag is set to 1.

        QUERY received from the current successor, and the last REPLY
        was received from all neighbors, but there is no Feasible
        Successor, the route should stay in ACTIVE state.  A QUERY is
        sent to all neighbors.  The QUERY origin flag is set to 3.

   (13) Received replies from all neighbors.  Since the QUERY origin
        flag indicates the successor originated the QUERY, it
        transitions to PASSIVE state and sends a REPLY to the old
        successor.

   (14) Received replies from all neighbors.  Since the QUERY origin
        flag indicates a topology change to the successor while in
        ACTIVE state, it need not send a REPLY to the old successor.
        When the Feasibility Condition is met, the route state
        transitions to PASSIVE.

   (15) Received replies from all neighbors.  Since the QUERY origin
        flag indicates either the router itself originated the QUERY or
        FC was not satisfied with the replies received in ACTIVE state,
        FD is reset to infinite value and the minimum of all the
        reported metrics is chosen as FD and route transitions back to
        PASSIVE state.  A REPLY is sent to the old-successor if oij
        flags indicate that there was a QUERY from successor.

   (16) If a route for a destination is in ACTIVE state because of a
        QUERY received from the current successor or there was an
        increase in distance while in ACTIVE state, the last REPLY was
        received from all neighbors, and a Feasible Successor exists for
        the destination, the route can go into PASSIVE state and a REPLY
        is sent to the successor if oij indicates that QUERY was
        received from the successor.

      Only observing the destination provided by node N, D enters the
   ACTIVE state and sends a QUERY to all its neighbors, in this case
   node C.
      C determines that it has a Feasible Successor and replies
   immediately with metric 3.
      C changes its old successor of D to its new single successor B
   and the route to N stays in PASSIVE state.
      D receives the REPLY and can transition out of ACTIVE state
   since it received replies from all its neighbors.
      D now has a viable path to N through C.
      D selects C as its successor to reach node N with a cost of 4.

   Notice that nodes A and B were not involved in the recalculation
   since they were not affected by the change.

   Let's consider the situation in Figure 4, where Feasible Successors
   may not exist.  If the link between node A and B fails, B goes into
   ACTIVE state for destination N since it has no Feasible Successors.
   Node B sends a QUERY to node C.  C has no Feasible Successors, so it
   goes active for destination N; and since C has no neighbors, it
   replies to the QUERY, deletes the destination, and returns to the
   PASSIVE state for the unreachable route.  As C removes the (now
   unreachable) destination from its table, C sends REPLY to its old
   successor.  B receives this REPLY from C, and determines this is the
   last REPLY it is waiting on before determining what the new state of
   the route should be; on receiving this REPLY, B deletes the route to
   N from its routing table.

   Since B was the originator of the initial QUERY, it does not have to
   send a REPLY to its old successor (it would not be able to any ways,
   because the link to its old successor is down).  Note that nodes A
   and D were not involved in the recalculation since their successors
   were not affected.

   EIGRP uses five different packet types to handle session management
   and pass DUAL Message types:

       HELLO Packets (includes ACK)
       QUERY Packets (includes SIA-Query)
       REPLY Packets (includes SIA-Reply)
       REQUEST Packets
       UPDATE Packets

   EIGRP packets are directly encapsulated into a network-layer
   protocol, such as IPv4 or IPv6.  While EIGRP is capable of using
   additional encapsulation (such as AppleTalk, IPX, etc.) no further
   encapsulation is specified in this document.






<span class="grey">Savage, et al.                Informational                    [Page 20]</span></pre>

   Support for network-layer protocol fragmentation is not supported,
   and EIGRP will attempt to avoid a maximum size packets that exceed
   the interface MTU by sending multiple packets that are less than or
   equal to MTU-sized packets.

   Each packet transmitted will use either multicast or unicast network-
   layer destination addresses.  When multicast addresses are used, a
   mapping for the data link multicast address (when available) must be
   provided.  The source address will be set to the address of the
   sending interface, if applicable.

   The following network-layer multicast addresses and associated data
   link multicast addresses:

      224.0.0.10 for IPv4 "EIGRP Routers" [<a href="#ref-13" title='"IPv4 Multicast Address Space Registry"'>13</a>]
      FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:A for IPv6 "EIGRP Routers" [<a href="#ref-14" title='"IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry"'>14</a>]

   They will be used on multicast-capable media and will be media
   independent for unicast addresses.  Network-layer addresses will be
   used and the mapping to media addresses will be achieved by the
   native protocol mechanisms.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20UPDATE%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  UPDATE Packets</span>

   UPDATE packets carry the DUAL UPDATE message type and are used to
   convey information about destinations and the reachability of those
   destinations.  When a new neighbor is discovered, unicast UPDATE
   packets are used to transmit a full table to the new neighbor, so the
   neighbor can build up its topology table.  In normal operation (other
   than neighbor startup such as a link cost changes), UPDATE packets
   are multicast.  UPDATE packets are always transmitted reliably.  Each
   TLV destination will be processed individually through the DUAL FSM.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20QUERY%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  QUERY Packets</span>

   A QUERY packet carries the DUAL QUERY message type and is sent by a
   router to advertise that a route is in ACTIVE state and the
   originator is requesting alternate path information from its
   neighbors.  An infinite metric is encoded by setting the delay part
   of the metric to its maximum value.

   If there is a topology change that causes multiple destinations to be
   marked ACTIVE, EIGRP will build one or more QUERY packets for all
   destinations present.  The state of each route is recorded
   individually, so a responding QUERY or REPLY need not contain all the
   same destinations in a single packet.  Since EIGRP uses a reliable
   transport mechanism, route QUERY packets are also guaranteed be
   reliably delivered.

   When a QUERY packet is received, each destination will trigger a DUAL
   event, and the state machine will run individually for each route.
   Once the entire original QUERY packet is processed, then a REPLY or
   SIA-REPLY will be sent with the latest information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20REPLY%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  REPLY Packets</span>

   A REPLY packet carries the DUAL REPLY message type and will be sent
   in response to a QUERY or SIA-QUERY packet.  The REPLY packet will
   include a TLV for each destination and the associated vector metric
   in its own topology table.

   The REPLY packet is sent after the entire received QUERY packet is
   processed.  When a REPLY packet is received, there is no reason to
   process the packet before an acknowledgment is sent.  Therefore, an
   acknowledgment is sent immediately and then the packet is processed.
   The sending of the acknowledgment is accomplished either by sending
   an ACK packet or by piggybacking the acknowledgment onto another
   packet already being transmitted.

   Each TLV destination will be processed individually through the DUAL
   FSM.  When a QUERY is received for a route that doesn't exist in our
   topology table, a REPLY with an infinite metric is sent and an entry
   in the topology table is added with the metric in the QUERY if the
   metric is not an infinite value.

   If a REPLY for a designation not in the Active state, or not in the
   topology table, EIGRP will acknowledge the packet and discard the
   REPLY.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20Exception%20Handling"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Exception Handling</span>

   When an EIGRP router transitions to ACTIVE state for a particular
   destination, a QUERY is sent to a neighbor and the ACTIVE timer is
   started to limit the amount of time a destination may remain in an
   ACTIVE state.

   A route is regarded as SIA when it does not receive a REPLY within a
   preset time.  This time interval is broken into two equal periods
   following the QUERY, and up to three additional "busy" periods in
   which an SIA-QUERY packet is sent for the destination.

   This process is begun when a router sends a QUERY to its neighbor.
   After one-half the SIA time interval (default implementation is 90
   seconds), the router will send an SIA-QUERY; this must be replied to
   with either a REPLY or SIA-REPLY.  Any neighbor that fails to send

   either a REPLY or SIA-REPLY with-in one-half the SIA interval will
   result in the neighbor being deemed to be "stuck" in the active
   state.

   Cisco also limits the number of SIA-REPLY messages allowed to three.
   Once the timeout occurs after the third SIA-REPLY with the neighbor
   remaining in an ACTIVE state (as noted in the SIA-Reply message), the
   neighbor being deemed to be "stuck" in the active state.

   If the SIA state is declared, DUAL may take one of two actions;

      a) Delete the route from that neighbor, acting as if the neighbor
         had responded with an unreachable REPLY message from the
         neighbor.

      b) Delete all routes from that neighbor and reset the adjacency
         with that neighbor, acting as if the neighbor had responded
         with an unreachable message for all routes.

   Implementation note: Cisco currently implements option (b).

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.1.1.%20%20SIA-QUERY"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.1.1" name="section-4.4.1.1">4.4.1.1</a>.  SIA-QUERY</span>

   When a QUERY is still outstanding and awaiting a REPLY from a
   neighbor, there is insufficient information to determine why a REPLY
   has not been received.  A lost packet, congestion on the link, or a
   slow neighbor could cause a lack of REPLY from a downstream neighbor.

   In order to try to ascertain if the neighboring device is still
   attempting to converge on the active route, EIGRP may send an SIA-
   QUERY packet to the active neighbor(s).  This enables an EIGRP router
   to determine if there is a communication issue with the neighbor or
   if it is simply still attempting to converge with downstream routers.

   By sending an SIA-QUERY, the originating router may extend the
   effective active time by resetting the ACTIVE timer that has been
   previously set, thus allowing convergence to continue so long as
   neighbor devices successfully communicate that convergence is still
   underway.

   The SIA-QUERY packet SHOULD be sent on a per-destination basis at
   one-half of the ACTIVE timeout period.  Up to three SIA-QUERY packets
   for a specific destination may be sent, each at a value of one-half
   the ACTIVE time, so long as each are successfully acknowledged and
   met with an SIA-REPLY.

   Upon receipt of an SIA-QUERY packet, an EIGRP router should first
   send an ACK and then continue to process the SIA-QUERY information.
   The QUERY is sent on a per-destination basis at approximately one-
   half the active time.

   If the EIGRP router is still active for the destination specified in
   the SIA-QUERY, the router should respond to the originator with the
   SIA-REPLY indicating that active processing for this destination is
   still underway by setting the ACTIVE flag in the packet upon
   response.

   If the router receives an SIA-QUERY referencing a destination for
   which it has not received the original QUERY, the router should treat
   the packet as though it was a standard QUERY:

      1) Acknowledge the receipt of the packet

      2) Send a REPLY if a successor exists

      3) If the SIA-QUERY is from the successor, transition to the
         ACTIVE state if and only if a Feasibility Condition check fails
         and send an SIA-REPLY with the ACTIVE bit set

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.1.2.%20%20SIA-REPLY"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.1.2" name="section-4.4.1.2">4.4.1.2</a>.  SIA-REPLY</span>

   An SIA-REPLY packet is the corresponding response upon receipt of an
   SIA-QUERY from an EIGRP neighbor.  The SIA-REPLY packet will include
   a TLV for each destination and the associated vector metric in the
   topology table.  The SIA-REPLY packet is sent after the entire
   received SIA-QUERY packet is processed.

   If the EIGRP router is still ACTIVE for a destination, the SIA-REPLY
   packet will be sent with the ACTIVE bit set.  This confirms for the
   neighbor device that the SIA-QUERY packet has been processed by DUAL
   and that the router is still attempting to resolve a loop-free path
   (likely awaiting responses to its own QUERY to downstream neighbors).

   The SIA-REPLY informs the recipient that convergence is complete or
   still ongoing; it is an explicit notification that the router is
   still actively engaged in the convergence process.  This allows the
   device that sent the SIA-QUERY to determine whether it should
   continue to allow the routes that are not converged to be in the
   ACTIVE state or if it should reset the neighbor relationship and
   flush all routes through this neighbor.

   EIGRP has four basic components:

        o Finite State Machine
        o Reliable Transport Protocol
        o Neighbor Discovery/Recovery
        o Route Management

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20Finite%20State%20Machine"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Finite State Machine</span>

   The detail of DUAL, the State Machine used by EIGRP, is covered in
   <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Reliable%20Transport%20Protocol"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Reliable Transport Protocol</span>

   The reliable transport is responsible for guaranteed, ordered
   delivery of EIGRP packets to all neighbors.  It supports intermixed
   transmission of multicast and unicast packets.  Some EIGRP packets
   must be transmitted reliably and others need not.  For efficiency,
   reliability is provided only when necessary.

   For example, on a multi-access network that has multicast
   capabilities, such as Ethernet, it is not necessary to send HELLOs
   reliably to all neighbors individually.  EIGRP sends a single
   multicast HELLO with an indication in the packet informing the
   receivers that the packet need not be acknowledged.  Other types of
   packets, such as UPDATE packets, require acknowledgment and this is
   indicated in the packet.  The reliable transport has a provision to
   send multicast packets quickly when there are unacknowledged packets
   pending.  This helps ensure that convergence time remains low in the
   presence of varying speed links.

   DUAL assumes there is lossless communication between devices and thus
   must depend on the transport protocol to guarantee that messages are
   transmitted reliably.  EIGRP implements the reliable transport
   protocol to ensure ordered delivery and acknowledgment of any
   messages requiring reliable transmission.  State variables such as a
   received sequence number, acknowledgment number, and transmission
   queues MUST be maintained on a per-neighbor basis.

   The following sequence number rules must be met for the EIGRP
   reliable transport protocol to work correctly:

      o  A sender of a packet includes its global sequence number in the
         sequence number field of the fixed header.  The sequence number
         wraps around to one when the maximum value is exceeded
         (sequence number zero is reserved for unreliable transmission).
         The sender includes the receivers sequence number in the
         acknowledgment number field of the fixed header.

      o  Any packets that do not require acknowledgment must be sent
         with a sequence number of 0.

      o  Any packet that has an acknowledgment number of 0 indicates
         that sender is not expecting to explicitly acknowledge
         delivery.  Otherwise, it is acknowledging a single packet.

      o  Packets that are network-layer multicast must contain
         acknowledgment number of 0.

   When a router transmits a packet, it increments its sequence number
   and marks the packet as requiring acknowledgment by all neighbors on
   the interface for which the packet is sent.  When individual
   acknowledgments are unicast addressed by the receivers to the sender
   with the acknowledgment number equal to the packets sequence number,
   the sender SHALL clear the pending acknowledgment requirement for the
   packet from the respective neighbor.

   If the required acknowledgment is not received for the packet, it
   MUST be retransmitted.  Retransmissions will occur for a maximum of 5
   seconds.  This retransmission for each packet is tried 16 times,
   after which, if there is no ACK, the neighbor relationship is reset
   with the peer that didn't send the ACK.

   The protocol has no explicit windowing support.  A receiver will
   acknowledge each packet individually and will drop packets that are
   received out of order.

   Implementation note: The exception to this occurs if a duplicate
   packet is received, and the acknowledgment for the original packet
   has been scheduled for transmission, but not yet sent.  In this case,
   EIGRP will not send an acknowledgment for the duplicate packet, and
   the queued acknowledgment will acknowledge both the original and
   duplicate packet.

   Duplicate packets are also discarded upon receipt.  Acknowledgments
   are not accumulative.  Therefore, an ACK with a non-zero sequence
   number acknowledges a single packet.

   There are situations when multicast and unicast packets are
   transmitted close together on multi-access broadcast-capable
   networks.  The reliable transport mechanism MUST ensure that all
   multicasts are transmitted in order and not mix the order among
   unicast and multicast packets.  The reliable transport provides a
   mechanism to deliver multicast packets in order to some receivers
   quickly, while some receivers have not yet received all unicast or
   previously sent multicast packets.  The SEQUENCE_TYPE TLV in HELLO
   packets achieves this.  This will be explained in more detail in this
   section.

   Figure 5 illustrates the reliable transport protocol on point-to-
   point links.  There are two scenarios that may occur: an UPDATE-
   initiated packet exchange or a QUERY-initiated packet exchange.

   This example will assume no packet loss.

   The UPDATE exchange sequence requires UPDATE packets sent to be
   delivered reliably.  The UPDATE packet transmitted contains a
   sequence number that is acknowledged by a receipt of an ACK packet.
   If the UPDATE or the ACK packet is lost on the network, the UPDATE
   packet will be retransmitted.

   This example will assume there is heavy packet loss on a network.

          Figure 6: Reliable Transfer on Lossy Point-to-Point Links

   Reliable delivery on multi-access LANs works in a similar fashion to
   point-to-point links.  The initial packet is always multicast and
   subsequent retransmissions are unicast addressed.  The
   acknowledgments sent are always unicast addressed.  Figure 7 shows an
   example with four routers on an Ethernet.

         Figure 8: Reliable Transfer on Multi-Access Links
                      with Conditional Receive

   Initially, Router A sends a multicast addressed UPDATE packet on the
   LAN.  B and C receive it and send acknowledgments.  Router B receives
   the UPDATE, but the acknowledgment sent is lost on the network.
   Before the retransmission timer for Router B's packet expires, there
   is an event that causes a new multicast addressed UPDATE to be sent.

   Router A detects that there is at least one neighbor on the interface
   with a full queue.  Therefore, it MUST signal that neighbor not to
   receive the next packet or it would receive the retransmitted packet
   out of order.  If all neighbors on the interface have a full queue,
   then EIGRP should reschedule the transmission of the UPDATE once the
   queues are no longer full.

   Router A builds a HELLO packet with a SEQUENCE_TYPE TLV indicating
   all the neighbors that have full queues.  In this case, the only
   neighbor address in the list is Router B.  The HELLO packet is sent
   via multicast unreliably out the interface.

   Routers C and D process the SEQUENCE_TYPE TLV by looking for their
   own addresses in the list.  If not found, they put themselves in CR-
   Mode.

   Router B does not find its address in the SEQUENCE TLV peer list, so
   it enters CR-Mode.  Packets received by Router B with the CR-Flag
   MUST be discarded and not acknowledged.

   Later, Router A will unicast transmit both packets 100 and 101
   directly to Router B.  Router B already has 100, so it discards and
   acknowledges it.

   Router B then accepts and acknowledges packet 101.  Once an
   acknowledgment is received, Router A can remove both packets from
   Router B's transmission list.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.1.%20%20Bandwidth%20on%20Low-Speed%20Links"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.1" name="section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  Bandwidth on Low-Speed Links</span>

   By default, EIGRP limits itself to using no more than 50% of the
   bandwidth reported by an interface when determining packet-pacing
   intervals.  If the bandwidth does not match the physical bandwidth
   (the network architect may have put in an artificially low or high
   bandwidth value to influence routing decisions), EIGRP may:

      1. Generate more traffic than the interface can handle, possibly
         causing drops, thereby impairing EIGRP performance.

      2. Generate a lot of EIGRP traffic that could result in little
         bandwidth remaining for user data.  To control such
         transmissions, an interface-pacing timer is defined for the
         interfaces on which EIGRP is enabled.  When a pacing timer
         expires, a packet is transmitted out on that interface.

   Neighbor Discovery/Recovery is the process that routers use to
   dynamically learn of other routers on their directly attached
   networks.  Routers MUST also discover when their neighbors become
   unreachable or inoperative.  This process is achieved with low
   overhead by periodically sending small HELLO packets.  As long as any
   packets are received from a neighbor, the router can determine that
   neighbor is alive and functioning.  Only after a neighbor router is
   considered operational can the neighboring routers exchange routing
   information.

   Each router keeps state information about adjacent neighbors.  When
   newly discovered neighbors are learned the address, interface, and
   Hold Time of the neighbor is noted.  When a neighbor sends a HELLO,
   it advertises its Hold Time.  The Hold Time is the amount of time a
   router treats a neighbor as reachable and operational.  In addition
   to the HELLO packet, if any packet is received within the Hold Time
   period, then the Hold Time period will be reset.  When the Hold Time
   expires, DUAL is informed of the topology change.

   When an EIGRP router is initialized, it will start sending HELLO
   packets out any interface on which EIGRP is enabled.  HELLO packets,
   when used for neighbor discovery, are normally sent multicast
   addressed.  The HELLO packet will include the configured EIGRP metric
   K-values.  Two routers become neighbors only if the K-values are the
   same.  This enforces that the metric usage is consistent throughout
   the Internet.  Also included in the HELLO packet is a Hold Time
   value.  This value indicates to all receivers the length of time in
   seconds that the neighbor is valid.  The default Hold Time will be
   three times the HELLO interval.  HELLO packets will be transmitted
   every 5 seconds (by default).  There may be a configuration command
   that controls this value and therefore changes the Hold Time.  HELLO
   packets are not transmitted reliably, so the sequence number should
   be set to 0.

   A router detects a new neighbor by receiving a HELLO packet from a
   neighbor not presently known.  To ensure unicast and multicast packet
   delivery, the detecting neighbor will send a unicast UPDATE packet to
   the new neighbor with no routing information (the NULL UPDATE
   packet).  The initial NULL UPDATE packet sent MUST have the INIT-Flag
   set and contain no topology information.

   Implementation note: The NULL UPDATE packet is used to ensure
   bidirectional UNICAST packet delivery as the NULL UPDATE and the ACK
   are both sent unicast.  Additional UPDATE packets cannot be sent
   until the initial NULL UPDATE packet is acknowledged.

   The INIT-Flag instructs the neighbor to advertise its routes, and it
   is also useful when a neighbor goes down and comes back up before the
   router detects it went down.  In this case, the neighbor needs new
   routing information.  The INIT-Flag informs the router to send it.

   Implementation note: When a router sends an UPDATE with the INIT-Flag
   set, and without the Restart (RS) flag set in the header, the
   receiving neighbor must also send an UPDATE with the INIT-Flag.
   Failure to do so will result in a Cisco device posting a "stuck in
   INIT state" error and subsequent discards.

   (1) Router A sends a multicast HELLO and Router B discovers it.

   (2) Router B sends an expedited HELLO and starts the process of
       sending its topology table to Router A.  In addition, Router B
       sends the NULL UPDATE packet with the INIT-Flag.  The second
       packet is queued, but it cannot be sent until the first is
       acknowledged.

   (3) Router A receives the first UPDATE packet and processes it as a

       packet will be processed and stored in a topology table.  Router
       B sends its first and only UPDATE packet with an accompanied ACK.

   (4) Router B receives UPDATE packet 100 from Router A.  Router B can

   To prevent packets from being sent to a neighbor prior to verifying
   multicast and unicast packet delivery is reliable, a three-way
   handshake is utilized.

   During normal adjacency formation, multicast HELLOs cause the EIGRP
   process to place new neighbors into the neighbor table.  Unicast
   packets are then used to exchange known routing information and
   complete the neighbor relationship (<a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>).

   To prevent EIGRP from sending sequenced packets to neighbors that
   fail to have bidirectional unicast/multicast, or one neighbor
   restarts while building the relationship, EIGRP MUST place the newly
   discovered neighbor in a "pending" state as follows:

      when Router A receives the first multicast HELLO from Router B, it
      places Router B in the pending state and transmits a unicast
      UPDATE containing no topology information and SHALL set the
      initialization bit.  While Router B is in this state, A will send
      it neither a QUERY nor an UPDATE.  When Router A receives the
      unicast acknowledgment from Router B, it will change the state
      from "pending" to "up".

   As described above, during the initial formation of the neighbor
   relationship, EIGRP uses a form of three-way handshake to verify both
   unicast and multicast connectivity are working successfully.  During
   this period of neighbor creation, the new neighbor is considered to
   be in the pending state, and it is not eligible to be included in the
   convergence process.

   Because of this, any QUERY received by an EIGRP router would not
   cause a QUERY to be sent to the new (and pending) neighbor.  It would
   perform the DUAL process without the new peer in the conversation.
   To do this, when a router in the process of establishing a new
   neighbor receives a QUERY from a fully established neighbor, it
   performs the normal DUAL Feasible Successor check to determine
   whether it needs to REPLY with a valid path or whether it needs to
   enter the ACTIVE process on the prefix.

   If it determines that it must go active, each fully established
   neighbor that participates in the convergence process will be sent a
   QUERY packet, and REPLY packets are expected from each.  Any pending
   neighbor will not be expected to REPLY and will not be sent a QUERY
   directly.  If it resides on an interface containing a mix of fully
   established neighbors and pending neighbors, it might receive the
   QUERY, but it will not be expected to REPLY to it.

   The topology table is populated by the Protocol-Dependent Modules
   (PDMs) (IPv4/IPv6), and it is acted upon by the DUAL finite state
   machine.  Associated with each entry are the destination address, a
   list of neighbors that have advertised this destination, and the
   metric associated with the destination.  The metric is referred to as
   the "CD".

   The CD is the best-advertised RD from all neighbors, plus the link
   cost between the receiving router and the neighbor.

   The "RD" is the CD as advertised by the Feasible Successor for the
   destination.  In other words, the Computed Distance, when sent by a
   neighbor, is referred to as the "Reported Distance" and is the metric
   that the neighboring router uses to reach the destination (its CD as
   described above).

   If the router is advertising a destination route, it MUST be using
   the route to forward packets; this is an important rule that distance
   vector protocols MUST follow.

   Within the topology table, EIGRP has the notion of internal and
   external routes.  Internal routes MUST be preferred over external
   routes, independent of the metric.  In practical terms, if an
   internal route is received, the diffusing computation will be run
   considering only the internal routes.  Only when no internal routes
   for a given destination exist will EIGRP choose the successor from
   the available external routes.

   Internal routes are destinations that have been originated within the
   same EIGRP AS.  Therefore, a directly attached network that is
   configured to run EIGRP is considered an internal route and is
   propagated with this information throughout the network topology.

   Internal routes are tagged with the following information:

      o Router ID of the EIGRP router that originated the route.
      o Configurable administrator tag.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.1.2.%20%20External%20Routes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4.1.2" name="section-5.4.1.2">5.4.1.2</a>.  External Routes</span>

   External routes are destinations that have been learned from another
   source, such as a different routing protocol or static route.  These
   routes are marked individually with the identity of their
   origination.  External routes are tagged with the following
   information:

      o Router ID of the EIGRP router that redistributed the route.
      o AS number where the destination resides.
      o Configurable administrator tag.
      o Protocol ID of the external protocol.
      o Metric from the external protocol.
      o Bit flags for default routing.

   As an example, suppose there is an AS with three border routers: BR1,
   BR2, and BR3.  A border router is one that runs more than one routing
   protocol.  The AS uses EIGRP as the routing protocol.  Two of the
   border routers, BR1 and BR2, also use Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
   [<a href="#ref-10" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>10</a>] and the other, BR3, also uses the Routing Information Protocol
   (RIP).

   Routes learned by one of the OSPF border routers, BR1, can be
   conditionally redistributed into EIGRP.  This means that EIGRP
   running in BR1 advertises the OSPF routes within its own AS.  When it
   does so, it advertises the route and tags it as an OSPF-learned route
   with a metric equal to the routing table metric of the OSPF route.
   The router-id is set to BR1.  The EIGRP route propagates to the other
   border routers.

   Let's say that BR3, the RIP border router, also advertises the same
   destinations as BR1.  Therefore, BR3, redistributes the RIP routes
   into the EIGRP AS.  BR2, then, has enough information to determine
   the AS entry point for the route, the original routing protocol used,
   and the metric.

   Further, the network administrator could assign tag values to
   specific destinations when redistributing the route.  BR2 can utilize
   any of this information to use the route or re-advertise it back out
   into OSPF.

   Using EIGRP route tagging can give a network administrator flexible
   policy controls and help customize routing.  Route tagging is
   particularly useful in transit ASes where EIGRP would typically
   interact with an inter-domain routing protocol that implements global
   policies.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.2.%20%20Split%20Horizon%20and%20Poison%20Reverse"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4.2" name="section-5.4.2">5.4.2</a>.  Split Horizon and Poison Reverse</span>

   In some circumstances, EIGRP will suppress or poison QUERY and UPDATE
   information to prevent routing loops as changes propagate though the
   network.

   Within Cisco, the split horizon rule suggests: "Never advertise a
   route out of the interface through which it was learned".  EIGRP
   implements this to mean, "if you have a successor route to a
   destination, never advertise the route out the interface on which it
   was learned".

   The poison reverse rule states: "A route learned through an interface
   will be advertised as unreachable through that same interface".  As
   with the case of split horizon, EIGRP applies this rule only to
   interfaces it is using for reaching the destination.  Routes learned
   though interfaces that EIGRP is NOT using to reach the destination
   may have the route advertised out those interfaces.

   In EIGRP, split horizon suppresses a QUERY, where as poison reverse
   advertises a destination as unreachable.  This can occur for a
   destination under any of the following conditions:

      o two routers are in startup or restart mode
      o advertising a topology table change
      o sending a query

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.2.1.%20%20Startup%20Mode"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4.2.1" name="section-5.4.2.1">5.4.2.1</a>.  Startup Mode</span>

   When two routers first become neighbors, they exchange topology
   tables during startup mode.  For each destination a router receives
   during startup mode, it advertises the same destination back to its
   new neighbor with a maximum metric (Poison Route).

   If a router uses a neighbor as the successor for a given destination,
   it will send an UPDATE for the destination with a metric of infinity.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.2.3.%20%20Sending%20a%20QUERY%2FUPDATE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4.2.3" name="section-5.4.2.3">5.4.2.3</a>.  Sending a QUERY/UPDATE</span>

   In most cases, EIGRP follows normal split-horizon rules.  When a
   metric change is received from the successor via QUERY or UPDATE that
   causes the route to go ACTIVE, the router will send a QUERY to
   neighbors on all interfaces except the interface toward the
   successor.

   In other words, the router does not send the QUERY out of the inbound
   interface through which the information causing the route to go
   ACTIVE was received.

   An exception to this can occur if a router receives a QUERY from its
   successor while already reacting to an event that did not cause it to
   go ACTIVE, for example, a metric change from the successor that did
   not cause an ACTIVE transition, but was followed by the UPDATE/QUERY
   that does result the router to transition to ACTIVE.

   EIGRP allows for modification of the default composite metric
   calculation (see <a href="#section-5.6">Section 5.6</a>) through the use of coefficients (K-
   values).  This adjustment allows for per-deployment tuning of network
   behavior.  Setting K-values up to 254 scales the impact of the scalar
   metric on the final composite metric.

   EIGRP default coefficients have been carefully selected to provide
   optimal performance in most networks.  The default K-values are as
   follows:

               K1 == K3 == 1
               K2 == K4 == K5 == 0
               K6 == 0

   If K5 is equal to 0, then reliability quotient is defined to be 1.

   K1 is used to allow path selection to be based on the bandwidth
   available along the path.  EIGRP can use one of two variations of
   Throughput-based path selection.

   o  Maximum Theoretical Bandwidth: paths chosen based on the highest
      reported bandwidth

   o  Network Throughput: paths chosen based on the highest "available"
      bandwidth adjusted by congestion-based effects (interface reported
      load)

   By default, EIGRP computes the Throughput using the maximum
   theoretical Throughput expressed in picoseconds per kilobyte of data
   sent.  This inversion results in a larger number (more time)
   ultimately generating a worse metric.

   If K2 is used, the effect of congestion as a measure of load reported

   by adjusting the maximum Throughput.

   K3 is used to allow delay or latency-based path selection.  Latency
   and delay are similar terms that refer to the amount of time it takes
   a bit to be transmitted to an adjacent neighbor.  EIGRP uses one-way-
   based values either provided by the interface or computed as a factor
   of the link s bandwidth.

   K4 and K5 are used to allow for path selection based on link quality
   and packet loss.  Packet loss caused by network problems results in
   highly noticeable performance issues or Jitter with streaming
   technologies, voice over IP, online gaming and videoconferencing, and
   will affect all other network applications to one degree or another.

   Critical services should pass with less than 1% packet loss.  Lower
   priority packet types might pass with less than 5% and then 10% for
   the lowest of priority of services.  The final metric can be weighted
   based on the reported link quality.

   The handling of K5 is conditional.  If K5 is equal to 0, then
   reliability quotient is defined to be 1.

   K6 has been introduced with Wide Metric support and is used to allow
   for Extended Attributes, which can be used to reflect in a higher
   aggregate metric than those having lower energy usage.  Currently
   there are two Extended Attributes, Jitter and energy, defined in the
   scope of this document.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.5.4.1.%20%20Jitter"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.5.4.1" name="section-5.5.4.1">5.5.4.1</a>.  Jitter</span>

   Use of Jitter-based Path Selection results in a path calculation with
   the lowest reported Jitter.  Jitter is reported as the interval
   between the longest and shortest packet delivery and is expressed in
   microseconds.  Higher values result in a higher aggregate metric when
   compared to those having lower Jitter calculations.

   Jitter is measured in microseconds and is accumulated along the path,
   with each hop using an averaged 3-second period to smooth out the
   metric change rate.

   Presently, EIGRP does not have the ability to measure Jitter, and, as
   such, the default value will be zero (0).  Performance-based
   solutions such as PfR could be used to populate this field.

   Use of Energy-based Path Selection results in paths with the lowest

   The amount of energy used is accumulative and has results in a higher
   aggregate metric than those having lower energy.

   The composite metric is based on bandwidth, delay, load, and
   reliability.  MTU is not an attribute for calculating the composite
   metric, but carried in the vector metrics.

   One of the original goals of EIGRP was to offer and enhance routing
   solutions for IGRP.  To achieve this, EIGRP used the same composite
   metric as IGRP, with the terms multiplied by 256 to change the metric
   from 24 bits to 32 bits.

   EIGRP calculates the composite metric with the following formula:

   metric = 256 * ({(K1*BW) + [(K2*BW)/(256-LOAD)] + (K3*DELAY)} *
            (K5/(REL+K4)))

   In this formula, Bandwidth (BW) is the lowest interface bandwidth
   along the path, and delay (DELAY) is the sum of all outbound
   interface delays along the path.  Load (LOAD) and reliability (REL)
   values are expressed percentages with a value of 1 to 255.

   Implementation note: Cisco IOS routers display reliability as a
   fraction of 255.  That is, 255/255 is 100% reliability or a perfectly
   stable link; a value of 229/255 represents a 90% reliable link.  Load
   is a value between 1 and 255.  A load of 255/255 indicates a
   completely saturated link.  A load of 127/255 represents a 50%
   saturated link.  These values are not dynamically measured; they are
   only measured at the time a link changes.

   Bandwidth is the inverse minimum bandwidth (in kbps) of the path in
   bits per second scaled by a factor of 10^7.  The formula for
   bandwidth is as follows:

                     (10^7)/BWmin

   Implementation note: When converting the real bandwidth to the
   composite bandwidth, truncate before applying the scaling factor.
   When converting the composite bandwidth to the real bandwidth, apply
   the scaling factor before the division and only then truncate.

   The delay is the sum of the outgoing interface delay (in tens of
   microseconds) to the destination.  A delay set to it maximum value
   (hexadecimal 0xFFFFFFFF) indicates that the network is unreachable.
   The formula for delay is as follows:

                     [sum of delays]

   The default composite metric, adjusted for scaling factors, for EIGRP
   is:

             metric = 256 * { [(10^7)/ BWmin] + [sum of delays]}

   Minimum Bandwidth (BWmin) is represented in kbps, and the "sum of
   delays" is represented in tens of microseconds.  The bandwidth and
   delay for an Ethernet interface are 10 Mbps and 1 ms, respectively.

   The calculated EIGRP bandwidth (BW) metric is then:

               256 * (10^7)/BW = 256 * {(10^7)/10,000}
                               = 256 * 1000
                               = 256,000

   And the calculated EIGRP delay metric is then:

            256 * sum of delay = 256 * 100 * 10 microseconds
                               = 25,600 (in tens of microseconds)

   To enable EIGRP to perform the path selection for interfaces with
   high bandwidths, both the EIGRP packet and composite metric formula
   have been modified.  This change allows EIGRP to choose paths based
   on the computed time (measured in picoseconds) information takes to
   travel though the links.

   EIGRP uses five "vector metrics": minimum Throughput, latency, load,
   reliability, and MTU.  These values are calculated from destination
   to source as follows:

              o Throughput    - Minimum value
              o Latency       - accumulative
              o Load          - maximum
              o Reliability   - minimum
              o MTU           - minimum
              o Hop count     - accumulative

   There are two additional values: Jitter and energy.  These two values
   are accumulated from destination to source:

           o Jitter - accumulative
           o Energy - accumulative

   These Extended Attributes, as well as any future ones, will be
   controlled via K6.  If K6 is non-zero, these will be additive to the
   path's composite metric.  Higher Jitter or energy usage will result
   in paths that are worse than those that either do not monitor these
   attributes or that have lower values.

   EIGRP will not send these attributes if the router does not provide
   them.  If the attributes are received, then EIGRP will use them in
   the metric calculation (based on K6) and will forward them with those
   routers values assumed to be "zero" and the accumulative values are
   forwarded unchanged.

   The use of the vector metrics allows EIGRP to compute paths based on
   any of four (bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load) path selection
   schemes.  The schemes are distinguished based on the choice of the
   key-measured network performance metric.

   Of these vector metric components, by default, only minimum
   Throughput and latency are traditionally used to compute the best
   path.  Unlike most metrics, minimum Throughput is set to the minimum
   value of the entire path, and it does not reflect how many hops or
   low Throughput links are in the path, nor does it reflect the
   availability of parallel links.  Latency is calculated based on one-
   way delays and is a cumulative value, which increases with each
   segment in the path.

   Network Designer note: When trying to manually influence EIGRP path
   selection though interface bandwidth/delay configuration, the
   modification of bandwidth is discouraged for following reasons:



<span class="grey">Savage, et al.                Informational                    [Page 44]</span></pre>

   The change will only affect the path selection if the configured
   value is the lowest bandwidth over the entire path.  Changing the
   bandwidth can have impact beyond affecting the EIGRP metrics.  For
   example, Quality of Service (QoS) also looks at the bandwidth on an
   interface.

   EIGRP throttles its packet transmissions so it will only use 50% of
   the configured bandwidth.  Lowering the bandwidth can cause EIGRP to
   starve an adjacency, causing slow or failed convergence and control-
   plane operation.

   Changing the delay does not impact other protocols, nor does it cause
   EIGRP to throttle back; changing the delay configured on a link only
   impacts metric calculation.

   EIGRP uses a number of defined constants for conversion and
   calculation of metric values.  These numbers are provided here for
   reference

           EIGRP_BANDWIDTH                    10,000,000
           EIGRP_DELAY_PICO                    1,000,000
           EIGRP_INACCESSIBLE       0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLL
           EIGRP_MAX_HOPS                            100
           EIGRP_CLASSIC_SCALE                       256
           EIGRP_WIDE_SCALE                        65536

   When computing the metric using the above units, all capacity
   information will be normalized to kilobytes and picoseconds before
   being used.  For example, delay is expressed in microseconds per
   kilobyte, and would be converted to kilobytes per second; likewise,
   energy would be expressed in power per kilobytes per second of usage.

   The formula for the conversion for Max-Throughput value directly from
   the interface without consideration of congestion-based effects is as
   follows:

                                  (EIGRP_BANDWIDTH * EIGRP_WIDE_SCALE)
        Max-Throughput = K1 *     ------------------------------------
                                       Interface Bandwidth (kbps)

   If K2 is used, the effect of congestion as a measure of load reported
   by the interface will be used to simulate the "available Throughput"
   by adjusting the maximum Throughput according to the formula:

                                           K2 * Max-Throughput
        Net-Throughput = Max-Throughput + ---------------------
                                              256 - Load

   K2 has the greatest effect on the metric occurs when the load
   increases beyond 90%.

   Transmission times derived from physical interfaces MUST be n units
   of picoseconds, converted to picoseconds prior to being exchanged
   between neighbors, or used in the composite metric determination.

   This includes delay values present in configuration-based commands
   (i.e., interface delay, redistribute, default-metric, route-map,
   etc.).

   The delay value is then converted to a "latency" using the formula:

                          Delay * EIGRP_WIDE_SCALE
        Latency = K3 *   --------------------------

   By default, the path selection scheme used by EIGRP is a combination
   of Throughput and Latency where the selection is a product of total
   latency and minimum Throughput of all links along the path:

      metric = (K1 * min(Throughput)) + (K3 * sum(Latency)) }

   address [<a href="#ref-14" title='"IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry"'>14</a>].  Unicast packets directed to a specific neighbor will
   contain the destination link-local address of the neighbor.

   There is no requirement that two EIGRP IPv6 neighbors share a common
   prefix on their connecting interface.  EIGRP IPv6 will check that a
   received HELLO contains a valid IPv6 link-local source address.
   Other HELLO processing will follow common EIGRP checks, including
   matching AS number and matching K-values.

   Header Version: EIGRP Packet Header Format version.  Current Version
      is 2.  This field is not the same as the TLV Version field.

   Opcode: Indicates the type of the message.  It will be one of the
      following values:

           EIGRP_OPC_UPDATE              1
           EIGRP_OPC_REQUEST             2

   Checksum: Each packet will include a checksum for the entire contents
      of the packet.  The checksum will be the standard ones' complement
      of the ones' complement sum.  For purposes of computing the
      checksum, the value of the checksum field is zero.  The packet is
      discarded if the packet checksum fails.

   Flags: Defines special handling of the packet.  There are currently
      four defined flag bits.

   INIT-Flag (0x01): This bit is set in the initial UPDATE sent to a
      newly discovered neighbor.  It instructs the neighbor to advertise
      its full set of routes.

   CR-Flag (0x02): This bit indicates that receivers should only accept
      the packet if they are in Conditionally Received mode.  A router
      enters Conditionally Received mode when it receives and processes
      a HELLO packet with a SEQUENCE TLV present.

   RS-Flag (0x04): The Restart flag is set in the HELLO and the UPDATE
      packets during the restart period.  The router looks at the RS-
      Flag to detect if a neighbor is restarting.  From the restarting
      routers perspective, if a neighboring router detects the RS-Flag
      set, it will maintain the adjacency, and will set the RS-Flag in
      its UPDATE packet to indicated it is doing a soft restart.

   EOT-Flag (0x08): The End-of-Table flag marks the end of the startup
      process with a neighbor.  If the flag is set, it indicates the
      neighbor has completed sending all UPDATEs.  At this point, the
      router will remove any stale routes learned from the neighbor
      prior to the restart event.  A stale route is any route that
      existed before the restart and was not refreshed by the neighbor
      via and UPDATE.

   Sequence Number: Each packet that is transmitted will have a 32-bit
      sequence number that is unique with respect to a sending router.
      A value of 0 means that an acknowledgment is not required.

   Acknowledgment Number: The 32-bit sequence number that is being
      acknowledged with respect to the receiver of the packet.  If the
      value is 0, there is no acknowledgment present.  A non-zero value
      can only be present in unicast-addressed packets.  A HELLO packet
      with a non-zero ACK field should be decoded as an ACK packet
      rather than a HELLO packet.

   Virtual Router Identifier (VRID): A 16-bit number that identifies the
      virtual router with which this packet is associated.  Packets
      received with an unknown, or unsupported, value will be discarded.

   Autonomous System Number: 16-bit unsigned number of the sending
      system.  This field is indirectly used as an authentication value.
      That is, a router that receives and accepts a packet from a
      neighbor must have the same AS number or the packet is ignored.
      The range of valid AS numbers is 1 through 65,535.

   The contents of each packet can contain a variable number of fields.
   Each field will be tagged and include a length field.  This allows
   for newer versions of software to add capabilities and coexist with
   old versions of software in the same configuration.  Fields that are
   tagged and not recognized can be skipped over.  Another advantage of
   this encoding scheme is that it allows multiple network-layer
   protocols to carry independent information.  Therefore, if it is
   later decided to implement a single "integrated" protocol, this can
   be done.

   The format of a {type, length, value} (TLV) is encoded as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    Value (variable length)                    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The type values are the ones defined below.  The length value
   specifies the length in octets of the type, length, and value fields.
   TLVs can appear in a packet in any order, and there are no
   interdependencies among them.

   Malformed TLVs contained in EIGRP messages are handled by silently
   discarding the containing message.  A TLV is malformed if the TLV
   Length is invalid or if the TLV extends beyond the end of the
   containing message.

   Address Length: Number of octets for the address that follows.  For
      IPv4, the value is 4.  For IPv6, it is 16.  For AppleTalk, the
      value is 4; for Novell IPX, the value is 10 (both are no longer in
      use).

   Protocol Address: Neighbor address on interface in which the HELLO
      with SEQUENCE TLV is sent.  Each address listed in the HELLO
      packet is a neighbor that should not enter Conditionally Received
      mode.

   If this information changes from the last state, it means either a

   When the TID list is received, it compares the list to the previous
   list sent.  If a TID is found that does not previously exist, the TID
   is added to the neighbor's topology list, and the existing sub-
   topology is sent to the peer.

   If a TID that was in a previous list is not found, the TID is removed
   from the neighbor's topology list and all routes learned though that
   neighbor for that sub-topology are removed from the topology table.

   EIGRP transports a number of flags with in the TLVs to indicate
   addition route state information.  These bits are defined as follows:

   Flags Field
   -----------
   Source Withdraw (Bit 0) - Indicates if the router that is the
   original source of the destination is withdrawing the route from the
   network or if the destination is lost due as a result of a network
   failure.

   Candidate Default (CD) (Bit 1) - Set to indicate the destination
   should be regarded as a candidate for the default route.  An EIGRP
   default route is selected from all the advertised candidate default
   routes with the smallest metric.

   ACTIVE (Bit 2) - Indicates if the route is in the ACTIVE State.

   External Autonomous System (AS) Number: A 32-bit number indicating
      the external AS of which the sending router is a member.  If the
      source protocol is EIGRP, this field will be the [VRID, AS] pair.
      If the external protocol does not have an AS, other information
      can be used (for example, Cisco uses process-id for OSPF).

   Administrative Tag: A tag assigned by the network administrator that
      is untouched by EIGRP.  This allows a network administrator to
      filter routes in other EIGRP border routers based on this value.

   There has been a long-standing requirement for EIGRP to support
   routing technologies, such as multi-topologies, and to provide the
   ability to carry destination information independent of the
   transport.  To accomplish this, a Vector has been extended to have a
   new "Header Extension Header" section.  This is a variable-length
   field and, at a minimum, it will support the following fields:

   Multiprotocol TLVs will provide an extendable section of metric
   information, which is not used for the primary routing compilation.
   Additional per-path information is included to enable per-path cost
   calculations in the future.  Use of the per-path costing along with
   the VID/TID will prove a complete solution for multidimensional
   routing.

   Priority: Priority of the prefix when processing a route.  In an AS
      using priority values, a destination with a higher priority
      receives preferential treatment and is serviced before a
      destination with a lower priority.  A value of zero indicates no
      priority is set.

   Reliability: The current error rate for the path.  Measured as an
      error percentage.  A value of 255 indicates 100% reliability

   Load: The load utilization of the path to the destination, measured
      as a percentage.  A value of 255 indicates 100% load.

   MTU: The minimum MTU size for the path to the destination.  Not used
      in metric calculation but available to underlying protocols

   Hop Count: The number of router traversals to the destination.

   Delay: The one-way latency along an unloaded path to the destination
      expressed in units of picoseconds per kilobit.  This number is not
      scaled; a value of 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF indicates an unreachable route.

   Bandwidth: The path bandwidth measured in kilobit per second as
      presented by the interface.  This number is not scaled; a value of
      0xFFFFFFFFFFFF indicates an unreachable route.

   Reserved: Transmitted as 0x0000.

   Opaque Flags: 16-bit protocol-specific flags.  Values currently
      defined by Cisco are:

          OPAQUE_SRCWD    0x01   Route Source Withdraw
          OPAQUE_CD       0x02   Candidate default route
          OPAQUE_ACTIVE   0x04   Route is currently in active state
          OPAQUE_REPL     0x08   Route is replicated from another VRF

   (Optional) EIGRP can carry energy usage by nodes in networks if the
   node is capable of measuring energy.  The active Energy reported will
   be added to any existing energy data and include in the route
   updates.  If no energy data is reported by the peer for a given
   destination, EIGRP will use the locally collected value.

   counter to indicate how many significant bits are present in the
   variable-length address field.

   Subnet Mask Bit Count: 8-bit value used to indicate the number of
      bits in the subnet mask.  A value of 0 indicates the default
      network and no address is present.

   Destination Address: A variable-length field used to carry the
      destination address.  The length is determined by the number of
      consecutive bits in the destination address.  The formula to
      calculate the length is address-family dependent:

      IPv4: ((Bit Count - 1) / 8) + 1
      IPv6: (Bit Count == 128) ? 16 : ((x / 8) + 1)

   This TLV conveys destination information based on the IANA AFI

   for routes learned by other routing protocols that EIGRP injects into
   the AS.  Available with this information is the identity of the
   routing protocol that created the route, the external metric, the AS
   number, an indicator if it should be marked as part of the EIGRP AS,
   and a network administrator tag used for route filtering at EIGRP AS
   boundaries.

   Being promiscuous, EIGRP will neighbor with any router that sends a
   valid HELLO packet.  Due to security considerations, this
   "completely" open aspect requires policy capabilities to limit
   peering to valid routers.

   EIGRP does not rely on a PKI or a heavyweight authentication system.
   These systems challenge the scalability of EIGRP, which was a primary
   design goal.

   Instead, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack prevention will depend on
   implementations rate-limiting packets to the control plane as well as
   authentication of the neighbor through the use of MD5 or SHA2-256

Acknowledgments

   Thank you goes to Dino Farinacci, Bob Albrightson, and Dave Katz.
   Their significant accomplishments towards the design and development
   of the EIGRP provided the bases for this document.

   A special and appreciative thank you goes to the core group of Cisco
   engineers whose dedication, long hours, and hard work led the
   evolution of EIGRP over the past decade.  They are Donnie Savage,
   Mickel Ravizza, Heidi Ou, Dawn Li, Thuan Tran, Catherine Tran, Don
   Slice, Claude Cartee, Donald Sharp, Steven Moore, Richard Wellum, Ray
   Romney, Jim Mollmann, Dennis Wind, Chris Van Heuveln, Gerald Redwine,
   Glen Matthews, Michael Wiebe, and others.

   The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge many people who have
   contributed to the discussions that lead to the making of this
   proposal.  They include Chris Le, Saul Adler, Scott Van de Houten,
   Lalit Kumar, Yi Yang, Kumar Reddy, David Lapier, Scott Kirby, David
   Prall, Jason Frazier, Eric Voit, Dana Blair, Jim Guichard, and Alvaro
