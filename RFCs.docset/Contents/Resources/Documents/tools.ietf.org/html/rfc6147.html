Abstract

   DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records.
   DNS64 is used with an IPv6/IPv4 translator to enable client-server
   communication between an IPv6-only client and an IPv4-only server,
   without requiring any changes to either the IPv6 or the IPv4 node,
   for the class of applications that work through NATs.  This document
   specifies DNS64, and provides suggestions on how it should be
   deployed in conjunction with IPv6/IPv4 translators.

   This document specifies DNS64, a mechanism that is part of the
   toolbox for IPv4-IPv6 transition and coexistence.  DNS64, used
   together with an IPv6/IPv4 translator such as stateful NAT64
   [<a href="rfc6146.html" title='"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers"'>RFC6146</a>], allows an IPv6-only client to initiate communications by
   name to an IPv4-only server.

   DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA resource records (RRs)
   from A RRs.  A synthetic AAAA RR created by the DNS64 from an
   original A RR contains the same owner name of the original A RR, but
   it contains an IPv6 address instead of an IPv4 address.  The IPv6
   address is an IPv6 representation of the IPv4 address contained in
   the original A RR.  The IPv6 representation of the IPv4 address is
   algorithmically generated from the IPv4 address returned in the A RR
   and a set of parameters configured in the DNS64 (typically, an IPv6
   prefix used by IPv6 representations of IPv4 addresses and,
   optionally, other parameters).

   Together with an IPv6/IPv4 translator, these two mechanisms allow an
   IPv6-only client to initiate communications to an IPv4-only server
   using the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the server.

   These mechanisms are expected to play a critical role in the IPv4-
   IPv6 transition and coexistence.  Due to IPv4 address depletion, it
   is likely that in the future, many IPv6-only clients will want to
   connect to IPv4-only servers.  In the typical case, the approach only
   requires the deployment of IPv6/IPv4 translators that connect an
   IPv6-only network to an IPv4-only network, along with the deployment
   of one or more DNS64-enabled name servers.  However, some features
   require performing the DNS64 function directly in the end hosts
   themselves.

   This document is structured as follows: <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> provides a
   non-normative overview of the behavior of DNS64.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> provides

   This section provides an introduction to the DNS64 mechanism.

   We assume that we have one or more IPv6/IPv4 translator boxes
   connecting an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network.  The IPv6/IPv4
   translator device provides translation services between the two
   networks, enabling communication between IPv4-only hosts and
   IPv6-only hosts.  (NOTE: By "IPv6-only hosts", we mean hosts running
   IPv6-only applications and hosts that can only use IPv6, as well as
   cases where only IPv6 connectivity is available to the client.  By
   "IPv4-only servers", we mean servers running IPv4-only applications
   and servers that can only use IPv4, as well as cases where only IPv4
   connectivity is available to the server).  Each IPv6/IPv4 translator
   used in conjunction with DNS64 must allow communications initiated
   from the IPv6-only host to the IPv4-only host.

   To allow an IPv6 initiator to do a standard AAAA RR DNS lookup to
   learn the address of the responder, DNS64 is used to synthesize a
   AAAA record from an A record containing a real IPv4 address of the
   responder, whenever the DNS64 cannot retrieve a AAAA record for the
   queried name.  The DNS64 service appears as a regular DNS server or
   resolver to the IPv6 initiator.  The DNS64 receives a AAAA DNS query
   generated by the IPv6 initiator.  It first attempts a resolution for
   the requested AAAA records.  If there are no AAAA records available
   for the target node (which is the normal case when the target node is
   an IPv4-only node), DNS64 performs a query for A records.  For each A
   record discovered, DNS64 creates a synthetic AAAA RR from the
   information retrieved in the A RR.

   The owner name of a synthetic AAAA RR is the same as that of the
   original A RR, but an IPv6 representation of the IPv4 address
   contained in the original A RR is included in the AAAA RR.  The IPv6
   representation of the IPv4 address is algorithmically generated from
   the IPv4 address and additional parameters configured in the DNS64.
   Among those parameters configured in the DNS64, there is at least one
   IPv6 prefix.  If not explicitly mentioned, all prefixes are treated
   equally, and the operations described in this document are performed
   using the prefixes available.  So as to be general, we will call any
   of these prefixes Pref64::/n, and describe the operations made with
   the generic prefix Pref64::/n.  The IPv6 addresses representing IPv4
   addresses included in the AAAA RR synthesized by the DNS64 contain
   Pref64::/n, and they also embed the original IPv4 address.

   The same algorithm and the same Pref64::/n prefix(es) must be
   configured both in the DNS64 device and the IPv6/IPv4 translator(s),
   so that both can algorithmically generate the same IPv6
   representation for a given IPv4 address.  In addition, it is required

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6147.html">RFC 6147</a>                          DNS64                       April 2011</span>


   that IPv6 packets addressed to an IPv6 destination address that
   contains the Pref64::/n be delivered to an IPv6/IPv4 translator that
   has that particular Pref64::/n configured, so they can be translated
   into IPv4 packets.

   Once the DNS64 has synthesized the AAAA RRs, the synthetic AAAA RRs
   are passed back to the IPv6 initiator, which will initiate an IPv6
   communication with the IPv6 address associated with the IPv4
   receiver.  The packet will be routed to an IPv6/IPv4 translator,
   which will forward it to the IPv4 network.

   In general, the only shared state between the DNS64 and the IPv6/IPv4
   translator is the Pref64::/n and an optional set of static
   parameters.  The Pref64::/n and the set of static parameters must be
   configured to be the same on both; there is no communication between
   the DNS64 device and IPv6/IPv4 translator functions.  The mechanism
   to be used for configuring the parameters of the DNS64 is beyond the
   scope of this memo.

   The prefixes to be used as Pref64::/n and their applicability are
   discussed in [<a href="rfc6052.html" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>].  There are two types of prefixes that can be
   used as Pref64::/n.

   o  The Pref64::/n can be the Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96 reserved
      by [<a href="rfc6052.html" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>] for the purpose of representing IPv4 addresses in
      IPv6 address space.

   o  The Pref64::/n can be a Network-Specific Prefix (NSP).  An NSP is
      an IPv6 prefix assigned by an organization to create IPv6
      representations of IPv4 addresses.

   The main difference in the nature of the two types of prefixes is
   that the NSP is a locally assigned prefix that is under control of
   the organization that is providing the translation services, while
   the Well-Known Prefix is a prefix that has a global meaning since it
   has been assigned for the specific purpose of representing IPv4
   addresses in IPv6 address space.

   The DNS64 function can be performed in any of three places.  The
   terms below are more formally defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   The first option is to locate the DNS64 function in authoritative
   servers for a zone.  In this case, the authoritative server provides
   synthetic AAAA RRs for an IPv4-only host in its zone.  This is one
   type of DNS64 server.






<span class="grey">Bagnulo, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 6]</span></pre>

   Another option is to locate the DNS64 function in recursive name
   servers serving end hosts.  In this case, when an IPv6-only host
   queries the name server for AAAA RRs for an IPv4-only host, the name
   server can perform the synthesis of AAAA RRs and pass them back to
   the IPv6-only initiator.  The main advantage of this mode is that
   current IPv6 nodes can use this mechanism without requiring any
   modification.  This mode is called "DNS64 in DNS recursive-resolver
   mode".  This is a second type of DNS64 server, and it is also one
   type of DNS64 resolver.

   The last option is to place the DNS64 function in the end hosts,
   coupled to the local (stub) resolver.  In this case, the stub
   resolver will try to obtain (real) AAAA RRs, and in case they are not
   available, the DNS64 function will synthesize AAAA RRs for internal
   usage.  This mode is compatible with some functions like DNSSEC
   validation in the end host.  The main drawback of this mode is its
   deployability, since it requires changes in the end hosts.  This mode
   is called "DNS64 in stub-resolver mode".  This is the second type of
   DNS64 resolver.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Background%20to%20DNS64-DNSSEC%20Interaction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Background to DNS64-DNSSEC Interaction</span>

   DNSSEC ([<a href="rfc4033.html" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>], [<a href="rfc4034.html" title='"Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4034</a>], [<a href="rfc4035.html" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>]) presents a special challenge
   for DNS64, because DNSSEC is designed to detect changes to DNS
   answers, and DNS64 may alter answers coming from an authoritative
   server.

   A recursive resolver can be security-aware or security-oblivious.
   Moreover, a security-aware recursive resolver can be validating or
   non-validating, according to operator policy.  In the cases below,
   the recursive resolver is also performing DNS64, and has a local
   policy to validate.  We call this general case vDNS64, but in all the
   cases below, the DNS64 functionality should be assumed to be needed.

   DNSSEC includes some signaling bits that offer some indicators of
   what the query originator understands.

   If a query arrives at a vDNS64 device with the "DNSSEC OK" (DO) bit
   set, the query originator is signaling that it understands DNSSEC.
   The DO bit does not indicate that the query originator will validate
   the response.  It only means that the query originator can understand
   responses containing DNSSEC data.  Conversely, if the DO bit is
   clear, that is evidence that the querying agent is not aware of
   DNSSEC.

   If a query arrives at a vDNS64 device with the "Checking Disabled"
   (CD) bit set, it is an indication that the querying agent wants all
   the validation data so it can do checking itself.  By local policy,
   vDNS64 could still validate, but it must return all data to the
   querying agent anyway.

   Here are the possible cases:

   1.  A DNS64 (DNSSEC-aware or DNSSEC-oblivious) receives a query with
       the DO bit clear.  In this case, DNSSEC is not a concern, because
       the querying agent does not understand DNSSEC responses.  The
       DNS64 can do validation of the response, if dictated by its local
       policy.

   2.  A security-oblivious DNS64 receives a query with the DO bit set,
       and the CD bit clear or set.  This is just like the case of a
       non-DNS64 case: the server doesn't support it, so the querying
       agent is out of luck.

   3.  A security-aware and non-validating DNS64 receives a query with
       the DO bit set and the CD bit clear.  Such a resolver is not
       validating responses, likely due to local policy (see <a href="rfc4035.html#section-4.2">[RFC4035],
       Section 4.2</a>).  For that reason, this case amounts to the same as
       the previous case, and no validation happens.

   4.  A security-aware and non-validating DNS64 receives a query with
       the DO bit set and the CD bit set.  In this case, the DNS64 is
       supposed to pass on all the data it gets to the query initiator
       (see <a href="rfc4035.html#section-3.2.2">Section 3.2.2 of [RFC4035]</a>).  This case will not work with
       DNS64, unless the validating resolver is prepared to do DNS64
       itself.  If the DNS64 modifies the record, the client will get
       the data back and try to validate it, and the data will be
       invalid as far as the client is concerned.

   5.  A security-aware and validating DNS64 resolver receives a query
       with the DO bit clear and the CD bit clear.  In this case, the
       resolver validates the data.  If it fails, it returns RCODE 2
       (Server failure); otherwise, it returns the answer.  This is the
       ideal case for vDNS64.  The resolver validates the data, and then
       synthesizes the new record and passes that to the client.  The
       client, which is presumably not validating (else it should have
       set DO and CD), cannot tell that DNS64 is involved.

   6.  A security-aware and validating DNS64 resolver receives a query
       with the DO bit set and the CD bit clear.  This works like the
       previous case, except that the resolver should also set the
       "Authentic Data" (AD) bit on the response.

   7.  A security-aware and validating DNS64 resolver receives a query
       with the DO bit set and the CD bit set.  This is effectively the
       same as the case where a security-aware and non-validating
       recursive resolver receives a similar query, and the same thing
       will happen: the downstream validator will mark the data as
       invalid if DNS64 has performed synthesis.  The node needs to do
       DNS64 itself, or else communication will fail.

   Authoritative server:  A DNS server that can answer authoritatively a
      given DNS request.

   DNS64:  A logical function that synthesizes DNS resource records
      (e.g., AAAA records containing IPv6 addresses) from DNS resource
      records actually contained in the DNS (e.g., A records containing
      IPv4 addresses).

   DNS64 recursive resolver:  A recursive resolver that provides the
      DNS64 functionality as part of its operation.  This is the same

   DNS64 resolver:  Any resolver (stub resolver or recursive resolver)
      that provides the DNS64 function.

   Recursive resolver:  A DNS server that accepts requests from one
      resolver, and asks another server (of some description) for the
      answer on behalf of the first resolver.  Full discussion of DNS
      recursion is beyond the scope of this document; see [<a href="rfc1034.html" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>RFC1034</a>] and
      [<a href="rfc1035.html" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>] for full details.

   Synthetic RR:  A DNS resource record (RR) that is not contained in
      the authoritative servers' zone data, but which is instead
      synthesized from other RRs in the same zone.  An example is a
      synthetic AAAA record created from an A record.

   IPv6/IPv4 translator:  A device that translates IPv6 packets to IPv4
      packets and vice versa.  It is only required that the
      communication initiated from the IPv6 side be supported.

   For a detailed understanding of this document, the reader should also
   be familiar with DNS terminology from [<a href="rfc1034.html" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>RFC1034</a>] and [<a href="rfc1035.html" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>] and
   with current NAT terminology from [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>].  Some parts of this
   document assume familiarity with the terminology of the DNS security
   extensions outlined in [<a href="rfc4035.html" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>].  It is worth emphasizing that while
   DNS64 is a logical function separate from the DNS, it is nevertheless
   closely associated with that protocol.  It depends on the DNS
   protocol, and some behavior of DNS64 will interact with regular DNS
   responses.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20DNS64%20Normative%20Specification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  DNS64 Normative Specification</span>

   DNS64 is a logical function that synthesizes AAAA records from A
   records.  The DNS64 function may be implemented in a stub resolver,
   in a recursive resolver, or in an authoritative name server.  It
   works within those DNS functions, and appears on the network as
   though it were a "plain" DNS resolver or name server conforming to
   [<a href="rfc1034.html" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>RFC1034</a>] and [<a href="rfc1035.html" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>].

   The implementation SHOULD support mapping of separate IPv4 address
   ranges to separate IPv6 prefixes for AAAA record synthesis.  This
   allows handling of special use IPv4 addresses [<a href="rfc5735.html" title='"Special Use IPv4 Addresses"'>RFC5735</a>].

   DNS messages contain several sections.  The portion of a DNS message
   that is altered by DNS64 is the answer section, which is discussed
   below in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>.  The resulting synthetic answer is put together
   with other sections, and that creates the message that is actually
   returned as the response to the DNS query.  Assembling that response
   is covered below in <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>.

   DNS64 also responds to PTR queries involving addresses containing any
   of the IPv6 prefixes it uses for synthesis of AAAA RRs.

   When the DNS64 receives a query for RRs of type AAAA and class IN, it
   first attempts to retrieve non-synthetic RRs of this type and class,
   either by performing a query or, in the case of an authoritative
   server, by examining its own results.  The query may be answered from
   a local cache, if one is available.  DNS64 operation for classes
   other than IN is undefined, and a DNS64 MUST behave as though no
   DNS64 function is configured.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.1.%20%20The%20Answer%20when%20There%20is%20AAAA%20Data%20Available"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.1" name="section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  The Answer when There is AAAA Data Available</span>

   If the query results in one or more AAAA records in the answer
   section, the result is returned to the requesting client as per
   normal DNS semantics, except in the case where any of the AAAA
   records match a special exclusion set of prefixes, as considered in
   <a href="#section-5.1.4">Section 5.1.4</a>.  If there is (non-excluded) AAAA data available, DNS64
   SHOULD NOT include synthetic AAAA RRs in the response (see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>
   for an analysis of the motivations for and the implications of not
   complying with this recommendation).  By default, DNS64
   implementations MUST NOT synthesize AAAA RRs when real AAAA RRs
   exist.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.2.%20%20The%20Answer%20when%20There%20is%20an%20Error"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.2" name="section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>.  The Answer when There is an Error</span>

   If the query results in a response with an RCODE other than 0 (No
   error condition), then there are two possibilities.  A result with
   RCODE=3 (Name Error) is handled according to normal DNS operation
   (which is normally to return the error to the client).  This stage is
   still prior to any synthesis having happened, so a response to be
   returned to the client does not need any special assembly other than
   what would usually happen in DNS operation.

   Any other RCODE is treated as though the RCODE were 0 (see
   Sections <a href="#section-5.1.6">5.1.6</a> and <a href="#section-5.1.7">5.1.7</a>) and the answer section were empty.  This is
   because of the large number of different responses from deployed name
   servers when they receive AAAA queries without a AAAA record being
   available (see [<a href="rfc4074.html" title='"Common Misbehavior Against DNS Queries for IPv6 Addresses"'>RFC4074</a>]).  Note that this means, for practical
   purposes, that several different classes of error in the DNS are all
   treated as though a AAAA record is not available for that owner name.

   It is important to note that, as of this writing, some servers
   respond with RCODE=3 to a AAAA query even if there is an A record
   available for that owner name.  Those servers are in clear violation
   of the meaning of RCODE 3, and it is expected that they will decline
   in use as IPv6 deployment increases.

   If the query receives no answer before the timeout (which might be
   the timeout from every authoritative server, depending on whether the
   DNS64 is in recursive-resolver mode), it is treated as RCODE=2
   (Server failure).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.4.%20%20Special%20Exclusion%20Set%20for%20AAAA%20Records"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.4" name="section-5.1.4">5.1.4</a>.  Special Exclusion Set for AAAA Records</span>

   Some IPv6 addresses are not actually usable by IPv6-only hosts.  If
   they are returned to IPv6-only querying agents as AAAA records,
   therefore, the goal of decreasing the number of failure modes will
   not be attained.  Examples include AAAA records with addresses in the
   ::ffff:0:0/96 network, and possibly (depending on the context) AAAA
   records with the site's Pref64::/n or the Well-Known Prefix (see
   below for more about the Well-Known Prefix).  A DNS64 implementation
   SHOULD provide a mechanism to specify IPv6 prefix ranges to be
   treated as though the AAAA containing them were an empty answer.  An
   implementation SHOULD include the ::ffff/96 network in that range by
   default.  Failure to provide this facility will mean that clients
   querying the DNS64 function may not be able to communicate with hosts
   that would be reachable from a dual-stack host.

   When the DNS64 performs its initial AAAA query, if it receives an
   answer with only AAAA records containing addresses in the excluded
   range(s), then it MUST treat the answer as though it were an empty
   answer, and proceed accordingly.  If it receives an answer with at
   least one AAAA record containing an address outside any of the
   excluded range(s), then it by default SHOULD build an answer section
   for a response including only the AAAA record(s) that do not contain
   any of the addresses inside the excluded ranges.  That answer section
   is used in the assembly of a response as detailed in <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>.
   Alternatively, it MAY treat the answer as though it were an empty
   answer, and proceed accordingly.  It MUST NOT return the offending
   AAAA records as part of a response.

   If the response contains a CNAME or a DNAME, then the CNAME or DNAME
   chain is followed until the first terminating A or AAAA record is
   reached.  This may require the DNS64 to ask for an A record, in case
   the response to the original AAAA query is a CNAME or DNAME without a
   AAAA record to follow.  The resulting AAAA or A record is treated
   like any other AAAA or A case, as appropriate.

   When assembling the answer section, any chains of CNAME or DNAME RRs
   are included as part of the answer along with the synthetic AAAA (if
   appropriate).

   If the query results in no error but an empty answer section in the
   response, the DNS64 attempts to retrieve A records for the name in
   question, either by performing another query or, in the case of an
   authoritative server, by examining its own results.  If this new A RR
   query results in an empty answer or in an error, then the empty
   result or error is used as the basis for the answer returned to the
   querying client.  If instead the query results in one or more A RRs,
   the DNS64 synthesizes AAAA RRs based on the A RRs according to the
   procedure outlined in <a href="#section-5.1.7">Section 5.1.7</a>.  The DNS64 returns the
   synthesized AAAA records in the answer section, removing the A
   records that form the basis of the synthesis.

   A synthetic AAAA record is created from an A record as follows:

   o  The NAME field is set to the NAME field from the A record.

   o  The TYPE field is set to 28 (AAAA).

   o  The CLASS field is set to the original CLASS field, 1.  Under this
      specification, DNS64 for any CLASS other than 1 is undefined.

   o  The Time to Live (TTL) field is set to the minimum of the TTL of
      the original A RR and the SOA RR for the queried domain.  (Note
      that in order to obtain the TTL of the SOA RR, the DNS64 does not
      need to perform a new query, but it can remember the TTL from the
      SOA RR in the negative response to the AAAA query.  If the SOA RR
      was not delivered with the negative response to the AAAA query,
      then the DNS64 SHOULD use the TTL of the original A RR or
      600 seconds, whichever is shorter.  It is possible instead to
      query explicitly for the SOA RR and use the result of that query,
      but this will increase query load and time to resolution for
      little additional benefit.)  This is in keeping with the approach
      used in negative caching [<a href="rfc2308.html" title='"Negative Caching of DNS Queries (DNS NCACHE)"'>RFC2308</a>].

   o  The RDLENGTH field is set to 16.

   o  The RDATA field is set to the IPv6 representation of the IPv4
      address from the RDATA field of the A record.  The DNS64 MUST
      check each A RR against configured IPv4 address ranges and select
      the corresponding IPv6 prefix to use in synthesizing the AAAA RR.
      See <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a> for discussion of the algorithms to be used in
      effecting the transformation.

   The DNS64 MAY perform the query for the AAAA RR and for the A RR in
   parallel, in order to minimize the delay.

      NOTE: Querying in parallel will result in performing unnecessary A
      RR queries in the case where no AAAA RR synthesis is required.  A
      possible trade-off would be to perform them sequentially but with
      a very short interval between them, so if we obtain a fast reply,
      we avoid doing the additional query.  (Note that this discussion
      is relevant only if the DNS64 function needs to perform external
      queries to fetch the RR.  If the needed RR information is
      available locally, as in the case of an authoritative server, the
      issue is no longer relevant.)

   DNS64 supports multiple algorithms for the generation of the IPv6
   representation of an IPv4 address.  The constraints imposed on the
   generation algorithms are the following:

   o  The same algorithm to create an IPv6 address from an IPv4 address
      MUST be used by both a DNS64 to create the IPv6 address to be
      returned in the synthetic AAAA RR from the IPv4 address contained
      in an original A RR, and by an IPv6/IPv4 translator to create the
      IPv6 address to be included in the source address field of the
      outgoing IPv6 packets from the IPv4 address included in the source
      address field of the incoming IPv4 packet.

   o  The algorithm MUST be reversible; i.e., it MUST be possible to
      derive the original IPv4 address from the IPv6 representation.

   o  The input for the algorithm MUST be limited to the IPv4 address;
      the IPv6 prefix (denoted Pref64::/n) used in the IPv6
      representations; and, optionally, a set of stable parameters that
      are configured in the DNS64 and in the NAT64 (such as a fixed
      string to be used as a suffix).

      *  For each prefix Pref64::/n, n MUST be less than or equal to 96.
         If one or more Pref64::/n are configured in the DNS64 through
         any means (such as manual configuration, or other automatic
         means not specified in this document), the default algorithm
         MUST use these prefixes (and not use the Well-Known Prefix).
         If no prefix is available, the algorithm MUST use the
         Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96 defined in [<a href="rfc6052.html" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>] to
         represent the IPv4 unicast address range.

   A DNS64 MUST support the algorithm for generating IPv6
   representations of IPv4 addresses defined in <a href="rfc6052.html#section-2">Section 2 of [RFC6052]</a>.
   Moreover, the aforementioned algorithm MUST be the default algorithm

   is provided in [<a href="rfc6052.html" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>], a sample description of the algorithm and

   If a DNS64 server receives a PTR query for a record in the IP6.ARPA
   domain, it MUST strip the IP6.ARPA labels from the QNAME, reverse the
   address portion of the QNAME according to the encoding scheme
   outlined in <a href="rfc3596.html#section-2.5">Section 2.5 of [RFC3596]</a>, and examine the resulting
   address to see whether its prefix matches any of the locally
   configured Pref64::/n or the default Well-Known Prefix.  There are
   two alternatives for a DNS64 server to respond to such PTR queries.
   A DNS64 server MUST provide one of these, and SHOULD NOT provide both
   at the same time unless different IP6.ARPA zones require answers of
   different sorts:

   1.  The first option is for the DNS64 server to respond
       authoritatively for its prefixes.  If the address prefix matches
       any Pref64::/n used in the site, either a NSP or the Well-Known
       Prefix (i.e., 64:ff9b::/96), then the DNS64 server MAY answer the
       query using locally appropriate RDATA.  The DNS64 server MAY use
       the same RDATA for all answers.  Note that the requirement is to
       match any Pref64::/n used at the site, and not merely the locally
       configured Pref64::/n.  This is because end clients could ask for
       a PTR record matching an address received through a different
       (site-provided) DNS64, and if this strategy is in effect, those
       queries should never be sent to the global DNS.  The advantage of
       this strategy is that it makes plain to the querying client that
       the prefix is one operated by the (DNS64) site, and that the
       answers the client is getting are generated by DNS64.  The
       disadvantage is that any useful reverse-tree information that
       might be in the global DNS is unavailable to the clients querying
       the DNS64.

   2.  The second option is for the DNS64 name server to synthesize a
       CNAME mapping the IP6.ARPA namespace to the corresponding
       IN-ADDR.ARPA name.  In this case, the DNS64 name server SHOULD
       ensure that there is RDATA at the PTR of the corresponding
       IN-ADDR.ARPA name, and that there is not an existing CNAME at
       that name.  This is in order to avoid synthesizing a CNAME that
       makes a CNAME chain longer or that does not actually point to

       anything.  The rest of the response would be the normal DNS
       processing.  The CNAME can be signed on the fly if need be.  The
       advantage of this approach is that any useful information in the
       reverse tree is available to the querying client.  The
       disadvantages are that it adds additional load to the DNS64
       (because CNAMEs have to be synthesized for each PTR query that
       matches the Pref64::/n), and that it may require signing on
       the fly.

   If the address prefix does not match any Pref64::/n, then the DNS64
   server MUST process the query as though it were any other query;
   i.e., a recursive name server MUST attempt to resolve the query as
   though it were any other (non-A/AAAA) query, and an authoritative
   server MUST respond authoritatively or with a referral, as
   appropriate.

   DNS64 synthesis MUST NOT be performed on any records in the
   additional section of synthesized answers.  The DNS64 MUST pass the
   additional section unchanged.

      NOTE: It may appear that adding synthetic records to the
      additional section is desirable, because clients sometimes use the
      data in the additional section to proceed without having to
      re-query.  There is in general no promise, however, that the
      additional section will contain all the relevant records, so any
      client that depends on the additional section being able to
      satisfy its needs (i.e., without additional queries) is
      necessarily broken.  An IPv6-only client that needs a AAAA record,
      therefore, will send a query for the necessary AAAA record if it
      is unable to find such a record in the additional section of an
      answer it is consuming.  For a correctly functioning client, the
      effect would be no different if the additional section were empty.
      The alternative of removing the A records in the additional
      section and replacing them with synthetic AAAA records may cause a
      host behind a NAT64 to query directly a name server that is
      unaware of the NAT64 in question.  The result in this case will be
      resolution failure anyway, but later in the resolution operation.
      The prohibition on synthetic data in the additional section
      reduces, but does not eliminate, the possibility of resolution
      failures due to cached DNS data from behind the DNS64.  See
      <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.

   If the DNS64 is in recursive-resolver mode, then considerations

   A DNS64 uses different pieces of data to build the response returned
   to the querying client.

   The query that is used as the basis for synthesis results either in
   an error, an answer that can be used as a basis for synthesis, or an
   empty (authoritative) answer.  If there is an empty answer, then the
   DNS64 responds to the original querying client with the answer the
   DNS64 received to the original (initiator's) query.  Otherwise, the
   response is assembled as follows.

   The header fields are set according to the usual rules for recursive
   or authoritative servers, depending on the role that the DNS64 is
   serving.  The question section is copied from the original
   (initiator's) query.  The answer section is populated according to
   the rules in <a href="#section-5.1.7">Section 5.1.7</a>.  The authority and additional sections
   are copied from the response to the final query that the DNS64
   performed, and used as the basis for synthesis.

   The final response from the DNS64 is subject to all the standard DNS
   rules, including truncation [<a href="rfc1035.html" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>] and EDNS0 handling [<a href="rfc2671.html" title='"Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)"'>RFC2671</a>].

   We consider the case where a recursive resolver that is performing
   DNS64 also has a local policy to validate the answers according to
   the procedures outlined in <a href="rfc4035.html#section-5">[RFC4035], Section 5</a>.  We call this
   general case vDNS64.

   The vDNS64 uses the presence of the DO and CD bits to make some
   decisions about what the query originator needs, and can react
   accordingly:

   1.  If CD is not set and DO is not set, vDNS64 SHOULD perform
       validation and do synthesis as needed.  See the next item for
       rules about how to do validation and synthesis.  In this case,
       however, vDNS64 MUST NOT set the AD bit in any response.

   2.  If CD is not set and DO is set, then vDNS64 SHOULD perform
       validation.  Whenever vDNS64 performs validation, it MUST
       validate the negative answer for AAAA queries before proceeding
       to query for A records for the same name, in order to be sure
       that there is not a legitimate AAAA record on the Internet.
       Failing to observe this step would allow an attacker to use DNS64
       as a mechanism to circumvent DNSSEC.  If the negative response
       validates, and the response to the A query validates, then the
       vDNS64 MAY perform synthesis and SHOULD set the AD bit in the
       answer to the client.  This is acceptable, because <a href="rfc4035.html#section-3.2.3">[RFC4035],
       Section 3.2.3</a> says that the AD bit is set by the name server side
       of a security-aware recursive name server if and only if it
       considers all the RRSets in the answer and authority sections to
       be authentic.  In this case, the name server has reason to
       believe the RRSets are all authentic, so it SHOULD set the AD
       bit.  If the data does not validate, the vDNS64 MUST respond with
       RCODE=2 (Server failure).

       A security-aware end point might take the presence of the AD bit
       as an indication that the data is valid, and may pass the DNS
       (and DNSSEC) data to an application.  If the application attempts
       to validate the synthesized data, of course, the validation will
       fail.  One could argue therefore that this approach is not
       desirable, but security-aware stub resolvers must not place any
       reliance on data received from resolvers and validated on their
       behalf without certain criteria established by <a href="rfc4035.html#section-4.9.3">[RFC4035],
       Section 4.9.3</a>.  An application that wants to perform validation
       on its own should use the CD bit.

   3.  If the CD bit is set and DO is set, then vDNS64 MAY perform
       validation, but MUST NOT perform synthesis.  It MUST return the
       data to the query initiator, just like a regular recursive
       resolver, and depend on the client to do the validation and the
       synthesis itself.

       The disadvantage to this approach is that an end point that is
       translation-oblivious but security-aware and validating will not
       be able to use the DNS64 functionality.  In this case, the end
       point will not have the desired benefit of NAT64.  In effect,
       this strategy means that any end point that wishes to do
       validation in a NAT64 context must be upgraded to be
       translation-aware as well.

   While DNS64 is intended to be part of a strategy for aiding IPv6
   deployment in an internetworking environment with some IPv4-only and
   IPv6-only networks, it is important to realize that it is
   incompatible with some things that may be deployed in an IPv4-only or
   dual-stack context.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20%20DNS%20Resolvers%20and%20DNS64"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  DNS Resolvers and DNS64</span>

   Full-service resolvers that are unaware of the DNS64 function can be
   (mis)configured to act as mixed-mode iterative and forwarding
   resolvers.  In a native IPv4 context, this sort of configuration may
   appear to work.  It is impossible to make it work properly without it
   being aware of the DNS64 function, because it will likely at some
   point obtain IPv4-only glue records and attempt to use them for
   resolution.  The result that is returned will contain only A records,
   and without the ability to perform the DNS64 function the resolver
   will be unable to answer the necessary AAAA queries.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2.%20%20DNSSEC%20Validators%20and%20DNS64"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" name="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  DNSSEC Validators and DNS64</span>

   An existing DNSSEC validator (i.e., one that is unaware of DNS64)
   might reject all the data that comes from DNS64 as having been
   tampered with (even if it did not set CD when querying).  If it is
   necessary to have validation behind the DNS64, then the validator
   must know how to perform the DNS64 function itself.  Alternatively,
   the validating host may establish a trusted connection with a DNS64,
   and allow the DNS64 recursive resolver to do all validation on its
   behalf.

   Synthetic AAAA records may be constructed on the basis of the network
   context in which they were constructed.  If a host sends DNS queries
   to resolvers in multiple networks, it is possible that some of them
   will receive answers from a DNS64 without all of them being connected
   via a NAT64.  For instance, suppose a system has two interfaces, i1
   and i2.  Whereas i1 is connected to the IPv4 Internet via NAT64, i2
   has native IPv6 connectivity only.  I1 might receive a AAAA answer
   from a DNS64 that is configured for a particular NAT64; the IPv6
   address contained in that AAAA answer will not connect with anything
   via i2.

   This example illustrates why it is generally preferable that hosts
   treat DNS answers from one interface as local to that interface.  The
   answer received on one interface will not work on the other
   interface.  Hosts that attempt to use DNS answers globally may
   encounter surprising failures in these cases.

   Note that the issue is not that there are two interfaces, but that
   there are two networks involved.  The same results could be achieved
   with a single interface routed to two different networks.

   Similarly, suppose that i1 has IPv6 connectivity and can connect to
   the IPv4 Internet through NAT64, but i2 has native IPv4 connectivity.
   In this case, i1 could receive an IPv6 address from a synthetic AAAA
   that would better be reached via native IPv4.  Again, it is worth
   emphasizing that this arises because there are two networks involved.

                Figure 2:  Accidental Dual-Stack DNS64 Use

   The default configuration of dual-stack hosts is that IPv6 is
   preferred over IPv4 ([<a href="rfc3484.html" title='"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC3484</a>]).  In that arrangement, the host will
   often use the NAT64 when native IPv4 would be more desirable.  For
   this reason, hosts with IPv4 connectivity to the Internet should
   avoid using DNS64.  This can be partly resolved by ISPs when
   providing DNS resolvers to clients, but that is not a guarantee that

   the NAT64 will never be used when a native IPv4 connection should be
   used.  There is no general-purpose mechanism to ensure that native
   IPv4 transit will always be preferred, because to a DNS64-oblivious
   host, the DNS64 looks just like an ordinary DNS server.  Operators of
   a NAT64 should expect traffic to pass through the NAT64 even when it
   is not necessary.

   Finally, consider the case where the IPv4 connectivity on i2 is only
   with a LAN, and not with the IPv4 Internet.  The IPv4 Internet is
   only accessible using the NAT64.  In this case, it is critical that
   the DNS64 not synthesize AAAA responses for hosts in the LAN, or else
   that the DNS64 be aware of hosts in the LAN and provide context-
   sensitive answers ("split view" DNS answers) for hosts inside the
   LAN.  As with any split view DNS arrangement, operators must be
   prepared for data to leak from one context to another, and for
   failures to occur because nodes accessible from one context are not
   accessible from the other.

                Figure 3:  Intentional Dual-Stack DNS64 Use

   It is important for deployers of DNS64 to realize that, in some
   circumstances, making the DNS64 available to a dual-stack host will
   cause the host to prefer to send packets via NAT64 instead of via
   native IPv4, with the associated loss of performance or functionality
   (or both) entailed by the NAT.  At the same time, some hosts are not
   able to learn about DNS servers provisioned on IPv6 addresses, or
   simply cannot send DNS packets over IPv6.

   In this section, we illustrate how the DNS64 behaves in different
   scenarios that are expected to be common.  In particular, we will
   consider the following scenarios defined in [<a href="rfc6144.html" title='"Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation"'>RFC6144</a>]: the "an IPv6
   network to the IPv4 Internet" scenario (both with DNS64 in DNS server
   mode and in stub-resolver mode) and the "IPv6 Internet to an IPv4
   network" setup (with DNS64 in DNS server mode only).

   In all the examples below, there is an IPv6/IPv4 translator
   connecting the IPv6 domain to the IPv4 one.  Also, there is a name
   server that is a dual-stack node, so it can communicate with IPv6
   hosts using IPv6 and with IPv4 nodes using IPv4.  In addition, we
   assume that in the examples, the DNS64 function learns which IPv6
   prefix it needs to use to map the IPv4 address space through manual
   configuration.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.%20%20Example%20of%20%22an%20IPv6%20Network%20to%20the%20IPv4%20Internet%22%20Setup%20with%20DNS64"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a>.

   In this example, we consider an IPv6 node located in an IPv6-only
   site that initiates a communication to an IPv4 node located in the
   IPv4 Internet.

   The scenario for this case is depicted in the following figure:

          Figure 4:  "An IPv6 Network to the IPv4 Internet" Setup

   The figure shows an IPv6 node H1 and an IPv4 node H2 with the IPv4
   address 192.0.2.1 and FQDN h2.example.com.

   The IPv6/IPv4 translator has an IPv4 address 203.0.113.1 assigned
   to its IPv4 interface, and it is using the Well-Known Prefix
   64:ff9b::/96 to create IPv6 representations of IPv4 addresses.  The
   same prefix is configured in the DNS64 function in the local name
   server.

   For this example, assume the typical DNS situation where IPv6 hosts
   have only stub resolvers, and they are configured with the IP address
   of a name server that they always have to query and that performs
   recursive lookups (henceforth called "the recursive name server").

   The steps by which H1 establishes communication with H2 are:

   1.  H1 does a DNS lookup for h2.example.com.  H1 does this by sending
       a DNS query for a AAAA record for H2 to the recursive name
       server.  The recursive name server implements DNS64
       functionality.

   2.  The recursive name server resolves the query, and discovers that
       there are no AAAA records for H2.

   3.  The recursive name server performs an A-record query for H2 and
       gets back an RRSet containing a single A record with the IPv4
       address 192.0.2.1.  The name server then synthesizes a AAAA
       record.  The IPv6 address in the AAAA record contains the prefix
       assigned to the IPv6/IPv4 translator in the upper 96 bits and the
       received IPv4 address in the lower 32 bits; i.e., the resulting
       IPv6 address is 64:ff9b::192.0.2.1.

   4.  H1 receives the synthetic AAAA record and sends a packet towards
       H2.  The packet is sent to the destination address 64:ff9b::
       192.0.2.1.

   5.  The packet is routed to the IPv6 interface of the IPv6/IPv4
       translator, and the subsequent communication flows by means of
       the IPv6/IPv4 translator mechanisms.

   The figure shows an IPv6 node H1 implementing the DNS64 function and
   an IPv4 node H2 with the IPv4 address 192.0.2.1 and FQDN
   h2.example.com.

   The IPv6/IPv4 translator has an IPv4 address 203.0.113.1 assigned
   to its IPv4 interface, and it is using the Well-Known Prefix
   64:ff9b::/96 to create IPv6 representations of IPv4 addresses.  The
   same prefix is configured in the DNS64 function in H1.

   For this example, assume the typical DNS situation where IPv6 hosts
   have only stub resolvers, and they are configured with the IP address
   of a name server that they always have to query and that performs
   recursive lookups (henceforth called "the recursive name server").
   The recursive name server does not perform the DNS64 function.

   The steps by which H1 establishes communication with H2 are:

   1.  H1 does a DNS lookup for h2.example.com.  H1 does this by sending
       a DNS query for a AAAA record for H2 to the recursive name
       server.

   2.  The recursive DNS server resolves the query, and returns the
       answer to H1.  Because there are no AAAA records in the global
       DNS for H2, the answer is empty.

   3.  The stub resolver at H1 then queries for an A record for H2 and
       gets back an A record containing the IPv4 address 192.0.2.1.  The
       DNS64 function within H1 then synthesizes a AAAA record.  The
       IPv6 address in the AAAA record contains the prefix assigned to
       the IPv6/IPv4 translator in the upper 96 bits, then the received
       IPv4 address in the lower 32 bits; the resulting IPv6 address is
       64:ff9b::192.0.2.1.

   4.  H1 sends a packet towards H2.  The packet is sent to the
       destination address 64:ff9b::192.0.2.1.

   5.  The packet is routed to the IPv6 interface of the IPv6/IPv4
       translator and the subsequent communication flows using the IPv6/
       IPv4 translator mechanisms.

   In this example, we consider an IPv6 node located in the IPv6
   Internet that initiates a communication to an IPv4 node located in
   the IPv4 site.

   In some cases, this scenario can be addressed without using any form
   of DNS64 function.  This is because it is possible to assign a fixed
   IPv6 address to each of the IPv4 nodes.  Such an IPv6 address would
   be constructed using the address transformation algorithm defined in
   [<a href="rfc6052.html" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>] that takes as input the Pref64::/96 and the IPv4 address of
   the IPv4 node.  Note that the IPv4 address can be a public or a
   private address; the latter does not present any additional
   difficulty, since an NSP must be used as Pref64::/96 (in this
   scenario, the usage of the Well-Known Prefix is not supported as
   discussed in [<a href="rfc6052.html" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>]).  Once these IPv6 addresses have been
   assigned to represent the IPv4 nodes in the IPv6 Internet, real AAAA
   RRs containing these addresses can be published in the DNS under the
   site's domain.  This is the recommended approach to handle this
   scenario, because it does not involve synthesizing AAAA records at
   the time of query.

   However, there are some more dynamic scenarios, where synthesizing
   AAAA RRs in this setup may be needed.  In particular, when DNS Update
   [<a href="rfc2136.html" title='"Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System (DNS UPDATE)"'>RFC2136</a>] is used in the IPv4 site to update the A RRs for the IPv4
   nodes, there are two options.  One option is to modify the DNS server
   that receives the dynamic DNS updates.  That would normally be the
   authoritative server for the zone.  So the authoritative zone would
   have normal AAAA RRs that are synthesized as dynamic updates occur.
   The other option is to modify all of the authoritative servers to
   generate synthetic AAAA records for a zone, possibly based on
   additional constraints, upon the receipt of a DNS query for the AAAA
   RR.  The first option -- in which the AAAA is synthesized when the
   DNS update message is received, and the data published in the
   relevant zone -- is recommended over the second option (i.e., the
   synthesis upon receipt of the AAAA DNS query).  This is because it is
   usually easier to solve problems of misconfiguration when the DNS
   responses are not being generated dynamically.  However, it may be
   the case where the primary server (that receives all the updates)
   cannot be upgraded for whatever reason, but where a secondary can be
   upgraded in order to handle the (comparatively small amount of) AAAA
   queries.  In such a case, it is possible to use the DNS64 as
   described next.  The DNS64 behavior that we describe in this section
   covers the case of synthesizing the AAAA RR when the DNS query
   arrives.

          Figure 6:  "The IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 Network" Setup
                       with DNS64 in DNS Server Mode

   The figure shows an IPv6 node H1 and an IPv4 node H2 with the IPv4
   address 192.0.2.1 and FQDN h2.example.com.

   The IPv6/IPv4 translator is using an NSP 2001:db8::/96 to create IPv6
   representations of IPv4 addresses.  The same prefix is configured in
   the DNS64 function in the local name server.  The name server that
   implements the DNS64 function is the authoritative name server for
   the local domain.

   The steps by which H1 establishes communication with H2 are:

   1.  H1 does a DNS lookup for h2.example.com.  H1 does this by sending
       a DNS query for a AAAA record for H2.  The query is eventually
       forwarded to the server in the IPv4 site.

   2.  The local DNS server resolves the query (locally), and discovers
       that there are no AAAA records for H2.

   3.  The name server verifies that h2.example.com and its A RR are
       among those that the local policy defines as allowed to generate
       a AAAA RR.  If that is the case, the name server synthesizes a
       AAAA record from the A RR and the prefix 2001:db8::/96.  The IPv6
       address in the AAAA record is 2001:db8::192.0.2.1.

   4.  H1 receives the synthetic AAAA record and sends a packet towards
       H2.  The packet is sent to the destination address 2001:db8::
       192.0.2.1.

   5.  The packet is routed through the IPv6 Internet to the IPv6
       interface of the IPv6/IPv4 translator and the communication flows
       using the IPv6/IPv4 translator mechanisms.

   DNS64 operates in combination with the DNS, and is therefore subject
   to whatever security considerations are appropriate to the DNS mode
   in which the DNS64 is operating (i.e., authoritative, recursive, or
   stub-resolver mode).

   DNS64 has the potential to interfere with the functioning of DNSSEC,
   because DNS64 modifies DNS answers, and DNSSEC is designed to detect
   such modifications and to treat modified answers as bogus.  See the
   discussion above in Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a>, <a href="#section-5.5">5.5</a>, and <a href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.

   Additionally, for the correct functioning of the translation
   services, the DNS64 and the NAT64 need to use the same Pref64.  If an
   attacker manages to change the Pref64 used by the DNS64, the traffic
   generated by the host that receives the synthetic reply will be
   delivered to the altered Pref64.  This can result in either a denial-
   of-service (DoS) attack (if the resulting IPv6 addresses are not
   assigned to any device), a flooding attack (if the resulting IPv6
   addresses are assigned to devices that do not wish to receive the
   traffic), or an eavesdropping attack (in case the Pref64 is routed
   through the attacker).

             Records when Real AAAA Resource Records Exist

   The motivation for synthesizing AAAA RRs when real AAAA RRs exist is
   to support the following scenario:

   o  An IPv4-only server application (e.g., web server software) is
      running on a dual-stack host.  There may also be dual-stack server
      applications running on the same host.  That host has fully
      routable IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and hence the authoritative DNS
      server has an A record and a AAAA record.

   o  An IPv6-only client (regardless of whether the client application
      is IPv6-only, the client stack is IPv6-only, or it only has an
      IPv6 address) wants to access the above server.

   o  The client issues a DNS query to a DNS64 resolver.

   If the DNS64 only generates a synthetic AAAA if there's no real AAAA,
   then the communication will fail.  Even though there's a real AAAA,
   the only way for communication to succeed is with the translated
   address.  So, in order to support this scenario, the administrator of
   a DNS64 service may want to enable the synthesis of AAAA RRs even
   when real AAAA RRs exist.

   The implication of including synthetic AAAA RRs when real AAAA RRs
   exist is that translated connectivity may be preferred over native
   connectivity in some cases where the DNS64 is operated in DNS server
   mode.

   <a href="rfc3484.html">RFC 3484</a> [<a href="rfc3484.html" title='"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC3484</a>] rules use "longest matching prefix" to select the
   preferred destination address to use.  So, if the DNS64 resolver
   returns both the synthetic AAAA RRs and the real AAAA RRs, then if
   the DNS64 is operated by the same domain as the initiating host, and
   a global unicast prefix (referred to as a Network-Specific Prefix
   (NSP) in [<a href="rfc6052.html" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>]) is used, then a synthetic AAAA RR is likely to be
   preferred.

   This means that without further configuration:

   o  In the "an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet" scenario, the host
      will prefer translated connectivity if an NSP is used.  If the
      Well-Known Prefix defined in [<a href="rfc6052.html" title='"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators"'>RFC6052</a>] is used, it will probably
      prefer native connectivity.

   o  In the "IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network" scenario, it is possible
      to bias the selection towards the real AAAA RR if the DNS64
      resolver returns the real AAAA first in the DNS reply, when an NSP
      is used (the Well-Known Prefix usage is not supported in this
      case).

   o  In the "an IPv6 network to an IPv4 network" scenario, for local
      destinations (i.e., target hosts inside the local site), it is
      likely that the NSP and the destination prefix are the same, so we
      can use the order of RR in the DNS reply to bias the selection
      through native connectivity.  If the Well-Known Prefix is used,
      the "longest matching prefix" rule will select native
      connectivity.

   The problem can be solved by properly configuring the <a href="rfc3484.html">RFC 3484</a>
