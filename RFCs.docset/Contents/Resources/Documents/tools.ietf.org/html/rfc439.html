   The session recorded below actually happened on 18 September 1972 and
   is herewith reproduced for your entertainment.

   Good Evening.

   Tell me your problems.  Please terminate input with a period or a
   question mark.

   *People get on my nerves sometimes.

   I am not sure I understand you fully.

   *You should pay more attention.

   Suppose you should pay more attention.

   *You're entitled to your own opinion.

   What makes you think I am entitled to my own opinion?

   *It bothers me just to be around people in general.

   Please go on.

   *I went to the track at Bay Meadows a while back.

   What does that suggest to you?

   *I went to the races.

   What else would you like to discuss?

   *Horseracing interests me.

   Why do you say that just now?

   *There's a lot of crooked gambling going on there.

   I am not sure I understand you fully,

   *It's clear to me if not to you.

   Do you think its likely that not to I?

   *I went to the races.

   Please go on.

   *I gamble on horses.

   What does that suggest to you?

   *I went to the races.

   What else would you like to discuss?

   *Gambling has been nothing but trouble to me.

   Why do you say that just now?

   *I've had experience with crooks gambling at the track.

   I am not sure I understand you fully.

   *I've already told you enough about that.

   Oh? I enough about that?

   *I went to the races.

         comment: This has to be the most persistent and patient
         paranoid I have ever encountered.

   Please go on.

   *Do you know anything about bookies?

   What makes you think I know anything about bookies?

   *A bookie didn't pay me off once.

   What does that suggest to you?

   *I beat up the bookie who did not pay off, and I thought he might use
   his friends in the underworld to get even with me.

   What else would you like to discuss?

   *What do you know about racketeers?

   Why do you ask?

   *What experience have you had gambling?

   Why does that question interest you?

   *I like horseraces.

   What else do you like?

   *I know the mob controls the big rackets.

   Who are you really talking about?

   *Have you ever really thought about the MAFIA?

   Suppose you ever really thought about the MAFIA.

   *Let's talk about something else.

   I am not sure I understand you fully.

   *You keep asking me the same things, why not change the topic?

   In what way?

   *What do you mean?

   Why are such questions on your mind?

   *I thought I told you, people get on my nerves.

   Your nerves?

   *Well, I don't know.

   Don't you really know?

   *I would say so.

   Please go on.

   *I would rather not discuss that anymore.

   Would you like to discuss your nerves?

   *I guess so.

   What does that suggest to you?

   *What are you getting at?

   What answer would please you most?

   *It's not a matter or like or dislike.

   What else would you like to discuss?

   *I am getting tired of answering the same questions over and over.

   What resemblance do you see?

   *Why do you need to know that?

   What do you think?

   *I don't understand your motives.

   Why don't you understand my motives?

   *Shouldn't I be?

         comment: ???

   Why do you say that just now?

         comment: I was wondering the same thing.

   *That's just the way it is.

   Suppose that's just the way it were not.

   *So?

   I am not sure I understand you fully.

   *You harp on the same questions too much.

   What does that similarity suggest to you?

   *I don't get you.

   Do you wish that you did get I?

   *It's about time you showed some interest in my feelings.

   Oh? I showed some interest in your feelings?

         comment: must have been an accident...

   *I will help you if I trust you.

   Do you wish that you trust I?

   *Maybe yes, maybe no.

   You don't seem quite certain.

    ...Excuse me for just a minute.  Sorry to have interrupt you please
   continue...

   *Really?

   Please go on.

   *In my opinion you have a one-track mind.

   What makes you think I have a one-track mind?

         comment: you ready for this?

   *I used to go to the track every week.

   What does that suggest to you?

   *I avoid racetracks now because the races are fixed.

   Is that the real reason?

   *I'd rather not discuss it.

   What else would you like to discuss?

   *That's something I don't want to go into.

   Does that trouble you?

   *I went to the races.

   Why do you say that just now.

   *It's none of your business.

   Why are you concerned over my business?

   *I don't confide in strangers.

   Don't you really confide in strangers?

   *Let's change the subject.

   Perhaps that concerns your feelings.

   *I went to the races.

   I am not sure I understand you fully.

   *What's wrong with you that you keep on bugging me about this?

   Who are you really talking about?

   *The way you repeat yourself is getting ridiculous.

   Suppose you repeat myself is getting ridiculous.

         comment: howzat?

   *There are some tricky operators down there.

   Are there really some tricky operators down there?

   *The guys involved in the horseracing racket.

   Please go on.


   *You are a real nag.

         comment: just one of the horses.

   Does it please you to believe I am a real nag?

   *I have had enough of this.
