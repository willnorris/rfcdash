Abstract

   To help reduce well-known threats against BGP including prefix mis-
   announcing and monkey-in-the-middle attacks, one of the security
   requirements is the ability to validate the origination Autonomous
   System (AS) of BGP routes.  More specifically, one needs to validate
   that the AS number claiming to originate an address prefix (as
   derived from the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP route) is in fact
   authorized by the prefix holder to do so.  This document describes a
   simple validation mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement.

   A BGP route associates an address prefix with a set of Autonomous
   Systems (ASes) that identify the interdomain path the prefix has
   traversed in the form of BGP announcements.  This set is represented
   as the AS_PATH attribute in BGP [<a href="rfc4271.html" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] and starts with the AS that
   originated the prefix.  To help reduce well-known threats against BGP
   including prefix mis-announcing and monkey-in-the-middle attacks, one
   of the security requirements is the ability to validate the
   origination AS of BGP routes.  More specifically, one needs to
   validate that the AS number claiming to originate an address prefix
   (as derived from the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP route) is in fact
   authorized by the prefix holder to do so.  This document describes a
   simple validation mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement.

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) describes an approach
   to build a formally verifiable database of IP addresses and AS
   numbers as resources.  The overall architecture of RPKI as defined in
   [<a href="rfc6480.html" title='"An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet Routing"'>RFC6480</a>] consists of three main components:

   o  a public key infrastructure (PKI) with the necessary certificate
      objects,

   o  digitally signed routing objects, and

   o  a distributed repository system to hold the objects that would
      also support periodic retrieval.

   The RPKI system is based on resource certificates that define
   extensions to X.509 to represent IP addresses and AS identifiers
   [<a href="rfc3779.html" title='"X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers"'>RFC3779</a>], thus the name RPKI.  Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)
   [<a href="rfc6482.html" title='"A Profile for Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)"'>RFC6482</a>] are separate digitally signed objects that define
   associations between ASes and IP address blocks.  Finally, the
   repository system is operated in a distributed fashion through the
   IANA, Regional Internet Registry (RIR) hierarchy, and ISPs.

   In order to benefit from the RPKI system, it is envisioned that
   relying parties at either the AS or organization level obtain a local
   copy of the signed object collection, verify the signatures, and
   process them.  The cache must also be refreshed periodically.  The
   exact access mechanism used to retrieve the local cache is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   Individual BGP speakers can utilize the processed data contained in
   the local cache to validate BGP announcements.  The protocol details
   to retrieve the processed data from the local cache to the BGP
   speakers is beyond the scope of this document (refer to [<a href="rfc6810.html" title='"The RPKI/Router Protocol"'>RFC6810</a>] for
   such a mechanism).  This document proposes a means by which a BGP
   speaker can make use of the processed data in order to assign a
   "validation state" to each prefix in a received BGP UPDATE message.

   Note that the complete path attestation against the AS_PATH attribute
   of a route is outside the scope of this document.

   Like the DNS, the global RPKI presents only a loosely consistent
   view, depending on timing, updating, fetching, etc.  Thus, one cache
   or router may have different data about a particular prefix than
   another cache or router.  There is no 'fix' for this; it is the
   nature of distributed data with distributed caches.

   Although RPKI provides the context for this document, it is equally
   possible to use any other database that is able to map prefixes to
   their authorized origin ASes.  Each distinct database will have its

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] only when they
   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed

   The BGP speaker loads validated objects from the cache into local
   storage.  The objects loaded have the content (IP address, prefix
   length, maximum length, origin AS number).  We refer to such a
   locally stored object as a "Validated ROA Payload" or "VRP".

   We define several terms in addition to "VRP".  Where these terms are
   used, they are capitalized:

   o  Prefix: (IP address, prefix length), interpreted as is customary
      (see [<a href="rfc4632.html" title='"Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan"'>RFC4632</a>]).

   o  Route: Data derived from a received BGP UPDATE, as defined in
      <a href="rfc4271.html#section-1.1">[RFC4271], Section 1.1</a>.  The Route includes one Prefix and an
      AS_PATH; it may include other attributes to characterize the
      prefix.

   o  VRP Prefix: The Prefix from a VRP.

   o  VRP ASN: The origin AS number from a VRP.

   o  Route Prefix: The Prefix derived from a route.

   o  Route Origin ASN: The origin AS number derived from a Route as
      follows:

      *  the rightmost AS in the final segment of the AS_PATH attribute
         in the Route if that segment is of type AS_SEQUENCE, or

      *  the BGP speaker's own AS number if that segment is of type
         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET or if the AS_PATH is empty,
         or

      *  the distinguished value "NONE" if the final segment of the
         AS_PATH attribute is of any other type.

   o  Covered: A Route Prefix is said to be Covered by a VRP when the
      VRP prefix length is less than or equal to the Route prefix
      length, and the VRP prefix address and the Route prefix address
      are identical for all bits specified by the VRP prefix length.
      (That is, the Route prefix is either identical to the VRP prefix
      or more specific than the VRP prefix.)

   o  Matched: A Route Prefix is said to be Matched by a VRP when the
      Route Prefix is Covered by that VRP, the Route prefix length is
      less than or equal to the VRP maximum length, and the Route Origin
      ASN is equal to the VRP ASN.

   Given these definitions, any given BGP Route will be found to have
   one of the following validation states:

   o  NotFound: No VRP Covers the Route Prefix.

   o  Valid: At least one VRP Matches the Route Prefix.

   o  Invalid: At least one VRP Covers the Route Prefix, but no VRP
      Matches it.

   We observe that no VRP can have the value "NONE" as its VRP ASN.
   Thus, a Route whose Origin ASN is "NONE" cannot be Matched by any
   VRP.  Similarly, no valid Route can have an Origin ASN of zero [<a href="#ref-AS0" title='"Codification of AS 0 processing."'>AS0</a>].
   Thus, no Route can be Matched by a VRP whose ASN is zero.

   When a BGP speaker receives an UPDATE from a neighbor, it SHOULD
   perform a lookup as described above for each of the Routes in the
   UPDATE message.  The lookup SHOULD also be applied to routes that are
   redistributed into BGP from another source, such as another protocol
   or a locally defined static route.  An implementation MAY provide
   configuration options to control which routes the lookup is applied
   to.  The validation state of the Route MUST be set to reflect the
   result of the lookup.  The implementation should consider the
   validation state as described in the document as a local property or
   attribute of the Route.  If validation is not performed on a Route,
   the implementation SHOULD initialize the validation state of such a
   route to "NotFound".

   Use of the validation state is discussed in Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a> and <a href="#section-5">5</a>.  An
   implementation MUST NOT exclude a route from the Adj-RIB-In or from
   consideration in the decision process as a side effect of its
   validation state, unless explicitly configured to do so.

   We observe that a Route can be Matched or Covered by more than one
   VRP.  This procedure does not mandate an order in which VRPs must be
   visited; however, the validation state output is fully determined.

   An implementation MUST provide the ability to match and set the
   validation state of routes as part of its route policy filtering
   function.  Use of validation state in route policy is elaborated in
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  For more details on operational policy considerations,
   see [<a href="#ref-ORIGIN-OPS" title='"RPKI-Based Origin Validation Operation"'>ORIGIN-OPS</a>].

   An implementation MUST also support four-octet AS numbers [<a href="rfc6793.html" title='"BGP Support for Four-Octet Autonomous System (AS) Number Space"'>RFC6793</a>].

   Each BGP speaker supporting prefix validation as described in this
   document is expected to communicate with one or more RPKI caches,
   each of which stores a local copy of the global RPKI database.  The
   protocol mechanisms used to gather and validate these data and
   present them to BGP speakers are described in [<a href="rfc6810.html" title='"The RPKI/Router Protocol"'>RFC6810</a>].

   The prefix-to-AS mappings used by the BGP speaker are expected to be
   updated over time.  When a mapping is added or deleted, the
   implementation MUST re-validate any affected prefixes and run the BGP
   decision process if needed.  An "affected prefix" is any prefix that
   was matched by a deleted or updated mapping, or could be matched by
   an added or updated mapping.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Deployment%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Deployment Considerations</span>

   Once a Route is selected for validation, it is categorized according
   the procedure given in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.  Subsequently, routing policy as
   discussed in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> can be used to take action based on the
   validation state.

   Policies that could be implemented include filtering routes based on
   validation state (for example, rejecting all "invalid" routes) or
   adjusting a route's degree of preference in the selection algorithm
   based on its validation state.  The latter could be accomplished by
   adjusting the value of such attributes as LOCAL_PREF.  Considering
   invalid routes for BGP decision process is a purely local policy
   matter and should be done with utmost care.

   In some cases (particularly when the selection algorithm is
   influenced by the adjustment of a route property that is not
   propagated into Internal BGP (IBGP)) it could be necessary for
   routing correctness to propagate the validation state to the IBGP
   peer.  This can be accomplished on the sending side by setting a
   community or extended community based on the validation state, and on
   the receiving side by matching the (extended) community and setting
   the validation state.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Although this specification discusses one portion of a system to
   validate BGP routes, it should be noted that it relies on a database
   (RPKI or other) to provide validation information.  As such, the
   security properties of that database must be considered in order to
   determine the security provided by the overall solution.  If
   "invalid" routes are blocked as this specification suggests, the
   overall system provides a possible denial-of-service vector; for

   example, if an attacker is able to inject (or remove) one or more
   records into (or from) the validation database, it could lead an
   otherwise valid route to be marked as invalid.

   In addition, this system is only able to provide limited protection
   against a determined attacker -- the attacker need only prepend the
   "valid" source AS to a forged BGP route announcement in order to
   defeat the protection provided by this system.

   This mechanism does not protect against "AS-in-the-middle attacks" or
   provide any path validation.  It only attempts to verify the origin.
   In general, this system should be thought of more as a protection
   against misconfiguration than as true "security" in the strong sense.
