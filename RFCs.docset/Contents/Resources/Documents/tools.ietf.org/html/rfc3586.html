Abstract

   This document describes the problem space and solution requirements
   for developing an IP Security Policy (IPSP) configuration and
   management framework.  The IPSP architecture provides a scalable,
   decentralized framework for managing, discovering and negotiating the
   host and network security policies that govern access, authorization,
   authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and other IP
   Security properties.  This document highlights such architectural
   components and presents their functional requirements.

   Network-layer security now enjoys broad popularity as a tool for
   protecting Internet traffic and resources.  Security at the network
   layer can be used as a tool for at least two kinds of security
   architecture:

   a) Security gateways.  Security gateways (including "firewalls") at
      the edges of networks use IPsec [<a href="rfc2401.html" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC-2401</a>] to enforce access
      control, protect the confidentiality and authenticity of network
      traffic entering and leaving a network, and to provide gateway
      services for virtual private networks (VPNs).

   b) Secure end-to-end communication.  Hosts use IPsec to implement
      host-level access control, to protect the confidentiality and
      authenticity of network traffic exchanged with the peer hosts with
      which they communicate, and to join virtual private networks.

   On one hand, IPsec provides an excellent basis for a very wide range
   of protection schemes; on the other hand, this wide range of
   applications for IPsec creates complex management tasks that become
   especially difficult as networks scale up and require different
   security policies, and are controlled by different entities, for
   different kinds of traffic in different parts of the network.

   As organizations deploy security gateways, the Internet divides into
   heterogeneous regions that enforce different access and security
   policies.  Yet it is often still necessary for hosts to communicate
   across the network boundaries controlled by several different
   policies.  The wide range of choices of cryptographic parameters (at
   multiple protocol layers) complicates matters and introduces the need
   for hosts and security gateways to identify and negotiate a set of
   security parameters that meets each party's requirements.  Even more
   complexity arises as IPsec becomes the means through which firewalls
   enforce access control and VPN membership; two IPsec endpoints that
   want to establish a security association must identify, not only the
   mutually acceptable cryptographic parameters, but also exactly what
   kind of access the combined security policy provides.

   While the negotiation of cryptographic and other security parameters
   for IPsec security associations (SAs) is supported by key management
   protocols (e.g., ISAKMP [<a href="rfc2408.html" title='"Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)"'>RFC-2408</a>]), the IPsec key management layer
   does not provide a scheme for managing, negotiating, or enforcing the
   security policies under which SAs operate.

   IPSP provides the framework for managing IPsec security policy,
   negotiating security association (SA) parameters between IPsec
   endpoints, and distributing authorization and policy information
   among hosts that require the ability to communicate via IPsec.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20The%20IP%20Security%20Policy%20Problem%20Space"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  The IP Security Policy Problem Space</span>

   IPSP aims to provide a scalable, decentralized framework for
   managing, discovering and negotiating the host and network IPsec
   policies that govern access, authorization, cryptographic mechanisms,
   confidentiality, data integrity, and other IPsec properties.

   The central problem solved by IPSP is that of controlling security
   policy in a manner that is useful for the wide range of IPsec
   applications and modes of operation.  In particular:

      -  IPSP hosts may serve as IPsec endpoints, security gateways,
         network management hubs, or a combination of these functions.
         IPSP will manage end-users computers (which may be fixed
         workstations controlled by a single organization or mobile
         laptops that require remote access to a corporate VPN),
         firewalls (which provide different services and allow different
         levels of access to different classes of traffic and users),
         VPN routers (which support links to other VPNs that might be
         controlled by a different organization's network policy), web
         and other servers (which might provide different services
         depending on where a client request came from), and so on.

      -  IPSP administration will be inherently heterogeneous and
         decentralized.  A basic feature of IPsec is that two hosts can
         establish a Security Association even though they might not
         share a common security policy, or, indeed, trust one another
         at all.  This property of IPsec becomes even more pronounced at
         the higher level abstraction managed by IPSP.

      -  The SA parameters acceptable to any pair of hosts (operating
         under different policies) will often not be specified in
         advance.  IPSP will often have to negotiate and discover the
         mutually-acceptable SA parameters on-the-fly when two hosts
         attempt to create a new SA.

      -  Some hosts will be governed by policies that are not directly
         specified in the IPSP language.  For example, a host's IPsec
         policy might be derived from a more comprehensive higher-layer
         security policy managed by some other system.  Similarly, some
         vendors might develop specialized (and proprietary) tools for
         managing policy in their products.  In such cases, it is
         necessary to derive an IPSP policy specification for only those
         aspects of a host's policy that involve interoperability with
         other hosts running IPSP.

      -  IPSP must scale to support complex policy administration
         schemes.  In even modest-size networks, one administrator must
         often control policy remotely, and must have the ability to
         change the policy on many different hosts at the same time.  In
         larger networks (or those belonging to large organizations), a
         host's policy might be governed by several different
         authorities (e.g., several different departments might have the
         authority to add users to a firewall or open access to new
         services).  Different parts of a policy might be "owned" by
         different entities in a complex hierarchy.  IPSP must provide a
         mechanism for delegating specific kinds of authority to
         specific entities.

      -  The semantics of IPSP must be well defined, particularly with
         respect to any security-critical aspects of the system.

      -  IPSP must be secure, sound, and comprehensible.  It should be
         possible to understand what an IPSP policy does; the difficulty
         of understanding an IPSP policy should be somewhat proportional
         to the complexity of the problem it solves.  It should also be
         possible to have confidence that an IPSP policy does what it
         claims, and that IPSP implementation is correct;
         architecturally, the security-critical parts of IPSP should be
         small and well-specified enough to allow verification of their
         correct operation.  Ideally, IPSP should be compatible with

   An IPSP solution MUST include:

      -  A policy model with well-defined semantics that captures the
         relationship between IPsec SAs and higher-level security
         policies,

      -  A gateway discovery mechanism that allows hosts to discover
         where to direct IPsec traffic intended for a specific endpoint,

      -  A well-specified language for describing host policies,

      -  A means for distributing responsibility for different aspects
         of policy to different entities,

      -  A mechanism for discovering the policy of a host,

      -  A mechanism for resolving the specific IPsec parameters to be
         used between two hosts governed by different policies (and for
         determining whether any such parameters exist); and,

      -  A well-specified mechanism for checking for compliance with a
         host's policy when SAs are created.

   The mechanisms used in IPSP must not require any protocol
   modifications in any of the IPsec standards (ESP [<a href="rfc2406.html" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC-2406</a>], AH,
   [<a href="rfc2402.html" title='"IP Authentication Header"'>RFC-2402</a>], IKE [<a href="rfc2409.html" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>RFC-2409</a>]).  The mechanisms must be independent of
   the SA-negotiation protocol, but may assume certain functionality
   from such a protocol (this is to ensure that future SA-negotiation
   protocols are not incompatible with IPSP).

   A Policy Model defines the semantics of IPsec policy.  Policy
   specification, checking, and resolution should implement the
   semantics defined in the model.  However, the model should be
   independent of the specific policy distribution mechanism and policy
   discovery scheme, to the extent possible.

   The gateway discovery mechanism may be invoked by any host or
   gateway.  Its goal is to determine what IPsec gateways exist between
   the initiator and the intended communication peer.  The actual
   mechanism employed may be used to piggy-back information necessary by
   other components of the IPSP architecture (e.g., policy discovery, as
   is done in [<a href="#ref-SPP" title='"The Security Policy Protocol"'>SPP</a>]).  The discovery mechanism may have to be invoked at
   any time, independently of existing security associations or other
   communication, to detect topology changes.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.3.%20%20Policy%20Specification%20Language"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.3" name="section-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>.  Policy Specification Language</span>

   In order to allow for policy discovery, compliance checking, and
   resolution across a range of hosts, a common language is necessary in
   which to express the policies of hosts that need to communicate with
   one another.  Statements in this language are the output of policy
   discovery, and provide the input to the policy resolution and
   compliance checking systems.  Note that a host's or network's
   security policy may be expressed in a vendor-specific way, but would
   be translated to the common language when it is to be managed by the
   IPSP services.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.4.%20%20Distributed%20policy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.4" name="section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  Distributed policy</span>

   As discussed above, it must be possible for all or part of a host's
   policy to be managed remotely, possibly by more than one entity.
   This is a basic requirement for large-scale networks and systems.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.5.%20%20Policy%20Discovery"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.5" name="section-3.2.5">3.2.5</a>.  Policy Discovery</span>

   A policy discovery mechanism must provide the essential information
   that two IPsec endpoints can use to determine what kinds of SAs are
   possible between one another.  This is especially important for hosts
   that are not controlled by the same entity, and that might not
   initially share any common information about one another.  Note that
   a host need not reveal its entire security policy, only enough
   information to support the SA resolution system for hosts that might
   want to communicate with it.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.6.%20%20Security%20Association%20Resolution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.6" name="section-3.2.6">3.2.6</a>.  Security Association Resolution</span>

   Once two hosts have learned enough about each other's policies, it
   must be possible (and computationally feasible) to find an acceptable
   set of SA parameters that meets both host's requirements and will
   lead to the successful creation of a new SA.

   When a host proposes the output of the SA resolution scheme, it must
   be checked for compliance with the local security policy of each
   host.  The security and soundness of the SAs created by IPSP-managed
   communication should depend only on the correctness of the compliance
   checking stage.  In particular, even if the SA resolution scheme
   (which is likely to be computationally and conceptually complex)
   produces an incorrect result, it should still not be possible to
   violate the specified policy of either host.
