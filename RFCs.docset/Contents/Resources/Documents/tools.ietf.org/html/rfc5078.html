Abstract

   <a href="rfc3777.html">RFC 3777</a> defines the Nominations and Recall Committee's (NomCom's)
   operation, and includes a sample timeline for major steps in the
   NomCom process that meets the minimum normative requirements for the
   process.  Recent NomComs have been scheduling based on the sample
   timeline, and the chairs of the last three NomComs -- Danny McPherson
   (2004-2005), Ralph Droms (2005-2006), and Andrew Lange (2006-2007) --
   have all reported that this timeline is very aggressive and suggested
   starting earlier.  This document restructures the sample timeline,
   but makes no normative process changes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   <a href="rfc3777.html">RFC 3777</a> ([<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>]) is a complete specification of the process by
   which members of the IAB and IESG are selected, confirmed, and
   recalled as of the date of its approval.  [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>] includes
   normative requirements for timing allowed for the various steps, and
   also includes an informative appendix, <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>, that contains a
   timeline based on the normative text.

   The normative time requirements in [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>] are end-of-task, so
   adjusting the informative timeline to get an earlier start does not
   require changes to the normative text in [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>].

   In IETF 68, IETF 65, and IETF 62 plenary reports, NomCom chairs
   suggested starting the NomCom cycle earlier.  This document describes
   a timeline that meets this need, replacing <a href="rfc3777.html#appendix-B">RFC 3777, Appendix B</a>, and
   makes no other changes to [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20The%20Problem"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  The Problem</span>

   There are several reasons that have been cited for the schedule
   pressures reported by recent NomComs.

   o  A few common practices are not accounted for in the <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>
      timeline [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>].  For example, it is common to allow a week for
      notifying unsuccessful nominees before the formal announcement is
      made.  This is not included in the timeline.

   o  Some tasks just seem to take longer than the minimum interval.
      For example, a public "call for volunteers" must be open for 30
      days, but the list of voting NomCom participants probably isn't
      announced at midnight on the 30th day.  Anecdotal evidence is that
      allowing about 6 weeks is more consistent with recent experience.

   o  The NomCom, and the community it serves, tends to celebrate a
      variety of holidays between the third IETF and the first IETF of
      the next year, so people may be out of the office, may wait to
      respond, etc.

   o  The <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> timeline does not provide flexibility in case of
      problems.  For example, the NomCom chair "reset" the random
      selection of volunteers for the 2006-2007 NomCom, requiring
      another seven-day delay for the announcement of the date of random
      selection.

   All of these reasons can be accommodated by simply starting earlier
   than is absolutely required.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5078.html">RFC 5078</a>                NomCom Starting Earlier             October 2007</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Interaction%20with%20IETF%20Face-to-Face%20Meeting%20Schedule"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Interaction with IETF Face-to-Face Meeting Schedule</span>

   In addition to these reasons for schedule pressure, it's worth noting
   that the NomCom schedule and the IETF face-to-face meeting cycle
   don't complement each other.

   o  When the NomCom volunteers are selected after the second IETF,
      they don't have an opportunity to meet face-to-face and "get
      organized" until the third IETF, when they should be winding up
      their deliberations.  This missed opportunity forces them to use
      teleconferences and other less efficient means of communications
      to get organized.

   o  The NomCom volunteers don't have a chance to conduct interviews
      with the community, or with nominees, until the third IETF, during
      the height of the NomCom effort.  If the NomCom effort took place
      before the third IETF, the NomCom could work on difficult
      nominations, and meet face-to-face with nominees under
      consideration.

   o  If the NomCom is able to start interviews during the second IETF
      meeting, starting earlier than is absolutely required may also
      help NomCom be more effective.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Proposed%20Solution"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Proposed Solution</span>

   The high-level description of the proposal is, of course, "start
   earlier", but more precision would be helpful.

   A sample, hypothetical timeline that meets these guidelines is shown
   in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  Please note that, like <a href="rfc3777.html#appendix-B">Appendix B in [RFC3777]</a>, this
   timeline is not normative, but it meets the normative requirements
   stated in [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>].

   Other timelines are certainly possible, including timelines that
   allow the NomCom to report its results more than one month before the
   first IETF, where the slate of nominees is announced.  Finishing
   early may be a good thing.

   It's worth noting that the first step in the timeline is "ISOC
   president appoints NomCom chair".  This doesn't happen as an IETF
   responsibility, but the reality is that the ISOC president needs to
   identify NomCom chair candidates around the time of the first IETF;
   she needs to have a shortlist 3 or 4 weeks after the first IETF.
   This document suggests (but does not add a normative requirement to
   [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>]) that the outgoing NomCom Chair should verify that this
   process is triggered during the first IETF.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5078.html">RFC 5078</a>                NomCom Starting Earlier             October 2007</span>


   1.  One week is allowed for the NomCom chair to publish milestones.

   2.  Six weeks are allowed for solicitation of NomCom participants.

   3.  One week is allowed for confirmation of the selection of voting
       members -- to allow at least some time for resolution if there is
       a problem.

   4.  The recommended time for NomCom self-organization is increased to
       six weeks.

   5.  One week is allowed for NomCom establishing milestones.

   6.  In the sample timeline (Table 1), an additional five weeks is
       allowed for the nominating bodies to select candidates.

   7.  The timeline is adjusted to allow one week at the end of the
       process for notification of unsuccessful candidates.

   This significantly increases the amount of time available for NomCom
   to select candidates while still meeting the normative requirements
   of [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Sample%20Timeline%20for%202008-2009%20NomCom%20Schedule"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Sample Timeline for 2008-2009 NomCom Schedule</span>

   The following table shows a sample timeline for the 2008-2009 NomCom
   schedule, based on the IETF dates for the second IETF (72nd IETF,
   held July 27 - August 1, 2008), third IETF (73rd IETF, held November
   16-21, 2008), and first IETF (74 IETF, held March 22-27, 2009).

   Note that the duration of each milestone step is adjusted as
   necessary for each NomCom, since the scheduled dates for IETF
   meetings vary from year to year.  This timeline allows the NomCom to
   begin self organizing at the Second IETF (this is what "on time")
   means in the table).

                                  Table 1

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Some%20Observations%20from%20the%202007-2008%20NomCom%20Experience"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Some Observations from the 2007-2008 NomCom Experience</span>

   Since the timeline described in this specification makes no normative
   changes to [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>], the 2007-2008 NomCom process started using the
   new timeline to gain experience and shake out unexpected
   consequences.  We discovered the following things:

   1.  It is worth pointing out that the [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>] requirement for
       eligibility, "Members of the IETF community must have attended at
       least 3 of the last 5 IETF meetings in order to volunteer.", is
       affected when the NomCom chair issues an earlier call for
       volunteers.  For example, using the 2008-2009 NomCom example in
       the doc: under the old schedule, a prospective member would need
       to have attended three of IETF meetings 68-72.  Under the new
       schedule, that becomes three of IETF meetings 67-71.

   2.  It's worth noting that when NomCom uses the earlier timeline,
       incumbents under review who were appointed to one-year terms have
       only one IETF meeting cycle to establish a track record before
       NomCom begins considering whether they should be retained.  This
       situation is rare but not unknown.  The recent split of the RAI
       area out of TSV created two one-year terms (one in RAI, and one
       in TSV), and this can also happens if an IESG or IAB member
       resigns with more than one year remaining in the member's term.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Out-of-Scope%20Suggestions%20Requiring%20Normative%20Text%20Changes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Out-of-Scope Suggestions Requiring Normative Text Changes</span>

   While there are very few avoidable serialized delays in [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>], we
   note that the minimum 30-day delay for volunteers is serialized after
   the NomCom chair is named.  This delay accounts for more than half
   the elapsed time between the NomCom chair being named and the NomCom
   itself forming.  If a future normative revision to [<a href="rfc3777.html" title='"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees"'>RFC3777</a>] changed

   the mechanics for this call for volunteers, this call could be issued
   while the NomCom chair is still being selected.  This would allow the
   new NomCom chair to begin work by announcing the date of random
   selection, instead of just waiting for the volunteers to volunteer.

   One possible trigger would be to have the outgoing NomCom chair issue
   the call for volunteers on behalf of the successor NomCom chair, who
   may not yet be identified, at the first IETF meeting each year.

   The NomCom timeline changes suggested in this document do not
   directly affect the security of the Internet.

   This draft is based on conversations with the chairs of the last
   three NomComs: Danny McPherson (2004-2005), Ralph Droms (2005-2006),
   and Andrew Lange (2006-2007), and on their corresponding plenary
   NomCom Report presentations at IETF 62, IETF 65, and IETF 68,
   respectively.

   The 2007 IESG discussed Andrew Lange's report at their face-to-face
   retreat and requested a proposal that adjusted the informative
   timeline with no normative changes.

   Thanks to Russ Housley, current General Area director, for reviewing
   an early version of this draft.

   Thanks to Brian Carpenter, who pointed out that the IETF NomCom
   portion of the timeline depends on the ISOC president appointing the
   NomCom chair soon after the first IETF ("NomCom chairs don't appear
   magically"), and provided a suggestion for ensuring that this happens
   in a timeframe that allows NomCom to begin self organizing at the
   Second IETF meeting each year.

   Thanks to Sam Weiler, who pointed out the shift in meeting attendance
   requirements described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.

   We should also thank the editors of previous NomCom procedures for
   developing a specification that we could "speed up" without changing
   normative text.
