Abstract

   The Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) provides an interoperable
   framework for Internet commerce. It is payment system independent and
   encapsulates payment systems such as SET, Secure Channel
   Credit/Debit, Mondex, CyberCoin, GeldKarte, etc. IOTP is able to
   handle cases where such merchant roles as the shopping site, the
   Payment Handler, the Delivery Handler of goods or services, and the
   provider of customer support are performed by different parties or by
   one party.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Background</span>

   The Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) provides an interoperable
   framework for Internet commerce. It is payment system independent and
   encapsulates payment systems such as SET, Mondex, CyberCash,
   DigiCash, GeldKarte, etc. IOTP is able to handle cases where such
   merchant roles as the shopping site, the Payment Handler, the
   Delivery Handler of goods or services, and the provider of customer
   support are performed by different parties or by one party.

   The developers of IOTP seek to provide a virtual capability that
   safely replicates the real world, the paper based, traditional,
   understood, accepted methods of trading, buying, selling, value
   exchanging that has existed for many hundreds of years.  The
   negotiation of who will be the parties to the trade, how it will be
   conducted, the presentment of an offer, the method of payment, the
   provision of a payment receipt, the delivery of goods and the receipt
   of goods. These are events that are taken for granted in the course
   of real world trade. IOTP has been produced to provide the same for
   the virtual world, and to prepare and provide for the introduction of
   new models of trading made possible by the expanding presence of the
   virtual world.

   The other fundamental ideal of the IOTP effort is to produce a
   definition of these trading events in such a way that no matter where
   produced, two unfamiliar parties using electronic commerce
   capabilities to buy and sell that conform to the IOTP specifications
   will be able to complete the business safely and successfully.

   In summary, IOTP supports:

   o Familiar trading models

   o New trading models

   o Global interoperability

   The remainder of this section provides background to why IOTP was
   developed. The specification itself starts in the next chapter.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1%20Commerce%20on%20the%20Internet%2C%20a%20Different%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a> Commerce on the Internet, a Different Model</span>

   The growth of the Internet and the advent of electronic commerce are
   bringing about enormous changes around the world in society, politics
   and government, and in business. The ways in which trading partners
   communicate, conduct commerce, are governed have been enriched and
   changed forever.

   One of the very fundamental changes about which IOTP is concerned is
   taking place in the way consumers and merchants trade.
   Characteristics of trading that have changed markedly include:

   o  Presence: Face-to-face transactions become the exception, not the
      rule.  Already with the rise of mail order and telephone order
      placement this change has been felt in western commerce.
      Electronic commerce over the Internet will further expand the
      scope and volume of transactions conducted without ever seeing the
      people who are a part of the enterprise with whom one does
      business.

   o  Authentication: An important part of personal presence is the
      ability of the parties to use familiar objects and dialogue to
      confirm they are who they claim to be. The seller displays one or
      several well known financial logos that declaim his ability to
      accept widely used credit and debit instruments in the payment
      part of a purchase. The buyer brings government or financial
      institution identification that assures the seller she will be
      paid. People use intangibles such as personal appearance and
      conduct, location of the store, apparent quality and familiarity
      with brands of merchandise, and a good clear look in the eye to
      reinforce formal means of authentication.

   o  Payment Instruments: Despite the enormous size of bank card
      financial payments associations and their members, most of the
      world's trade still takes place using the coin of the realm or
      barter. The present infrastructure of the payments business cannot
      economically support low value transactions and could not survive
      under the consequent volumes of transactions if it did accept low
      value transactions.

   o  Transaction Values: New meaning for low value transactions arises
      in the Internet where sellers may wish to offer for example, pages
      of information for fractions of currency that do not exist in the
      real world.

   o  Delivery: New modes of delivery must be accommodated such as
      direct electronic delivery. The means by which receipt is
      confirmed and the execution of payment change dramatically where
      the goods or services have extremely low delivery cost but may in
      fact have very high value.  Or, maybe the value is not high, but
      once delivery occurs the value is irretrievably delivered so
      payment must be final and non-refundable but delivery nonetheless
      must still be confirmed before payment.  Incremental delivery such
      as listening or viewing time or playing time are other models that
      operate somewhat differently in the virtual world.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2%20Benefits%20of%20IOTP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a> Benefits of IOTP</span>

   ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SOFTWARE VENDORS

   Electronic Commerce Software Vendors will be able to develop e-
   commerce products which are more attractive as they will inter-
   operate with any other vendors' software. However, since IOTP focuses
   on how these solutions communicate, there is still plenty of
   opportunity for product differentiation.

   PAYMENT BRANDS

   IOTP provides a standard framework for encapsulating payment
   protocols.  This means that it is easier for payment products to be
   incorporated into IOTP solutions. As a result the payment brands will
   be more widely distributed and available on a wider variety of
   platforms.

   MERCHANTS

   There are several benefits for Merchants:

   o  they will be able to offer a wider variety of payment brands,

   o  they can be more certain that the customer will have the software
      needed to complete the purchase

   o  through receiving payment and delivery receipts from their
      customers, they will be able to provide customer care knowing that
      they are dealing with the individual or organisation with which
      they originally traded

   o  new merchants will be able to enter this new (Internet) market-
      place with new products and services, using the new trading
      opportunities which IOTP presents

   BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

   There are also several benefits for Banks and Financial Institutions:

   o  they will be able to provide IOTP support for merchants

   o  they will find new opportunities for IOTP related services:

      -  providing customer care for merchants
      -  fees from processing new payments and deposits

   o  they have an opportunity to build relationships with new types of
      merchants

   CUSTOMERS

   For Customers there are several benefits:

   o  they will have a larger selection of merchants with whom they can
      trade

   o  there is a more consistent interface when making the purchase

   o  there are ways in which they can get their problems fixed through
      the merchant (rather than the bank!)

   o  there is a record of their transaction which can be used, for
      example, to feed into accounting systems or, potentially, to
      present to the tax authorities

   This specification is Baseline IOTP. It is a Baseline in that it
   contains ways of doing trades on the Internet which are the most
   common, for example purchases and refunds.

   The group that has worked on the IOTP see an extended version being
   developed over time but feel a need to focus on a limited function
   but completely usable specification in order that implementers can
   develop solutions that work now.

   During this period it is anticipated that there will be no changes to
   the scope of this specification with the only changes made being
   limited to corrections where problems are found. Software solutions
   have been developed based on earlier versions of this specification
   (for example version 0.9 published in early 1998 and earlier
   revisions of version 1.0 published during 1999) which prove that the
   IOTP works.

   The objectives of this document are to provide a specification of
   version 1.0 of the Internet Open Trading Protocols which can be used
   to design and implement systems which support electronic trading on
   the Internet using the Internet Open Trading Protocols.







<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                     [Page 10]</span></pre>

   The purpose of the document is:

   o  to allow potential developers of products based on the protocol to
      develop software/hardware solutions which use the protocol

   o  to allow the financial services industry to understand a
      developing electronic commerce trading protocol that encapsulates
      (without modification) any of the current or developing payment
      schemes now being used or considered by their merchant customer
      base

   The protocol describes the content, format and sequences of messages
   that pass among the participants in an electronic trade - consumers,
   merchants and banks or other financial institutions, and customer
   care providers.  These are required to support the electronic
   commerce transactions outlined in the objectives above.

   The protocol is designed to be applicable to any electronic payment
   scheme since it targets the complete purchase process where the
   movement of electronic value from the payer to the payee is only one,
   but important, step of many that may be involved to complete the
   trade.

   Payment Scheme which IOTP could support include MasterCard Credit,
   Visa Credit, Mondex Cash, Visa Cash, GeldKarte, eCash, CyberCoin,
   Millicent, Proton, etc.

   Each payment scheme contains some message flows which are specific to
   that scheme. These scheme-specific parts of the protocol are
   contained in a set of payment scheme supplements to this
   specification.

   The document does not prescribe the software and processes that will
   need to be implemented by each participant. It does describe the
   framework necessary for trading to take place.

   This document also does not address any legal or regulatory issues
   surrounding the implementation of the protocol or the information
   systems which use them.

   The Internet Open Trading Protocols (IOTP) define a number of
   different types of IOTP Transactions:

   o  Purchase. This supports a purchase involving an offer, a payment
      and optionally a delivery

   o  Refund. This supports the refund of a payment as a result of,
      typically, an earlier purchase

   o  Value Exchange. This involves two payments which result in the
      exchange of value from one combination of currency and payment
      method to another

   o  Authentication. This supports one organisation or individual to
      check that another organisation or individual are who they appear
      to be.

   o  Withdrawal. This supports the withdrawal of electronic cash from a
      financial institution

   o  Deposit. This supports the deposit of electronic cash at a
      financial institution

   o  Inquiry. This supports inquiries on the status of an IOTP
      transaction which is either in progress or is complete

   o  Ping. This supports a simple query which enables one IOTP aware
      application to determine whether another IOTP application running
      elsewhere is working or not.

   These IOTP Transactions are "Baseline" transactions since they have
   been identified as a minimum useful set of transactions. Later
   versions of IOTP may include additional types of transactions.

   Each of the IOTP Transactions above involve:

   o  a number of organisations playing a Trading Role, and

   o  a set of Trading Exchanges. Each Trading Exchange involves the
      exchange of data, between Trading Roles, in the form of a set of
      Trading Components.

   Trading Roles, Trading Exchanges and Trading Components are described
   below.

   The roles are:

   o  Consumer. The person or organisation which is to receive and pay
      for the goods or services

   o  Merchant. The person or organisation from whom the purchase is
      being made and who is legally responsible for providing the goods
      or services and receives the benefit of the payment made

   o  Payment Handler. The entity that physically receives the payment
      from the Consumer on behalf of the Merchant

   o  Delivery Handler. The entity that physically delivers the goods or
      services to the Consumer on behalf of the Merchant.

   o  Merchant Customer Care Provider. The entity that is involved with
      customer dispute negotiation and resolution on behalf of the
      Merchant

   Roles may be carried out by the same organisation or different
   organisations. For example:

   o  in the simplest case one physical organisation (e.g., a merchant)
      could handle the purchase, accept the payment, deliver the goods
      and provide merchant customer care

   o  at the other extreme, a merchant could handle the purchase but
      instruct the consumer to pay a bank or financial institution,
      request that delivery be made by an overnight courier firm and to
      contact an organisation which provides 24x7 service if problems
      arise.

   Note that in this specification, unless stated to the contrary, when
   the words Consumer, Merchant, Payment Handler, Delivery Handler or
   Customer Care Provider are used, they refer to the Trading Role
   rather than an actual organisation.

   An individual organisation may take multiple roles. For example a
   company which is selling goods and services on the Internet could
   take the role of Merchant when selling goods or services and the role
   of Consumer when the company is buying goods or services itself.

   As roles occur in different places there is a need for the
   organisations involved in the trade to exchange data, i.e. to carry
   out Trading Exchanges, so that the trade can be completed.

   The Internet Open Trading Protocols identify four Trading Exchanges
   which involve the exchange of data between the Trading Roles. The
   Trading Exchanges are:

   o  Offer. The Offer Exchange results in the Merchant providing the
      Consumer with the reason why the trade is taking place. It is
      called an Offer since the Consumer must accept the Offer if a
      trade is to continue

   o  Payment. The Payment Exchange results in a payment of some kind
      between the Consumer and the Payment Handler. This may occur in
      either direction

   o  Delivery. The Delivery Exchange transmits either the on-line
      goods, or delivery information about physical goods from the
      Delivery Handler to the Consumer, and

   o  Authentication. The Authentication Exchange can be used by any
      Trading Role to authenticate another Trading Role to check that
      they are who they appear to be.

   IOTP Transactions are composed of various combinations of these
   Trading Exchanges.  For example, an IOTP Purchase transaction
   includes Offer, Payment, and Delivery Trading Exchanges.  As another
   example, an IOTP Value Exchange transaction is composed of an Offer
   Trading Exchange and two Payment Trading Exchanges.

   Trading Exchanges consist of Trading Components that are transmitted
   between the various Trading Roles.  Where possible, the number of
   round-trip delays in an IOTP Transaction is minimised by packing the
   Components from several Trading Exchanges into combination IOTP
   Messages.  For example, the IOTP Purchase transaction combines a
   Delivery Organisation Component with an Offer Response Component in
   order to avoid an extra Consumer request and response.

   Each of the IOTP Trading Exchanges is described in more detail below.
   For clarity of description, these describe the Trading Exchanges as
   though they were standalone operations.  For performance reasons, the
   Trading Exchanges are intermingled in the actual IOTP Transaction
   definitions.

   The goal of the Offer Exchange is for the Merchant to provide the
   Consumer with information about the trade so that the Consumer can
   decide whether to continue with the trade. This is illustrated in the
   figure below.

 *+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

 1.          Consumer decides to trade and sends information about the
             transaction (requests an offer) to the Merchant e.g.,
             using HTML.

     C --&gt; M Data: Information on what is being purchased (Offer Request)
             - outside scope of IOTP

 2.          Merchant checks the information provided by the Consumer,

             Consumer.

             Offer Response Signature (optional) that signs other
             components

 3.          Consumer checks the information from the Merchant and
             decides whether to continue.

                           Figure 2 Offer Exchange

   An Offer Exchange uses the following Trading Components that are
   passed between the Consumer and the Merchant:

   o  the Status component is used to indicate to other parties that a
      valid Offer Response has been generated

   o  the Organisation Component contains information which describes
      the Organisations which are taking a role in the trade:

      -  the consumer provides information, about who the consumer is
         and, if goods or services are being delivered, where the goods
         or services are to be delivered to




<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                     [Page 19]</span></pre>

      -  the merchant augments this information by providing information
         about the merchant, the Payment Handler, the customer care
         provider and, if goods or services are being delivered, the
         Delivery Handler

   o  the Order Component contains descriptions of the goods or services
      which will result from the trade if the consumer agrees to the
      offer.  This information is sent by the Merchant to the consumer
      who should verify it

   o  the Payment Component generated by the Merchant, contains details
      of how much to pay, the currency and the payment direction, for
      example the consumer could be asking for a refund. Note that there
      may be more than one payment in a trade

   o  the Delivery Component, also generated by the Merchant, is used if
      goods or services are being delivered. This contains information
      about how delivery will occur, for example by post or using e-mail

   o  the Trading Role Data component contains data the Merchant wants
      to forward to another Trading Role such as a Payment Handler or
      Delivery Handler

   o  the "Offer Response" Signature Component, if present, digitally
      signs all of the above components to ensure their integrity.

   The exact content of the information provided by the Merchant to the
   Consumer will vary depending on the type of IOTP Transaction. For
   example:

   o  low value purchases may not need a signature

   o  the amount to be paid may vary depending on the payment brand and
      payment protocol used

   o  some offers may not involve the delivery of any goods

   o  a value exchange will involve two payments

   o  a merchant may not offer customer care.

   Information provided by the consumer to the merchant is provided
   using a variety of methods, for example, it could be provided:

   o  using [<a href="#ref-HTML" title='"Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0"'>HTML</a>] pages as part of the "shopping experience" of the
      consumer.

   o  Using the Open Profiling Standard [<a href="#ref-OPS">OPS</a>] which has recently been
      proposed,

   The goal of the Payment Exchange is for a payment to be made from the
   Consumer to a Payment Handler or vice versa using a payment brand and
   payment protocol selected by the Consumer. A secondary goal is to
   optionally provide the Consumer with a digitally signed Payment
   Receipt which can be used to link the payment to the reason for the
   payment as described in the Offer Exchange.

   Payment Exchanges can work in a variety of ways. The most general
   case where the trade is dependent on the payment brand and protocol
   used is illustrated in the diagram below. Simpler payment exchanges
   are possible.

                          Figure 3 Payment Exchange

   A Payment Exchange uses the following Trading Components that are
   passed between the Consumer, the Merchant and the Payment Handler:

   o  The Brand List Component contains a list of payment brands (for
      example, MasterCard, Visa, Mondex, GeldKarte), payment protocols
      (for example SET Version 1.0, Secure Channel Credit Debit (SCCD -
      the name used for a credit or debit card payment where

      unauthorised access to account information is prevented through
      use of secure channel transport mechanisms such as SSL/TLS) as
      well as currencies/amounts that apply. The Merchant sends the
      Brand List to the Consumer. The consumer compares the payment
      brands, protocols and currencies/amounts on offer with those that
      the Consumer supports and makes a selection.

   o  The Brand Selection Component contains the Consumer's selection.
      Payment brand, protocol, currency/amount and possibly protocol-
      specific information is sent back to the Merchant. This
      information may be used to change information in the Offer
      Exchange. For example, a merchant could choose to offer a discount
      to encourage the use of a store card.

   o  the Status component is used to indicate to the Payment Handler
      that an earlier exchange (e.g., an Offer Exchange) has
      successfully completed and by the Payment Handler to indicate the
      completion status of the Payment Exchange.

   o  The Organisation Components are generated by the Merchant. They
      contain details of the Merchant and Payment Handler Roles:

      -  the Merchant role is required so that the Payment Handler can
         identify which Merchant initiated the payment. Typically, the
         result of the Payment Handler accepting (or making) a payment
         on behalf of the Merchant will be a credit or debit transaction
         to the Merchant's account held by the Payment Handler. These
         transactions are outside the scope of this version of IOTP

      -  the Payment Handler role is required so that the Payment
         Handler can check that it is the correct Payment Handler to be
         used for the payment

   o  The Payment Component contains details of how much to pay, the
      currency and the payment direction

   o  The "Offer Response" Signature Component, if present, digitally
      signs all of the above components to ensure their integrity. Note
      that the Brand List and Brand Selection Components are not signed
      until the payment information is created (step 4 in the diagram)

   o  the Trading Role Data component contains from other roles (e.g., a
      Merchant) that needs to be  forwarded to the Payment Handler

   o  The Payment Scheme Component contains messages from the payment
      protocol used in the Trade. For example they could be SET
      messages, Mondex messages, GeldKarte Messages or one of the other
      payment methods supported by IOTP. The content of the Payment

      Scheme Component is defined in the supplements that describe how
      IOTP works with various payment protocols.

   o  The Payment Receipt Component contains a record of the payment.
      The content depends upon the payment protocol used.

   o  The "Payment Receipt" Signature Component provides proof of
      payment by digitally signing both the Payment Receipt Component
      and the Offer Response Signature. The signature on the offer
      digitally signs the Order, Organisation and Delivery Components
      contained in the Offer.  This signature effectively binds the
      payment to the offer.

   The example of a Payment Exchange above is the most general case.
   Simpler cases are also possible. For example, if the amount paid is
   not dependent on the payment brand and protocol selected then the
   payment information generated by step 3 can be sent to the Consumer
   at the same time as the Brand List Component generated by step 1.
   These and other variations are described in the Baseline Purchase
   IOTP Transaction (see <a href="#section-9.1.8">section 9.1.8</a>).

   The goal of the Delivery Exchange is to cause purchased goods to be
   delivered to the consumer either online or via physical delivery. A
   second goal is to provide a "delivery note" to the consumer,
   providing details about the delivery, such as shipping tracking
   number. The result of the delivery may also be signed so that it can
   be used for customer care in the case of problems with physical
   delivery. The message flow is illustrated in the diagram below.

                    involved in the delivery and optionally sings it
                    and sends it to the Consumer

                         Figure 4 Delivery Exchange

A Delivery Exchange uses the following Trading Components that are
passed between the Consumer, the Merchant and the Delivery Handler:

   o  the Status component is used to indicate to the Delivery Handler
      that an earlier exchange (e.g., an Offer Exchange or Payment
      Exchange) has successfully completed and by the Delivery Handler
      to indicate the completion status of the Delivery Exchange.

   o  The Organisation Component(s) contain details of the Deliver To,
      Delivery Handler and Merchant Roles:

      -  the Deliver To role indicates where the goods or services are
         to be delivered to

      -  the Delivery Handler role is required so that the Delivery
         Handler can check that she is the correct Delivery Handler to
         do the delivery

      -  the Merchant role is required so that the Delivery Handler can
         identify which Merchant initiated the delivery

   o  The Order Component, contains information about the goods or
      services to be delivered

   o  The Delivery Component contains information about how delivery
      will occur, for example by post or using e-mail.

   o  The "Offer Response" Signature Component, if present, digitally
      signs all of the above components to ensure their integrity.

   o  The "Payment Receipt" Signature Component provides proof of
      payment by digitally signing the Payment Receipt Component and the
      Offer Signature. This is used by the Delivery Handler to check
      that delivery is authorised

   o  The Delivery Note Component contains customer care information
      related to a physical delivery, or alternatively the actual
      "electronic goods".  The Consumer's software does not interpret
      information about a physical delivery but should have the ability
      to display the information, both at the time of the delivery and
      later if the Consumer selects the Trade to which this delivery
      relates from a transaction list

   o  The "Delivery Response" Signature Component, if present, provides
      proof of the results of the Delivery by digitally signing the
      Delivery Note and any Offer Response or Payment Response
      signatures that the Delivery Handler received.

   The goal of the Authentication Exchange is to allow one Organisation,
   for example a financial institution, to be able to check that another
   Organisation, for example a consumer, is who they appear to be.

   An Authentication Exchange involves:

   o  an Authenticator - the Organisation which is requesting the
      authentication, and

   o  an Authenticatee - the Organisation being authenticated.

 1.          First Organisation, e.g., a Consumer, takes an action (for

             requires that the Organisation is authenticated

     1 --&gt; 2 Need for Authentication (outside scope of IOTP)

 2.          The second Organisation generates an Authentication
             Request - including challenge data, and a list of the
             algorithms that may be used for the authentication -
             and/or a request for the Organisation information then
             sends it to the first Organisation

 3.          The first Organisation optionally checks any signature
             associated with the Authentication Request then uses the
             specified authentication algorithm to generate an
             Authentication Response which is sent back to the second
             Organisation together with details of any Organisation
             information requested

             who they appear to be and the result recorded in a Status
             Component which is then sent back to the first
             Organisation.

 5.          The first Organisation then optionally checks the results
             indicated by the Status and any associated signature and
             takes the appropriate action or stops.

   An Authentication Exchange uses the following Trading Components that
   are passed between the two Organisations:

   o  the Authentication Request Component that requests an
      Authentication and indicates the authentication algorithm and
      optional challenge data to be used.

   o  A Trading Role Information Request Component that requests
      information about an Organisation, for example a ship to address.

   o  The Authentication Response Component which contains the challenge
      response generated by the recipient of the Authentication Request
      Component.

   o  Organisation Components that contain the result of the Trading
      Role Information Request

   o  the Status Component which contains the results of the second
      party's verification of the Authentication Response.

   This specification describes the IOTP Transactions which make up
   Baseline IOTP. As described in the preface, IOTP will evolve over
   time. This section defines the initial conformance criteria for
   implementations that claim to "support IOTP."

   The main determinant on the scope of an IOTP implementation is the
   roles which the solution is designed to support. The roles within
   IOTP are described in more detail in <a href="#section-2.1">section 2.1</a> Trading Roles. To
   summarise the roles are: Merchant, Consumer, Payment Handler,
   Delivery Handler and Customer Care Provider.

   Payment Handlers who can be of three types:

   o  those who accept a payment as part of a purchase or make a payment
      as part of a refund,

   o  those who accept value as part of a deposit transaction, or

   o  those that issue value a withdrawal transaction

   The following table defines, for each role, the IOTP Transactions and
   Trading Blocks which must be supported for that role.

      depends on one of the following conditions:

      -  if Baseline Authentication IOTP Transaction is supported;

      -  if required by a Payment Method as defined in its IOTP

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20Protocol%20Structure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. Protocol Structure</span>

   The previous section provided an introduction which explained:

   o  Trading Roles which are the different roles which Organisations
      can take in a trade: Consumer, Merchant, Payment Handler, Delivery
      Handler and Customer Care Provider, and

   o  Trading Exchanges where each Trading Exchange involves the
      exchange of data, between Trading Roles, in the form of a set of
      Trading Components.

   This section describes:

   o  how Trading Components are constructed into Trading Blocks and the
      IOTP Messages which are physically sent in the form of [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>]
      documents between the different Trading Roles,

   o  how IOTP Messages are exchanged between Trading Roles to create an
      IOTP Transaction

   o  the XML definitions of an IOTP Message including a Transaction
      Reference Block - an XML element which identifies an IOTP
      Transaction and the IOTP Message within it

   o  the definitions of the XML ID Attributes which are used to
      identify IOTP Messages, Trading Blocks and Trading Components and
      how these are referred to using Element References from other XML
      elements

   o  how extra XML Elements and new user defined values for existing
      IOTP codes can be used when Extending IOTP,

   o  how IOTP uses the Packaged Content Element to embed data such as
      payment protocol messages or detailed order definitions within an
      IOTP Message

   o  how IOTP Identifies Languages so that different languages can be
      used within IOTP Messages

   o  how IOTP handles both Secure and Insecure Net Locations when
      sending messages

   o  how an IOTP Transaction can be cancelled.

   The diagram also introduces the concept of a Transaction Reference
   Block.  This block contains, amongst other things, a globally unique
   identifier for the IOTP Transaction. Also each block and component is
   given an ID Attribute (see <a href="#section-3.4">section 3.4</a>) which is unique within an
   IOTP Transaction.  Therefore the combination of the ID attribute and

   the globally unique identifier in the Transaction Reference Block is
   sufficient to uniquely identify any Trading Block or Trading
   Component.

   A predefined set of IOTP Messages exchanged between the Trading Roles
   constitute an IOTP Transaction. This is illustrated in the diagram

   In the above diagram the Internet is shown as the transport
   mechanism.  This is not necessarily the case. IOTP Messages can be
   transported using a variety of transport mechanisms.

   The IOTP Transactions (see <a href="#section-9">section 9</a>) in this version of IOTP are
   specifically:

   o  Purchase. This supports a purchase involving an offer, a payment
      and optionally a delivery

   o  Refund. This supports the refund of a payment as a result of,
      typically, an earlier purchase

   o  Value Exchange. This involves two payments which result in the
      exchange of value from one combination of currency and payment
      method to another

   o  Authentication. This supports the remote authentication of one
      Trading Role by another Trading Role using a variety of
      authentication algorithms, and the provision of an Organisation
      Information about the Trading Role that is being authenticated for
      use in, for example, the creation of an offer

   o  Withdrawal. This supports the withdrawal of electronic cash from a
      financial institution

   o  Deposit. This supports the deposit of electronic cash at a
      financial institution

   o  Inquiry This supports inquiries on the status of an IOTP
      transaction which is either in progress or is complete

   o  Ping This supports a simple query which enables one IOTP aware
      application to determine whether another IOTP application running
      elsewhere is working or not.

   As described earlier, IOTP Messages are [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>] documents which are
   physically sent between the different Trading Roles that are taking
   part in a trade.

   The IOTP Message is the root element of the XML document. It
   therefore needs to be preceded by an appropriate XML Document Prolog.
   For example:

   &lt;?XML Version='1.0'?&gt;
   &lt;!DOCTYPE IotpMessage &gt;
   &lt;IotpMessage&gt;
    ...
   &lt;/IotpMessage&gt;

   A Transaction Reference Block contains information which identifies
   the IOTP Transaction and IOTP Message. The Transaction Reference
   Block contains:

   o  a Transaction Id Component which globally uniquely identifies the
      IOTP Transaction. The Transaction Id Components are the same
      across all IOTP messages that comprise a single IOTP transaction,

   o  a Message Id Component which provides control information about
      the IOTP Message as well as uniquely identifying the IOTP Message
      within an IOTP Transaction, and

   o  zero or more Related To Components which link this IOTP
      Transaction to either other IOTP Transactions or other events
      using the identifiers of those events.

   The definition of a Transaction Reference Block is as follows:

   &lt;!ELEMENT TransRefBlk (TransId, MsgId, RelatedTo*) &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST TransRefBlk
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED &gt;

   This contains information which globally uniquely identifies the IOTP
   Transaction. Its definition is as follows:

   &lt;!ELEMENT TransId EMPTY &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST TransId
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED
    Version            NMTOKEN #FIXED '1.0'

    TransTimeStamp     CDATA   #REQUIRED &gt;

   Attributes:

   ID                 An identifier which uniquely identifies the
                      Transaction Id Component within the IOTP
                      Transaction.

   Version            This identifies the version of IOTP, and therefore
                      the structure of the IOTP Messages, which the IOTP
                      Transaction is using.

   IotpTransId        Contains data which uniquely identifies the IOTP
                      Transaction. It must conform to the rules for
                      Message Ids in [<a href="rfc822.html">RFC 822</a>].

   IotpTransTyp       This is the type of IOTP Transaction being carried
                      out. For Baseline IOTP it identifies a "standard"
                      IOTP Transaction and implies the sequence and
                      content of the IOTP Messages exchanged between the
                      Trading Roles. The valid values for Baseline IOTP
                      are:
                       o BaselineAuthentication
                       o BaselineDeposit
                       o BaselinePurchase
                       o BaselineRefund
                       o BaselineWithdrawal
                       o BaselineValueExchange
                       o BaselineInquiry
                       o BaselinePing

                      Values of IotpTransType are managed under the
                      procedure described in <a href="#section-12">section 12</a> IANA
                      Considerations which also allows user defined
                      values of IotpTransType to be defined.

                      In later versions of IOTP, this list will be
                      extended to support different types of standard
                      IOTP Transaction. It is also likely to support the
                      type Dynamic which indicates that the sequence of
                      steps within the transaction are non-standard.

   TransTimeStamp     Where the system initiating the IOTP Transaction
                      has an internal clock, it is set to the time at
                      which the IOTP Transaction started in [<a href="#ref-UTC" title='"CCYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ+n"'>UTC</a>]
                      format.

                      The main purpose of this attribute is to provide
                      an alternative way of identifying a transaction by
                      specifying the time at which it started.

                      Some systems, for example, hand held devices may
                      not be able to generate a  time stamp. In this
                      case this attribute should contain the value "NA"
                      for Not Available.

   The Message Id Component provides control information about the IOTP
   Message as well as uniquely identifying the IOTP Message within an
   IOTP Transaction. Its definition is as follows.

                          IOTP Message within the IOTP Transaction (see
                          <a href="#section-3.4">section 3.4</a> ID Attributes). Note that if an
                          IOTP Message is resent then the value of this
                          attribute remains the same.

   RespIotpMsg            This contains the ID attribute of the Message
                          Id Component of the IOTP Message to which this
                          IOTP Message is a response. In this way all

   Attributes:

   ID                 An identifier which uniquely identifies the
                      Related To Component within the IOTP Transaction.

   xml:lang           Defines the language used by attributes or child
                      elements within this component, unless overridden
                      by an xml:lang attribute on a child element. See
                      <a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a> Identifying Languages.

   RelationshipType   Defines the type of the relationship. Valid values
                      are:

                       o IotpTransaction. in which case the Packaged

   Relation           The Relation attribute contains a phrase in the
                      language defined by xml:lang which describes the
                      nature of the relationship between the IOTP
                      transaction that contains this component and
                      another IOTP Transaction or other event. The exact
                      words to be used are left to the implementers of
                      the IOTP software.

                      The purpose of the attribute is to provide the
                      Trading Roles involved in an IOTP Transaction with
                      an explanation of the nature of the relationship
                      between the transactions.

                      Care should be taken that the words used to in the
                      Relation attribute indicate the "direction" of the
                      relationship correctly. For example: one
                      transaction might be a refund for another earlier
                      transaction. In this case the transaction which is
                      a refund should contain in the Relation attribute
                      words such as "refund for" rather than "refund to"
                      or just "refund".

   RelnKeyWords       This attribute contains keywords which could be
                      used to help identify similar relationships, for
                      example all refunds. It is anticipated that
                      recommended keywords will be developed through
                      examination of actual usage. In this version of
                      the specification there are no specific
                      recommendations and the keywords used are at the
                      discretion of implementers.

   Content:

   PackagedContent    The Packaged Content (see <a href="#section-3.7">section 3.7</a>) contains
                      data which identifies the related transaction. Its
                      format varies depending on the value of the
                      RelationshipType.

   IOTP Messages, Blocks (i.e. Transaction Reference Blocks and Trading
   Blocks), Trading Components (including the Transaction Id Component
   and the Signature Component) and some of their child elements are
   each given an XML "ID" attribute which is used to identify an
   instance of these XML elements. These identifiers are used so that
   one element can be referenced by another. All these attributes are
   given the attribute name ID.

   The values of each ID attribute are unique within an IOTP transaction
   i.e. the set of IOTP Messages which have the same globally unique
   Transaction ID Component. Also, once the ID attribute of an element
   has been assigned a value it is never changed. This means that
   whenever an element is copied, the value of the ID attribute remains
   the same.

   As a result it is possible to use these IDs to refer to and locate
   the content of any IOTP Message, Block or Component from any other
   IOTP Message, Block or Component in the same IOTP Transaction using
   Element References (see <a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a>).

   This section defines the rules for setting the values for the ID
   attributes of IOTP Messages, Blocks and Components.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.4.1%20IOTP%20Message%20ID%20Attribute%20Definition"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4.1" name="section-3.4.1">3.4.1</a> IOTP Message ID Attribute Definition</span>

   The ID attribute of the Message Id Component of an IOTP Message must
   be unique within an IOTP Transaction. It's definition is as follows:

   IotpMsgId_value  ::= IotpMsgIdPrefix IotpMsgIdSuffix
   IotpMsgIdPrefix  ::= NameChar (NameChar)*
   IotpMsgIdSuffix  ::= Digit (Digit)*

   IotpMsgIdPrefix    Apart from messages which contain: an Inquiry
                      Request Trading Block, an Inquiry Response Trading
                      Block, a Ping Request Trading Block or a Ping
                      Response Trading Block; then the same prefix is
                      used for all messages sent by the Merchant or
                      Consumer role as follows:

                       o "M" - Merchant
                       o "C" - Consumer

                      For messages which contain an Inquiry Request
                      Trading Block or a Ping Request Trading Block, the
                      prefix is set to "I" for Inquiry.

                      For messages which contain an Inquiry Response
                      Trading Block or a Ping Response Trading Block,
                      the prefix is set to "Q".

                      The prefix for the other roles in a trade is
                      contained within the Organisation Component for
                      the role and are typically set by the Merchant.
                      The following is recommended as a guideline and
                      must not be relied upon:

                       o "D" - Delivery Handler
                       o "C" - Deliver To

                      As a guideline, prefixes should be limited to one
                      character.

                      NameChar has the same definition as the [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>]
                      definition of NameChar.

   IotpMsgIdSuffix    The suffix consists of one or more digits. The
                      suffix must be unique within a Trading Role within
                      an IOTP Transaction. The following is recommended
                      as a guideline and must not be relied upon:

                       o the first IOTP Message sent by a trading role
                         is given the suffix "1"
                       o the second and subsequent IOTP Messages sent
                         by the same trading role are incremented by one
                         for each message
                       o no leading zeroes are included in the suffix

                      Put more simply the Message Id Component of the
                      first IOTP Message sent by a Consumer would have
                      an ID attribute of, "C1", the second "C2", the
                      third "C3" etc.

                      Digit has the same definition as the [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>]

   The ID Attribute of Blocks and Components must also be unique within
   an IOTP Transaction. Their definition is as follows:

   BlkOrCompId_value ::= IotpMsgId_value "." IdSuffix
   IdSuffix ::= Digit (Digit)*

   IotpMsgId_value    The ID attribute of the Message ID Component of
                      the IOTP Message where the Block or Component is
                      first used.

                      In IOTP, Trading Components and Trading Blocks are
                      copied from one IOTP Message to another. The ID
                      attribute does not change when an existing Trading
                      Block or Component is copied to another IOTP
                      Message.

   A Trading Component or one of its child XML elements, may contain an
   XML attribute that refers to another Block (i.e. a Transaction
   Reference Block or a Trading Block) or Trading Component (including a
   Transaction Id and Signature Component). These Element References are
   used for many purposes, a few examples include:

   o  identifying an XML element whose Digest is included in a Signature
      Component,

   o  referring to the Payment Handler Organisation Component which is
      used when making a Payment

   An Element Reference always contains the value of an ID attribute of
   a Block or Component.

   Identifying the IOTP Message, Trading Block or Trading Component
   which is referred to by an Element Reference, involves finding the
   XML element which:

   o  belongs to the same IOTP Transaction (i.e. the Transaction Id
      Components of the IOTP Messages match), and

   o  where the value of the ID attribute of the element matches the
      value of the Element Reference.

   Note: The term "match" in this specification has the same definition
   as the [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>] definition of match.

   An example of "matching" an Element Reference is illustrated in the
   example below.

   Note: Element Reference attributes are defined as "NMTOKEN" rather
   than "IDREF" (see [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>]). This is because an IDREF requires that the
   XML element referred to is in the same XML Document.  With IOTP this
   is not necessarily the case.

   Baseline IOTP defines a minimum protocol which systems supporting
   IOTP must be able to accept. As new versions of IOTP are developed,
   additional types of IOTP Transactions will be defined. In addition to
   this, Baseline and future versions of IOTP will support user
   extensions to IOTP through two mechanisms:

   o  extra XML elements, and

   o  new values for existing IOTP codes.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.6.1%20Extra%20XML%20Elements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6.1" name="section-3.6.1">3.6.1</a> Extra XML Elements</span>

   The XML element and attribute names used within IOTP constitute an
   [XML Namespace] as identified by the xmlns attribute on the
   IotpMessage element. This allows IOTP to support the inclusion of
   additional XML elements within IOTP messages through the use of [XML
   Namespaces].

   Using XML Namespaces, extra XML elements may be included at any level
   within an IOTP message including:

   o  new Trading Blocks

   o  new Trading Components

   o  new XML elements within a Trading Component.

   The following rules apply:

   o  any new XML element must be declared according to the rules for
      [XML Namespaces]

   o  new XML elements which are either Trading Blocks or Trading
      Components must contain an ID attributes with an attribute name of
      ID.

   In order to make sure that extra XML elements can be processed
   properly, IOTP reserves the use of a special attribute,
   IOTP:Critical, which takes the values True or False and may appear in
   extra elements added to an IOTP message.

   The purpose of this attribute is to allow an IOTP aware application
   to determine if the IOTP transaction can safely continue.
   Specifically:

   o  if an extra XML element has an "IOTP:Critical" attribute with a
      value of "True" and an IOTP aware application does not know how to
      process the element and its child elements, then the IOTP
      transaction has a Technical Error (see <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>) and must fail.

   o  if an extra XML element has an "IOTP:Critical" attribute with a
      value of "False" then the IOTP transaction may continue if the
      IOTP aware application does not know how to process it. In this
      case:

      -  any extra XML elements contained within an XML element defined
         within the IOTP namespace, must be included with that element
         whenever the IOTP XML element is used or copied by IOTP

      -  the content of the extra element must be ignored except that it
         must be included when it is used in the creation of a digest as
         part of the generation of a signature

   o  if an extra XML element has no "IOTP:Critical" attribute then it
      must be treated as if it had an "IOTP:Critical" attribute with a
      value of "True"

   o  if an XML element contains an "IOTP:Critical" attribute, then the
      value of that attribute is assumed to apply to all the child
      elements within that element

   In order to ensure that documents containing "IOTP:Critical" are
   valid, it is declared as part of the DTD for the extra element as:

   IOTP:Critical     (True | False ) 'True'

   If IOTP is to be extended using Opaque Embedded Data then a Packaged
   Content Element (see <a href="#section-3.7">section 3.7</a>) should be used to encapsulate the
   data.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.7%20Packaged%20Content%20Element"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7" name="section-3.7">3.7</a> Packaged Content Element</span>

   The Packaged Content element supports the concept of an embedded data
   stream, transformed to both protect it against misinterpretation by
   transporting systems and to ensure XML compatibility. Examples of its
   use in IOTP include:

   o  to encapsulate payment scheme messages, such as SET messages,

   o  to encapsulate a description of an order, a payment note, or a
      delivery note.

   In general it is used to encapsulate one or more data streams.

   This data stream has three standardised attributes that allow for
   identification, decoding and interpretation of the contents. Its
   definition is as follows.

                      same point in IOTP. For example:

                          &lt;PackagedContent Name='FirstPiece'&gt;

                        &lt;/ABCD&gt;

                      The name attribute may be omitted, for example if
                      there is only one Packaged Content element.

   Content            This identifies what type of data is contained
                      within the Content of the Packaged Content
                      Element. The valid values for the Content
                      attribute are as follows:
                       o PCDATA. The content of the Packaged Content
                         Element can be treated as PCDATA with no
                         further processing.
                       o MIME. The content of the Packaged Content
                         Element is a complete MIME item. Processing
                         should include looking for MIME headers inside
                         the Packaged Content Element.
                       o MIME:mimetype. The content of the Packaged
                         Content Element is MIME content, with the
                         following header "Content-Type: mimetype".
                         Although it is possible to have MIME:mimetype
                         with the Transform attribute set to NONE, it is
                         far more likely to have Transform attribute set
                         to BASE64. Note that if Transform is NONE is
                         used, then the entire content must still
                         conform to PCDATA. Some characters will need to
                         be encoded either as the XML default entities,
                         or as numeric character entities.

                       o XML. The content of the Packaged Content
                         Element can be treated as an XML document.
                         Entities and CDATA sections, or Transform set
                         to BASE64, must be used to ensure that the
                         Packaged Content Element contents are
                         legitimate PCDATA.

                      Values of the Content attribute are controlled
                      under the procedures defined in <a href="#section-12">section 12</a> IANA
                      Considerations which also allows user defined
                      values to be defined.

   Transform          This identifies the transformation that has been
                      done to the data before it was placed in the
                      content. Valid values are:

                       o NONE. The PCDATA content of the Packaged
                         Content Element is the correct representation
                         of the data. Note that entity expansion must
                         occur first (i.e. replacement of &amp;amp; and
                         &amp;#9;) before the data is examined. CDATA
                         sections may legitimately occur in a Packaged
                         Content Element where the Transform attribute
                         is set to NONE.
                       o BASE64. The PCDATA content of the Packaged
                         Content Element represents a BASE64 encoding of
                         the actual content.

   Content:

   PCDATA             This is the actual data which has been embedded.
                      The format of the data and rules on how to decode
                      it are contained in the Content and the Transform
                      attributes

   Note that any special details, especially custom attributes, must be
   represented at a higher level.

   The packaged content may contain HTML. In this case the following
   conventions are followed:

   o  references to any documents, images or other things, such as
      sounds or web pages, which can affect the recipient's
      understanding of the data which is being packaged must refer to
      other Packaged Elements contained within the same parent element,
      e.g., an Order Description

   o  if more than one Packaged Content element is included within a
      parent element in order to meet the previous requirement, then the
      Name attribute of the top level Packaged Content from which
      references to all other Packaged Elements can be determined,
      should have a value of Main

   o  relative references to other documents, images, etc. from one
      Packaged Content element to another are realised by setting the
      value of the relative reference to the Name attribute of another
      Packaged Content element at the same level and within the same
      parent element

   o  no external references that require the reference to be resolved
      immediately should be used. As this could make the HTML difficult
      or impossible to display completely

   o  [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Five: Conformance Criteria and Examples"'>MIME</a>] is used to encapsulate the data inside each Packaged
      Element.  This means that the information in the MIME header used
      to identify the type of data which has been encapsulated and
      therefore how it should be displayed.

   If the above conventions are not followed by, for example, including
   external references which must be resolved, then the recipient of the
   HTML should be informed.

   Note: As an implementation guideline the values of the Name
   Attributes allocated to Packaged Content elements should make it
   possible to extract each Packaged Content into a directory and then
   display the HTML directly

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.7.2%20Packaging%20XML"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7.2" name="section-3.7.2">3.7.2</a> Packaging XML</span>

   Support for XML is recommended. When XML needs to be displayed, for
   example to display the content of an Order Description to a Consumer,
   then implementers should follow the latest recommendations of the
   World Wide Web Consortium.

   Note: At the time of writing this specification, standards are under
   development that specify XML style sheets that show how XML documents
   should be displayed. See:

   o "Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Specification" at
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xsl">http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xsl</a>, and

   o "Associating stylesheets with XML documents" at
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet">http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet</a>.

   Once these standards become W3C "Recommendations", then it is
   anticipated that this specification will be amended if practical.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.8%20Identifying%20Languages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.8" name="section-3.8">3.8</a> Identifying Languages</span>

   IOTP uses [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>] Language Identification to specify which languages
   are used within the content and attributes of IOTP Messages.

   The following principles have been used in order to determine which
   XML elements contain an xml:lang Attributes:

   o  a mandatory xml:lang attribute is contained on every Trading
      Component which contains attributes or content which may need to
      be displayed or printed in a particular language

   o  an optional xml:lang attribute is included on child elements of
      these Trading Components. In this case the value of xml:lang, if
      present, overrides the value for the Trading Component.

   xml:lang attributes which follow these principles are included in the
   Trading Components and their child XML elements defined in <a href="#section-7">section 7</a>.

   A sender of a message, typically a Consumer can indicate a preference
   for a language, and a character set by specifying a list of preferred
   languages/character sets in a Message Id Component (see <a href="#section-3.3.2">section</a>
   <a href="#section-3.3.2">3.3.2</a>).  Note that there is no obligation on the receiver of such a
   message to respond using one of the listed languages/character sets
   as they may not have the technology to be able to do it. It also
   means that the ability to handle these lists is not a requirement for
   conformance to this specification. However the ability to respond,
   for example using one of the stated languages/character sets is
   likely to provide a better user experience.

   IOTP contains several "Net Locations" which identify places where,
   typically, IOTP Messages may be sent. Net Locations come in two
   types:

   o  "Secure" Net Locations which are net locations where privacy of
      data is secured using, for example, encryption methods such as
      [SSL/TLS], and

   o  "Insecure" Net Locations where privacy of data is not assured.

   Note that either a Secure Net Location or an Insecure Net Location or
   both must be present.

   If only one of the two Net Locations is present, then the one present
   must be used.

   Where both types of net location are present then either may be used
   depending on the preference of the sender of the message.

   Any Trading Role involved in an IOTP transaction may cancel that
   transaction at any time.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.10.1%20Cancelling%20Transactions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.10.1" name="section-3.10.1">3.10.1</a> Cancelling Transactions</span>

   IOTP Transactions are cancelled by sending an IOTP message containing
   just a Cancel Block with an appropriate Status Component to the other
   Trading Role involved in the Trading Exchange.

   Note: The Cancel Block can be sent asynchronously of any other IOTP
   Message. Specifically it can be sent either before sending or after
   receiving an IOTP Message from the other Trading Role

   If an IOTP Transaction is cancelled during a Trading Exchange (i.e.
   the interval between sending a "request" block and receiving the
   matching "response" block) then the Cancel Block is sent to the same
   location as the next IOTP Message in the Trading Exchange would have
   been sent.

   If a Consumer cancels a transaction after a Trading Exchange has
   completed (i.e. the "response" block for the Trading Exchange has
   been received), but before the IOTP Transaction has finished then the
   Consumer sends a Cancel Block with an appropriate Status Component to
   the net location identified by the SenderNetLocn or
   SecureSenderNetLocn contained in the Protocol Options Component (see
   <a href="#section-7.1">section 7.1</a>) contained in the TPO Block (see <a href="#section-8.1">section 8.1</a>) for the
   transaction. This is normally the Merchant Trading Role.

   A Consumer should not send a Cancel Block after the IOTP Transaction
   has completed. Cancelling a complete transaction should be treated as
   a technical error.

   After cancelling the IOTP Transaction, the Consumer should go to the
   net location specified by the CancelNetLocn attribute contained in
   the Trading Role Element for the Organisation that was sent the
   Cancel Block.

   A non-Consumer Trading Role should only cancel a transaction:

   o after a request block has been received and

   o before the response block has been sent

   If a non-Consumer Trading Role cancels a transaction at any other
   time it should be treated by the recipient as an error.

   If a Cancel Block is received by a Consumer at a point in the IOTP
   Transaction when cancellation is allowed, then the Consumer should
   stop the transaction.

   If a Cancel Block is received by a non-Consumer role, then the
   Trading Role should anticipate that the Consumer may go to the
   location specified by the CancelNetLocn attribute contained in the
   Trading Role Element for the Trading Role.

   IOTP is designed as a request/response protocol where each message is
   composed of a number of Trading Blocks which contain a number of
   Trading Components. There are several interrelated considerations in
   handling errors, re-transmissions, duplicates, and the like. These
   factors mean IOTP aware applications must manage message flows more
   complex than the simple request/response model. Also a wide variety
   of errors can occur in messages as well as at the transport level or
   in Trading Blocks or Components.

   This section describes at a high level how IOTP handles errors,
   retries and idempotency. It covers:

   o  the different types of errors which can occur. This is divided
      into:

      -  "technical errors" which are independent of the purpose of the
         IOTP Message,

      -  "business errors" which indicate that there is a problem
         specific to the process (e.g., payment or delivery) which is
         being carried out, and

   o  the depth of the error which indicates whether the error is at the
      transport, message or block/component level

   o  how the different trading roles should handle the different types
      of messages which they may receive.

   Technical Errors are those which are independent of the meaning of
   the message. This means, they can affect any attempt at IOTP
   communication.  Typically they are handled in a standard fashion with
   a limited number of standard options for the user. Specifically these
   are:

   o retrying the transmission, or

   o cancelling the transaction.

   When communications are operating sufficiently well, a technical
   error is indicated by an Error Component (see <a href="#section-7.21">section 7.21</a>) in an
   Error Block (see <a href="#section-8.17">section 8.17</a>) sent by the party which detected the
   error in an IOTP message to the party which sent the erroneous
   message.

   If communications are too poor, a message which was sent may not
   reach its destination. In this case a time-out might occur.

   The Error Codes associated with Technical Errors are recorded in the
   Error Component which lists all the different technical errors which
   can be set.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2%20Business%20Errors"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a> Business Errors</span>

   Business Errors may occur when the IOTP messages are "technically"
   correct. They are connected with a particular process, for example,
   an offer, payment, delivery or authentication, where each process has
   a different set of possible business errors.

   For example, "Insufficient funds" is a reasonable payment error but
   makes no sense for a delivery while "Back ordered" is a reasonable
   delivery error but not meaningful for a payment. Business errors are
   indicated in the Status Component (see <a href="#section-7.16">section 7.16</a>) of a "response
   block" of the appropriate type, for example a Payment Response Block
   or a Delivery Response Block. This allows whatever additional
   response related information is needed to accompany the error
   indication.

   Business errors must usually be presented to the user so that they
   can decide what to do next. For example, if the error is insufficient
   funds in a Brand Independent Offer (see <a href="#section-9.1.2.2">section 9.1.2.2</a>), the user
   might wish to choose a different payment instrument/account of the
   same brand or a different brand or payment system. Alternatively, if

   the IOTP based implementation allows it and it makes sense for that
   instrument, the user might want to put more funds into the
   instrument/account and try again.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3%20Error%20Depth"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a> Error Depth</span>

   The three levels at which IOTP errors can occur are the transport
   level, the message level, and the block level. Each is described
   below.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.1%20Transport%20Level"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.1" name="section-4.3.1">4.3.1</a> Transport Level</span>

   This level of error indicates a fundamental problem in the transport
   mechanism over which the IOTP communication is taking place.

   All transport level errors are technical errors and are indicated by
   either an explicit transport level error indication, such as a "No
   route to destination" error from TCP/IP, or by a time out where no
   response has been received to a request.

   The only reasonable automatic action when faced with transport level
   errors is to retry and, after some number of automatic retries, to
   inform the user.

   The explicit error indications that can be received are transport
   dependent and the documentation for the appropriate IOTP Transport
   supplement should be consulted for errors and appropriate actions.

   Appropriate time outs to use are a function of both the transport
   being used and of the payment system if the request encapsulates
   payment information. The transport and payment system specific
   documentation should be consulted for time out and automatic retry
   parameters.  Frequently there is no way to directly inform the other
   party of transport level errors but they should generally be logged
   and if automatic recovery is unsuccessful and there is a human user,
   the user should be informed.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.2%20Message%20Level"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.2" name="section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a> Message Level</span>

   This level of error indicates a fundamental technical problem with an
   entire IOTP message. For example, the XML is not "Well Formed", or
   the message is too large for the receiver to handle or there are
   errors in the Transaction Reference Block (see <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a>) so it is
   not possible to figure out what transaction the message relates to.

   All message level errors are technical errors and are indicated by
   Error Components (see <a href="#section-7.21">section 7.21</a>) sent to the other party. The
   Error Component includes a Severity attribute which indicates whether

   the error is a Warning and may be ignored, a TransientError which
   indicates that a retry may resolve the problem or a HardError in
   which case the transaction must fail.

   The Technical Errors (see <a href="#section-7.21.2">section 7.21.2</a> Error Codes) that are
   Message Level errors are:

   o  XML not well formed. The document is not well formed XML (see
      [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>])

   o  XML not valid. The document is not valid XML (see [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>])

   o  block level technical errors (see <a href="#section-4.3.3">section 4.3.3</a>) on the
      Transaction Reference Block (see <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a>) and the Signature
      Block only. Checks on these blocks should only be carried out if
      the XML is valid

   Note that checks on the Signature Block include checking, where
   possible, that each Signature Component is correctly calculated. If
   the Signature is incorrectly calculated then the data that should
   have been covered by the signature can not be trusted and must be
   treated as erroneous. A description of how to check a signature is
   correctly calculated is contained in <a href="#section-6.2">section 6.2</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.3%20Block%20Level"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.3" name="section-4.3.3">4.3.3</a> Block Level</span>

   A Block level error indicates a problem with a block or one of its
   components in an IOTP message (apart from Transaction Reference or
   Signature Blocks). The message has been transported properly, the
   overall message structure and the block/component(s) including the
   Transaction Reference and Signature Blocks are meaningful but there
   is some error related to one of the other blocks.

   Block level errors can be either:

   o  technical errors, or

   o  business errors

   Technical Errors are further divided into:

   o  Block Level Attribute and Element Checks, and

   o  Block and Component Consistency Checks

   o  Transient Technical Errors

   If a technical error occurs related to a block or component, then an
   Error Component is generated for return.

   Block Level Attribute and Element Checks occur only within the same
   block. Checks which involve cross-checking against other blocks are
   covered by Block and Component Consistency Checks.

   The Block Level Attribute &amp; Element checks are:

   o  checking that each attribute value within each element in a block
      conforms to any rules contained within this IOTP specification

   o  checking that the content of each element conforms to any rules
      contained within this IOTP specification

   o  if the previous checks are OK, then checking the consistency of
      attribute values and element content against other attribute
      values or element content within any other components in the same
      block.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.3.2%20Block%20and%20Component%20Consistency%20Checks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.3.2" name="section-4.3.3.2">4.3.3.2</a> Block and Component Consistency Checks</span>

   Block and Component Consistency Checks consist of:

   o  checking that the combination of blocks and/or components present
      in the IOTP Message are consistent with the rules contained within
      this IOTP specification

   o  checking for consistency between attributes and element content
      within the blocks within the same IOTP message.

   o  checking for consistency between attributes and elements in blocks
      in this IOTP message and blocks received in earlier IOTP messages
      for the same IOTP transaction

   If the block passes the "Block Level Attribute and Element Checks"
   and the "Block and Component Consistency Checks" then it is processed
   either by the IOTP Aware application or perhaps by some "back-end"
   system such as a payment server.

   Severity Attribute set to TransientError and the MinRetrySecs
   attribute set to some value suitable for the Transport Mechanism

   Note that transient technical errors can be generated by any of the
   Trading Roles involved in transaction.

   If a business error occurs in a process such as a Payment or a
   Delivery, then the appropriate type of response block is returned
   containing a Status Component (see <a href="#section-7.16">section 7.16</a>) with the
   ProcessState attribute set to Failed and the CompletionCode
   indicating the nature of the problem.

   Some business errors may be "transient" in that the Consumer role may
   be able to recover and complete the transaction in some other way.
   For example if the Credit Card that a consumer provided had
   insufficient funds for a purchase, then the Consumer may recover by
   using a different credit card.

   Recovery from "transient" business errors is dependent on the
   CompletionCode. See the definition of the Status Component for what
   is possible.

   Note that no Error Component or Error Block is generated for business
   errors.

   IOTP messages are actually a combination of blocks and components as
   described in 3.1.1 IOTP Message Structure. Especially in future
   extensions of IOTP, a rich variety of combinations of such blocks and
   components can occur. It is important that the multiple
   transmission/receipt of the "same" request for an action that will
   change state does not result in that action occurring more than once.
   This is called idempotency. For example, a customer paying for an
   order would want to pay the full amount only once. Most network
   transport mechanisms have some probability of delivering a message
   more than once or not at all, perhaps requiring retransmission. On
   the other hand, a request for status can reasonably be repeated and
   should be processed fresh each time it is received.

   Correct implementation of IOTP can be modelled by a particular
   processing order as detailed below. Any other method that is
   indistinguishable in the messages sent between the parties is equally
   acceptable.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.5%20Server%20Role%20Processing%20Sequence"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" name="section-4.5">4.5</a> Server Role Processing Sequence</span>

   "Server roles" are any Trading Role which is not the Consumer role.
   They are "Server roles" since they typically receive a request which
   they must service and then produce a response. However server roles
   can also initiate transactions. More specifically Server Roles must
   be able to:

   o  Initiate a transaction (see <a href="#section-4.5.1">section 4.5.1</a>). These are divided
      into:

      -  payment related transactions and

      -  infrastructure transactions

   o  Accept and process a message received from another role (see
      <a href="#section-4.5.2">section 4.5.2</a>). This includes:

      -  identifying if the message belongs to a transaction that has
         been received before

      -  handling duplicate messages

      -  generating Transient errors if the servers that process the
         input message are too busy to handle it

      -  processing the message if it is error free, authorised and, if
         appropriate, producing a response to send back to the other
         role

   o  Cancel a current transaction if requested (see <a href="#section-4.5.3">section 4.5.3</a>)

   o  Re-transmit messages if a response was expected but has not been
      received in a reasonable time (see <a href="#section-4.5.4">section 4.5.4</a>).

   Server Roles may initiate a variety of different types of
   transaction.  Specifically:

   Processing input messages involves the following:

   o  checking the structure and identity of the message

   o  checking for and handling duplicate messages

   o  processing non-duplicate original messages which includes:

      -  checking for errors, then if no errors are found

      -  processing the message to produce an output message if
         appropriate

   Each of these is discussed in more detail below.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.5.2.1%20Checking%20Structure%20and%20Message%20Identity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5.2.1" name="section-4.5.2.1">4.5.2.1</a> Checking Structure and Message Identity</span>

   It is critical to check that the message is "well formed" XML and
   that the transaction identifier (IotpTransId attribute on the TransId
   Component) within the IOTP message can be successfully identified
   since an IotpTransId will be needed to generate a response.

   If the input message is not well formed then generate an Error
   Component with a Severity of HardError and ErrorCode of
   XmlNotWellFrmd.

   If the message is well formed but the IotpTransId cannot be
   identified then generate an ErrorComponent with:

   o  a Severity of HardError and an ErrorCode of AttMissing,

   o  a PackagedContent containing "IotpTransId" - the missing
      attribute.

   Insert the Error Component inside an Error Block with a new
   TransactionId component with a new IotpTransId and return it to the
   sender of the original message.

   If the input message can be identified as potentially a valid input
   message then check to see if an "identical" input message has been
   received before. Identical means that all blocks, components,
   elements, attribute values and element content in the input message
   are the same.

   Note: The recommended way of checking for identical messages is to
   check for equal values of their [<a href="#ref-DOM-HASH" title='"Digest Values for DOM (DOMHASH)"'>DOM-HASH</a>]

   If an identical message has been received before then check to see if
   the processing of the previous message has completed.

   If processing has not completed then generate an Error Component with
   a Severity of Transient Error and an Error Code of MsgBeingProc to
   indicate the message is being processed and send it back to the
   sender of the Input Message requesting that the original message be
   resent after an appropriate period of time.

   Otherwise, if processing has completed and resulted in an output
   message then retrieve the last message that was sent and send it
   again.

   If the message is not a duplicate then it should be processed.

   Once it's been established that the message is not a duplicate, then
   it can be processed. This involves:

   o  checking that a server is available to handle the message,
      generating a Transient Error if it is not

   o  checking the Transaction is Not Already in error or cancelled

   o  validating the input message. This includes:

      -  checking for message level errors

      -  checking for block level errors

      -  checking any encapsulated data

   o  checking for errors in the sequence that blocks have been received

   o  generating error components for any errors that result

   o  if neither hard errors nor transient errors result, then
      processing the message and generating an output message, if
      required, for return to the sender of the Input Message

   Note: This approach to handling of duplicate input messages means, if
   absolutely "identical" messages are received then absolutely
   "identical" messages are returned. This also applies to Inquiry and
   Ping transactions when in reality the state of a transaction or the
   processing ability of the servers may have changed. If up-to-date
   status of transactions or servers is required, then an IOTP
   transaction with a new value for the ID attribute of the MsgId
   component must be used.

   Each of the above steps is discussed below.

   CHECKING A SERVER IS AVAILABLE

   The process that is handling the input message should check that the
   rest of the system is not so busy that a response in a reasonable
   time cannot be produced.

   If the server is too busy, then it should generate an Error Component
   with a Severity of Transient Error and an Error Code of SystemBusy
   and send it back to the sender of the Input Message requesting that
   the original message be resent after an appropriate period of time.

   Note: Some servers may occasionally become very busy due to
   unexpected increases in workload. This approach allows short peaks in
   workloads to be handled by delaying the input of messages by asking
   the sender of the message to resubmit later.

   CHECKING THE TRANSACTION IS NOT ALREADY IN ERROR OR CANCELLED

   Check that:

   o  previous messages received or sent did not contain or result in
      Hard Errors, and

   o  the Transaction has not been cancelled by either the Consumer or
      the Server Trading Role





<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                     [Page 65]</span></pre>

   If it has then, ignore the message. A transaction with hard errors or
   that has been cancelled, cannot be restarted.

   CHECK FOR MESSAGE AND BLOCK LEVEL ERRORS

   If the transaction is still OK then check for message level errors.
   This involves:

   o  checking the XML is valid

   o  checking that the elements, attributes and content of the
      Transaction Reference Block are without error and conform to this
      specification

   o  checking the digital signature which involves:

      -  checking that the Signature value is correctly calculated, and

      -  the hash values in the digests are correctly calculated where
         the source of the hash value is available.

   Checking for block level errors involves:

   o  checking within each block (apart from the Transaction Reference
      Block) that:

      -  the attributes, elements and element contents are valid

      -  the values of the attributes, elements and element contents are
         consistent within the block

   o  checking that the combination of blocks are valid

   o  checking that the values of the attribute, elements and element
      contents are consistent between the blocks in the input message
      and blocks in earlier messages either sent or received. This
      includes checking that the presence of a block is valid for a
      particular transaction type

   If the message contains any encapsulated data, then if possible check
   the encapsulated data for errors using additional software to check
   the data where appropriate.

   check for errors in Block sequence, the phrase "refers to an IOTP

   the Trans Ref Block contains an IotpTransId that refers to". So, for
   example, " If an Error or Cancel Block refers to an IOTP transaction
   that is not recognised then ..."  should be interpreted as " If an
   Error or Cancel Block is contained in an IOTP Message where the Trans
   Ref Block contains an IotpTransId that refers to an IOTP transaction
   that is not recognised then ...

   Errors in the sequence that blocks arrive depends on the block.
   Blocks where checking for sequence is required are:

   o  Error and Cancel Blocks. If an Error or Cancel Block refers to an
      IOTP transaction that is not recognised then it is a Hard Error.
      Do not return an error if Error or Cancel Blocks have been
      received for the IOTP Transaction before to avoid looping.

   o  Inquiry Request and Response Blocks. If an Inquiry Request or an
      Inquiry Response Block refers to an IOTP transaction that is not
      recognised then it is a Hard Error

   o  Authentication Request Block. If an Authentication Request Block
      refers to an IOTP transaction that is recognised it is a Hard
      Error

   o  Authentication Response Block. Check as follows:

      -  if an Authentication Response Block does not refer to an IOTP
         transaction that is recognised it is a Hard Error, otherwise

      -  if the Authentication Response Block doesn't refer to an
         Authentication Request that had been previously sent then it is
         a Hard Error, otherwise

      -  if an Authentication Response for the same IOTP transaction has
         been received before and the Authentication was successful then
         it is a Hard Error.

   o  Authentication Status Block. Check as follows:

      -  if an Authentication Status Block does not refer to an IOTP

      -  if the Authentication Status Block doesn't refer to an

   o  TPO Selection Block (Merchant only). Check as follows:

      -  if the TPO Selection Block doesn't refer to an IOTP Transaction
         that is recognised then it is a Hard Error, otherwise

      -  if the TPO Selection Block refers to an IOTP Transaction where
         a TPO Block and Offer Response (in one message) had previously
         been sent then it is a Hard Error, otherwise

      -  if the TPO Selection Block does not refer to an IOTP

         Response) had previously been sent then it is a Hard Error,
         otherwise

      -  if a TPO Selection Block for the same TPO Block has been
         received before then it is a Hard Error

   o  Payment Request Block (Payment Handler only). Check as follows:

      -  if the Payment Request Block refers to an IOTP Transaction that
         is not recognised then its OK, otherwise

      -  if the Payment Request Block refers to IOTP Transaction that
         was not for a Payment then it is a Hard Error, otherwise

      -  if there was a previous payment that failed with a non-
         recoverable Completion Code then it is a Hard Error, otherwise

      -  if a previous payment is still in progress then it is a Hard
         Error

   o Payment Exchange Block (Payment Handler only). Check as follows:

   If any Error Components have been generated then collect them into an
   Error Block for sending to the sender of the Input message. Note that
   Error Blocks should be sent back to the sender of the message and to
   the ErrorLogNetLocn for the Trading Role of the sender if one is
   specified.

   Note: The above checking on the sequence of Authentication Responses
   and Payment Requests supports the Consumer re-submitting a repeat
   action request since the previous one failed, for example:

   o  because they did not know the correct response (e.g., a password)
      on an authentication or,

   o  they were unable to pay as there were insufficient funds on a
      credit card

   PROCESS THE ERROR FREE INPUT MESSAGE

   If the input message passes the previous checks then it can be
   processed to produce an output message if required. Note that:

   o  Inquiry Requests on Ping Transactions should be ignored

   o  if the Input message contains an Error Block with a Transient
      Error then wait for the required time then resend the previous
      message, if a response to the earlier message has not been
      received

   o  if the input message contains a Error Component with a  HardError
      or a Cancel Block then stop all further processing of the
      transaction. This includes suppressing the sending of any messages
      currently being generated or responding to any new non-duplicate
      messages that are received

   o  processing of encapsulated messages (e.g., Payment Protocol
      Messages) may result in additional transient errors

   o  a digital signature can only safely be generated once all the
      blocks and components have been generated and it is known which
      elements in the message need to be signed.

   If an output message is generated then it should be saved so that it
   can be resent as required if an identical input message is received
   again.  Note that output messages that contain transient errors are
   not saved so that they can be processed afresh when the input message
   is received again.

   This process is used to cancel a transaction running on an IOTP
   server.  It is initiated by some other process as a result of an
   external request from another system or server that is being run by
   the same Trading Role.  The processing required is as follows:

   o  if the IotpTransId of the transaction to be cancelled is not
      recognised, or complete then fail the request, otherwise

   o  if the IotpTransId refers to a Ping Transaction then fail the
      request, otherwise

   o  determine which Document Exchange to cancel and generate a Cancel
      Block and send it to the other party

   Note: Cancelling a transaction on an IOTP server typically arises for
   a business reason. For example a merchant may have attempted
   authentication several times without success and as a result decides
   to cancel the transaction. Therefore the process that decides to take
   this action needs to send a message from the process/server that made
   the business decision to the IOTP server with the instruction that
   the IOTP transaction should be cancelled.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.5.4%20Retransmitting%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5.4" name="section-4.5.4">4.5.4</a> Retransmitting Messages</span>

   The server should periodically check for transactions where a message
   is expected in return but none has been received after a time that is
   dependent on factors such as:

   o  the Transport Mechanism being used;

   o  the time required to process encapsulated messages (e.g., Payment
      messages) and

   o  whether or not human input is required.

   If no message has been received the original message should be
   resent.  This should occur up to a maximum number of times dependent
   on the reliability of the Transport Mechanism being used.

   If no response is received after the required time then the
   Transaction should be "timed out". In this case, set the process
   state of the transaction to Failed, and a completion code of either:

   o  TimedOutRcvr if the transaction can potentially recovered later,
      or

   The "Client role" in IOTP is the Consumer Trading Role.

   Note: A company or Organisation that is a Merchant, for example, may
   take on the Trading Role of a Consumer when making purchases or
   downloading or withdrawing electronic cash.

   More specifically the Consumer Role must be able to:

   o  Initiate a transaction (see <a href="#section-4.6.1">section 4.6.1</a>). These are divided
      into:

      -  payment related transactions and

      -  infrastructure transactions

   o  Accept and process a message received from another role (see
      <a href="#section-4.6.2">section 4.6.2</a>). This includes:

      -  identifying if the message belongs to a transaction that has
         been received before

      -  handling duplicate messages

      -  generating Transient errors if the servers that process the
         input message are too busy to handle it

      -  processing the message if it is error free and, if appropriate,
         producing a response to send back to the other role

   o  Cancel a current transaction if requested, for example by the User
      (see <a href="#section-4.6.3">section 4.6.3</a>)

   o  Re-transmit messages if a response was expected but has not been
      received in a reasonable time (see <a href="#section-4.6.4">section 4.6.4</a>).

   The Consumer Role may initiate a number of different types of
   transaction. Specifically:

   o an Inquiry Transaction (see <a href="#section-9.2.1">section 9.2.1</a>)

   o a Ping Transaction (see <a href="#section-9.2.2">section 9.2.2</a>)

   Processing of Input Messages for a Consumer Role is the same as for
   an IOTP Server (see <a href="#section-4.5.2">section 4.5.2</a>) except in the area of checking for
   Errors in Block Sequence (for an IOTP Server see <a href="#section-4.5.2.4">section 4.5.2.4</a>).
   This is described below

   Note: The description of the processing for an IOTP Server includes
   consideration of multi-threading of input messages and multi-tasking
   of requests. For the Consumer Role - particularly if running on a
   stand-alone system such as a PC - use of multi-threading is a
   decision of the implementer of the consumer role IOTP solution.

   Server (see <a href="#section-4.5.2.4">section 4.5.2.4</a>) except that the Consumer Role is
   substituted for IOTP Server Role:

   o Error and Cancel Blocks,

   o Inquiry Request and Response Blocks,

   o Authentication Request, Response and Status Blocks.

   For the other blocks a Consumer role might receive, the potential
   errors in the sequence that blocks arrive depends on the block.
   Blocks where checking for sequence is required are:

   o  TPO Block. Check as follows:

      -  if the input message also contains an Authentication Request
         block and an Offer Response Block then there is a Hard Error,
         otherwise

      -  if the input message also contains an Authentication Request
         block and Authentication Status block then there is Hard Error
         otherwise,


      -  if the input message also contains an Authentication Request
         block and the IOTP Transaction is recognised by the Consumer
         role's system, then there is a Hard Error, otherwise

   This section considers, from an IETF perspective how IOTP addresses
   security. The next section (see <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>. Digital Signatures and
   IOTP) describes how IOTP uses Digital Signatures when these are
   needed.

   This section covers:

   o determining whether to use digital signatures

   o data privacy, and

   o payment protocol security.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1%20Determining%20whether%20to%20use%20digital%20signatures"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a> Determining whether to use digital signatures</span>

   The use of digital signatures within IOTP are entirely optional. IOTP
   can work successfully entirely without the use of digital signatures.

   Ultimately it is up to the Merchant, or other trading role, to decide
   whether IOTP Messages will include signatures, and for the Consumer



<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                     [Page 74]</span></pre>

   to decide whether carrying out a transaction without signatures is an
   acceptable risk. If Merchants discover that transactions without
   signatures are not being accepted, then they will either:

   o start using signatures,

   o find a method of working which does not need signatures, or

   o accept a lower volume and value of business.

   A non-exhaustive list of the reasons why digital signatures might be
   used follows:

   o  the Merchant (or other trading role) wants to demonstrate that
      they can be trusted. If, for example, a merchant generates an
      Offer Response Signature (see <a href="#section-7.19.2">section 7.19.2</a>) using a certificate
      from a trusted third party, known to the Consumer, then the
      Consumer can check the signature and certificate and so more
      reasonably rely on the offer being from the actual Organisation
      the Merchant claims to be. In this case signatures using
      asymmetric cryptography are likely to be required

   o  the Merchant, or other Trading Role, want to generate a record of
      the transaction that is fit for a particular purpose. For example,
      with appropriate trust hierarchies, digital signatures could be
      checked by the Consumer to determine:

      -  if it would be accepted by tax authorities as a valid record of
         a transaction, or

      -  if some warranty, for example from a "Better Business Bureau"
         orsimilar was being provided

   o  the Payment Handler, or Delivery Handler, needs to know that the
      request is unaltered and authorised. For example, in IOTP, details
      of how much to pay is sent to the Consumer in the Offer Response
      and then forwarded to the Payment Handler in a Payment Request. If
      the request is not signed, the Consumer could change the amount
      due by, for example, removing a digit. If the Payment Handler has
      no access to the original payment information in the Offer
      Response, then, without signatures, the Payment Handler cannot be
      sure that the data has not been altered. Similarly, if the payment
      information is not digitally signed, the Payment Handler cannot be
      sure who is the Merchant that is requesting the payment

   o  a Payment Handler or Delivery Handler wants to provide a non-
      refutable record of the completion status of a Payment or
      Delivery. If a Payment Response or Delivery Response is signed,



<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                     [Page 75]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-76" id="page-76" name="page-76"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2801.html">RFC 2801</a>                       IOTP/1.0                       April 2000</span>


      then the Consumer can later use the record of the Payment or
      Delivery to prove that it occurred.  This could be used, for
      example, for customer care purposes.

   A non-exhaustive list of the reasons why digital signatures might not
   be used follows:

   o  trading roles are combined therefore changes to data made by the
      consumer can be detected. One of the reasons for using signatures
      is so that one trading role can determine if data has been changed
      by the Consumer or some other party. However if the trading roles
      have access to the necessary data, then it might be possible to
      compare, for example, the payment information in the Payment
      Request with the payment information in the Offer Response. Access
      to the data necessary could be realised by, for example, the
      Merchant and Payment Handler roles being carried out by the same
      Organisation on the same system, or the Merchant and Payment
      Handler roles being carried out on different systems but the
      systems can communicate in some way. (Note this type of
      communication is outside the current scope of IOTP)

   o  the processing cost of the cryptography is too high. For example,
      if a payment is being made of only a few cents, the cost of
      carrying out all the cryptography associated with generating and
      checking digital signatures might make the whole transaction
      uneconomic. Co-locating trading roles, could help avoid this
      problem.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2%20Symmetric%20and%20Asymmetric%20Cryptography"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a> Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography</span>

   The advantage of using symmetric keys with IOTP is that no Public Key
   Infrastructure need be set up and just the Merchant, Payment Handler
   and Delivery Handler need to agree on the shared secrets to use.

   However the disadvantage of symmetric cryptography is that the
   Consumer cannot easily check the credentials of the Merchant, Payment
   Handler, etc. that they are dealing with. This is likely to reduce,
   somewhat, the trust that the Consumer will have carrying out the
   transaction.

   However it should be noted that even if asymmetric cryptography is
   being used, the Consumer does not NEED to be provided with any
   digital certificates as the integrity of the transaction is
   determined by, for example, the Payment Handler checking the Offer
   Response Signature copied to the Payment Request.

   Note that symmetric, asymmetric or both types of cryptography may be
   used in a single transaction.

   Privacy of information is provided by sending IOTP Messages between
   the various Trading Roles using a secure channel such as [SSL/TLS].
   Use of a secure channel within IOTP is optional.

   IOTP is designed to be completely blind to the payment protocol being
   used to effect a payment. From the security perspective, this means
   that IOTP neither helps, nor hinders, the achievement of payment
   security.

   If it is necessary to consider payment security from an IOTP
   perspective, then this should be included in the payment protocol
   supplement which describes how IOTP supports that payment protocol.

   However what IOTP is designed to do is to use digital signatures to
   bind together the record, contained in a "response" message, of each
   trading exchange in a transaction. For example IOTP can bind
   together: an Offer, a Payment and a Delivery.

   IOTP can work successfully without using any digital signatures
   although in an open networking environment it will be less secure -
   see 5.  Security Considerations for a description of the factors that
   need to be considered.

   However, this section describes how to use digital signatures in the
   many situations when they will be needed. Topics covered are:

   o  an overview of how IOTP uses digital signatures

   o  how to check a signature is correctly calculated

   o  how Payment Handlers and Delivery Handlers check they can carry
      out payments or deliveries on behalf of a Merchant.

   In general, signatures when used with IOTP:

   o  are always treated as IOTP Components (see <a href="#section-7">section 7</a>)

   o  contain digests of one or more IOTP Components or Trading Blocks,
      possibly including other Signature Components, in any IOTP message
      within the same IOTP Transaction

   o  identify:

      -  which Organisation signed (originated) the signature, and

      -  which Organisation(s) should process the signature in order to
         check that the Action the Organisation should take can occur.

   Digital certificates may be associated with digital signatures if
   asymmetric cryptography is being used. However if symmetric
   cryptography is being used, then the digital certificate will be
   replaced by some identifier of the secret key to use.

   Note: The classic example of one signature signing another in IOTP,
   is when an Offer is first signed by a Merchant creating an "Offer
   Response" signature, which is then later signed by a Payment Handler
   together with a record of the payment creating a "Payment Receipt"
   signature. In this way, the payment in an IOTP Transaction is bound
   to the Merchant's offer.

   Note that one Manifest may be associated with multiple signature
   "Value" elements where each Value element contains a digital
   signature over the same Manifest, perhaps using the same (or
   different) signature algorithm but using a different certificate or
   shared secret key. Specifically it will allow the Merchant to agree
   on different shared secrets keys with their Payment Handler and
   Delivery Handler.

   The detailed definitions of a Signature component are contained in
   <a href="#section-7.19">section 7.19</a>.

   The remainder of this section contains:

   o  an example of how IOTP uses signatures

   o  how the OriginatorInfo and RecipientInfo elements within a
      Signature Component are used to identify the Organisations
      associated with the signature

   o  how IOTP uses signatures to prove actions complete successfully

   An example of how signatures are used is illustrated in the figure

   Baseline Purchase relate to one another. Refer to this example in the

   delivery can occur (see <a href="#section-6.3">section 6.3</a>).

   Note: A Baseline Purchase transaction has been used for illustration
   purposes. The usage of the elements and attributes is the same for
   all types of IOTP Transactions.

   The OriginatorRef attribute of the OriginatorInfo element in the
   Signature Component contains an Element Reference (see <a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a>)
   that points to the Organisation Component of the Organisation which
   generated the Signature. In this example its the Merchant.

   Note that the value of the content of the Attribute element with a
   Type attribute set to IOTP Signature Type must match the Trading Role
   of the Organisation which signed it. If it does not, then it is an
   error. Valid combinations are given in the table below.

         IOTP Signature Type    Valid Trading Role

         PingRequest             any role

         PingResponse            any role

   The RecipientRefs attribute of the RecipientInfo element in the
   Signature Component contains Element References to the Organisation
   Components of the Organisations that should use the signature to
   verify that:

   o  they have a pre-existing relationship with the Organisation that
      generated the signature,

   o  the data which is secured by the signature has not been changed,

   o  the data has been signed correctly, and

   o  the action they are required to undertake on behalf of the
      Merchant is therefore authorised.

   Note that if symmetric cryptography is being used then a separate
   RecipientInfo and Value elements for each different set of shared
   secret keys are likely within the Signature Component.

   Alternatively if asymmetric cryptography is being used then the
   RecpientRefs attribute of one RecipientInfo element may refer to
   multiple Organisation Components if they are all using the same
   certificates.

   Proving an action completed successfully, is achieved by signing data
   on Response messages. Specifically:

   o  on the Offer Response, when a Merchant is making an Offer to the
      Consumer which can then be sent to either:

      -  a Payment Handler to prove that the Merchant authorises
         Payment, or

      -  a Delivery Handler to prove that Merchant authorises Delivery,
         provided other necessary authorisations are complete (see
         below)

   o  on the Payment Response, when a Payment Handler is generating a
      Payment Receipt which can be sent to either:

      -  a Delivery Handler, in a Delivery Request Block to authorise
         Delivery together with the Offer Response signature, or

      -  another Payment Handler, in a second Payment Request, to
         authorise the second payment in a Value Exchange IOTP
         Transaction

   o  Delivery Response, when a Delivery Handler is generating a
      Delivery Note. This can be used to prove after the event what the
      Delivery Handler said they would do

   o  Authentication Response. One method of authenticating another
      party to a trade is to send an Authentication Request specifying
      that a Digital Signature should be used for authentication

   o  Transaction Status Inquiry. The Inquiry Response Block may be
      digitally signed to attest to the authenticity of the response

   o  Ping. The Ping Response may be digitally signed so that checks can
      be made that the signature can be understood.

   This proof of an action may, in future versions of IOTP, also be used
   to prove after the event that the IOTP transaction occurred. For
   example to a Customer Care Provider.

   Checking a signature is correctly calculated is part of checking for
   Message Level Errors (see <a href="#section-4.3.2">section 4.3.2</a>). It is included here so that
   all signature and security related considerations are kept together.

   Before a Trading Role can check a signature it must identify which of
   the potentially multiple Signature elements should be checked. The
   steps involved are as follows:

   o  check that a Signature Block is present and it contains one or
      more Signature Components

   o  identify the Organisation Component which contains an OrgId
      attribute for the Organisation which is carrying out the signature
      check. If no or more than one Organisation Component is found then
      it is an error

   o  use the ID attribute of the Organisation Component to find the
      RecipientInfo element that contains a RecipientRefs attribute that
      refers to that Organisation Component. Note there may be no
      signatures to verify

   o  check the Signature Component that contains the identified
      RecipientInfo element as follows:

      -  use the SignatureValueRef and the SignatureAlgorithmRef
         attributes to identify, respectively: the Value element that
         contains the signature to be checked and the Signature
         Algorithm element that describes the signature algorithm to be
         used to verify the Signature, then

      -  if the Signature Algorithm element indicates that asymmetric
         cryptography is being used then use the SignatureCertRef to
         identify the Certificate to be used by the signature algorithm

      -  if Signature Algorithm element indicates that symmetric
         cryptography is being used then the content of the
         RecipientInfo element is used to identify the correct shared
         secret key to use

      -  use the specified signature algorithm to check that the Value
         Element correctly signs the Manifest Element

      -  check that the Digest Elements in the Manifest Element are
         correctly calculated where Components or Blocks referenced by
         the Digest have been received by the Organisation checking the
         signature.

   This section describes the processes required for a Payment Handler
   or Delivery Handler to check that a payment or delivery can occur.
   This may include checking signatures if this is specified by the
   Merchant.

   In outline the steps are:

   o  check that the Payment Request or Delivery Request has been sent
      to the correct Organisation

   o  check that correct IOTP components are present in the request, and

   o  check that the payment or delivery is authorised

   For clarity and brevity the following terms or phrases are used in
   this section:

   o  a "Request Block" is used to refer to either a Payment Request
      Block (see <a href="#section-8.7">section 8.7</a>) or a Delivery Request Block (see <a href="#section-8.10">section</a>
      <a href="#section-8.10">8.10</a>) unless specified to the contrary

   o  a "Response Block" is used to refer to either a Payment Response
      Block (see <a href="#section-8.9">section 8.9</a>) or a Delivery Response Block (see <a href="#section-8.11">section</a>
      <a href="#section-8.11">8.11</a>)

   o  an "Action" is used to refer to an action which occurs on receipt
      of a Request Block. Actions can be either a Payment or a Delivery

   o  an "Action Organisation", is used to refer to the Payment Handler
      or Delivery Handler that carries out an Action

   o  a "Signer of an Action", is used to refer to the Organisations
      that sign data about an Action to authorise the Action, either in
      whole or in part

   o  a "Verifier of an Action", is used to refer to the Organisations
      that verify data to determine if they are authorised to carry out
      the Action

   o  an ActionOrgRef attribute contains Element References which can be
      used to identify the "Action Organisation" that should carry out
      an Action

   Checking the Request Block was sent to the correct Organisation
   varies depending on whether the request refers to a Payment or a
   Delivery.

   In outline a Payment Handler checks if it can accept or make a
   payment by identifying the Payment Component in the Payment Request
   Block it has received, then using the ID of the Payment Component to
   track through the Brand List and Brand Selection Components to
   identify the Organisation selected by the Consumer and then checking
   that this Organisation is itself.

      Figure 12 Checking a Payment Handler can carry out a Payment

   The following describes the steps involved and the checks which need
   to be made:

   o  Identify the Payment Component (see <a href="#section-7.9">section 7.9</a>) in the Payment
      Request Block that was received.

   o  Identify the Brand List and Brand Selection Components for the
      Payment Component. This involves:

      -  identifying the Brand List Component (see <a href="#section-7.7">section 7.7</a>) where
         the value of its ID attribute matches the BrandListRef
         attribute of the Payment Component. If no or more than one
         Brand List Component is found there is an error.

      -  identifying the Brand Selection Component (see <a href="#section-7.8">section 7.8</a>)
         where the value of its BrandListRef attribute matches the
         BrandListRef of the Payment Component. If no or more than one
         matching Brand Selection Component is found there is an error.

   o  Identify the Brand, Protocol Amount, Pay Protocol and Currency
      Amount elements within the Brand List that have been selected by
      the Consumer as follows:

      -  the Brand Element (see <a href="#section-7.7.1">section 7.7.1</a>) selected is the element
         where the value of its Id attribute matches the value of the
         BrandRef attribute in the Brand Selection. If no or more than
         one matching Brand Element is found then there is an error.

      -  the Protocol Amount Element (see <a href="#section-7.7.3">section 7.7.3</a>) selected is the
         element where the value of its Id attribute matches the value
         of the ProtocolAmountRef attribute in the Brand Selection
         Component. If no or more than one matching Protocol Amount
         Element is found there is an error

      -  the Pay Protocol Element (see <a href="#section-7.7.5">section 7.7.5</a>) selected is the
         element where the value of its Id attribute matches the value
         of the PayProtocolRef attribute in the identified Protocol
         Amount Element.  If no or more than one matching Pay Protocol
         Element is found there is an error

      -  the Currency Amount Element (see <a href="#section-7.7.4">section 7.7.4</a>) selected is the
         element where the value of its Id attribute matches the value
         of the CurrencyAmountRef attribute in the Brand Selection
         Component. If no or more than one matching Currency Amount
         element is found there is an error

   o  Check the consistency of the references in the Brand List and
      Brand Selection Components:

      -  check that an Element Reference exists in the
         ProtocolAmountRefs attribute of the identified Brand Element
         that matches the Id attribute of the identified Protocol Amount
         Element. If no or more than one matching Element Reference can
         be found there is an error

      -  check that the CurrencyAmountRefs attribute of the identified
         Protocol Amount element contains an element reference that
         matches the Id attribute of the identified Currency Amount
         element. If no or more than one matching Element Reference is
         found there is an error.

      -  check the consistency of the elements in the Brand List.
         Specifically, the selected Brand, Protocol Amount, Pay Protocol
         and Currency Amount Elements are all child elements of the
         identified Brand List Component. If they are not there is an
         error.

   o  Check that the Payment Handler that received the Payment Request
      Block is the Payment Handler selected by the Consumer. This
      involves:

      -  identifying the Organisation Component for the Payment Handler.
         This is the Organisation Component where its ID attribute
         matches the ActionOrgRef attribute in the identified Pay
         Protocol Element. If no or more than one matching Organisation
         Component is found there is an error

      -  checking the Organisation Component has a Trading Role Element
         with a Role attribute of PaymentHandler. If not there is an
         error

      -  finally, if the identified Organisation Component is not the
         same as the Organisation that received the Payment Request

   The steps involved are as follows:

   o  Identify the Delivery Component in the Delivery Request Block. If
      there is no or more than one matching Delivery Component there is
      an error

   o  Use the ActionOrgRef attribute of the Delivery Component to
      identify the Organisation Component of the Delivery Handler. If
      there is no or more than one matching Organisation Component there
      is an error

   o  If the Organisation Component for the Delivery Handler does not
      have a Trading Role Element with a Role attribute of
      DeliveryHandler there is an error

   o  Finally, if the Organisation that received the Delivery Request
      Block does not identify the Organisation Component for the
      Delivery Handler as itself, then there is an error.

   Check that the correct components are present in the Payment Request
   Block (see <a href="#section-8.7">section 8.7</a>) or in the Delivery Request Block (see <a href="#section-8.10">section</a>
   <a href="#section-8.10">8.10</a>).

   The previous steps identified the Action Organisation and that all
   the necessary components are present. This step checks that the
   Action Organisation is authorised to carry out the Action.

   In outline the Action Organisation will identifies the Merchant,
   checks that it has a pre-existing agreement with the Merchant that
   allows it carry out the Action and that any constraints implied by
   that agreement are being followed, then, if signatures are required,
   it checks that they sign the correct data.

   The steps involved are as follows:

   o  Identify the Merchant. This is the Organisation Component with a
      Trading Role Element which has a Role attribute with a value of
      Merchant. If no or more than one Trading Role Element is found,
      there is an error

   o  Check the Action Organisation's agreements with the Merchant
      allows the Action to be carried out. To do this the Action
      Organisation must check that:

      -  the Merchant is known and a pre-existing agreement exists for
         the Action Organisation to be their agent for the payment or
         delivery

      -  they are allowed to take part in the type of IOTP transaction
         that is occurring. For example a Payment Handler may have
         agreed to accept payments as part of a Baseline Purchase, but
         not make payments as part of a Baseline Refund

      -  any constraints in their agreement with the Merchant are being
         followed, for example, whether or not an Offer Response
         signature is required

   o  Check the signatures are correct. If signatures are required then
      they need to be checked. This involves:

      -  Identifying the correct signatures to check. This involves the
         Action Organisation identifying the Signature Components that
         contain references to the Action Organisation (see 6.3.1).
         Depending on the IOTP Transaction being carried out (see
         <a href="#section-9">section 9</a>) either one or two signatures may be identified

      -  checking that the Signature Components are correct. This
         involves checking that Digest elements exist within the
         Manifest Element that refer to the necessary Trading Components
         (see <a href="#section-6.3.3.1">section 6.3.3.1</a>).

   All Signature Components contained within IOTP Messages must include
   Digest elements that refer to:

   o  the Transaction Id Component (see <a href="#section-3.3.1">section 3.3.1</a>) of the IOTP
      message that contains the Signature Component. This binds the
      globally unique IotpTransId to other components which make up the
      IOTP Transaction

   o  the Transaction Reference Block (see <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a>) of the first
      IOTP Message that contained the signature. This binds the
      IotpTransId with information about the IOTP Message contained
      inside the Message Id Component (see <a href="#section-3.3.2">section 3.3.2</a>).

   Check that each Signature Component contains Digest elements that
   refer to the correct data required.

   The Digest elements that need to be present depend on the Trading
   Role of the Organisation which generated (signed) the signature:

   o  if the signer of the signature is a Merchant then:

      -  Digest elements must be present for all the components in the
         Request Block apart from the Brand Selection Component which is
         optional

   o  if the signer of the signature is a Payment Handler then Digest
      elements must be present for:

      -  the Signature Component signed by the Merchant, and optionally

      -  one or more Signature Components signed by the previous Payment
         Handler(s) in the Transaction.

   Protocol options are options which apply to the IOTP Transaction as a
   whole. Essentially it provides a short description of the entire
   transaction and the net location which the Consumer role should
   branch to if the IOTP Transaction is successful.

   The definition of a Protocol Options Component is as follows.

   &lt;!ELEMENT ProtocolOptions EMPTY &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST ProtocolOptions
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED

    SecureSenderNetLocn CDATA  #IMPLIED
    SuccessNetLocn     CDATA   #REQUIRED &gt;

   Attributes:

   ID                   An identifier which uniquely identifies the
                        Protocol Options Component within the IOTP
                        Transaction.

   Xml:lang             Defines the language used by attributes or child
                        elements within this component, unless
                        overridden by an xml:lang attribute on a child
                        element. See <a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a> Identifying Languages.

   ShortDesc            This contains a short description of the IOTP
                        Transaction in the language defined by xml:lang.
                        Its purpose is to provide an explanation of what
                        type of IOTP Transaction is being conducted by
                        the parties involved.

                        It is used to facilitate selecting an individual
                        transaction from a list of similar transactions,
                        for example from a database of IOTP transactions
                        which has been stored by a Consumer, Merchant,
                        etc.

   SenderNetLocn        This contains the non secured net location of
                        the sender of the TPO Block in which the
                        Protocol Options Component is contained.

                        It is the net location to which the recipient of
                        the TPO block should send a TPO Selection Block
                        if required.

   PackagedContent    This contains the challenge data as one or more
                      Packaged Content (see <a href="#section-3.7">section 3.7</a>) that is to be
                      responded to using the Algorithm defined by the
                      Algorithm element.

   Algorithm          This contains information which describes the
                      Algorithm (see 7.19 Signature Components) that
                      must be used to generate the Authentication
                      Response.

                      The Algorithms that may be used are identified by
                      the Name attribute of the Algorithm element. For

   Authentication Request Block (see <a href="#section-8.4">section 8.4</a>).

   Depending on the Algorithm selected, the results of applying the

   ContentSoftwareId  See <a href="#section-14">section 14</a>.Glossary.

   Content:

   PackagedContent    An optional description of the order information
                      as one or more Packaged Contents (see <a href="#section-3.7">section</a>

   The Packaged Content element will normally be required, however it
   may be omitted where sufficient information about the purchase can be
   provided in the ShortDesc attribute. If the full Order Description
   requires it several Packaged Content elements may be used.

   Although the amount and currency are likely to appear in the Packaged
   Content of the Order Description it is the amount and currency
   contained in the payment related trading components (Brand List,
   Brand Selection and Payment) that is authoritative. This means it is
   important that the amount actually being paid (as contained in the
   payment related trading components) is prominently displayed to the
   Consumer.

   For interoperability, implementations must support Plain Text, HTML
   and XML as a minimum so that it can be easily displayed.

   Note: Disclaimer. The following information provided in this note
   does not represent formal advice of any of the authors of this
   specification. Readers of this specification must form their own
   views and seek their own legal counsel on the usefulness and
   applicability of this information.

   The merchant in the context of Internet commerce with anonymous
   consumers initially frames the terms of the offer on the web page,
   and in order to obtain the goods or services, the consumer must
   accept them.

   If there is to be a time-limited offer, it is recommended that
   merchants communicate this to the consumer and state in the order
   description in a manner which is clear to the consumer that:

   o  the offer is time limited

   o  the OkFrom and OkTo timestamps specify the validity of the offer

   o  the clock, e.g., the merchant's clock, that will be used to
      determine the validity of the offer

   Also note that although the OkFrom and OkTo dates are likely to
   appear in the Packaged Content of the Order Description it is the
   dates contained in the Order Component that is authoritative. This
   means it is important that the OkFrom and OkTo dates actually being
   used is prominently displayed to the Consumer.

   Organisation IDs are used by one IOTP Trading Role to identify
   another.  In order to avoid confusion, this means that these IDs must
   be globally unique.

   In principle this is achieved in the following way:

   o  the Organisation Id for all trading roles, apart from the Consumer
      Trading Role, uses a domain name as their globally unique
      identifier,

   o  the Organisation Id for a Consumer Trading Role is allocated by
      one of the other Trading Roles in an IOTP Transaction and is made
      unique by concatenating it with that other roles' Organisation Id,

   o  once a Consumer is allocated an Organisation Id within an IOTP
      Transaction the same Organisation Id is used by all the other
      trading roles in that IOTP transaction to identify that Consumer.

   Specifically, the content of the Organisation ID is defined as
   follows:

   OrgId ::= NonConsumerOrgId | ConsumerOrgId
   NonConsumerOrgId ::= DomainName
   ConsumerOrgId ::= ConsumerOrgIdPrefix (namechar)+ "/" NonConsumerOrgId
   ConsumerOrgIdPrefix ::= "Consumer:"

   ConsumerOrgId      The Organisation ID for a Consumer consists of:
                       o a standard prefix to identify that the
                         Organisation Id is for a consumer, followed by

                       o one or more characters which conform to the
                         definition of an XML "namechar". See [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>]
                         specifications, followed by
                       o the NonConsumerOrgId for the Organisation
                         which allocated the ConsumerOrgId. It is
                         normally the Merchant role.

                      Use of upper and lower case is not significant.

   NonConsumerOrgId   If the Role is not Consumer then this contains the

   BrandId             This contains a unique identifier for the brand
                       (or promotional brand). It is used to match
                       against a list of Payment Instruments which the
                       Consumer holds to determine whether or not the
                       Consumer can pay using the Brand.

                       Values of BrandId are managed under the procedure
                       described in <a href="#section-12">section 12</a> IANA Considerations.

                       As values of BrandId are controlled under the

   BrandName           This contains the name of the brand, for example
                       MasterCard Credit. This is the description of the
                       Brand which is displayed to the consumer in the
                       Consumers language defined by xml:lang. For
                       example it might be "American Airlines Advantage

   A Brand Selection Component identifies the choice of payment brand,
   payment protocol and the Payment Handler.  This element is used:

   o  in Payment Request messages within Baseline Purchase and Baseline
      Value Exchange IOTP Transactions to identify the brand, protocol
      and payment handler for a payment, or

   o  to, optionally, inform a merchant in a purchase of the payment
      brand being used so that the offer and order details can be
      amended accordingly.

   In Baseline IOTP, the integrity of Brand Selection Components is not
   guaranteed.  However, modification of Brand Selection Components can
   only cause denial of service if the payment protocol itself is secure
   against message modification, duplication, and swapping attacks.

   The definition of a Brand Selection Component is as follows.

                        this Payment Scheme Component relates. It is
                        required unless the Payment Scheme Component is
                        part of an Transaction Inquiry Status
                        Transaction (see <a href="#section-9.2.1">section 9.2.1</a>).

   ConsumerPaymentId    An identifier specified by the Consumer which,
                        if returned by the Payment Handler in another
                        Payment Scheme Component or by other means, will
                        enable the Consumer to identify which payment is
                        being referred to.

   PaymentHandlerPayId  An identifier specified by the Payment Handler
                        which, if returned by the Consumer in another
                        Payment Scheme Component, or by other means,
                        will enable the Payment Handler to identify
                        which payment is being referred to. It is
                        required on every Payment Scheme Component apart
                        from the one contained in a Payment Request
                        Block.

   Content:

   PackagedContent    Contains payment scheme protocol information as
                      Packaged Content elements (see <a href="#section-3.7">section 3.7</a>). See
                      the payment scheme supplement for the definition
                      of its content.

   A Payment Receipt is a record of a payment which demonstrates how
   much money has been paid or received. It is distinct from a purchase
   receipt in that it contains no record of what was being purchased.

   Typically the content of a Payment Receipt Component will contain
   data which describes:

   o  the amount paid and its currency

   o  the date and time of the payment

   o  internal reference numbers which identify the payment to the
      payment system

   o  potentially digital signatures generated by the payment method
      which can be used to prove after the event that the payment
      occurred.

   If the Payment Method being used provides the facility then the
   Payment Receipt Component should contain payment protocol messages,
   or references to messages, which prove the payment occurred.

   The precise definition of the content is Payment Method dependent.
   Refer to the supplement for the payment method being used to
   determine the rules that apply.

   Information contained in the Payment Receipt Component should be
   displayed or otherwise made available to the Consumer.

   Note: If the Payment Receipt Component contains Payment Protocol
   Messages, then the Messages will need to be processed by Payment
   Method software to convert it into a format which can be understood
   by the Consumer

    The definition of a Payment Receipt Component is as follows.

   &lt;!ELEMENT PayReceipt (PackagedContent*) &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST PayReceipt
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED
    PaymentRef         NMTOKEN #REQUIRED
    PayReceiptNameRefs NMTOKENS #IMPLIED
    ContentSoftwareId  CDATA   #IMPLIED &gt;

   Attributes:

   ID                  An identifier which uniquely identifies the
                       Payment Receipt Component within the IOTP
                       Transaction.

   PaymentRef          Contains an Element Reference (see <a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a>)
                       to the Payment Component (see <a href="#section-7.9">section 7.9</a>) to
                       which this payment receipt applies

   PayReceiptNameRefs  Optionally contains a list of the values of the
                       Name attributes of Packaged Content elements that
                       together make up the receipt. The Packaged
                       Content elements are contained either within:
                        o Payment Scheme Data components exchanged
                          between the Payment Handler and the Consumer
                          roles during the Payment, and/or
                        o the Payment Receipt component itself.
                       Note that:
                        o each payment scheme defines in its supplement
                          the Names of the Packaged Content elements
                          that must be listed in this attribute (if
                          any).
                        o if a Payment Scheme Component contains
                          Packaged Content elements with a name that
                          matches a name within PayReceiptNameRefs, then
                          those Payment Scheme Components must be
                          referenced by Digests in the Payment Response
                          signature component (if such a signature is
                          being used)

                       The client software should save all the
                       components referenced so that the payment receipt
                       can be reconstructed when required.

   Content:

   PackagedContent    Optionally contains payment scheme payment receipt
                      information as Packaged Content elements (see
                      <a href="#section-3.7">section 3.7</a>). See the payment scheme supplement
                      for the definition of its content.

                      Note that:
                       o the values of the Name attribute of each
                         packaged content element are defined by the
                         Payment Protocol Supplement
                       o the value of each Name must be unique within a

                         Payment Scheme or Payment Receipt Components,
                         with the same value of the PaymentRef attribute

   Note that either the PayReceiptNameRefs attribute, the
   PackagedContent element, or both must be present.

   The Payment Note Component contains additional, non payment related,
   information which the Payment Handler wants to provide to the
   Consumer.  For example, if a withdrawal or deposit were being made
   then it could contain information on the remaining balance on the
   account after the transfer was complete. The information should
   duplicate information contained within the Payment Receipt Component.

   Information contained in the Payment Note Component should be
   displayed or otherwise made available to the Consumer. For
   interoperability, the Payment Note Component should support, as a
   minimum, the content types of "Plain Text", HTML and XML. Its
   definition is as follows.

   &lt;!ELEMENT PaymentNote (PackagedContent+) &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST PaymentNote

   xml:lang            Defines the language used by attributes or child
                       elements within this component, unless overridden
                       by an xml:lang attribute on a child element. See
                       <a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a> Identifying Languages.

   DelivExch           Indicates if this IOTP Transaction includes the
                       messages associated with a Delivery Exchange.
                       Valid values are:
                        o True indicates it does include a Delivery
                          Exchange
                        o False indicates it does not include a
                          Delivery Exchange

                       If set to true then a DeliveryData element must
                       be present. If set to false it may be absent.

   DelivAndPayResp     Indicates if the Delivery Response Block (see

   A Consumer Delivery Data Component is used by a Consumer to specify
   an identifier that can be used by the Consumer to identify the
   Delivery.

   Its definition is as follows:

   &lt;!ELEMENT ConsumerDeliveryData EMPTY &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST ConsumerDeliveryData
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED
    ConsumerDeliveryId CDATA   #REQUIRED&gt;

   Attributes:

   ID                  An identifier which uniquely identifies the
                       Consumer Delivery Data Component within the IOTP
                       Transaction.

   ConsumerDeliveryId  An identifier specified by the Consumer which, if
                       returned by the Delivery Handler will enable the
                       Consumer to identify which Delivery is being

   A Delivery Note contains delivery instructions about the delivery of
   goods or services or potentially the actual Delivery Information
   itself.  It is information which the person or Organisation receiving
   the Delivery Note can use when delivery occurs.

   For interoperability, the Delivery Note Component Packaged Content
   should support both Plain Text, HTML and XML.

   It's definition is as follows.

   &lt;!ELEMENT DeliveryNote (PackagedContent+) &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST DeliveryNote
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED
    xml:lang           NMTOKEN #REQUIRED
    DelivHandlerDelivId CDATA  #IMPLIED
    ContentSoftwareId  CDATA   #IMPLIED &gt;

   Attributes:

   ID                   An identifier which uniquely identifies the
                        Delivery Note Component within the IOTP
                        Transaction.

   xml:lang             Defines the language used by attributes or child
                        elements within this component, unless
                        overridden by an xml:lang attribute on a child
                        element. See <a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a> Identifying Languages.

   DelivHandlerDelivId  An optional identifier specified by the Delivery
                        Handler which, if returned by the Consumer in
                        another Delivery Component, or by other means,
                        will enable the Delivery Handler to identify
                        which Delivery is being referred to. It is
                        required on every Delivery Component apart from
                        the one contained in a Delivery Request Block.

                        An example use of this attribute is to contain a
                        delivery tracking number.

   A Status Component contains status information about the business
   success or failure (see <a href="#section-4.2">section 4.2</a>) of a process.

   Its definition is as follows.

   &lt;!ELEMENT Status EMPTY &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST Status
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED

    CompletionCode     NMTOKEN #IMPLIED
    ProcessReference   CDATA   #IMPLIED
    StatusDesc         CDATA   #IMPLIED &gt;

   Attributes:

   ID                 An identifier which uniquely identifies the Status
                      Component within the IOTP Transaction.

   xml:lang           Defines the language used by attributes within
                      this component. See <a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a> Identifying
                      Languages.

   StatusType         Indicates the type of Document Exchange which the
                      Status is reporting on. It may be set to either
                      Offer, Payment, Delivery, Authentication or
                      Undefined.

                      Undefined means that the type of document exchange
                      could not be identified. This is caused by an
                      error in the initial input message of the
                      exchange.

                      Considerations which also allows user defined
                      values of StatusType to be defined.

   ElRef              If the StatusType is not set to Undefined then
                      ElRef contains an Element Reference (see <a href="#section-3.5">section</a>
                      <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>) to the Component for which the Status is

                       o an Order Component (see <a href="#section-7.5">section 7.5</a>), if the
                         StatusType is Offer,
                       o a Payment Component (see <a href="#section-7.9">section 7.9</a>), if the
                         StatusType is Payment, or
                       o a Delivery Component (see <a href="#section-7.13">section 7.13</a>), if
                         the StatusType is Delivery
                       o an Authentication Request Component (see

                         Authentication.

   ProcessState       Contains a State Code which indicates the current
                      state of the process being carried out. Valid
                      values for ProcessState are:
                       o NotYetStarted. A Request Block has been
                         received but the process has not yet started
                       o InProgress. Processing of the Request Block
                         has started but it is not yet complete
                       o CompletedOk. The processing of the Request
                         Block has completed successfully without any
                         errors
                       o Failed. The processing of the Request Block
                         has failed because of a Business Error (see
                         <a href="#section-4.2">section 4.2</a>)
                       o ProcessError. This value is only used when the
                         Status Component is being used in connection
                         with an Inquiry Request Trading Block (see
                         <a href="#section-8.12">section 8.12</a>). It indicates there was a
                         Technical Error (see <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>) in the
                         Request Block which is being processed or some
                         internal processing error.

                      Note that this code reports on the processing of a
                      Request Block. Further, asynchronous processing
                      may occur after the Response Block associated with
                      the Process has been sent.

   CompletionCode     Indicates how the process completed. Valid values
                      for the CompletionCode are given below together

                      A CompletionCode is a maximum of 14 characters
                      long.

   ProcessReference   This optional attribute holds a reference for the
                      process whose status is being reported. It may
                      hold the following values:
                       o when StatusType is set to Offer, it should
                         contain the OrderIdentifier from the Order
                         Component
                       o when StatusType is set to Payment, it should
                         contain the PaymentHandlerPayId from the
                         Payment Scheme Data Component
                       o when StatusType is set to Delivery, it should
                         contain the DelivHandlerDelivId from the
                         Delivery Note Component
                       o when StatusType is set to Authentication, it
                         should contain the AuthenticationId from the
                         Authentication Request Component

                      This attribute should be absent in the Inquiry
                      Request message when the Consumer has not been
                      given such a reference number by the IOTP Service
                      Provider.

                      This attribute can be used inside an Inquiry
                      Response Block (see <a href="#section-8.13">section 8.13</a>) to give the
                      reference number for a transaction which has
                      previously been unavailable.

                      For example, the package tracking number might not
                      be assigned at the time a delivery response was
                      received. However, if the Consumer issues a
                      Baseline Transaction Status Inquiry later, the
                      Delivery Handler can put the package tracking
                      number into this attribute in the Inquiry Response
                      message and send it back to the Consumer.

   StatusDesc         An optional textual description of the current
                      status of the process in the language identified
                      by xml:lang.

       Value                            Description

   AuthError        Authentication Error. The check of the
                    Authentication Response which was carried out has
                    failed.

                    Recovery may be possible by the Consumer re-
                    submitting a new Authentication Response Block with
                    corrected information.

   ConsCancelled    Consumer Cancelled. The Consumer decides to cancel
                    the transaction for some reason. This code is only
                    valid in a Status Component contained in a Cancel
                    Block or an Inquiry Response Block.

                    No recovery possible.

   MerchCancelled   Offer Cancelled. The Merchant declines to generate
                    an offer for some reason and cancels the
                    transaction. This code is only valid in a Status
                    Component contained in a Cancel Block or an Inquiry
                    Response Block.

                    No recovery possible.

   Unspecified      Unspecified error. There is some unknown problem or
                    error which does not fall into one of the other
                    CompletionCodes.

                    No recovery possible.

   The CompletionCode is only required if the ProcessState attribute is
   set to Failed. The following table contains the valid values for the
   CompletionCode that may be used and indicates where recovery may be
   possible. It is recommended that the StatusDesc attribute is used by
   individual payment schemes to provide further explanation where
   appropriate.

         Value                           Description

   BrandNotSupp       Brand not supported. The payment brand is not
                      supported by the Payment Handler.

                      See below for recovery options.

   CurrNotSupp        Currency not supported. The currency in which the
                      payment is to be made is not supported by either
                      the Payment Instrument or the Payment Handler.

                      If the payment is Brand Independent, then the
                      Consumer may recover by selecting a different
                      currency, if available, or a different brand. Note
                      that this may involve a different Payment Handler.

   ConsCancelled      Consumer Cancelled. The Consumer decides to cancel
                      the payment for some reason. This code is only
                      valid in a Status Component contained in a Cancel
                      Block or an Inquiry Response Block.

                      Recovery is not possible.

   PaymtCancelled     Payment Cancelled. The Payment Handler declines to
                      complete the payment for some reason and cancels
                      the transaction. This code is only valid in a
                      Status Component contained in a Cancel Block or an
                      Inquiry Response Block.

                      See below for recovery options.

   AuthError          Authentication Error. The Payment Scheme specific
                      authentication check which was carried out has
                      failed.

                      Recovery may be possible. See the payment scheme
                      supplement to determine what is allowed.

   InsuffFunds        Insufficient funds. There are insufficient funds
                      available for the payment to be made.

                      See below for recovery options.

   InstBrandInvalid   Payment Instrument not valid for Brand. A Payment
                      Instrument is being used which does not correspond
                      with the Brand selected. For example a Visa credit
                      card is being used when MasterCard was selected as
                      the Brand.

                      See below for recovery options.

   InstNotValid       Payment instrument not valid for trade. The
                      Payment Instrument cannot be used for the proposed
                      type of trade, for some reason.

                      See below for recovery options.

   BadInstrument      Bad instrument. There is a problem with the
                      Payment Instrument being used which means that it
                      is unable to be used for the payment.

                      See below for recovery options.

   Unspecified        Unspecified error. There is some unknown problem
                      or error which does not fall into one of the other
                      CompletionCodes. The StatusDesc attribute should
                      provide the explanation of the cause.

                      See below for recovery options.

   TimedOutRcvr       Recoverable Time Out. Messages were resent but no
                      response received. The document exchange has
                      therefore "Timed Out". This code is only valid on
                      a Transaction Inquiry.

                      Recovery is possible if the last message from the
                      other Trading Role is received again.

                      a Transaction Inquiry.

                      No recovery possible.

   If the Payment is Brand Independent, then recovery may be possible
   for some values of the Completion Code, by the Consumer selecting
   either a different payment brand or a different payment instrument
   for the same brand. Note that this might involve a different Payment
   Handler. The codes to which this applies are: BrandNotSupp,
   PaymtCancelled, InsuffFunds, InstBrandInvalid, InstNotValid,
   BadInstrument and Unspecified.

   Recovery from Payments associated with Brand Dependent purchases is
   only possible, if the Brand Selection component sent by the Merchant
   to the Consumer does not change. In practice this means that the same
   Brand, Protocol Amount and PayProtocol elements must be used. All
   that can change is the Payment Instrument. Any other change will
   invalidate the Merchant's Offer as a changed selection will
   invalidate the Offer Response.

                   which the Authenticatee is taking in the IOTP

                     information
                    o asking a Consumer for Merchant information

   Note: Definitions of the XML structures for signatures and
   certificates are described in the document titled "Digital Signatures
   for the Internet Open Trading Protocol" by Kent Davidson and Yoshiaki
   Kawatsura published at the same time as this document - see
   [<a href="#ref-IOTPDSIG" title='"Digital Signatures for the v1.0 Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP)"'>IOTPDSIG</a>].

   In the future it is anticipated that future versions of IOTP will
   adopt a whatever method for digitally signing XML becomes the
   standard.

   Each Signature Component digitally signs one or more Blocks or
   Components including other Signature Components.

   The Signature Component:

   o  contains digests of one or more Blocks or Components in one or
      more IOTP Messages within the same IOTP Transaction and places the
      result in a Digest Element

   o  concatenates these Digest elements with other information on the
      type of signature, the originator and potential recipients of the
      signature and details of the signature algorithms being used and
      places them in a Manifest element, and

   o  signs the Manifest element using the optional certificate
      identified in the Certificate element within the Signature Block
      placing the result in a Value element within a Signature Component

   Note that there may be multiple Value elements that contain
   signatures of a Manifest Element.

   A Signature Component can be one of four types either:

   o an Offer Response Signature,

   o a Payment Response Signature,

   Definitions of the elements and attributes are contained in
   [<a href="#ref-IOTPDSIG" title='"Digital Signatures for the v1.0 Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP)"'>IOTPDSIG</a>].  The following contains additional information that
   describes how these elements and attributes are used by IOTP.

   SIGNATURE ELEMENT

   The ID attribute is mandatory.

   MANIFEST ELEMENT

   The optional LocatorHrefBase attribute contains text which should be
   concatenated before the text contained in the LocatorHREF attribute
   of all Digest elements within the Manifest.

   Its purpose is to reduce the size of LocatorHREF attribute values
   since the first part of the LocatorHREF attributes in the same
   signature are likely to be the same.

   Typically, within IOTP, it will contain all the characters in a
   LocatorHref attribute up to the sharp ("#") character (see
   immediately below).

   ALGORITHM AND PARAMETER ELEMENTS

   The algorithm element identifies the algorithms used in generating
   the signature. The type of the algorithm is defined by the value of
   the Type attribute which indicates if it is to be used as a Digest
   algorithm, a Signature algorithm or a Key Agreement algorithm.

   The following Digest algorithms must be implemented:

   o  a [<a href="#ref-DOM-HASH" title='"Digest Values for DOM (DOMHASH)"'>DOM-HASH</a>] algorithm. This is identified by setting the Name
      attribute of the Algorithm element to "urn:ibm:dom-hash"

   o  a [<a href="#ref-SHA1" title='"Secure Hash Standard"'>SHA1</a>] algorithm. This is identified by setting the Name
      attribute of the Algorithm element to "urn:fips:sha1", and

   o  a [<a href="#ref-MD5" title='"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>MD5</a>] algorithm. This is identified by setting the Name
      attribute of the Algorithm element to "urn:rsa:md5"



<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                    [Page 148]</span></pre>

   o  The following Signature algorithms must be implemented:

   o  a [<a href="#ref-DSA">DSA</a>] algorithm. This is identified by setting the Name
      attribute of the Algorithm element to "urn:us.gov:dsa"

   o  a [<a href="#ref-HMAC" title='"HMAC: Keyed- Hashing for Message Authentication"'>HMAC</a>] algorithm. This is identified by setting the Name
      attribute of the Algorithm element to "urn:ibm:hmac"

   It is recommended that the following Signature algorithm is also
   implemented:

   o  a [<a href="#ref-RSA" title="A. Shamir">RSA</a>] algorithm. This is identified by setting the Name
      attribute of the Algorithm element to "urn:rsa:rsa"

   In addition other payment scheme specific algorithms may be used. In
   this case the value of the name attribute to use is specified in the
   payment scheme supplement for that algorithm.

   One algorithm may make use of other algorithms by use of the
   Parameter element, for example:

   &lt;Algorithm ID=A1 type="digest" name="urn:ibm:dom-hash"&gt;
     &lt;Parameter type='AlgorithmRef'&gt;A2&lt;/Parameter&gt;
   &lt;/Algorithm&gt;
   &lt;Algorithm ID=A2 type="digest" name="urn:fips:sha1"&gt;
   &lt;/Algorithm&gt;
   &lt;Algorithm ID=A3 type="signature" name="urn:ibm:hmac"&gt;
       &lt;Parameter type='AlgorithmRef'&gt;A1&lt;/Parameter&gt;
   &lt;/Algorithm&gt;

   DIGEST ELEMENT

   The LocatorHREF attribute identifies the IOTP element which is being
   digitally signed. Specifically it consists of:

   o  the value of the IotpTransId attribute of the Transaction ID
      Component, followed by:

   o  a sharp character, i.e. "#", followed by

   o  an Element Reference (see <a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a>) to the element within the
      IOTP Transaction which is the subject of the digest.

   Before analysing the structure of the LocatorHREF attribute, it must
   be concatenated with the value of the LocatorHrefBase attribute of
   the Manifest element (see immediately above).

   ATTRIBUTE ELEMENT

   There must be one and only one Attribute Element that contains a Type
   attribute with a value of IOTP Signature Type and with content set to
   either: OfferResponse, PaymentResponse, DeliveryResponse,

   AuthenticationRequest, AuthenticationResponse, PingRequest or
   PingResponse; depending on the type of the signature.

   Values of the content of the Attribute element are controlled under
   the procedures defined in <a href="#section-12">section 12</a> IANA Considerations which also
   allows user defined values to be defined.

   The Critical attribute must be set to true.

   ORIGINATORINFO ELEMENT

   The OriginatorRef attribute of the OriginatorInfo element must always
   be present and contain an Element Reference (see <a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a>) to the
   Organisation Component of the Organisation that generated the
   Signature Component.

   RECIPIENTINFO ELEMENT

   The RecipientRefs attribute contains a list of Element References
   (see <a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a>), that point to the Organisations that might need to
   validate the signature. For details see below.

   The Manifest Element of a signature which has a type of OfferResponse
   should contain Digest elements for the following Components:

   o  the Transaction Id Component (see <a href="#section-3.3.1">section 3.3.1</a>) of the IOTP
      message that contains the Offer Response Signature

   o  the Transaction Reference Block (see <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a>) of the IOTP

   The Offer Response Signature should also contain Digest elements for
   the components that describe each of the Organisations that may or
   will need to verify the signature. This involves:

   o  if the Merchant has received a TPO Selection Block containing
      Brand Selection Components, then generate a Digest element for the
      Payment Handler identified by the Brand Selection Component and
      the Delivery Handler identified by the Delivery Component. See
      <a href="#section-6.3.1">section 6.3.1</a> Check Request Block sent Correct Organisation for a
      description of how this can be done.

   o  if the Merchant is not expecting to receive a TPO Selection Block
      then generate a Digest element for the Delivery Handler and all
      the Payment Handlers that are involved.

   A Certificate Component contains a Digital Certificate. They are used
   only when required, for example, when asymmetric cryptography is
   being used and the recipient of the signature that needs to check has
   not already received the Public Key.

   The structure of a Certificate Component is defined in [<a href="#ref-IOTPDSIG" title='"Digital Signatures for the v1.0 Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP)"'>IOTPDSIG</a>].

   The Error Component contains information about Technical Errors (see
   <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>) in an IOTP Message which has been received by one of the
   Trading Roles involved in the trade.

   For clarity two phrases are defined which are used in the description
   of an Error Component:

   o  message in error. An IOTP message which contains or causes an
      error of some kind

   Attributes:

   ID                 An identifier which uniquely identifies the Error
                      Component within the IOTP Transaction.

   xml:lang           Defines the language used by attributes or child
                      elements within this component, unless overridden
                      by an xml:lang attribute on a child element. See
                      <a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a> Identifying Languages.

   ErrorCode          Contains an error code which indicates the nature
                      of the error in the message in error. Valid values
                      for the ErrorCode are given in <a href="#section-7.21.2">section 7.21.2</a>
                      Error Codes.

   ErrorDesc          Contains a narrative description of the error in
                      the language defined by xml:lang. The content of
                      this attribute is defined by the vendor/developer
                      of the software which generated the Error
                      Component

   Severity           Indicates the severity of the error.  Valid values
                      are:
                       o Warning. This indicates that although there is
                         a message in error the IOTP Transaction can
                         still continue.
                       o TransientError. This indicates that the error
                         in the message in error may be recovered if the
                         message in error  that is referred to by the
                         ErrorLocation element is resent

                       o HardError. This indicates that there is an
                         unrecoverable error in the message in error and
                         the IOTP Transaction must stop.

   MinRetrySecs       This attribute should be present if Severity is
                      set to TransientError. It is the minimum number of
                      whole seconds which the IOTP aware application
                      which received the message reporting the error
                      should wait before re-sending the message in error
                      identified by the ErrorLocation element.

                      If Severity is not set to TransientError then the
                      value of this attribute is ignored.

   SwVendorErrorRef   This attribute is a reference whose value is set
                      by the vendor/developer of the software which
                      generated the Error Component. It should contain
                      data which enables the vendor to identify the
                      precise location in their software and the set of
                      circumstances which caused the software to
                      generate a message reporting the error. See also
                      the SoftwareId attribute of the Message Id element
                      in the Transaction Reference Block (<a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a>).

   Content:

   ErrorLocation      This identifies the IOTP Transaction Id of the
                      message in error  and, where possible, the element
                      and attribute in the message in error that caused
                      the Error Component to be generated.

                      If the Severity of the error is not
                      TransientError, more than one ErrorLocation may be
                      specified as appropriate depending on the nature
                      of the error (see <a href="#section-7.21.2">section 7.21.2</a> Error Codes) and
                      at the discretion of  the vendor/developer of the
                      IOTP Aware Application.

   PackagedContent    This contains additional data which can be used to
                      understand the error. Its content may vary as
                      appropriate depending on the nature of the error
                      (see <a href="#section-7.21.2">section 7.21.2</a> Error Codes) and at the

   If there is more than one Error Component in a message reporting the
   error, carry out the actions appropriate for the Error Component with
   the highest severity. In this context, HardError has a higher
   severity than TransientError, which has a higher severity than
   Warning.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.21.1.1%20Severity%20-%20Warning"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.21.1.1" name="section-7.21.1.1">7.21.1.1</a> Severity - Warning</span>

   If an IOTP aware application is generating a message reporting the
   error with an Error Component where the Severity attribute is set to
   Warning, then if the message reporting the error does not contain
   another Error Component with a severity higher than Warning, the IOTP
   Message must also include the Trading Blocks and Trading Components
   that would have been included if no error was being reported.

   If a message reporting the error is received with an Error Component
   where Severity is set to Warning, then:

   o  it is recommended that information about the error is either
      logged, or otherwise reported to the user,

   o  the implementer of the IOTP aware application must either, at
      their or the user's discretion:

      -  continue the IOTP transaction as normal, or

      -  fail the IOTP transaction by generating a message reporting the
         error with an Error Component with Severity set to HardError
         (see <a href="#section-7.21.1.3">section 7.21.1.3</a>).

   If the intention is to continue the IOTP transaction then, if there
   are no other Error Components with a higher severity, check that the
   necessary Trading Blocks and Trading Components for normal processing
   of the transaction to continue are present. If they are not then
   generate a message reporting the error with an Error Component with
   Severity set to HardError.

   If an IOTP Aware Application is generating a message reporting the
   error with an Error Component where the Severity attribute is set to
   TransientError, then there should be only one Error Component in the
   message reporting the error. In addition, the MinRetrySecs attribute
   should be present.

   If a message reporting the error is received with an Error Component
   where Severity is set to TransientError then:

   o  if the MinRetrySecs attribute is present and a valid number, then
      use the MinRetrySecs value given. Otherwise if MinRetrySecs is
      missing or is invalid, then:

      -  generate a message reporting the error containing an Error
         Component with a Severity of Warning and send it on the next
         IOTP message (if any) to be sent to the Trading Role which sent
         the message reporting the error with the invalid MinRetrySecs,
         and

      -  use a value for MinRetrySecs which is set by the
         vendor/developer of the IOTP Aware Application.

   o  check that only one ErrorLocation element is contained within the
      Error Component and that it refers to an IOTP Message which was
      sent by the recipient of the Error Component with a Severity of
      TransientError. If more than one ErrorLocation is present then
      generate a message reporting the error with a Severity of
      HardError.

   If an IOTP Aware Application is generating a message reporting the
   error with an Error Component where the Severity attribute set to
   HardError, then there should be only one Error Component in the
   message reporting the error.

   If a message reporting the error is received with an Error Component
   where Severity is set to HardError then terminate the IOTP

                   <a href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>).

   XmlNotWellFrmd  XML not well formed. The XML document is not well
                   formed. See [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>] for the meaning of "well formed".
                   Even if the XML is not well formed, it should still
                   be scanned to find the Transaction Reference Block so
                   that a properly formed Error Response may be
                   generated.

   XmlNotValid     XML not valid. The XML document is well formed but
                   the document is not valid. See [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>] for the meaning
                   of "valid". Specifically:
                    o the XML document does not comply with the
                     constraints defined in the IOTP document type
                     declaration (DTD) (see <a href="#section-13">section 13</a> Internet Open

                     declaration of any additional [XML Namespace] that
                     are declared.

                   As for XML not well formed, attempts should still be
                   made to extract the Transaction Reference Block so
                   that a properly formed Error Response may be
                   generated.

   ElUnexpected    Unexpected element. Although the XML document is well
                   formed and valid, an element is present that is not
                   expected in the particular context according to the

   ValueTooSmall   Value too small or early. The value of all or part of
                   the Content of an element or an attribute, although
                   valid, is too small.

   ValueTooLarge   Value too large or in the future. The value of all or
                   part of the Content of an element or an attribute,
                   although valid, is too large.

   ElInconsistent  Element Inconsistent. Although the document is well
                   formed and valid, according to the rules and
                   constraints contained in this specification:
                    o the content of an element is inconsistent with the
                     content of other elements or their attributes, or
                    o the value of an attribute is inconsistent with the
                     value of one or more other attributes.

                   In this case create ErrorLocation elements which
                   identify all the attributes or elements which are
                   inconsistent.

   TransportError  Transport Error. This error code is used to indicate
                   that there is a problem with the Transport Mechanism
                   which is preventing the message from being received.
                   It is typically associated with a Transient Error.
                   Explanation of the Transport Error is contained
                   within the ErrorDesc attribute. The values which can
                   be used inside ErrorDesc with a TransportError is
                   specified in the IOTP supplement for the Transport
                   mechanism.

   MsgBeingProc    Message Being Processed. This error code is only used
                   with a Severity of Transient Error. It indicates that
                   the previous message, which may be an exchange
                   message or a request message, is being processed and,
                   if no response is received by the time indicated by
                   the MinRetrySecs attribute, then the original message
                   should be resent.

   SystemBusy      System Busy. This error code is only used with a
                   Severity of Transient Error. It indicates that the
                   server that received a message is currently too busy
                   to handle the message. If no response is received by

                   the time indicated by the MinRetrySecs attribute,
                   then the original message should be resent.

   Note: If the server/system handling the Transport Mechanism (e.g.,
   HTTP) is busy then a Transport Specific error message should be used
   instead of an IOTP Error message. This code should be used in
   association with IOTP servers/systems or other servers/systems to
   which the IOTP server is connected.

   UnknownError    Unknown Error. Indicates that the transaction cannot
                   complete for some reason that is not covered
                   explicitly by any of the other errors.  The ErrorDesc
                   attribute should be used to indicate the nature of
                   the problem.

                   This could be used to indicate, for example, an
                   internal error in a backend server or client process
                   of some kind.

   An Error Location Element identifies an element and optionally an
   attribute in the message in error which is associated with the error.
   It contains a reference to the IOTP Message, Trading Block, Trading
   Component, element and attribute, which is in error.

    AttName            NMTOKEN #IMPLIED &gt;

   Attributes:

   ElementType        This is the name of the type of the element where
                      the error is located. For example if the element
                      was declared as &lt;!ELEMENT Org ... then its name is
                      "Org".

   IotpMsgRef         This is the value of the ID attribute of the of
                      the Message Id Component (see <a href="#section-3.3.2">section 3.3.2</a>) of
                      the message in error to which this Error Component
                      applies.

   BlkRef             If the error is associated with a specific Trading
                      Block, then this is the value of the ID attribute
                      of the Trading Block where the error is located.

   CompRef            If the error is associated with a specific Trading
                      Component, then this is the value of the ID
                      attribute of the Trading Component where the error
                      is located.

   ElementRef         If the error is associated with a specific element
                      within a Trading Component then, if the element
                      has an attribute with an "attribute type" (see
                      [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>]) of "ID", then this is the value of that
                      attribute.

   AttName            If the error is associated with the value of an
                      attribute, then this is the name of that
                      attribute. In this case the PackagedContent of the
                      Error Component should contain the value of the
                      attribute.

   Note that as many as the attributes as possible should be included.
   For example if an attribute in a child element of a Trading Component
   contains an incorrect value, then all the attributes of ErrorLocation
   should be present.

   Trading Blocks are child elements of the top level IOTP Messages that
   are sent in the form of [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>] documents directly between the
   different Trading Roles that are taking part in a trade.

   Each Trading Blocks consist of one or more Trading Components (see

   The Ping Request Block is used to determine if a Server is operating
   and whether or not cryptography is compatible.

   The definition of a Ping Request Block is as follows.

   &lt;!ELEMENT PingReqBlk (Org*)&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST PingReqBlk
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED&gt;

   Attributes:

   ID                 An identifier which uniquely identifies the Ping
                      Request Trading Block within the IOTP Transaction.

   Content:

   Org                Optional Organisation Components (see <a href="#section-7.6">section</a>
                      <a href="#section-7.6">7.6</a>).

                      If no Organisation Component is present then the
                      Ping Request is anonymous and simply determines if
                      the server is operating.

                      However if Organisation Components are present,
                      then it indicates that the sender of the Ping
                      Request wants to verify that digital signatures
                      can be handled.

                      In this case the sender includes:
                       o an Organisation Component that identifies
                         itself specifying the Trading Role(s) it is
                         taking in IOTP transactions (Merchant, Payment
                         Handler, etc.)
                       o an Organisation Component that identifies the
                         intended recipient of the message.

                      These are then used to generate a signature over
                      the Ping Response Block.

   The Ping Response Trading Block provides the result of a Ping
   Request.

   It contains an Organisation Component that identifies the sender of
   the Ping Response.

                          can still provide a Ping response.

   SigVerifyStatusCode  Contains a code which shows the status of
                        signature verification. This is present only
                        when the message containing the Ping Request

   The Error Trading Block contains one or more Error Components (see
   <a href="#section-7.21">section 7.21</a>) which contain information about Technical Errors (see
   <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>) in an IOTP Message which has been received by one of the
   Trading Roles involved in the trade.

   For clarity two phrases are defined which are used in the description
   of an Error Trading Block:

   o  message in error. An IOTP message which contains or causes an
      error of some kind

   o  message reporting the error. An IOTP message that contains an
      Error Trading Block that describes the error found in a message in
      error.

   An Error Trading Block may be contained in any message reporting the
   error. The action which then follows depends on the severity of the
   error. See the definition of an Error Component, for an explanation
   of the different types of severity and the actions which can then
   occur.

   in3 Note: Although, an Error Trading Block can report multiple
   different errors using multiple Error Components, there is no
   obligation on a developer of an IOTP Aware Application to do so.

   The structure of an Error Trading Block is as follows.

   &lt;!ELEMENT ErrorBlk (ErrorComp+, PaySchemeData*) &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST ErrorBlk
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED &gt;

   Attributes:

   ID                 An identifier which uniquely identifies the Error
                      Trading Block within the IOTP Transaction.

   Content:

   ErrorComp          An Error Components (see <a href="#section-7.21">section 7.21</a>) that
                      contains information about an individual Technical
                      Error.

   The Cancel Block is used by one Trading Role to inform any other that
   a transaction has been cancelled. Example usage includes:

   o  a Consumer Role informing a non-Consumer role that it no longer
      plans to continue with the transaction. This will allow the server
      to close down the transaction tidily without a waiting for a
      time-out to occur

   o  a non-Consumer Role to inform a Consumer role that the Transaction
      is being stopped. In this case, the Consumer is then unlikely to
      re-send the previous message that was sent in the mistaken
      understanding that the original was not received.

   Its definition is as follows.

   &lt;!ELEMENT CancelBlk (Status) &gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST CancelBlk
    ID                 ID      #REQUIRED &gt;

   Attributes:

   ID                 An identifier which uniquely identifies the Cancel
                      Block within the IOTP Transaction.

   The Baseline Internet Open Trading Protocol supports three types of
   transactions for different purposes. These are

   o  an Authentication IOTP transaction which supports authentication
      of one party in a trade by another and/or requests information
      about another Trading Role








<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                    [Page 184]</span></pre>

   o  IOTP Transactions that involve one or more payments. Specifically:

      -  Deposit

      -  Purchase

      -  Refund

      -  Withdrawal, and

      -  Value Exchange

   o  IOTP Transactions designed to check the correct function of the
      IOTP infrastructure. Specifically:

      -  Transaction Status Inquiry, and

      -  Ping

   Although the Authentication IOTP Transaction can operate on its own,
   authentication can optionally precede any of the "payment"
   transactions.  Therefore, the rest of this section is divided into
   two parts covering:

   o  Authentication and Payment transactions (Authentication, Deposit,
      Purchase, Refund, Withdrawal and Value Exchange)

   o  Infrastructure Transactions (Transaction Status Inquiry and Ping)
      that are designed to support inquiries on whether or not a
      transaction has succeeded or a Trading Role's servers are
      operating correctly, and

      The Authentication and Payment related IOTP Transactions consist
      of six Document Exchanges which are then combined in sequence to
      implement a specific transaction.

      Generally, there is a close, but not exact, correspondence between
      a Document Exchange and a Trading Exchange. The main difference is
      that some Document Exchanges implement part or all of two Trading
      Exchanges simultaneously in order to minimise the number of actual
      IOTP Messages which must be sent over the Internet.

      The six Document Exchanges are:

   o  Authentication. This is a direct implementation of the
      Authentication Trading Exchange

   o  Brand Dependent Offer. This is the Offer Trading Exchange combined
      with the Brand Selection part of the Payment Trading Exchange. Its
      purpose is to provide the Merchant with information on the Brand
      selected so that the content of the Offer Response may be adapted
      accordingly

   o  Brand Independent Offer. This is also an Offer Trading Exchange.
      However, in this instance, the content of the Offer Response does
      not depend on the Brand selected.

   o  Payment. This is a direct implementation of the Payment part of a
      Payment Trading Exchange

   o  Delivery. This is a direct implementation of the Delivery Exchange

   o  Delivery with Payment. This is an implementation of combined
      Payment and Delivery Trading Exchanges

   These Document Exchanges are combined together in different sequences
   to implement each IOTP Transaction. The way in which they may be
   combined is illustrated by the diagram below.

   The Authentication Document Exchange is a direct implementation of
   the Authentication Trading Exchange (see <a href="#section-2.2.4">section 2.2.4</a>). It involves:

   o  an Authenticator - the Organisation which is requesting the
      authentication, and

   o  an Authenticatee - the Organisation being authenticated.

   The authentication consists of:

   o  an Authentication Request being sent by the Authenticator to the
      Authenticatee,

   o  an Authentication Response being sent in return by the
      Authenticatee to the Authenticator which is then checked, and

   o  an Authentication Status being sent by the Authenticator to the
      Authenticatee to provide an indication of the success or failure
      of the authentication.

   An Authentication Document Exchange also:

   o  provides an Authenticatee with an Organisation Component which
      describes the Authenticator, and

   o  optionally provides the Authenticator with Organisation Components
      which describe the Authenticatee.

   The Authentication Request may also be digitally signed which allows
   the Authenticatee to verify the credentials of the Authenticator.

   The IOTP Messages which are involved are illustrated by the diagram
   below.

 1.          First Organisation takes an action (for example by
             pressing a button on an HTML page) which requires that
             the Organisation is authenticated

     1 --&gt; 2 Authentication Need (outside scope of IOTP)

 2.          The second Organisation generates: an Authentication
             Request Block containing one or more Authentication
             Request Components and/or a Trading Role Information
             Request Component, then sends it to the first
             Organisation

     1 &lt;-- 2 TPO &amp; AUTHENTICATION REQUEST. IotpMsg: Trans Ref Block;
             Signature Block (optional); TPO Block; Auth Request Block

 3.          IOTP aware application started. If a Signature Block is
             present, the first Organisation may use this to check the
             credentials of the second Organisation. If credentials are
             OK, the first Organisation selects an Authentication
             Request to use (if present and more than one), then uses
             the authentication algorithm selected to generate an
             Authentication Response Block. If present, the Trading
             Role Information Request Component is used to generate
             Organisation Components. Finally a Signature Component is
             created if required and all components are then sent back
             to the second Organisation for validation.

     1 --&gt; 2 AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE. IotpMsg; Trans Ref Block;

 4.          The second Organisation checks the Authentication
             Response against the data in the Authentication Request
             Block to check that the first Organisation is who they
             appear to be, and sends an Authentication Status Block to
             the first Organisation to indicate the result then
             stops.

   On receiving a TPO &amp; Authentication Request IOTP Message (see below),
   an Authenticatee may either:

   o  generate and send an Authentication Response IOTP Message back to
      the Authenticator, or

   o  indicate failure to comply with the Authentication Request by
      sending a Cancel Block back to the Authenticator containing a
      Status Component with a StatusType of Authentication a
      ProcessState of Failed and the CompletionCode (see <a href="#section-7.16.4">section 7.16.4</a>)
      set to either: AutEeCancel, NoAuthReq, TradRolesIncon or
      Unspecified.

   On receiving an Authentication Response IOTP Message (see below), an
   Authenticator should send in return, an Authentication Status IOTP
   Message (see below) containing a Status Block with a Status Component
   where the StatusType is set to Authentication, and:

   o  the ProcessState attribute of the Status Component is set to
      CompletedOk which indicates a successful completion, or

   o  the ProcessState attribute is set to Failed and the CompletionCode
      attribute is set to either: AutOrCancel, AuthFailed or Unspecified
      which indicates a failed authentication,

   On receiving an Authentication Status IOTP Message (see below), the
   Authenticatee should check the Status Component in the Status Block.
   If this indicates:

   o  a successful authentication, then the Authenticatee should either:

      SIGNATURE BLOCK (AUTHENTICATION STATUS)

      If the Authentication Status Block is being digitally signed then
      a Signature Block must be included that contains a Signature
      Component with Digest elements for the following XML elements:

   o  the Transaction Reference Block (see <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a>) for the IOTP

   o  the following components of the Authentication Status Block:

      -  the Status Component (see <a href="#section-7.16">section 7.16</a>).

   Note: If the Authentication Document Exchange is followed by an Offer
   Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.2">section 9.1.2</a>) then the Authentication Status
   Block and the Signature Block (Authentication Status) may be combined
   with either:

   o a TPO IOTP Message (see <a href="#section-9.1.2.3">section 9.1.2.3</a>), or

   o a TPO and Offer Response IOTP Message (see <a href="#section-9.1.2.6">section 9.1.2.6</a>)

   The Offer Document Exchange occurs in two basic forms:

   o  Brand Dependent Offer Exchange. Where the content of the offer,
      e.g., the order details, amount, delivery details, etc., are
      dependent on the payment brand and protocol selected by the
      consumer, and

   o  Brand Independent Offer Exchange. Where the content of the offer
      is not dependent on the payment brand and protocol selected.

      Each of these types of Offer Document Exchange may be preceded by
      an Authentication Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.1">section 9.1.1</a>).

      In a Brand Dependent Offer Document Exchange the TPO Block and the
      Offer Response Block are sent separately by the Merchant to the
      Consumer, i.e.:

             to create an offer,

     C --&gt; M Offer information - outside scope of IOTP

 2.          Merchant decides which payment brand protocols,

 5.          Consumer checks the Offer is OK, then combines components
             from the TPO Block, the TPO Selection Block and the Offer
             Response Block to create the next IOTP Message for the

   Note, a Consumer identifies a Brand Dependent Offer Document
   Exchange, by the absence of an Offer Response Block in the first IOTP
   Message.

   MESSAGE PROCESSING GUIDELINES

   On receiving a TPO IOTP Message (see below), the Consumer may either:

   o  generate and send a TPO Selection IOTP Message back to the
      Merchant, or

   o  indicate failure to continue with the IOTP Transaction by sending
      a Cancel Block back to the Merchant containing a Status Component
      with a StatusType of Offer, a ProcessState of Failed and the
      CompletionCode (see <a href="#section-7.16.4">section 7.16.4</a>) set to either: ConsCancelled
      or Unspecified.

   On receiving a TPO Selection IOTP Message (see below) the Merchant
   may either:

   o  generate and send an Offer Response IOTP Message back to the
      Consumer, or

   o  indicate failure to continue with the IOTP Transaction by sending
      a Cancel Block back to the Consumer containing a Status Component
      with a StatusType of Offer, a ProcessState of Failed and the
      CompletionCode (see <a href="#section-7.16.4">section 7.16.4</a>) set to either: MerchCancelled
      or Unspecified.

   On receiving an Offer Response IOTP Message (see below) the Consumer
   may either:

   o  generate and send the next IOTP Message in the IOTP transaction
      and send it to the required Trading Role. This is dependent on the
      IOTP Transaction, or

   o  indicate failure to continue with the IOTP Transaction by sending
      a Cancel Block back to the Merchant containing a Status Component
      with a StatusType of Offer, a ProcessState of Failed and the
      CompletionCode (see <a href="#section-7.16.4">section 7.16.4</a>) set to either: ConsCancelled
      or Unspecified.

   If the Merchant receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel block,
   then the Consumer is likely to go to the CancelNetLocn specified on
   the Trading Role Element in the Organisation Component for the
   Merchant.





<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                    [Page 197]</span></pre>

   If the Consumer receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel block,
   then the information contained in the IOTP Message should be reported
   to the Consumer but no further action taken.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.1.2.2%20Brand%20Independent%20Offer%20Document%20Exchange"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.1.2.2" name="section-9.1.2.2">9.1.2.2</a> Brand Independent Offer Document Exchange</span>

   In a Brand Independent Offer Document Exchange the TPO Block and the
   Offer Response Block are sent together by the Merchant to the
   Consumer, i.e. there is one IOTP Message that contains both a TPO
   Block, and an Offer Response Block.

   The message flow is illustrated by the diagram below:

 *+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
 Consumer
     |  Merchant
STEP |     |
 1.          Consumer decides to trade and sends to the Merchant
             information (e.g., using HTML) that enables the Merchant
             to create an offer,

     C --&gt; M Offer information - outside scope of IOTP

 2.          Merchant decides which payment brand protocols,
             currencies and amounts apply, places then in a Brand List
             Component inside a TPO Block, creates an Offer Response
             containing details about the IOTP Transaction including
             price, etc., optionally signs it  and sends to Consumer

     C &lt;-- M TPO &amp; OFFER RESPONSE. IotpMsg: Trans Ref Block; Signature
             Block; TPO Block; Offer Response Block

 3.          IOTP aware application started. Consumer selects the
             payment brand, payment protocol and currency/amount to
             use. Records selection in a Brand Selection Component,
             checks offer is OK, combines the Brand Selection
             Component with information from the TPO Block and Offer
             Response Block to create the next IOTP Message for the
             Transaction and sends it together with the Signature
             Block if present to the required Trading Role.

   Note that a Brand Independent Offer Document Exchange always occurs
   when only one payment brand, protocol and currency/amount is being
   offered to the Consumer by the Merchant. It is also likely to, but
   will not necessarily, occur when multiple brands are being offered,
   the Payment Handler is the same, and all brands use the same set of
   protocols.

   Note that the TPO Block and the Offer Response Block can be sent in
   separate IOTP messages (see Brand Dependent Offer Document Exchange)
   even if the Offer Response Block does not change. However this
   increases the number of messages in the transaction and is therefore
   likely to increase transaction response times.

   IOTP aware applications supporting the Consumer Trading Role must
   check for the existence of an Offer Response Block in the first IOTP
   Message to determine whether the Offer Document Exchange is brand
   dependent or not.

   MESSAGE PROCESSING GUIDELINES

   On receiving a TPO and Offer Response IOTP Message (see below), the
   Consumer may either:

   o  generate and send the next IOTP Message in the IOTP transaction
      and send it to the required Trading Role. This is dependent on the
      IOTP Transaction, or

   o  indicate failure to continue with the IOTP Transaction by sending
      a Cancel Block back to the Merchant containing a Status Component
      with a StatusType of Offer, a ProcessState of Failed and the
      CompletionCode (see <a href="#section-7.16.1">section 7.16.1</a>) set to either: ConsCancelled
      or Unspecified.

   If the Merchant receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel block,
   then the Consumer is likely to go to the CancelNetLocn specified on
   the Trading Role Element in the Organisation Component for the
   Merchant.

   The TPO IOTP Message is only used with a Brand Dependent Offer
   Document Exchange. Apart from a Transaction Reference Block (see
   <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a>), this message consists of just a Trading Protocol
   Options Block (see <a href="#section-8.1">section 8.1</a>) which is described below.

   TPO (TRADING PROTOCOL OPTIONS) BLOCK

   The Trading Protocol Options Block (see <a href="#section-8.1">section 8.1</a>) must contain the
   following Trading Components:

   o  one Protocol Options Component which defines the options which
      apply to the whole IOTP Transaction. See <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.

   o  one Brand List Component (see <a href="#section-7.7">section 7.7</a>) for each Payment in the
      IOTP Transaction that contain one or more payment brands and
      protocols which may be selected for use in each payment

   o  Organisation Components (see <a href="#section-7.6">section 7.6</a>) with the following
      roles:

      -  Merchant who is making the offer

      -  Consumer who is carrying out the transaction

      -  the PaymentHandler(s) for the payment. The "ID" of the Payment
         Handler Organisation Component is contained within the PhOrgRef
         attribute of the Payment Component

   If the IOTP Transaction includes a Delivery then the TPO Block must
   also contain:

   o  Organisation Components with the following roles:

      -  DeliveryHandler who will be delivering the goods or services

      -  DelivTo i.e. the person or Organisation which is to take
         delivery

   AUTHENTICATION STATUS AND SIGNATURE BLOCKS

   If the Offer Document Exchange was preceded by an Authentication
   Document Exchange, then the TPO IOTP Message may also contain:

   o  an Authentication Status Block (see <a href="#section-8.6">section 8.6</a>), and

   o  an optional Signature Block (Authentication Status) Signature
      Block

   See <a href="#section-9.1.1.4">section 9.1.1.4</a> Authentication Status IOTP Message for more

   The Payment Document Exchange is a direct implementation of the last
   part of a Payment Trading Exchange (see <a href="#section-2.2.2">section 2.2.2</a>) after the
   Brand has been selected by the Consumer. A Payment Exchange consists
   of:

   o  the Consumer requesting that a payment starts by generating
      Payment Request IOTP Message using information from previous IOTP
      Messages in the Transaction and then sending it to the Payment
      Handler

   o  the Payment Handler and the Consumer then swapping Payment
      Exchange IOTP Messages encapsulating payment protocol messages
      until the payment is complete, and finally

   o  the Payment Handler sending a Payment Response IOTP Message to the
      Consumer containing a receipt for the payment.

   The IOTP Messages which are involved are illustrated by the diagram
   below.

   Consumer
     |  Payment
     |  Handler
STEP |     |
 1.          Consumer generates Pay Request Block encapsulating a
             payment protocol message if required and sends to Payment
             Handler with the Signature Block if present

     C --&gt; P PAYMENT REQUEST. IotpMsg: Trans Ref Block; Signature
             Block (optional); Pay Request Block

 2.          Payment Handler processes Pay Request Block, checks
             optional signature and starts exchanging payment protocol
             messages encapsulated in a Pay Exchange Block, with the
             Consumer

     C &lt;-&gt; P PAYMENT EXCHANGE. IotpMsg: Trans Ref Block; Pay Exchange
             Block

 3.          Consumer and Payment Handler keep on exchanging Payment
             Exchange blocks until eventually payment protocol
             messages finish so Payment Handler creates a Pay Receipt
             Component inside a Pay Response Block, and an optional
             Signature Component inside a Signature Block, sends them
             to the Consumer and stops.

     C &lt;-- P PAYMENT RESPONSE. IotpMsg: Trans Ref Block; Signature
             Block (optional); Pay Response Block

 4.          Consumer checks Payment Response is OK. Optionally keeps
             information on IOTP Transaction for record keeping
             purposes and either stops or creates the next IOTP
             message for the Transaction and sends it together with
             the Signature Block, if present, to the required Trading
             Role

   On receiving a Payment Request IOTP Message, the Payment Handler
   should check that they are authorised to carry out the Payment (see
   <a href="#section-6">section 6</a> Digital Signatures). They may then either:

   o  generate and send a Payment Exchange IOTP Message back to the
      Consumer, if more payment protocol messages need to be exchanged,
      or

   o  generate and send a Payment Response IOTP Message if the exchange
      of payment protocol messages is complete, or

   o  indicate failure to continue with the Payment by sending a Cancel
      Block back to the Consumer containing a Status Component with a
      StatusType of Payment, a ProcessState of Failed and the
      CompletionCode (see <a href="#section-7.16.4">section 7.16.4</a>) set to either: BrandNotSupp,
      CurrNotSupp, PaymtCancelled, AuthError, InsuffFunds,
      InstBrandInvalid, InstNotValid, BadInstrument or Unspecified.

   On receiving a Payment Exchange IOTP Message, the Consumer may
   either:

   o  generate and send a Payment Exchange Message back to the Payment
      Handler or

   o  indicate failure to continue with the Payment by sending a Cancel
      Block back to the Payment Handler containing a Status Component
      with a StatusType of Payment, a ProcessState of Failed and the
      CompletionCode (see <a href="#section-7.16.2">section 7.16.2</a>) set to either: ConsCancelled
      or Unspecified.

   On receiving a Payment Exchange IOTP Message, the Payment Handler may
   either:

   o  generate and send a Payment Exchange IOTP Message back to the
      Consumer, if more payment protocol messages need to be exchanged,
      or

   o  generate and send a Payment Response IOTP Message if the exchange

   On receiving a Payment Response IOTP Message, the Consumer may
      either:

   o  generate and send the next IOTP Message in the IOTP transaction
      and send it to the required Trading Role. This is dependent on the
      IOTP Transaction,

   o  stop, since the IOTP Transaction has ended, or

   o  indicate failure to continue with the IOTP Transaction by sending
      a Cancel Block back to the Merchant containing a Status Component
      with a StatusType of Payment, a ProcessState of Failed and the
      CompletionCode (see <a href="#section-7.16.1">section 7.16.1</a>) set to either: ConsCancelled
      or Unspecified.

   If the Consumer receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel block,
   then the information contained in the IOTP Message should be reported
   to the Consumer but no further action taken.

   If the Payment Handler receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel
   block, then the Consumer is likely to go to the CancelNetLocn
   specified on the Trading Role Element in the Organisation Component
   for the Payment Handler from which any further action may take place.

   If the Merchant receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel block,
   then the Consumer should have completed the payment but not
   continuing with the transaction for some reason. In this case the
   Consumer is likely to go to the CancelNetLocn specified on the
   Trading Role Element in the Organisation Component for the Merchant
   from which any further action may take place.

   The Delivery Document Exchange is a direct implementation of a
   Delivery Trading Exchange (see <a href="#section-2.2.3">section 2.2.3</a>). It consists of:

   o  the Consumer requesting a Delivery by generating Delivery Request
      IOTP Message using information from previous IOTP Messages in the
      Transaction and then sending it to the Delivery Handler

   o  the Delivery Handler sending a Delivery Response IOTP Message to
      the Consumer containing details about the Handler's response to
      the request together with an optional signature.

   On receiving a Delivery Request IOTP Message, the Delivery Handler
   should check that they are authorised to carry out the Delivery (see
   <a href="#section-6">section 6</a> Digital Signatures). They may then either:

   o  generate and send a Delivery Response IOTP Message to the
      Consumer, or

   o  indicate failure to continue with the Delivery by sending a Cancel
      Block back to the Consumer containing a Status Component with a
      StatusType of Delivery, a ProcessState of Failed and the
      CompletionCode (see <a href="#section-7.16.4">section 7.16.4</a>) set to either: DelivCanceled,
      or Unspecified.

   On receiving a Delivery Response IOTP Message, the Consumer should
   just stop since the IOTP Transaction is complete.

   If the Consumer receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel block,
   then the information contained in the IOTP Message should be reported
   to the Consumer but no further action taken.

   The Delivery Request IOTP Message consists of:

   o  a Delivery Request Block, and

   o  an optional Signature Block

   DELIVERY REQUEST BLOCK

   The Delivery Request Block (see <a href="#section-8.10">section 8.10</a>) contains:

   o  the following components copied from the Offer Response Block:

      -  the Status Component (see <a href="#section-7.16">section 7.16</a>)

      -  the Order Component (see <a href="#section-7.5">section 7.5</a>)

      -  the Organisation Component (see <a href="#section-7.6">section 7.6</a>) with the roles of:

   o  the following Component from the Payment Response Block:

      -  the Status Component (see <a href="#section-7.16">section 7.16</a>).

   o  zero or more Trading Role Data Components (see <a href="#section-7.17">section 7.17</a>).

   SIGNATURE BLOCK (DELIVERY REQUEST)

   If the preceding Offer Document Exchange included an Offer Response
   Signature or the Payment Document Exchange included a Payment
   Response Signature, then they should both be copied to the Signature
   Block.

   The Payment and Delivery Document Exchange is a combination of the
   last part of the Payment Trading Exchange (see <a href="#section-2.2.2">section 2.2.2</a>) and a
   Delivery Trading Exchange (see <a href="#section-2.2.3">section 2.2.3</a>). It consists of:

   o  the Consumer requesting that a payment starts by generating
      Payment Request IOTP Message using information from previous IOTP
      Messages in the Transaction and then sending it to the Payment
      Handler

   o  the Payment Handler and the Consumer then swapping Payment
      Exchange IOTP Messages encapsulating payment protocol messages
      until the payment is complete, and finally

   o  the Payment Handler sending to the Consumer in one IOTP Message:

      -  a Payment Response Block containing a receipt for the payment,
         and

 Consumer
     |  Payment
     |  Handler
STEP |     |
 1.          Consumer generates Pay Request Block encapsulating a
             payment protocol message if required and sends to Payment
             Handler with the Signature Block if present

     C --&gt; P PAYMENT REQUEST. IotpMsg: Trans Ref Block; Signature
             Block; Pay Request Block

 2.          Payment Handler processes Pay Request Block, checks
             optional signature and starts exchanging payment protocol
             messages encapsulated in a Pay Exchange Block, with the
             Consumer

     C &lt;-&gt; P PAYMENT EXCHANGE. IotpMsg: Trans Ref Block; Pay Exchange
             Block

 3.          Consumer and Payment Handler keep on exchanging Payment
             Exchange blocks until eventually payment protocol
             messages finish so Payment Handler creates a Pay Receipt
             Component inside a Pay Response Block, and an optional
             Signature Component inside a Signature Block, then uses
             information from the Offer Response Bock to create a
             Delivery Response Block and sends both to the Consumer
             and stops.

 4.          Consumer checks Payment Response and Delivery Response
             Blocks are OK. Optionally keeps information on IOTP
             Transaction for record keeping purposes and either stops
             or creates the next IOTP message for the Transaction and
             sends it together with the Signature Block, if present,
             to the required Trading Role

   The Delivery Response Block and the Payment Response Block may be
   combined into the same IOTP Message only if the Payment Handler has
   the information available so that she can send the Delivery Response
   Block.  This is likely to, but will not necessarily, occur when the
   Merchant, the Payment Handler and the Delivery Handler Roles are
   combined.

   The DelivAndPayResp attribute of the Delivery Component (see <a href="#section-7.13">section</a>
   <a href="#section-7.13">7.13</a>) contained within the Offer Response Block (see <a href="#section-8.3">section 8.3</a>) is
   set to True if the Delivery Response Block and the Payment Response
   Block are combined into the same IOTP Message and is set to False if
   the Delivery Response Block and the Payment Response Block are sent
   in separate IOTP Messages.

   On receiving a Payment Request IOTP Message or a Payment Exchange
   IOTP Message, the Payment Handler should carry out the same actions
   as for a Payment Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.3.1">section 9.1.3.1</a>).

   On receiving a Payment Exchange IOTP Message, the Consumer should
   also carry out the same actions as for a Payment Document Exchange
   (see <a href="#section-9.1.3.1">section 9.1.3.1</a>).

   On receiving a Payment Response and Delivery Response IOTP Message
   then the IOTP Transaction is complete and should take no further
   action.

   If the Consumer receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel block,
   then the information contained in the IOTP Message should be reported
   to the Consumer but no further action taken.

   If the Payment Handler receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel
   block, then the Consumer is likely to go to the CancelNetLocn
   specified on the Trading Role Element in the Organisation Component
   for the Payment Handler from which any further action may take place.

   If the Merchant receives an IOTP Message containing a Cancel block,
   then the Consumer should have completed the payment but not
   continuing with the transaction for some reason. In this case the
   Consumer is likely to go to the CancelNetLocn specified on the
   Trading Role Element in the Organisation Component for the Merchant
   from which any further action may take place.

   A Baseline Authentication IOTP Transaction may occur at any time
   between any of the Trading Roles involved in IOTP Transactions. This
   means it could occur:

   o  before another IOTP Transaction

   o  at the same time as another IOTP Transaction

   o  independently of any other IOTP Transaction.

   The Baseline Authentication IOTP Transaction consists of just an
   Authentication Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.1">section 9.1.1</a>) as illustrated
   by the diagram below.

   Example uses of the Baseline Authentication IOTP Transaction include:

   o  when the Baseline Authentication IOTP Transaction takes place as
      an early part of a session where strong continuity exists. For
      example, a Financial Institution could:

      -  set up a secure channel (e.g., using [SSL/TLS]) with a customer

      -  authenticate the customer using the Baseline Authentication
         IOTP Transaction, and then

      -  provide the customer with access to account information and
         other services with the confidence that they are communicating
         with a bona fide customer.

   o  as a means of providing a Merchant role with Organisation
      Components that contain information about Consumer and DelivTo
      Trading Roles

   o  so that a Consumer may authenticate a Payment Handler before
      starting a payment.

   The Baseline Deposit IOTP Transaction supports the deposit of
   electronic cash with a Financial Institution.

   Note: The Financial Institution has, in IOTP terminology, a role of
   merchant in that a service (i.e. a deposit of electronic cash) is
   being offered in return for a fee, for example bank charges of some
   kind. The term "Financial Institution" is used in the diagrams and in
   the text for clarity.

   The Baseline Deposit IOTP Transaction consists of the following
   Document Exchanges:

   o  an optional Authentication Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.1">section 9.1.1</a>)

   o  an Offer Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.2">section 9.1.2</a>), and

   o  a Payment Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.3">section 9.1.3</a>).

   The way in which these Document Exchanges may be combined together is
   illustrated by the diagram below.

   determine which combination of document exchanges apply to a
   particular instance of an IOTP Transaction

   Note that:

   o  a Merchant (Financial Institution) may be able to accept a deposit
      in several different types of electronic cash although, since the
      Consumer role that is depositing the electronic cash usually knows
      what type of cash they want to deposit, it is usually constrained



<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                    [Page 219]</span></pre>

      in practice to only one type. However, there may be several
      different protocols which may be used for the same "brand" of
      electronic cash. In this case a Brand Dependent Offer may be
      appropriate to negotiate the protocol to be used.

   o  the Merchant (Financial Institution) may use the results of the
      authentication to identify not only the consumer but also the
      account to which the payment is to be deposited. If no single
      account can be identified, then it must be obtained by other
      means. For example:

      -  the consumer could specify the account number prior to the
         Baseline Deposit IOTP Transaction starting, or

      -  the consumer could have been identified earlier, for example
         using a Baseline Authentication IOTP Transaction, and an
         account selected from a list provided by the Financial
         Institution.

   o  The Baseline Deposit IOTP Transaction without an Authentication
      Document Exchange might be used:

      -  if a previous IOTP transaction, for example a Baseline
         Withdrawal or a Baseline Authentication, authenticated the
         consumer, and a secure channel has been maintained, therefore
         the authenticity of the consumer is known

      -  if authentication is achieved as part of a proprietary payment
         protocol and is therefore included in the Payment Document
         Exchange

      -  if authentication of the consumer has been achieved by some
         other means outside of the scope of IOTP, for example, by using
         a pass phrase, or a proprietary banking software solution.

   The Baseline Purchase IOTP Transaction supports the purchase of goods
   or services using any payment method. It consists of the following

   In business terms the refund process typically consists of:

   o  a request for a refund being made by the Consumer to the Merchant,
      typically supported by evidence to demonstrate:

      -  the original trade took place, for example by providing a
         receipt for the original transaction

      -  using some type of authentication, that the consumer requesting
         the refund is the consumer, or a representative of the
         consumer, who carried out the original trade

      -  the reason why the merchant should make the refund

   o  the merchant agreeing (or not) to the refund. This may involve
      some negotiation between the Consumer and the Merchant, and, if
      the merchant agrees,

   o  a refund payment by the Merchant to the Consumer.

   The Baseline Refund IOTP Transaction supports a subset of the above,
   specifically it supports:

   o  stand alone authentication of the Consumer using a separate
      Baseline Authentication IOTP Transaction (see <a href="#section-9.1.6">section 9.1.6</a>)

   o  a refund payment by the Merchant to the Consumer using the
      following two Trading Exchanges:

      -  an optional Authentication Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.1">section</a>

   Exchange might be used:

   o  when authentication of the consumer has been achieved by some
      other means, for example, the consumer has entered some previously
      supplied code in order to identify herself and the refund to which
      the code applies. The code could be supplied, for example on a web
      page or by e-mail.

   The Baseline Withdrawal IOTP Transaction supports the withdrawal of
   electronic cash from a Financial Institution.

   Note: The Financial Institution has, in IOTP terminology, a role of
   merchant in that a service (i.e. a withdrawal of electronic cash) is
   being offered in return for a fee, for example bank charges of some
   kind. The term "Financial Institution" is used in the diagrams and in
   the text for clarity.

   The Baseline Withdrawal IOTP Transaction consists of the following
   Document Exchanges:

   o  an optional Authentication Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.1">section 9.1.1</a>)

   o  an Offer Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.2">section 9.1.2</a>), and

   o  a Payment Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.3">section 9.1.3</a>).

   The way in which these Document Exchanges may be combined together is
   illustrated by the diagram below.

   Note that:

   o  a Merchant (Financial Institution) may be able to offer withdrawal
      of several different types of electronic cash. In practice usually
      only one form of electronic cash may be offered. However, there
      may be several different protocols which may be used for the same
      "brand" of electronic cash.

   o  the Merchant (Financial Institution) may use the results of the
      authentication to identify not only the consumer but also the
      account from which the withdrawal is to be made. If no single
      account can be identified, then it must be obtained by other
      means. For example:

      -  the consumer could specify the account number prior to the
         Baseline Withdrawal IOTP Transaction starting, or

      -  the consumer could have been identified earlier, for example
         using a Baseline Authentication IOTP Transaction, and an
         account selected from a list provided by the Financial
         Institution.

   o  a Baseline Withdrawal without an authentication might be used:

      -  if a previous IOTP transaction, for example a Baseline Deposit
         or a Baseline Authentication, authenticated the consumer, and a
         secure channel has been maintained, therefore the authenticity
         of the consumer is known

      -  if authentication is achieved as part of a proprietary payment
         protocol and is therefore included in the Payment Document
         Exchange

      -  if authentication of the consumer has been achieved by some
         other means, for example, by using a pass phrase, or a
         proprietary banking software solution.

   The Baseline Value Exchange Transaction uses Payment Document
   Exchanges to support the exchange of value in one currency obtained
   using one payment method with value in the same or another currency
   using the same or another payment method. Examples of its use
   include:

   o  electronic cash advance on a credit card. For example the first
      payment could be a "dollar SET Payment" using a credit card with
      the second payment being a download of Visa Cash e-cash in
      dollars.

   o  foreign exchange using the same payment method. For example the
      payment could be an upload of Mondex value in British Pounds and
      the second a download of Mondex value in Euros

   o  foreign exchange using different payment methods. For example the
      first payment could be a SET payment in Canadian Dollars followed
      a download of GeldKarte in Deutchmarks.

   The Baseline Value Exchange uses the following Document Exchanges:

   o  an optional Authentication Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.1">section 9.1.1</a>)

   o  an Offer Document Exchange (see <a href="#section-9.1.2">section 9.1.2</a>), which provides
      details of what values and currencies will be exchanged, and

   o  two Payment Document Exchanges (see <a href="#section-9.1.3">section 9.1.3</a>) which carry out
      the two payments involved.

   The way in which these Document Exchanges may be combined together is
   illustrated by the diagram below.

   The Baseline Value Exchange IOTP Transaction occurs in two basic
   forms:

   o  Brand Dependent Value Exchange. Where the content of the offer,
      for example the rate at which one form of value is exchanged for
      another, is dependent on the payment brands and protocols selected
      by the consumer, and

   o  Brand Independent Value Exchange. Where the content of the offer
      is not dependent on the payment brands and protocols selected.

   Note: In the above the role is a Merchant even though the
   Organisation carrying out the Value Exchange may be a Bank or some
   other Financial Institution. This is because the Bank is acting as a
   merchant in that they are making an offer which the Consumer can
   either accept or decline.

   The TPO Block and Offer Response Block may only be combined into the
   same IOTP Message if the content of the Offer Response Block does not
   change as a result of selecting the payment brands and payment
   protocols to be used in the Value Exchange.

   BASELINE VALUE EXCHANGE SIGNATURES

   The use of signatures to ensure the integrity of a Baseline Value
   Exchange is illustrated by the diagram below.

   In the previous sections an Authentication Document Exchange is shown
   preceding an Offer Document Exchange as part of a single IOTP
   Transaction with the same IOTP Transaction Id.

   It is also possible to run a separate Authentication Transaction at
   any point, even in parallel with another IOTP Transaction. Typically
   this will be used:

   o  by a Consumer to authenticate a Merchant, Payment Handler or a
      Delivery Handler, or

   o  by a Payment Handler or Delivery Handler to authenticate a
      Consumer.

   In outline the basic process consists of:

   o  the Trading Role that decides it wants to carry out an
      authentication of another role suspends the current IOTP
      transaction being carried out

   o  a stand-alone Authentication transaction is then carried out. This
      may, at implementer's option, be linked to the original IOTP
      Transaction using a Related To Component (see <a href="#section-3.3.3">section 3.3.3</a>) in
      the Transaction Reference Block.

   o  if the Authentication transaction is successful, then the original
      IOTP Transaction is restarted

   o  if the Authentication fails then the original IOTP Transaction is
      cancelled.

   For example, a Consumer could:

   o  authenticate the Payment Handler for a Payment between receiving
      an Offer Response from a Merchant and before sending the Payment
      Request to that Payment Handler

   o  authenticate a Delivery Handler for a Delivery between receiving
      the Payment Response from a Payment Handler and before sending the
      Delivery Request

   A Payment Handler could authenticate a Consumer after receiving the
   Payment Request and before sending the next Payment related message.

   A Delivery Handler could authenticate a Consumer after receiving the
   Delivery Request and before sending the Delivery Response.

   Note: Some Payment Methods may carry out an authentication within the
   Payment Exchange. In this case the information required to carry out
   the authentication will be included in Payment Scheme Components.

   In this instance IOTP aware application will not be aware that an
   authentication has occurred since the Payment Scheme Components that
   contain authentication request information will be indistinguishable
   from other Payment Scheme Components.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.2%20Infrastructure%20Transactions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.2" name="section-9.2">9.2</a> Infrastructure Transactions</span>

   Infrastructure Transactions are designed to support inquiries about
   whether or not a transaction has succeeded or a Trading Role's
   servers are operating correctly. There are two types of transaction:

   o  a Transaction Status Inquiry Transaction which provides
      information on the status of an existing or complete IOTP
      transaction, and

   o  Ping Transaction that enables one IOTP aware application to
      determine if the IOTP aware application at another Trading Role is
      operating and verify whether or not signatures can be handled.

   Each of these is described below

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.2.1%20Baseline%20Transaction%20Status%20Inquiry%20IOTP%20Transaction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.2.1" name="section-9.2.1">9.2.1</a> Baseline Transaction Status Inquiry IOTP Transaction</span>

   The Baseline IOTP Transaction Status Inquiry provides information on
   the status of an existing or complete IOTP transaction.

   The Trading Blocks used by the Baseline Transaction Status Inquiry
   Transaction are:

   o  an Inquiry Request Trading Block (see <a href="#section-8.12">section 8.12</a>),

   o  an Inquiry Response Trading Block (see <a href="#section-8.13">section 8.13</a>)

   o  an optional Signature Block (see <a href="#section-8.16">section 8.16</a>).

   The Inquiry IOTP Transaction can be used for a variety of reasons.
   For example:

   o  to help in resuming a suspended transaction to determine the
      current state of processing of one of the other roles,




<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                    [Page 235]</span></pre>

   o  for a merchant to determine if a payment, delivery, etc., was
      completed.  For example, a Consumer might claim that payment was
      made but no signed IOTP payment receipt was available to prove it.
      If the Merchant makes an inquiry of the Payment Handler then the
      Merchant can determine whether or not payment was made.

   Note: Inquiries on Baseline Ping IOTP Transactions (see <a href="#section-9.2.2">section</a>
   <a href="#section-9.2.2">9.2.2</a>) are ignored.

   MAKING INQUIRIES OF ANOTHER TRADING ROLE

   One Trading Role may make an inquiry of any other Trading Role at any
   point in time.

   IOTP aware software that supports the Consumer Trading Role may not:

   o  digitally sign a response if requested, since it may not have the
      capability, or

   o  respond to an Inquiry Request at all since it may not be on-line,
      or may consider that the request is not reasonable since, for
      example, the Request was not digitally signed.

   As a guideline:

   o  the Consumer should send a Transaction Status Inquiry Block to a
      Trading Role only after the following events have occurred:

      - to the Merchant, after sending a TPO Selection Block,

      - to the Payment Handler, after sending a Payment Request Block,

      - to the Delivery Handler, after sending a Delivery Request Block,

   o  other Trading Roles should send a Transaction Status Inquiry Block
      to the Consumer only after receiving a message from the Consumer
      and before sending the final "Response" message to the Consumer

   o  there are no restrictions on non-Consumer Trading Roles sending
      Inquiries to other trading roles.

   TRANSACTION STATUS INQUIRY TRANSPORT SESSION

   For a Transaction Status Inquiry on an ongoing transaction a
   different transport session from the ongoing transaction is used. For
   a Transaction Status Inquiry on a past transaction, how the IOTP

   module on the software at the Trading Role is started upon the

   Transport supplement for IOTP.

   TRANSACTION STATUS INQUIRY ERROR HANDLING

   Errors in a Transaction Status Inquiry can be categorised into one of
   the following three cases:

   o  Business errors (see <a href="#section-4.2">section 4.2</a>) in the original (inquired)
      messages

   o  Technical errors (see <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>) - both IOTP and payment scheme
      specific ones - in the original IOTP (inquired) messages

   o  Technical errors in the message containing the Inquiry Request
      Block itself

   The following outlines what the software should do in each case

   BUSINESS ERRORS IN THE ORIGINAL MESSAGES

   Return an Inquiry Response Block containing the Status Component
   which was last sent to the Consumer Role.

   TECHNICAL ERRORS IN THE ORIGINAL MESSAGES

   Return an Inquiry Response Block containing a Status Component. The
   Status Component should contain a ProcessState attribute set to
   ProcessError. In this case send back an Error Block indicating where
   the error was found in the original message.

   TECHNICAL ERRORS IN THE INQUIRY REQUEST BLOCK

   Return an Error message. That is, send back an Error Block containing
   the Error Code (see <a href="#section-7.21.2">section 7.21.2</a>) which describes the nature of the
   error in the Inquiry Request message.

   The remainder of this sub-section on the Baseline Transaction Status
   Inquiry IOTP Transaction defines the contents of each Trading Block.
   Note that the term "original transaction" is the transaction which a
   trading role wants to discover some information about.

   TRANSACTION REFERENCE BLOCK

   A Trading Role making an inquiry must use a Transaction Id Component
   (see <a href="#section-3.3.1">section 3.3.1</a>) where both the IotpTransId and TransTimeStamp
   attributes are the same as in the Transaction Id Component of the
   original transaction that is being inquired upon. The IotpTransId
   attribute in this component serves as the key in querying the

   transaction logs maintained at the Trading Role's site. The value of
   the ID attribute of the Message Id Component should be different from
   those of any in the original transaction (see <a href="#section-3.4.1">section 3.4.1</a>).

   If up-to-date status information is required then the MsgId
   Component, and in particular the ID attribute for the MsgId Component
   must be different from any other IOTP Message that has been sent by
   the Trading Role. This is required because of the way that
   Idempotency is handled by IOTP (see <a href="#section-4.5.2.2">section 4.5.2.2</a> Checking/Handling
   Duplicate Messages).

   INQUIRY REQUEST BLOCK

   The Inquiry Request Block (see <a href="#section-8.12">section 8.12</a>) contains the following
   components:

   o  one Inquiry Type Component (see <a href="#section-7.18">section 7.18</a>). This identifies
      whether the inquiry is on an offer, payment, or delivery.

   o  zero or one Payment Scheme Components (see <a href="#section-7.10">section 7.10</a>). This is
      for encapsulating payment scheme specific inquiry messages for
      inquiries on a payment.

   SIGNATURE BLOCK (INQUIRY REQUEST)

   If a signature block is present on the message containing the Inquiry
   Request Block then it may be checked to determine if the Inquiry
   Request is authorised.

   If present, the Inquiry Request Signature Block (see <a href="#section-8.12">section 8.12</a>)
   contains the following components:

   o  one Signature Component (see <a href="#section-7.19">section 7.19</a>)

   o  one or more Certificate Components, if required.

   Inquiry Response Blocks should only be generated if the Transaction
   is authorised.

   Note: Digital signatures on an Inquiry Request is only likely to
   occur if the recipient of the request expects the Inquiry Request to
   be signed. In this version of IOTP this will require some kind of
   pre-existing agreement. This means that:

   o  Consumers are unlikely to generate requests with signatures,
      although it is not an error if they do

   o  the other trading roles may agree that digital signatures are
      required. For example a Payment Handler may require that an
      Inquiry Request is digitally signed by the Merchant so that they
      can check that the request is valid.

   On the other hand if the original transaction to which the Inquiry
   relates was carried out over a secure channel (e.g., [SSL]) then it
   is probably reasonable to presume that if the sender of the Inquiry
   knows the Transaction Id component of the original message (including
   for example the timestamp) then the inquiry is likely to be genuine.

   INQUIRY RESPONSE BLOCK

   The Inquiry Response Block (see <a href="#section-8.13">section 8.13</a>) contains the following
   components:

   o  one Status Component (see <a href="#section-7.16">section 7.16</a>). This component holds the
      status information on the inquired transaction,

   o  zero or one Payment Scheme Components. These contain encapsulated
      payment scheme specific inquiry messages for inquiries on payment.

   SIGNATURE BLOCK (INQUIRY RESPONSE)

   If a signature block is present on the message containing the Inquiry
   Response Block then it may be checked by the receiver of the block to
   determine if the Inquiry Response is valid.

   If present, the Inquiry Response Signature Block (see <a href="#section-8.13">section 8.13</a>)
   contains the following components:

   o one Signature Component (see <a href="#section-7.19">section 7.19</a>)

   o one or more Certificate Components, if required.

   Note: Digital signatures on an Inquiry Response is only likely to
   occur if the recipient of the response expects the Inquiry Request to

   The purpose of the Baseline IOTP Ping Transaction is to test basic
   connectivity between the Trading Roles that may take part in an IOTP
   Transaction.

   It enables IOTP aware application software to:

   o  determine if the IOTP aware application at another Trading Role is
      operating, and

   o  verify whether or not the two trading roles signatures can be
      processed.

   For example it can be used by a Merchant to determine if a Payment
   Handler or Delivery Handler is up and running prior to starting a
   Purchase transaction that uses those trading roles.

   The Trading Blocks used by the Baseline Ping IOTP Transaction are:

   o a Ping Request Block (see <a href="#section-8.14">section 8.14</a>)

   o a Ping Response Block (see <a href="#section-8.15">section 8.15</a>), and

   o a Signature Block (see <a href="#section-8.16">section 8.16</a>).

                      Figure 33 Baseline Ping Messages

   The verification that signatures can be handled is indicated by the
   sender of the Ping Request Block including:

   o  Organisation Components that identify itself and the intended
      recipient of the Ping Request Block, and

   o  a Signature Block that signs data in the Ping Request.

   In this way the receiver of the Ping Request:

   o  knows who is sending the Ping Request and can therefore verify the
      Signature on the Request, and

   o  knows who to generate a signature for on the Ping Response.

   Note that a Ping Request:

   o  does not affect any on-going transaction

      transaction messages such as TPO or Transaction Status Inquiry.

   All IOTP aware applications must return a Ping Response message to
   the sender of a Ping Request message when it is received.

   A Baseline IOTP Ping request can also contain an optional Signature
   Block. IOTP aware applications can, for example, use the Signature
   Block to check the recipient of a Ping Request can successfully
   process and check signatures it has received.

   For each Baseline Ping IOTP Transaction, each IOTP role shall
   establish a different transport session from other IOTP transactions.

   Any IOTP Trading Role can send a Ping request to any other IOTP
   Trading Role at any time it wants. A Ping message has its own
   IotpTransId, which is different from other IOTP transactions.

   The remainder of this sub-section on the Baseline Ping IOTP
   Transaction defines the contents of each Trading Block.

   TRANSACTION REFERENCE BLOCK

   The IotpTransId of a Ping transaction should be different from any
   other IOTP transaction.

   PING REQUEST BLOCK

   If the Ping Transaction is anonymous then no Organisation Components
   are included in the Ping Request Block (see <a href="#section-8.7">section 8.7</a>).

   If the Ping Transaction is not anonymous then the Ping Request Block
   contains Organisation Components for:

   o  the sender of the Ping Request Block, and

   o  the verifier of the Signature Component

   If Organisation Components are present, then it indicates that the
   sender of the Ping Request message has generated a Signature Block.
   The signature block must be verified by the Trading Role that
   receives the Ping Request Block.

   SIGNATURE BLOCK (PING REQUEST)

   The Ping Request Signature Block (see <a href="#section-8.16">section 8.16</a>) contains the
   following components:

   One of the key features of IOTP is the ability for a merchant to
   offer a list of Brands from which a consumer may make a selection.
   This section provides an overview of what is involved and provides
   guidance on how selection of a brand and associated payment
   instrument can be carried out by a Consumer. It covers:

   o  definitions of Payment Instruments and Brands - what are Payment
      Instruments and Brands in an IOTP context. Further categorises
      Brands as optionally a "Dual Brand" or a "Promotional Brand",

   o  identification and selection of Promotional Brands - Promotional
      Brands offer a Consumer some additional benefit, for example
      loyalty points or a discount. This means that both Consumers and
      Merchant must be able to correctly identify that a valid
      Promotional Brand is being used.

   A Payment Instrument is the means by which a Consumer pays for goods
   or services offered by a Merchant. It can be, for example:

   o  a credit card such as MasterCard or Visa;

   o  a debit card such as MasterCard's Maestro;

   o  a smart card based electronic cash payment instrument such as a
      Mondex Card, a GeldKarte card or a Visa Cash card

   o  a software based electronic payment account such as a CyberCash or
      DigiCash account.

   Most Payment Instruments have a number, typically an account number,
   by which the Payment Instrument can be identified.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.1.2%20Definition%20of%20Brand"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.1.2" name="section-11.1.2">11.1.2</a> Definition of Brand</span>

   A Brand is the mark which identifies a particular type of Payment
   Instrument. A list of Brands are the payment options which are
   presented by the Merchant to the Consumer and from which the Consumer
   makes a selection. Each Brand may have a different Payment Handler.
   Examples of Brands include:

   o  payment association and proprietary Brands, for example
      MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Diners Club, Mondex,
      GeldKarte, CyberCash, etc.

   o  promotional brands (see below). These include:

      -  store brands, where the Payment Instrument is issued to a
         Consumer by a particular Merchant, for example Walmart, Sears,
         or Marks and Spencer (UK)

      -  cobrands, for example American Advantage Visa, where an
         Organisation uses their own brand in conjunction with,
         typically, a payment association Brand.

   A Dual Brand means that a single payment instrument may be used as if
   it were two separate Brands. For example there could be a single
   Japanese "UC" MasterCard which can be used as either a UC card or a
   regular MasterCard. The UC card Brand and the MasterCard Brand could
   each have their own separate Payment Handlers. This means that:

   o  the merchant treats, for example "UC" and "MasterCard" as two
      separate Brands when offering a list of Brands to the Consumer,

   o  the consumer chooses a Brand, for example either "UC" or
      "MasterCard,

   o  the consumer IOTP aware application determines which Payment
      Instrument(s) match the chosen Brand, and selects, perhaps with
      user assistance, the correct Payment Instrument to use.

   Note: Dual Brands need no special treatment by the Merchant and
   therefore no explicit reference is made to Dual Brands in the DTD.
   This is because, as far as the Merchant is concerned, each Brand in a
   Dual Brand is treated as a separate Brand. It is at the Consumer,
   that the matching of a Brand to a Dual Brand Payment Instrument needs
   to be done.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.1.4%20Definition%20of%20Promotional%20Brand"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.1.4" name="section-11.1.4">11.1.4</a> Definition of Promotional Brand</span>

   A Promotional Brand means that, if the Consumer pays with that Brand,
   then the Consumer will receive some additional benefit which can be
   received in two ways:

   o  at the time of purchase. For example if a Consumer pays with a
      "Walmart MasterCard" at a Walmart web site, then a 5% discount
      might apply, which means the consumer actually pays less,

   o  from their Payment Instrument (card) issuer when the payment
      appears on their statement. For example loyalty points in a
      frequent flyer scheme could be awarded based on the total payments
      made with the Payment Instrument since the last statement was
      issued.

   Note that:

   o  the first example (obtaining the benefit at the time of purchase),
      requires that:

      -  the Consumer is informed of the benefits which arise if that
         Brand is selected



<span class="grey">Burdett                      Informational                    [Page 248]</span></pre>

      -  if the Brand is selected, the Merchant changes the relevant
         IOTP Components in the Offer Response to reflect the correct
         amount to be paid

   o  the second (obtaining a benefit through the Payment Instrument
      issuer) does not require that the Offer Response is changed

   o  each Promotional Brand should be identified as a separate Brand in
      the list of Brands offered by the Merchant. For example:

   There are two problems which need to handled in identifying
   Promotional Brands:

   o  how does the Merchant or their Payment Handler positively identify
      the promotional brand being used at the time of purchase

   o  how does the Consumer reliably identify the correct promotional
      brand from the Brand List presented by the Merchant

   The following is a description of how this could be achieved.

   Note: Please note that the approach described here is a model
   approach that solves the problem. Other equivalent methods may be
   used.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.1.5.1%20Merchant%2FPayment%20Handler%20Identification%20of%20Promotional%20Brands"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.1.5.1" name="section-11.1.5.1">11.1.5.1</a> Merchant/Payment Handler Identification of Promotional Brands</span>

   Correct identification that the Consumer is paying using a
   Promotional Brand is important since a Consumer might fraudulently
   claim to have a Promotional Brand that offers a reduced payment
   amount when in reality they do not.

   Two approaches seem possible:

   o  use some feature of the Payment Instrument or the payment method
      to positively identify the Brand being used. For example, the SET
      certificate for the Brand could be used, if one is available, or

   o  use the Payment Instrument (card) number to look up information
      about the Payment Instrument on a Payment Instrument issuer
      database to determine if the Payment Instrument is a promotional
      brand.

   Note that:

   o  the first assumes that SET is available.

   o  the second is only possible if the Merchant, or alternatively the
      Payment Handler, has access to card issuer information.

   IOTP does not provide the Merchant with Payment Instrument
   information (e.g., a card or account number). This is only sent as
   part of the encapsulated payment protocol to a Payment Handler. This
   means that:

   o  the Merchant would have to assume that the Payment Instrument
      selected was a valid Promotional Brand, or

   o  the Payment Handler would have to check that the Payment
      Instrument was for the valid Promotional Brand and fail the
      payment if it was not.

   A Payment Handler checking that a brand is a valid Promotional Brand
   is most likely if the Payment Handler is also the Card Issuer.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.1.5.2%20Consumer%20Selection%20of%20Promotional%20Brands"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.1.5.2" name="section-11.1.5.2">11.1.5.2</a> Consumer Selection of Promotional Brands</span>

   Two ways by which a Consumer can correctly select a Promotional Brand
   are:

   o  the Consumer visually matching a logo for the Promotional Brand
      which has been provided to the Consumer by the Merchant,

   o  the Consumer's IOTP aware application matching a code for the
      Promotional Brand which the application has registered against a
      similar code contained in the list of Brands offered by the
      Merchant.

   In the latter case, the code contained in the Consumer wallet must
   match exactly the code in the list offered by the Merchant otherwise
   no match will be found. Ways in which the Consumer's IOTP Aware
   Application could obtain such a code include:

   o  the Consumer types the code in directly. This is error prone and
      not user friendly, also the consumer needs to be provided with the
      code.  This approach is not recommended,

   o  using one of the Brand Identifiers defined by IOTP and pre-loaded
      into the Consumers IOTP Aware application or wallet by the
      developer of the Wallet,

   o  using some information contained in the software or other data
      associated with the Payment Instrument. This could be:

      -  a SET certificate for Brands which use this payment method

      -  a code provided by the payment software which handles the
         particular payment method, this could apply to, for example,
         GeldKarte, Mondex, CyberCash and DigiCash,

   o  the consumer making an initial "manual" link between a Promotional
      Brand in the list of Brands offered by the Merchant and an
      individual Payment Instrument, the first time the promotional
      brand is used. The IOTP Aware application would then "remember"
      the code for the Promotional Brand for use in future purchases.

   New Brand Ids are allocated under IANA procedures (see <a href="#section-12">section 12</a>
   IANA Considerations). Which also contains an initial list of Brand
   Identifiers.

   It is recommended that implementers of consumer IOTP aware
   applications (e.g., software wallets) pre-load their software with
   the then current set of Brand Ids and provide a method by which they
   can be updated. For example, by going to the software developer's web
   site.

   This section describes the codes that are controlled by IANA, and
   also how new codes can be created for testing purposes that are not
   controlled by IANA.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.1%20Codes%20Controlled%20by%20IANA"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.1" name="section-12.1">12.1</a> Codes Controlled by IANA</span>

   To help ensure interoperability, there is a need for codes used by
   IOTP to be maintained in a controlled environment so that their
   meaning and usage are well defined and duplicate codes avoided.
   [<a href="#ref-IANA">IANA</a>] is the mechanism to be used for this purpose as described in
   <a href="rfc2434.html">RFC 2434</a>.

                      With the exception of Algorithms that begin with
                      "pay:", new values are allocated following review
                      on the IETF Trade mailing list and by the

   Note:     The Algorithm element is likely to be eventually defined
   within the [DSIG] name space. It is likely that the maintenance
   procedure defined here may need to vary over time, as the DSIG
   proposals become more widely adopted.

   In addition to the formal development and registration of codes as
   described above, there is still a need for developers to experiment
   using new IOTP codes. For this reason, "user defined codes" may be
   used to identify additional values for the codes contained within
   this specification without the need for them to be registered with
   IANA.

   The definition of a user defined code is as follows:

   user_defined_code ::= ( "x-" | "X-" ) NameChar (NameChar)*

     NameChar           NameChar has the same definition as the [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>]
                        definition of NameChar

   Use of domain names (see [<a href="#ref-DNS" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>DNS</a>]) to make user defined codes unique is
   recommended although this method cannot be relied upon.

          NAME                            DESCRIPTION

   Authenticator      The Organisation which is requesting the
                      authentication of another Organisation, and

   Authenticatee      The Organisation being authenticated by an
                      Authenticator

   Business Error     See Status Component.

   Brand              A Brand is the mark which identifies a particular
                      type of Payment Instrument. A list of Brands are
                      the payment options which are presented by the
                      Merchant to the Consumer and from which the
                      Consumer makes a selection. Each Brand may have a
                      different Payment Handler. Examples of Brands
                      include:
                       o payment association and proprietary Brands,
                         for example MasterCard, Visa, American Express,
                         Diners Club, American Express, Mondex,
                         GeldKarte, CyberCash, etc.
                       o Promotional Brands (see below). These include:
                       o store Brands, where the Payment Instrument is
                         issued to a Consumer by a particular Merchant,
                         for example Walmart, Sears, or Marks and
                         Spencer (UK)
                       o coBrands, for example American Advantage Visa,
                         where an a company uses their own Brand in
                         conjunction with, typically, a payment
                         association Brand.

   Consumer           The Organisation which is to receive the benefit
                      of and typically pay for the goods or services.

   ContentSoftwareId  This contains information which identifies the
                      software which generated the content of the
                      element. Its purpose is to help resolve
                      interoperability problems that might occur as a
                      result of incompatibilities between messages
                      produced by different software. It is a single
                      text string in the language defined by xml:lang.
                      It must contain, as a minimum:
                       o the name of the software manufacturer
                       o the name of the software
                       o the version of the software, and
                       o the build of the software

                      It is recommended that this attribute is included
                      whenever the software which generated the content
                      cannot be identified from the SoftwareId attribute
                      on the Message Id Component (see <a href="#section-3.3.2">section 3.3.2</a>)

   Customer Care      An Organisation that is providing customer care
   Provider           typically on behalf of a Merchant. Examples of
                      customer care include, responding to problems
                      raised by a Consumer arising from an IOTP
                      Transaction that the Consumer took part in.

   Delivery Handler   The Organisation that directly delivers the goods
                      or services to the Consumer on behalf of the
                      Merchant. Delivery can be in the form of either
                      digital goods (e.g., a [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Five: Conformance Criteria and Examples"'>MIME</a>] message), or
                      physically delivered using the post or a courier.

   Document Exchange  A Document Exchange consists of a set of IOTP
                      Messages exchanged between two parties that
                      implement part or all of two Trading Exchanges
                      simultaneously in order to minimise the number of
                      actual IOTP Messages which must be sent over the
                      Internet.

                      Document Exchanges are combined together in
                      sequence to implement a particular IOTP
                      Transaction.

   Dual Brand         A Dual Brand means that a single Payment
                      Instrument may be used as if it were two separate
                      Brands. For example there could be a single
                      Japanese "UC" MasterCard which can be used as

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2801.html">RFC 2801</a>                       IOTP/1.0                       April 2000</span>


                      either a UC card or a regular MasterCard. The UC
                      card Brand and the MasterCard Brand could each
                      have their own separate Payment Handlers. This
                      means that:
                       o the Merchant treats, for example "UC" and
                         "MasterCard" as two separate Brands when
                         offering a list of Brands to the Consumer,
                       o the Consumer chooses a Brand, for example
                         either "UC" or "MasterCard,
                       o the Consumer IOTP aware application determines
                         which Payment Instrument(s) match the chosen
                         Brand, and selects, perhaps with user
                         assistance, the correct Payment Instrument to
                         use.

   Error Block        An Error Block reports that a Technical Error was
                      found in an IOTP Message that was previously
                      received. Typically Technical Errors are caused by
                      errors in the XML which has been received or some
                      technical failure of the processing of the IOTP
                      Message. Frequently the generation or receipt of
                      an Error Block will result in failure of the IOTP
                      Transaction. They are distinct from Business
                      Errors, reported in a Status Component, which can
                      also cause failure of an IOTP Transaction.

   Exchange Block     An Exchange Block is sent between the two Trading
                      Roles involved in a Trading Exchange. It contains
                      one or more Trading Components. Exchange Blocks
                      are always sent after a Request Block and before a
                      Response Block in a Trading Exchange. The content
                      of an Exchange Block is dependent on the type of
                      Trading Exchange being carried out.

   IOTP Message       An IOTP Message is the outermost wrapper for the
                      document(s) which are sent between Trading Roles
                      that are taking part in a trade. It is a well
                      formed XML document. The documents it contains
                      consist of:
                       o a Transaction Reference Block to uniquely
                         identify the IOTP Transaction of which the IOTP
                         Message is part,
                       o an optional Signature Block to digitally sign
                         the Trading Blocks or Trading Components
                         associated with the IOTP Transaction
                       o an optional Error Block to report on technical
                         errors contained in a previously received IOTP
                         Message, and

                       o a collection of IOTP Trading Blocks which
                         carries the data required to carry out an IOTP

   IOTP Transaction   An instance of an Internet Open Trading Protocol
                      Transaction consists of a set of IOTP Messages
                      transferred between Trading Roles. The rules for
                      what may be contained in the IOTP Messages is
                      defined by the Transaction Type of the IOTP
                      Transaction.

   IOTP Transaction   A Transaction Type identifies the type an of IOTP
   Type               Transaction. Examples of Transaction Type include:
                      Purchase, Refund, Authentication, Withdrawal,
                      Deposit (of electronic cash). The Transaction Type
                      specifies for an IOTP Transaction:
                       o the Trading Exchanges which may be included in
                         the transaction,
                       o how those Trading Exchanges may be combined to
                         meet the business needs of the transaction
                       o which Trading Blocks may be included in the
                         IOTP Messages that make up the transaction
                       o Consult this specification for the rules that
                         apply for each Transaction Type.

   Merchant           The Organisation from whom the service or goods
                      are being obtained, who is legally responsible for
                      providing the goods or services and receives the
                      benefit of any payment made

   Merchant Customer  The Organisation that is involved with customer
   Care Provider      dispute negotiation and resolution on behalf of
                      the Merchant

   Organisation       A company or individual that takes part in a Trade
                      as a Trading Role. The Organisations may take one
                      or more of the roles involved in the Trade

   Payment Handler    The Organisation that physically receives the
                      payment from the Consumer on behalf of the
                      Merchant

   Payment            A Payment Instrument is the means by which
   Instrument         Consumer pays for goods or services offered by a
                      Merchant. It can be, for example:
                       o a credit card such as MasterCard or Visa;
                       o a debit card such as MasterCard's Maestro;
                       o a smart card based electronic cash Payment

                         Instrument such as a Mondex Card, a GeldKarte
                         card or a Visa Cash card
                       o a software based electronic payment account
                         such as a CyberCash's CyberCoin or DigiCash
                         account.

                      All Payment Instruments have a number, typically
                      an account number, by which the Payment Instrument
                      can be identified.

   Promotional Brand  A Promotional Brand means that, if the Consumer
                      pays with that Brand, then the Consumer will
                      receive some additional benefit which can be
                      received in two ways:
                       o at the time of purchase. For example if a
                         Consumer pays with a "Walmart MasterCard" at a
                         Walmart web site, then a 5% discount might
                         apply, which means the Consumer actually pays
                         less,
                       o from their Payment Instrument (card) issuer
                         when the payment appears on their statement.
                         For example loyalty points in a frequent flyer
                         scheme could be awarded based on the total
                         payments made with the Payment Instrument since
                         the last statement was issued.

                      Each Promotional Brand should be identified as a
                      separate Brand in the list of Brands offered by
                      the Merchant.

   Receipt Component  A Receipt Component is a record of the successful
                      completion of a Trading Exchange. Examples of
                      Receipt Components include: Payment Receipts, and
                      Delivery Notes. It's content may dependent on the
                      technology used to perform the Trading Exchange.
                      For example a Secure Electronic Transaction (SET)
                      payment receipt consists of SET payment messages
                      which record the result of the payment.

   Request Block      A Request Block is Trading Block that contains a
                      request for a Trading Exchange to start. The
                      Trading Components in a Request Block may be
                      signed by a Signature Block so that their
                      authenticity may be checked and to determine that
                      the Trading Exchange being requested is
                      authorised. Authorisation for a Trading Exchange
                      to start can be provided by the signatures
                      contained on Receipt Components contained in

                      Response Blocks resulting from previously
                      completed Trading Exchanges.  Examples of Request
                      Blocks are Payment Request and Delivery Request

   Response Block     A Response Block is a Trading Block that indicates
                      that a Trading Exchange is complete. It is sent by
                      the Trading Role that received a Request Block to
                      the Trading Role that sent the Request Block. The
                      Response Block contains a Status Component that
                      contains information about the completion of the
                      Trading Exchange, for example it indicates whether
                      or not the Trading Exchange completed
                      successfully. For some Trading Exchanges the
                      Response Block contains a Receipt Component that
                      forms a record of the Trading Exchange. Receipt
                      Components may be digitally signed using a
                      Signature Block to make completion non-refutable.
                      Examples of Response Blocks include Offer
                      Response, Payment Response and Delivery Response.

   Signature Block    A Signature Block is a Trading Block that contains
                      one or more digital signatures in the form of
                      Signature Components. A Signature Component may
                      digitally sign any Block or Component in any IOTP
                      Message in the same IOTP Transaction.

   Status Component   A Status Component contains information that
                      describes the state of a Trading Exchange.

                      Before the Trading Exchange is complete the Status
                      Component can indicate information about how the
                      Trading Exchange is progressing.

                      Once a Trading Exchange is complete the Status
                      Component can only indicate the success of the
                      Trading Exchange or that a Business Error has
                      occurred.

                      A Business Error indicates that continuation with
                      the Trading Exchange was not possible because of
                      some business rule or logic, for example,
                      "insufficient funds available", rather than any
                      Technical Error associated with the content or
                      format of the IOTP Messages in the IOTP
                      Transaction.

   Trading Block      A Trading Block consists of one or more Trading
                      Components. One or more Trading Blocks may be
                      contained within the IOTP Messages which are
                      physically sent in the form of [<a href="#ref-XML">XML</a>] documents
                      between the different Trading Roles that are
                      taking part in a trade. Trading Blocks are of
                      three main types:
                       o a Request Block,
                       o an Exchange Block, or a
                       o a Response Block

   Trading Component  A Trading Component is a collection of XML
                      elements and attributes. Trading Components are
                      the child elements of the Trading Blocks. Examples
                      of Trading Components are: Offer, Brand List,
                      Payment Receipt, Delivery [information], Payment
                      Amount [information]

   Trading Exchange   A Trading Exchange consists of the exchange,
                      between two Trading Roles, of a sequence of
                      documents. The documents may be in the form of
                      Trading Blocks or they may be transferred by some
                      other means, for example through entering data
                      into a web page. Each Trading Exchange consists of
                      three main parts:
                       o the sending of a Request Block by one Trading
                         Role (the initiator) to another Trading Role
                         (the recipient),
                       o the optional exchange of one or more Exchange
                         Blocks between the recipient and the initiator,
                         until eventually,
                       o the Trading Role that received the Request
                         Block sends a Response Block to the initiator.

                      A Trading Exchange is designed to implement a
                      useful service of some kind. Examples of Trading
                      Exchanges/services are:
                       o Offer, which results in a Consumer receiving
                         an offer from a Merchant to carry out a
                         business transaction of some kind,
                       o Payment, where a Consumer makes a payment to a
                         Payment Handler,
                       o Delivery, where a Consumer requests, and
                         optionally obtains, delivery of goods or
                         services from a Delivery Handler, and
                       o Authentication, where any Trading Role may
                         request and receive information about another
                         Trading Role.

   Trading Role       A Trading Role identifies the different ways in
                      which Organisations can participate in a trade.
                      There are five Trading Roles: Consumer, Merchant,
                      Payment Handler, Delivery Handler, and Merchant
                      Customer Care Provider.

   Transaction        A Transaction Reference Block identifies an IOTP
   Reference Block    Transaction. It contains data that identifies:
                       o the Transaction Type,
                       o the IOTP Transaction uniquely, through a
                         globally unique transaction identifier
                       o the IOTP Message uniquely within the IOTP
                         Transaction, through a message identifier

                      The Transaction Reference Block may also contain
                      references to other transactions which may or may
                      not be IOTP Transactions
