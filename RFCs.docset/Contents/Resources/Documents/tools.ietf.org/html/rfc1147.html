          Status of this Memo
          
          The goal of this FYI memo is to provide practical informa-
          tion to site administrators and network managers.  This memo
          provides information for the Internet community.  It does
          not specify any standard.  It is not a statement of IAB pol-
          icy or recommendations.  Comments, critiques, and new or
          updated tool descriptions are welcome, and should be sent to
          Robert Stine, at stine@sparta.com, or to the NOCTools work-
          ing group, at noctools@merit.edu.
          
          Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
          
          <span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>
          
          This catalog contains descriptions of several tools avail-
          able to assist network managers in debugging and maintaining
          TCP/IP internets and interconnected communications
          resources.  Entries in the catalog tell what a tool does,
          how it works, and how it can be obtained.
          
          The NOCTools Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task
          Force (IETF) compiled this catalog in 1989.  Future editions
          will be produced as IETF members become aware of tools that
          should be included, and of deficiencies or inaccuracies.
          Developing an edition oriented to the OSI protocol suite is
          also contemplated.
          
          The tools described in this catalog are in no way endorsed
          by the IETF.  For the most part, we have neither evaluated
          the tools in this catalog, nor validated their descriptions.
          Most of the descriptions of commercial tools have been pro-
          vided by vendors.  Caveat Emptor.
          
          <span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1%20Purpose"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a> Purpose</span>
          
          The practice of re-inventing the wheel seems endemic to the
          field of data communications.  The primary goal of this

          document is to fight that tendency in a small but useful
          way.  By listing the capabilities of some of the available
          network management tools, we hope to pool and share
          knowledge and experience.  Another goal of this catalog is
          to show those new in the field what can be done to manage
          internet sites.  A network management tutorial at the end of
          the document is of further assistance in this area.
          Finally, by omission, this catalog points out the network
          management tools that are needed, but do not yet exist.
          
          There are other sources of information on available network
          management tools.  Both the DDN Protocol Implementation and
          Vendors Guide and the DATAPRO series on data communications
          and LANs are particularly comprehensive and informative.
          The DDN Protocol Implementation and Vendors Guide addresses
          a wide range of internet management topics, including
          evaluations of protocol implementations and network
          analyzers.* The DATAPRO volumes, though expensive (check
          your local university or technical libraries!), are good
          surveys of available commercial products for network manage-
          ment.  DATAPRO also includes tutorials, market analyses,
          product evaluations, and predictions on technology trends.

          The tools described in this document are used for managing
          the network resources, LANs, and devices that are commonly
          interconnected by TCP/IP internets.  This document is not,
          however, a "how to" manual on network management.  While it
          includes a tutorial, the coverage is much too brief and gen-
          eral to serve as a sole source: a great deal of further
          study is required of aspiring network managers.  Neither is
          this catalog is an operations manual for particular tools.
          Each individual tool entry is brief, and emphasizes the uses
          to which a tool can be put.  A tool's documentation, which
          in some cases runs to hundreds of pages, should be consulted
          for assistance in its installation and operation.

          tool name.  The tool descriptions all follow a standard for-
          mat, described in the introduction to <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.
          
          Following the catalog, there is an appendix that contains a
          tutorial on the goals and practice of network management.

          The compilation and editing of this catalog was sponsored by
          the Defense Communications Engineering Center (DCEC), con-
          tract DCA100-89-C-0001.  The effort grew out of an initial
          task to survey current internet management tools.  The cata-
          log is largely, however, the result of volunteer labor on
          the part of the NOCTools Working Group, the User Services
          Working Group, and many others.  Without these volunteer
          contributions, the catalog would not exist.  The support
          from the Internet community for this endeavor has been
          extremely gratifying.
          
          Several individuals made especially notable contributions.
          Mike Patton, Paul Holbrook, Mark Fedor and Gary Malkin were
          particularly helpful in composition and editorial review,
          while Dave Crocker provided essential guidance and
          encouragement.  Bob Enger was active from the first with the
          gut work of chairing the Working Group and building the
          catalog.  Phill Gross helped to christen the NOCTools Work-
          ing Group, to define its scope and goals, and to establish
          its role in the IETF.  Mike Little contributed the formative
          idea of enhancing and publicizing the management tool survey
          through IETF participation.

          This catalog uses "keywords" for terse characterizations of
          the tools.  Keywords are abbreviated attributes of a tool or
          its use.  To allow cross-comparison of tools, uniform key-
          word definitions have been developed, and are given below.
          Following the definitions, there is an index of catalog
          entries by keyword.
          
          <span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20Keyword%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a> Keyword Definitions</span>
          
          The keywords are always listed in a prefined order, sorted
          first by the general category into which they fall, and then
          alphabetically.  The categories that have been defined for
          management tool keywords are:
          
               o+    the general management area to which a tool
                    relates or a tool's functional role;
          
               o+    the network resources or components that are
                    managed;
          
               o+    the mechanisms or methods a tool uses to perform
                    its functions;
          
               o+    the operating system and hardware environment of a
                    tool; and
          
               o+    the characteristics of a tool as a hardware pro-
                    duct or software release.

          Free
               a tool is available at no charge, though other restric-
               tions may apply (tools that are part of an OS distribu-
               tion but not otherwise  available  are  not  listed  as
               "free").
          
          Library
               a tool packaged with either an Application  Programming

          Following is an index of catalog entries sorted by keyword.
          This index can be used to locate the tools with a particular
          attribute: tools are listed under each keyword that charac-
          terizes them.  The keywords and the subordinate lists of
          tools under them are in alphabetical order.
          
          In the interest of brevity, some liberties have been taken
          with tool names.  Capitalization of the names is as speci-
          fied by the tool developers or distributers.  Note that
          parenthetical roman numerals following a tool's name are not
          actually part of the name.  The use of roman numerals to
          differentiate tools with the same name is explained in the
          introduction of <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

          This section is a collection of brief descriptions of tools
          for managing TCP/IP internets.  These entries are in alpha-
          betical order, by tool name.
          
          The entries all follow a standard format.  Immediately after
          the NAME of a tool are its associated KEYWORDS.  Keywords
          are terse descriptions of the purposes or attributes of a
          tool.  A more detailed description of a tool's purpose and
          characteristics is given in the ABSTRACT section.  The
          MECHANISM section describes how a tool works.  In CAVEATS,
          warnings about tool use are given.  In BUGS, known bugs or
          bug-report procedures are given.  LIMITATIONS describes the
          boundaries of a tool's capabilities.  HARDWARE REQUIRED and
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED relate the operational environment a tool
          needs.  Finally, in AVAILABILITY, pointers to vendors,
          online repositories, or other sources for a tool are given.
          
          We deal with the problem of tool-name clashes -- different
          tools that have the same name -- by appending parenthetical
          roman numerals to the names.  For example, BYU, MITRE, and
          SNMP Research each submitted a description of a tool called
          "NETMON." These tools were independently developed, are
          functionally different, run in different environments, and
          are no more related than Richard Burton the 19th century
          explorer and Richard Burton the 20th century actor.  BYU's
          tool "NETMON" is listed as "NETMON (I)," MITRE's as "NETMON
          (II)," and the tool from SNMP Research as "NETMON (III)."
          
          The parenthetical roman numerals reveal only the order in
          which the catalog editor received the tool descriptions.
          They should not be construed to indicate any sort of prefer-
          ence, priority, or rights to a tool name.

          NAME
               CMIP Library
          
          KEYWORDS
               alarm, control, manager, status; OSI; UNIX; free,
               library, sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               The CMIP Library implements the functionality of the
               Common Management Information Service/Protocol as in
               the documents ISO DP 9595-2/9596-2 of March 1988.  It
               can act as a building block for the construction of
               CMIP-based agent and manager applications.
          
          MECHANISM
               The CMIP library uses ISO ROS, ACSE and ASN.1 presenta-
               tion, as implemented in ISODE, to provide its service.
          
          CAVEATS
               None.
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               The M-CREATE, M-DELETE and M-ACTION protocol primitives
               are not implemented in this version.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               Developed on Sun3, tested on Sun3 and VAXStation.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               The ISODE protocol suite, BSD UNIX.
          
          AVAILABILITY
               The CMIP library and related management tools built
               upon it, known as OSIMIS (OSI Management Information
               Service), are publicly available from University Col-
               lege London, England via FTP and FTAM.  To obtain

          NAME
               The CMU SNMP Distribution
          
          KEYWORDS
               manager, status; IP; NMS, SNMP; UNIX; free, sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               The CMU SNMP Distribution includes source code for an
               SNMP agent, several SNMP client applications, an ASN.1
               library, and supporting documentation.
          
               The agent compiles into about 10 KB of 68000 code.  The
               distribution includes a full agent that runs on a
               Kinetics FastPath2/3/4, and is built into the KIP
               appletalk/ethernet gateway.  The machine independent
               portions of this agent also run on CMU's IBM PC/AT
               based router.
          
               The applications are designed to be useful in the real
               world.  Information is collected and presented in a
               useful format and is suitable for everyday status moni-
               toring.  Input and output are interpreted symbolically.
               The tools can be used without referencing the RFCs.
          
          MECHANISM
               SNMP.
          
          CAVEATS
               None.
          
          BUGS
               None reported.  Send bug reports to
               sw0l+snmp@andrew.cmu.edu.  ("sw0l" is "ess double-you
               zero ell.")
          
          LIMITATIONS
               None reported.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               The KIP gateway agent runs on a Kinetics FastPath2/3/4.
               Otherwise, no restrictions.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               The code was written with efficiency and portability in
               mind.  The applications compile and run on the follow-

          ABSTRACT
               This program consists of 858 computer security ques-
               tions divided up in thirteen sections.  The program
               presents the questions to the user and records their
               responses.  After answering the questions in one of the
               thirteen sections, the user can generate a report from
               the questions and the user's answers.  The thirteen
               sections are: telecommunications security, physical
               access security, personnel security, systems develop-
               ment security, security awareness and training prac-
               tices, organizational and management security, data and
               program security, processing and operations security,
               ergonomics and error prevention, environmental secu-
               rity, and backup and recovery security.
          
               The questions are weighted as to their importance, and
               the report generator can sort the questions by weight.
               This way the most important issues can be tackled
               first.
          
          MECHANISM
               The questions are displayed on the screen and the user
               is prompted for a single keystroke reply.  When the end
               of one of the thirteen sections is reached, the answers
               are written to a disk file.  The question file and the
               answer file are merged to create the report file.

          ABSTRACT
               The ConnectVIEW Network Management System consists of
               various software managers that control and manage Hal-
               ley System's internets made of of ConnectLAN 100 ether-
               net and ConnectLAN 200 Token Ring Brouters.  The
               management software provides an icon-based graphical
               network display with real-time monitoring and report-
               ing, along with configuration, fault, performance and
               security management functions for managing ConnectLAN
               brouters.  A Planning function is also provided that
               allows users to draw their networks.

          ABSTRACT
               These commands display private MIB information from
               Wellfleet systems.  They retrieve and format for
               display values of one or several MIB variables from the
               Wellfleet Communications private enterprise MIB, using
               the SNMP (<a href="rfc1098.html">RFC1098</a>).  In particular these tools are used
               to examine the non-IP modules (DECnet, XNS, and Bridg-
               ing) of a Wellfleet system.
          
               Decaddrs displays the DECnet configuration of a
               Wellfleet system acting as a DECnet router, showing the
               static parameters associated with each DECnet inter-
               face.  Decaroute and decnroute display the DECnet
               inter-area and intra-area routing tables (that is area
               routes and node routes).  Xnsroutes displays routes
               known to a Wellfleet system acting as an XNS router.
               Bridgetab displays the bridge forwarding table with the
               disposition of traffic arriving from or directed to
               each station known to the Wellfleet bridge module.  All
               these commands take an IP address as the argument and
               can specify an SNMP community for the retrieval.  One
               SNMP query is performed for each row of the table.
               Note that the Wellfleet system must be operating as an
               IP router for the SNMP to be accessible.
          
          MECHANISM
               Management information is exchanged by use of SNMP.

          ABSTRACT
               DiG (domain information groper), is a command line tool
               which queries DNS servers in either an interactive or a
               batch mode.  It was developed to be more
               convenient/flexible than nslookup for gathering perfor-
               mance data and testing DNS servers.
          
          MECHANISM
               Dig is built on a slightly modified version of the bind
               resolver (release 4.8).

          ABSTRACT
               Netlabs' Dual Manager provides management of TCP/IP
               networks using both SNMP and CMOT protocols.  Such
               management can be initiated either through the X-
               Windows user interface (both Motif and Openlook), or
               through OSI Network Management (CMIP) commands.  The
               Dual Manager provides for configuration, fault, secu-
               rity and performance management.  It provides extensive
               map management features, including scanned maps in the
               background.  It provides simple mechanisms to extend
               the MIB and assign specific lists of objects to
               specific network elements, thereby providing for the
               management of all vendors' specific MIB extensions.  It
               provides an optional relational DBMS for storing and
               retrieving MIB and alarm information.  Finally, the
               Dual Manager is an open platform, in that it provides
               several Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for
               users to extend the functionality of the Dual Manager.
          
               The Dual Manager is expected to work as a TCP/IP
               "branch manager" under DEC's EMA, AT&amp;T's UNMA and other
               OSI-conformant enterprise management architectures.
          
          MECHANISM
               The Netlabs Dual Manager supports the control and moni-
               toring of network resources by use of both CMOT and
               SNMP message exchanges.

          NAME
               ENTM -- Ethernet Traffic Monitor
          
          KEYWORDS
               traffic; ethernet, IP; eavesdrop; VMS; free.
          
          ABSTRACT
               ENTM is a screen-oriented utility that runs under
               VAX/VMS.  It monitors local ethernet traffic and
               displays either a real time or cumulative, histogram
               showing a percent breakdown of traffic by ethernet pro-
               tocol type.  The information in the display can be
               reported based on packet count or byte count.  The per-
               cent of broadcast, multicast and approximate lost pack-
               ets is reported as well.  The screen display is updated
               every three seconds.  Additionally, a real time, slid-
               ing history window may be displayed showing ethernet
               traffic patterns for the last five minutes.
          
               ENTM can also report IP traffic statistics by packet
               count or byte count.  The IP histograms reflect infor-
               mation collected at the TCP and UDP port level, includ-
               ing ICMP type/code combinations.  Both the ethernet and
               IP histograms may be sorted by ASCII protocol/port name
               or by percent-value.  All screen displays can be saved
               in a file for printing later.
          
          MECHANISM
               This utility simply places the ethernet controller in
               promiscuous mode and monitors the local area network
               traffic.  It preallocates 10 receive buffers and
               attempts to keep 22 reads pending on the ethernet dev-
               ice.
          
          CAVEATS
               Placing the ethernet controller in promiscuous mode may
               severly slow down a VAX system.  Depending on the speed
               of the VAX system and the amount of traffic on the  lo-
               cal  ethernet,  a large amount of CPU time may be spent
               on the Interrupt Stack.  Running this code on any  pro-
               duction system during operational hours is discouraged.

          BUGS
               Due to a bug in the VAX/VMS ethernet/802 device driver,
               IEEE  802 format packets may not always be detected.  A
               simple test is performed to "guess" which  packets  are
               in  IEEE  802  format (DSAP equal to SSAP).  Thus, some
               DSAP/SSAP pairs may be reported as  an  ethernet  type,
               while  valid ethernet types may be reported as IEEE 802
               packets.
          
               In some hardware configurations, placing an ethernet
               controller in promiscuous mode with automatic-restart
               enabled will hang the controller.  Our VAX 8650 hangs
               running this code, while our uVAX IIs and uVAX IIIs do
               not.

          LIMITATIONS
               The user is required to have PHY_IO, TMPMBX and NETMBX
               privileges.  When activated, the program first checks
               that the user process as enough quotas remaining
               (BYTLM, BIOLM, ASTLM and PAGFLQUO) to successfully run
               the program without entering into an involuntary wait
               state.  Some quotas require a fairly generous setting.
          
               The contents of IEEE 802 packets are not examined.
               Only the presence of IEEE 802 packets on the wire is
               reported.
          
               The count of lost packets is approximated.  If, after
               each read completes on the ethernet device, the utility
               detects that it has no reads pending on that device,
               the lost packet counter is incremented by one.
          
               When the total number of bytes processed exceeds
               7fffffff hex, all counters are automatically reset to
               zero.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED

          NAME
               etherfind
          
          KEYWORDS
               traffic; ethernet, IP, NFS; eavesdrop; UNIX.
          
          ABSTRACT
               Etherfind examines the packets that traverse a network
               interface, and outputs a text file describing the
               traffic.  In the file, a single line of text describes
               a single packet: it contains values such as protocol
               type, length, source, and destination.  Etherfind can
               print out all packet traffic on the ethernet, or
               traffic for the local host.  Further packet filtering
               can be done on the basis of protocol: IP, ARP, RARP,
               ICMP, UDP, ND, TCP, and filtering can also be done
               based on the source, destination addresses as well as
               TCP and UDP port numbers.
          
          MECHANISM
               In usual operations, and by default, etherfind puts the
               interface in promiscuous mode.  In 4.3BSD UNIX and
               related OSs, it uses a Network Interface Tap (NIT) to
               obtain a copy of traffic on an ethernet interface.

               Output list of hosts on an ethernet that respond to IP
               ARP.  Produces a list in the following format:

               The first column is the ethernet address, the second
               the IP address, and the third is the hostname (which is
               omitted if the name could not be found via gethost-
               byaddr).  A starting and ending IP address may be
               specified on the command line, which will limit the
               search.
          
          MECHANISM
               Etherhostprobe sends a UDP packet to the ``echo'' port,
               then looks in the kernel's ARP cache for the
               corresponding address entry.  Explicit response (or
               lack of same) to the UDP packet is ignored.  The cache
               will be checked up to four times at one-quarter-second
               intervals.  Note that this allows the program to be run
               by a user with no special privileges.
          
          CAVEATS
               Etherhostprobe will fill the kernel's ARP cache with
               possibly useless entries, possibly causing delays to
               programs foolishly attempting to accomplish real work.
          
               Etherhostprobe causes -lots- of ARPs to be generated,
               possibly fooling network monitoring software (or peo-
               ple) into concluding that something is horribly broken.
          
               Etherhostprobe spends up to one second looking for each
               possible address.  Thus, exhaustively searching a
               class-C network will take about four minutes, and
               exhaustively searching a class-B network will take
               about 18 hours.  Exhaustively searching a class-A net-
               work will take the better part of a year, so don't even

               think about it.
          
               Etherhostprobe will be fooled by gateways that imple-
               ment proxy ARP; every possible address on the proxy-
               ARPed subnet will be listed with the gateway's ethernet
               address.

               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               If a given machine is not running IP ARP at the time

          ABSTRACT
               The Network Applications Technology (NAT) EtherMeter
               product is a dedicated ethernet traffic monitor that
               provides statistics on the ethernet segment to which it
               is attached.  The EtherMeter reports three major kinds
               of statistics.  For good packets, it reports the total
               number of good packets seen on the segment, the number
               of multicast and broadcast packets, and the total
               number of bytes in all packets seen.  For packets with
               errors, it reports the number of CRC errors, short
               packets, oversize packets, and alignment errors.  It
               also reports the distribution of packet by type, and
               the number of protocols seen on the segment.  A count
               of transmit collisions is reported.  Peak and current
               ethernet utilization rates are also reported, etc.
               Alarms can be set for utilization rate, packet rate,
               total error count, and delta error.
          
               The EtherMeter reports the statistics to a Network
               Management Station (NMS), also available from NAT, via
               IP/UDP datagrams, so that the meters can be monitored
               through routers.  The NMS displays graphical and/or
               textual information, and EtherMeter icons turn colors
               to indicate status.  Alarms can be set, and if the lev-
               els are exceeded an audible alarm is generated on the
               NMS, and the EtherMeter icon changes from green to yel-
               low on the network map.
          
          MECHANISM
               The EtherMeter is a self-contained board that can
               either be plugged into a PC/AT bus for power or
               installed in a small stand-alone enclosure.  The board
               can be obtained with either a 10BASE5 thick ethernet
               transceiver cable connector, or a 10BASE2 thin ethernet
               BNC connector.
          
          CAVEATS
               The EtherMeter is primarily a passive device whose only
               impact  on  the  network  will come from the monitoring
               packets sent to the NMS.  The EtherMeter is assigned an
               IP address for communication with the NMS.

               Proprietary protocol currently in use.  The company has
               stated its intention to develop SNMP for the EtherMeter
               product in the first half of 1990.  Currently the NMS
               does not keep log files.  This limitation is ack-
               nowledged, and plans are underway to add ASCII log file
               capability to the NMS.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               An EtherMeter board and a PC/AT bus to plug it into, or
               a stand-alone enclosure with power supply (available
               from NAT).  A Network Management Station and its
               software is required as well, to fully interact with
               the EtherMeter devices.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               The EtherMeter software is included in ROM on the dev-

          ABSTRACT
               EtherView is a network monitoring tool which runs on
               Sun workstations and allows you to monitor your hetero-
               geneous internet network.  It monitors all systems on
               the ethernet.  It has three primary functions:
          
               Load Profile:  It allows users to monitor the load on
               the ethernet over extended periods of time.  The net-
               work administrator can use it to characterize load gen-
               erated by a node on the network, determine which sys-
               tems and applications generate how much of the load and
               how that load fluctuates over long periods of time.
          
               NFS Profile:  It allows the network administrator to
               determine the load on NFS servers, the average response
               time NFS servers and the mix of NFS load on each of the
               servers.  Users can use the data to benchmark different
               NFS servers, determine which servers are overloaded,
               deduce the number of clients that each server can sup-
               port and evaluate the effectiveness of NFS accelera-
               tors.
          
               Protocol Analyzer:  Users can capture packets based on
               source, destination, application, protocol, bit pat-
               tern, packet size or a boolean filtering expression.
               It provides all standard features such as configurable
               buffer size, packet slicing and bit pattern based
               triggering criterion.  It does automatic disassembly of
               NFS, TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, ARP and RARP packets.  Packets
               can be examined in any combination of summary, hex or
               detail format.
          
          MECHANISM
               EtherView uses the Sun's NIT interface to turn the eth-
               ernet interface into promiscuous mode to capture pack-
               ets.  A high level process manages the interface and a
               low level process does the actual capturing and filter-
               ing.  Shared memory is used to communicate between the
               two processes.
          
          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               Because of limitations in Sun's NIT  interface,  Ether-
               View will not capture packets originating from the sys-
               tem where it is run.
          
               EtherView requires super-user privileges on the system
               where it is run.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               EtherView runs on all models of Sun-3, Sun-4 and Sun-
               386i.

          ABSTRACT
               These commands retrieve and format for display values
               of one or several MIB variables (<a href="rfc1066.html">RFC1066</a>) using the
               SNMP (<a href="rfc1098.html">RFC1098</a>).  Getone and getmany retrieve arbitrary
               MIB variables; getroute, getarp, getaddr, and getif
               retrieve and display tabular information (routing
               tables, ARP table, interface configuration, etc.), and
               getid retrieves and displays system name, identifica-
               tion and boot time.
          
               Getone &lt;target&gt; &lt;mibvariable&gt; retrieves and displays
               the value of the designated MIB variable from the
               specified target system.  The SNMP community name to be
               used for the retrieval can also be specified.  Getmany
               works similarly for groups of MIB variables rather than
               individual values.  The name of each variable, its
               value and its data type is displayed.  Getroute returns
               information from the ipRoutingTable MIB structure,
               displaying the retrieved information in an accessible
               format.  Getarp behaves similarly for the address
               translation table; getaddr for the ipAddressTable; and
               getif displays information from the interfaces table,
               supplemented with information from the ipAddressTable.
               Getid displays the system name, identification, ipFor-
               warding state, and the boot time and date.  All take a
               system name or IP address as an argument and can
               specify an SNMP community for the retrieval.  One SNMP
               query is performed for each row of the table.

          MECHANISM
               Tests are performed on a gateway in an isolated
               testbed.  Hammer generates packets at controlled rates.
               It can set the length and interpacket interval of a
               packet stream.  Anvil counts packet arrivals.
          
          CAVEATS
               Hammer should not be run on a live network.
          
          BUGS
               None reported.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               Early versions of hammer could not produce inter-packet
               intervals shorter than 55 usec.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               Hammer runs on a PC/AT or compatible, and anvil
               requires a PC or clone.  Both use a Micom Interlan
               NI5210 for LAN interface.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               MS-DOS.

          ABSTRACT
               Hopcheck is a tool that lists the gateways traversed by
               packets sent from the hopcheck-resident PC to a desti-
               nation.  Hopcheck uses the same mechanism as traceroute
               but is for use on IBM PC compatibles that have ethernet
               connections.  Hopcheck is part of a larger TCP/IP pack-
               age that is known as ka9q that is for use with packet
               radio.  Ka9q can coexist on a PC with other TCP/IP
               packages such as FTP Inc's PC/TCP, but must be used
               independently of other packages.  Ka9q was written by
               Phil Karn.  Hopcheck was added by Katie Stevens,
               dkstevens@ucdavis.edu.  Unlike traceroute, which
               requires a UNIX kernel mod, hopcheck will run on the
               standard, unmodified ka9q release.
          
          MECHANISM

          NAME

          KEYWORDS

          ABSTRACT
               HyperMIB is a hypertext presentation of the MIB
               (<a href="rfc1066.html">RFC1066</a>).  The tree structure of the MIB is presented
               graphically, and the user traverses the tree by select-
               ing branches of the tree.  When the MIB variables are
               displayed, selecting them causes a text window to
               appear and show the definition of that variable (using
               the actual text of the MIB document).
          
          MECHANISM
               The Apple Macintosh HyperCard utility is used.  The
               actual text of the MIB document is read into scrollable
               text windows, and a string search is done on the vari-
               able selected.  A person familiar with HyperCard pro-
               gramming could modify the program to suit their needs
               (such as to add the definitions for their company's
               private space).
          
          CAVEATS
               None.
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               This program only gives the definition of the MIB vari-
               ables.  It cannot poll a node to find the value of the
               variables.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED

          ABSTRACT
               Internet Rover is a prototype network monitor that uses
               multiple protocol "modules" to test network functional-
               ity.  This package consists of two primary pieces of
               code: the data collector and the problem display.
          
               There is one data collector that performs a series of
               network tests, and maintains a list of problems with
               the network.  There can be many display processes all
               displaying the current list of problems which is useful
               in a multi-operator NOC.
          
               The display task uses curses, allowing many terminal
               types to display the problem file either locally or
               from a remote site.  Full source is provided.  The data
               collector is easily configured and extensible.  Contri-
               butions such as additional protocol modules, and shell
               script extensions are welcome.
          
          MECHANISM
               A configuration file contains a list of nodes,
               addresses, NodeUp? protocol test (ping in most cases),
               and a list of further tests to be performed if the node
               is in fact up.  Modules are included to test TELNET,
               FTP, and SMTP.  If the configuration contains a test
               that isn't recognized, a generic test is assumed, and a
               filename is checked for existence.  This way users can
               create scripts that create a file if there is a prob-
               lem, and the data collector simply checks the existence
               of that file to determine if there is problem.

          LIMITATIONS
               This tools does not yet have the capability to  perform
               actions based on the result of the test.  Rather, it is
               intended for a multi-operator environment,  and  simply
               displays a list of what is wrong with the net.

          ABSTRACT
               LAN Patrol is a full-featured network analyzer that
               provides essential information for effective fault and
               performance management.  It allows network managers to
               easily monitor user activity, find traffic overloads,
               plan for growth, test cable, uncover intruders, balance
               network services, and so on.  LAN Patrol uses state of
               the art data collection techniques to monitor all
               activity on a network, giving an accurate picture of
               how it is performing.
          
               LAN Patrol's reports can be saved as ASCII files to
               disk, and imported into spreadsheet or database pro-
               grams for further analysis.
          
          MECHANISM
               The LAN Patrol interface driver programs a standard
               interface card to capture all traffic on a network seg-
               ment.  The driver operates from the background of a
               standard PC, maintaining statistics for each station on
               the network.  The information can be viewed on the PC's
               screen, or as a user-defined report output either to
               file or printer.
          
          CAVEATS
               None.  Normal operation is completely passive, making
               LAN Patrol transparent to the network.
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               LAN Patrol can monitor up to 10,000 packets/sec on an
               AT class PC, and is limited to monitoring a maximum of
               1024 stations for intervals of up to 30 days.
          
               Because LAN Patrol operates at the physical level, it
               will only see traffic for the segment on which it is
               installed; it cannot see traffic across bridges.

          NAME
               LanProbe -- the HP 4990S LanProbe Distributed Analysis
               System.
          
          KEYWORDS
               alarm, manager, map, status, traffic; ethernet; eaves-
               drop, NMS; proprietary.
          
          ABSTRACT
               The LanProbe distributed monitoring system performs
               remote and local monitoring of ethernet LANs in a pro-
               tocol and vendor independent manner.
          
               LanProbe discovers each active node on a segment and
               displays it on a map with its adapter card vendor name,
               ethernet address, and IP address.  Additional informa-
               tion about the nodes, such as equipment type and physi-
               cal location can be entered in to the data base by the
               user.
          
               When the NodeLocator option is used, data on the actual
               location of nodes is automatically entered and the map
               becomes an accurate representation of the physical lay-
               out of the segment.  Thereafter when a new node is
               installed and becomes active, or when a node is moved
               or becomes inactive, the change is detected and shown
               on the map in real time.  The system also provides the
               network manager with precise cable fault information
               displayed on the map.
          
               Traffic statistics are gathered and displayed and can
               be exported in (comma delimited) CSV format for further
               analysis.  Alerts can be set on user defined thres-
               holds.
          
               Trace provides a remote protocol analyzer capability
               with decodes for common protocols.
          
               Significant events (like power failure, cable breaks,
               new node on network, broadcast IP source address seen,
               etc.) are tracked in a log that is uploaded to Pro-
               beView periodically.
          
               ProbeView generates reports that can be manipulated by
               MSDOS based word processors, spreadsheets, and DBMS.

          MECHANISM
               The system consists of one or more LanProbe segment
               monitors and ProbeView software running under Microsoft
               Windows.  The LanProbe segment monitor attaches to the
               end of an ethernet segment and monitors all traffic.
               Attachment can be direct to a thin or thick coax cable,
               or via an external transceiver to fiber optic or twist-
               ed pair cabling.  Network data relating to the segment
               is transferred to a workstation running ProbeView via
               RS-232, ethernet, or a modem connection.
          
               ProbeView software, which runs on a PC/AT class works-
               tation, presents network information in graphical
               displays.
          
               The HP4992A NodeLocator option attaches to the opposite
               end of the cable from the HP4991A LanProbe segment mon-
               itor.  It automatically locates the position of nodes
               on the ethernet networks using coaxial cabling schemes.

          ABSTRACT
               LANWatch 2.0 is an inexpensive, powerful and flexible
               network analyzer that runs under DOS on personal com-
               puters and requires no hardware modifications to either
               the host or the network.  LANWatch is an invaluable
               tool for installing, troubleshooting, and monitoring
               local area networks, and for developing and debugging
               new protocols.  Network managers using LANWatch can
               inspect network traffic patterns and packet errors to
               isolate performance problems and bottlenecks.  Protocol
               developers can use LANWatch to inspect and verify
               proper protocol handling.  Since LANWatch is a
               software-only package which installs easily in existing
               PCs, network technicians and field service engineers
               can carry LANWatch in their briefcase for convenient
               network analysis at remote sites.
          
               LANWatch has two operating modes: Display and Examine.
               In Display Mode, LANWatch traces network traffic by
               displaying captured packets in real time.  Examine Mode
               allows you to scroll back through stored packets to
               inspect them in detail.  To select a subset of packets
               for display, storage or retrieval, there is an exten-
               sive set of built-in filters.  Using filters, LANWatch
               collects only packets of interest, saving the user from
               having to sort through all network traffic to isolate
               specific packets.  The built-in filters include alarm,
               trigger, capture, load, save and search.  They can be
               controlled separately to match on source or destination
               address, protocol, or packet contents at the hardware
               and transport layers.  LANWatch also includes suffi-
               cient source code so users can modify the existing
               filters and parsers or add new ones.
          
               The LANWatch distribution includes executables and
               source for several post-processors: a TCP protocol
               analyzer, a node-by-node traffic analyzer and a dump
               file listing tool.

               Uses many common PC network interfaces by placing them
               in promiscuous mode and capturing traffic.
          
          CAVEATS
               Most PC network interfaces will not capture 100% of the
               traffic on a fully-loaded network (primarily missing
               back-to-back packets).
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               LANWatch can't analyze what it doesn't see (see
               Caveats).
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               LANWatch requires a PC or PS/2 with a supported network
               interface card.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               LANWatch runs in DOS.  Modification of the supplied
               source code or creation of additional filters and
               parsers requires Microsoft C 5.1

          NAME
               map -- Interactive Network Map
          
          KEYWORDS
               manager, map; CHAOS, ethernet, IP, ring, star; NMS,
               ping, SNMP, X; UNIX; free, sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               Map draws a map of network connectivity and allows
               interactive examination of information about various
               components including whether hosts can be reached over
               the network.
          
               The program is supplied with complete source and is
               written in a modular fashion to make addition of dif-
               ferent protocols stacks, displays, or hardcopy devices
               relatively easy.  This is one of the reasons why the
               initial version supports at least two of each.  Contri-
               butions of additional drivers in any of these areas
               will be welcome as well as porting to additional plat-
               forms.
          
          MECHANISM
               Net components are pinged by use of ICMP echo and,
               optionally, CHAOS status requests and SNMP "gets."  The
               program initializes itself from static data stored in
               the file system and therefore does not need to access
               the network in order to get running (unless the static
               files are network mounted).
          
          CAVEATS
               As of publication, the tool is in beta release.
          
          BUGS
               Several minor nits, documented in distribution files.
               Bug discoveries should be reported by email to Bug-
               Map@LCS.MIT.Edu.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               See distribution file for an indepth discussion of sys-
               tem capabilities and potential.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               An X display is needed for interactive display of the
               map, non-graphical interaction is available in non-
               display mode.  For hardcopy output a PostScript or Tek-
               tronix 4692 printer is required.

          ABSTRACT
               Mconnect allows an interactive session with a remote
               mailer.  Mail delivery problems can be diagnosed by
               connecting to the remote mailer and issuing SMTP com-
               mands directly.
          
          MECHANISM
               Opens a TCP connection to remote SMTP on port 25.  Pro-
               vides local line buffering and editing, which is the
               distinction between mconnect and a TELNET to port 25.

          ABSTRACT
               Netlabs' CMOT code debuted in Interop 89.  The CMOT
               code comes with an Extensible MIB, which allows users
               to add new MIB variables.  The code currently supports
               all the MIB variables in <a href="rfc1095.html">RFC 1095</a> via the data types in
               <a href="rfc1065.html">RFC 1065</a>, as well as the emerging MIB-II, which is
               currently in experimental stage.  The CMOT has been
               benchmarked at 100 Management Operations per Second
               (MOPS) for a 1-MIPS machine.
          
          MECHANISM
               The Netlabs CMOT agent supports the control and moni-
               toring of network resources by use of CMOT message
               exchanges.

          ABSTRACT
               Netlabs' SNMP code debuted in Interop 89, where it
               showed interoperation of the code with several imple-
               mentations on the show floor.  The SNMP code comes with
               an Extensible MIB, which allows users to add new MIB
               variables.  The code currently supports all the MIB
               variables in <a href="rfc1066.html">RFC 1066</a> via the data types in <a href="rfc1065.html">RFC 1065</a>,
               as well as the emerging MIB-II, which is currently in
               experimental stage.  The SNMP has been benchmarked at
               200 Management Operations per Second (MOPS) for a 1-
               MIPS machine.

          ABSTRACT
               Netmon is a DOS-based program that pings hosts on a
               monitored list at user-specified intervals.  In addi-
               tion, a user may optionally ping hosts not on the list.
          
               Netmon also performs domain lookups.  Furthermore, a
               user may build and send a domain query to any desired
               DNS server.
          
          MECHANISM
               The tool works by using the echo service feature of
               ICMP.  It reports if it receives an incorrect response
               or no response.
          
          CAVEATS
               Depending on the frequency of pinging and the number of
               hosts pinged, netmon could create a high volume of
               traffic.

          ABSTRACT
               NETMON is a facility to enable communication of net-
               working events from the BSD UNIX operating system to a
               user-level network monitoring or management program.
               Iptrace is a program interfacing to NETMON which logs
               TCP-IP traffic for performance measurement and gateway
               monitoring. It is easy to build other NETMON-based
               tools using iptrace as a model.
          
               NETMON resides in the 4.3BSD UNIX kernel.  It is
               independent of hardware-specific code in UNIX.  It is
               transparent to protocol and network type, having no
               internal assumptions about the network protocols being
               recorded.  It is installed in BSD-like kernels by
               adding a standard function call (probe) to a few points
               in the input and output routines of the protocols to be
               logged.
          
               NETMON is analogous to Sun Microsystems' NIT, but the
               interface tap function is extended by recording more
               context information.  Aside from the timestamp, the
               choice of information recorded is up to the installer
               of the probes.  The NETMON probes added to the BSD IP
               code supplied with the distribution include as context:
               input and output queue lengths, identification of the
               network interface, and event codes labeling packet dis-
               cards.  (The NETMON distribution is geared towards
               measuring the performance of BSD networking protocols
               in an IP gateway).
          
               NETMON is designed so that it can reside within the
               monitored system with minimal interference to the net-
               work processing.  The estimated and measured overhead
               is around five percent of packet processing.
          
               The user-level tool "iptrace" is provided with NETMON.
               This program logs IP traffic, either at IP-level only,
               or as it passes through the network interface drivers
               as well.  As a separate function, iptrace produces a
               host traffic matrix output.  Its third type of output
               is abbreviated sampling, in which only a pre-set number
               of packets from each new host pair is logged.  The

               three output types are configured dynamically, in any
               combination.
          
               OSITRACE, another logging tool with a NETMON interface,
               is available separately (and documented in a separate
               entry in this catalog).
          
          MECHANISM
               Access to the information logged by NETMON is through a
               UNIX special file, /dev/netmon.  User reads are blocked
               until the buffer reaches a configurable level of full-
               ness.
          
               Several other parameters of NETMON can be tuned at com-
               pile time.  A diagnostic program, netmonstat, is
               included in the distribution.

          NAME
               NETMON -- an SNMP-based network management tool from
               SNMP Research.
          
          KEYWORDS
               alarm, control, manager, map, routing; DECnet, ether-
               net, IP, OSI, ring, star; NMS, SNMP; DOS; sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               The NETMON application implements a network management
               station based on a low-cost DOS-based platform.  It can
               be successfully used with many types of networks,
               including both wide area networks and those based on
               various LAN media.  NETMON has been used with multipro-
               tocol devices including those which support TCP/IP,
               DECnet, and OSI protocols.  The fault management tool
               displays the map of the network configuration with
               current node and link state indicated in one of several
               colors.  Alarms may be enabled to alert the operator of
               events occurring in the network.  Events are logged to
               disk.  The NETMON application comes complete with
               source code including a powerful set of portable
               libraries for generating and parsing SNMP messages.
               Output data from NETMON may be transferred via flat
               files for additional report generation by a variety of
               statistical packages.
          
          MECHANISM
               The NETMON application is based on the Simple Network
               Management Protocol (SNMP).  Polling is performed via
               the powerful SNMP get-next operator and the SNMP get
               operator.  Trap directed polling is used to regulate
               the focus and intensity of the polling.
          
          CAVEATS
               None.
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               The monitored and managed nodes must implement the SNMP
               over UDP per <a href="rfc1098.html">RFC 1098</a> or must be reachable via a proxy
               agent.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               The minimum system is a IBM Personal Computer (4.77
               MHz) with DOS 3.0 or later, an Enhanced Graphics

               Adapter, Enhanced Graphics Monitor, a single 360 Kbyte
               floppy drive, and an ethernet adapter.  However, most
               users will find a hard disk to be helpful for storing
               network history and will be less impatient with a fas-
               ter CPU.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               DOS 3.0 or later and TCP/IP software from one of
               several sources.

          ABSTRACT
               Netstat is a program that accesses network related data
               structures within the kernel, then provides an ASCII
               format at the terminal.  Netstat can provide reports on
               the routing table, TCP connections, TCP and UDP
               "listens", and protocol memory management.
          
          MECHANISM
               Netstat accesses operating system memory to read the
               kernel routing tables.
          
          CAVEATS
               Kernel data structures can change while netstat is run-
               ning.

          NAME
               netwatch
          
          KEYWORDS
               traffic; ethernet, IP, ring; eavesdrop; DOS; free.
          
          ABSTRACT
               PC/netwatch listens to an attached local broadcast net-
               work and displays one line of information for every
               packet that goes by.  This information consists of the
               "to" and "from" local network addresses, the packet
               length, the value of the protocol type field, and 8
               selected contiguous bytes of the packet contents.
               While netwatch is running it will respond to commands
               to display collected information, change its operating
               mode, or to filter for specific types of packets.
          
          MECHANISM
               Puts controller in promiscuous mode.
          
          CAVEATS
               None.
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               The monitor can handle a burst rate of about 200 pack-
               ets per second.  Packets arriving faster than that are
               missed (but counted in the statistics of the network
               driver).  The display rate is about 25 packets per
               second and there is a buffer that can hold 512
               undisplayed packets.  The monitor discards overflow
               packets.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED

          NAME
               Network Integrator I
          
          KEYWORDS
               map, traffic; ethernet; UNIX.
          
          ABSTRACT
               This tool monitors traffic on network segments.  All
               information is dumped to either a log file or, for
               real-time viewing, to a command tool window.  Data is
               time-stamped according to date and time.  Logging can
               continue for up to 24 hours.
          
               The tool is flexible in data collection and presenta-
               tion.  Traffic filters can be specified according to
               header values of numerous protocols, including those
               used by Apple, DEC, Sun, HP, and Apollo.  Bandwidth
               utilization can be monitored, as well as actual load
               and peak throughput.  Additionally, the Network
               Integrator can analyze a network's topology, and record
               the location of all operational nodes on a network.
          
               Data can be displayed in six separate formats of bar
               graphs.  In addition, there are several routines for
               producing statistical summaries of the data collected.
          
          MECHANISM
               The tools work through RPC and XDR calls.
          
          CAVEATS
               Although the tool adds only little traffic to a net-
               work, generation of statistics from captured files
               requires a significant portion of a workstation's CPU.
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               Must be root to run monitor.  There does not seem to be
               a limit to the number of nodes, since it monitors by
               segments.  The only major limitation is the amount of
               disk space that a user can commit to the log files.
               The size of the log files, however, can be controlled
               through the tool's parameters.

          ABSTRACT
               Net_monitor uses ICMP echo (and DECnet reachability
               information on VAX/VMS) to monitor a network.  The mon-
               itoring is very simplistic, but has proved useful.  It
               periodically tests whether hosts are reachable and
               reports the results in a full-screen display.  It
               groups hosts together in common sets.  If all hosts in
               a set become unreachable, it makes a lot of racket with
               bells, since it assumes that this means that some com-
               mon piece of hardware that supports that set has
               failed.  The periodicity of the tests, hosts to test,
               and groupings of hosts are controlled with a single
               configuration file.
          
               The idea for this program came from the PC/IP monitor
               facility, but is an entirely different program with
               different functionality.
          
          MECHANISM
               Reachability is tested using ICMP echo facilities for
               TCP/IP hosts (and DECnet reachability information on
               VAX/VMS).  A DECnet node is considered reachable if it
               appears in the list of hosts in a "show network" com-
               mand issued on a routing node.
          
          CAVEATS
               This facility has been found to be most useful when run
               in a window on a workstation rather than on a terminal
               connected to a host.  It could be useful if ported to a
               PC (looks easy using FTP Software's programming
               libraries), but this has not been done.  Curses is very
               slow and cpu intensive on VMS, but the tool has been
               run in a window on a VAXstation 2000.  Just don't try
               to run it on a terminal connected to a 11/750.

          LIMITATIONS
               This tool is not meant to be a replacement for a more
               comprehensive network management facility such as is
               provided with SNMP.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               A host with a network connection.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               Curses, 4.xBSD UNIX socket programming libraries (lim-
               ited set) and some flavor of TCP/IP that supports ICMP
               echo request (ping).  It has been run on VAX/VMS run-
               ning WIN/TCP and several flavors of 4BSD UNIX (includ-
               ing SunOS 3.2, 4.0, and 4.3BSD).  It could be ported to
               any platform that provides a BSD-style programming li-
               brary with an ICMP echo request facility and curses.

          KEYWORDS

          ABSTRACT
               Nfswatch monitors all incoming ethernet traffic to an
               NFS file server and divides it into several categories.
               The number and percentage of packets received in each
               category is displayed on the screen in a continuously
               updated display.
          
               All exported file systems are monitored by default.
               Other files may optionally be monitored.  Options also
               allow monitoring of traffic destined for a remote host
               instead of the local host, or monitoring traffic sent
               by a single host.  Items such as the sample interval
               length can be adjusted either on the command line or
               interactively.  Facilities for taking screen
               "snapshots," saving all data to a log file, and summar-
               izing the log file are included.  Nfslogsum, a program
               that summarizes the log file, is included in the dis-
               tribution.
          
          MECHANISM
               Nfswatch uses the Network Interface Tap in promiscuous
               mode to monitor the ethernet.  It filters out NFS pack-
               ets destined for the local (or remote) host, and then
               decodes the file handles in order to determine which
               file or file system a request pertains to.
          
          CAVEATS
               Because the NFS file handle is a non-standard (server
               private) piece of data, the file system monitoring part
               of the program will break whenever the format of a file
               handle is not what it expects to see.  This is easily
               fixed in the code, however.  The code presently under-
               stands SunOS 4.0 file handles.

          LIMITATIONS
               Up to 256 exported file systems and 256 individual
               files can be monitored, but only (2 * (DisplayLines -
               16)) will be displayed on the screen (all data will be
               written to the log file).
          
               Only NFS requests made by client machines are counted;
               the NFS traffic generated by the server in response to
               these requests is not counted.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               Has been tested on Sun-3 and Sun-4 systems.  No
               hardware dependencies, but see below.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               SunOS 4.0 or higher.  The STREAMS NIT device is used.
               Fairly easy code modifications should be able to make
               it run under older SunOS releases, or other versions of
               BSD UNIX with a NIT-like device.

          ABSTRACT
               Nhfsstone (pronounced n-f-s-stone, the "h" is silent)
               is an NFS benchmarking program.  It is used on an NFS
               client to generate an artificial load with a particular
               mix of NFS operations.  It reports the average response
               time of the server in milliseconds per call and the
               load in calls per second.  The nhfsstone distribution
               includes a script, "nhfsnums" that converts test
               results into plot(5) format so that they can be graphed
               using graph(1) and other tools.
          
          MECHANISM
               Nhfsstone is an NFS traffic generator.  It adjusts its
               calling patterns based on the client's kernel NFS
               statistics and the elapsed time.  Load can be generated
               over a given time or number of NFS calls.
          
          CAVEATS
               Nhfsstone will compete for system resources with other
               applications.

          ABSTRACT
               The 9100 Network Management Center provides the capa-
               bility to manage and control standards-based networking
               products from Hughes LAN Systems' and other vendors.
               This management extends to all network products that
               are equipped with the industry standard SNMP (Simple
               Network Management Protocol).  A comprehensive rela-
               tional database manages the data and ensures easy
               access and control of resources throughout the network.
          
               9100 NMC software provides the following functions:
          
               Database Management
                    Stores and retrieves the information required to
                    administer and configure the network.  It can be
                    used to:
                         Store and recall configuration data for all
                         devices.
                         Provide availability history for devices.
                         Provides full-function SQL interface.
                         Assign new internet addresses.
                         Provide administrative information such as
                         physical location of devices, person respon-
                         sible, maintenance history, asset data,
                         hardware/software versions, etc.
          
               Configuration Management
                    A comprehensive configuration model that enables
                    you to:
                         Retrieve configuration information from SNMP
                         devices.
                         Configure HLS devices using SNMP.
                         Configures attributes relating to TCP/IP,
                         DECnet and other protocols in HLS devices
                         using SNMP.
                         Poll devices to compare their current attri-
                         bute values with those in the database and

          ABSTRACT
               NNStat is a collection of programs that provides an
               internet statistic collecting capability.  The NNStat
               strategy for statistic collection is to collect traffic
               statistics via a promiscuous ethernet tap on the local
               networks, versus instrumenting the gateways.  If all
               traffic entering or leaving a network or set of net-
               works traverses a local ethernet, then by stationing a
               statistic gathering agent on each local network a pro-
               file of network traffic can be gathered.  Statistical
               data is retrieved from the local agents by a global
               manager.
          
               A program called "statspy" performs the data gathering
               function.  Essentially, statspy reads all packets on an
               ethernet interface and records all information of
               interest.  Information of interest is gathered by exa-
               mining each packet and determining if the source or
               destination IP address is one that is being monitored,
               typically a gateway address.  If so then the contents
               of the packet are examined to see if they match further
               criteria.
          
               A program called "collect" performs global data collec-
               tion.  It periodically polls various statspy processes
               in the domain of interest to retrieve locally logged
               statistical data.
          
               The NNSTAT distribution comes with several sample awk
               programs which process the logged output of the collect
               program.
          
          MECHANISM
               Local agents (statspy processes) collect raw traffic
               data via a promiscuous ethernet tap.  Statistical, fil-
               tered or otherwise reduced data is retrieved from the
               local agents by a global manager (the "collect" pro-
               cess).

          NAME
               NPRV -- IP Node/Protocol Reachability Verifier
          
          KEYWORDS
               map, routing, status; IP; ping; VMS; free.
          
          ABSTRACT
               NPRV is a full-screen, keypad-oriented utility that
               runs under VAX/VMS.  It allows the user to quickly scan
               through a user-defined list of IP addresses (or domain
               names) and verify a node's reachability.  The node's
               reachability is determined by performing an ICMP echo,
               UDP echo and a TCP echo at alternating three second
               intervals.  The total number of packets sent and
               received are displayed, as well as the minimum, average
               and maximum round-trip times (in milliseconds) for each
               type of echo.  Additionally, a "trace route" function
               is performed to determine the path from the local sys-
               tem to the remote host.  Once all of the trace route
               information has filled the screen, a "snapshot" of the
               screen can be written to a text file.  Upon exiting the
               utility, these text files can be used to generate a
               logical network map showing host and gateway intercon-
               nectivity.
          
          MECHANISM
               The ICMP echo is performed by sending ICMP ECHO REQUEST
               packets.  The UDP and TCP echoes are performed by con-
               necting to the UDP/TCP echo ports (port number 7).  The
               trace route information is compiled by sending alter-
               nating ICMP ECHO REQUEST packets and UDP packets with
               very large destination UDP port numbers (in two
               passes).  Each packet is initially sent with a TTL
               (time to live) of 1.  This should cause an ICMP TIME
               EXCEEDED error to be generated by the first routing
               gateway.  Then each packet is sent with a TTL of 2.
               This should cause an ICMP TIME EXCEEDED error to be
               generated by the second routing gateway.  Then each
               packet is sent with a TTL of 3, and so on.  This pro-
               cess continues until an ICMP ECHO REPLY or UDP PORT
               UNREACHABLE is received.  This indicates that the
               remote host has been reached and that the trace route
               information is complete.
          
          CAVEATS
               This utility sends one echo packet per second (ICMP,
               UDP or TCP), as well as sending out one trace route
               packet per second.  If a transmitted trace route packet

               is returned in less than one second, another trace
               route packet is sent in 100 milliseconds.  This could
               cause a significant amount of contention on the local
               network.

          LIMITATIONS
               The user is required to have SYSPRV privilege to per-
               form the ICMP Echo and trace route functions.  The
               utility will still run with this privilege disabled,
               but only the UDP Echo and TCP Echo information will be
               displayed.  This utility is written in C, but unfor-
               tunately it cannot be easily ported over to UNIX since
               many VMS system calls are used and all screen I/O is
               done using the VMS Screen Management Routines.

          ABSTRACT
               Nslookup is a program used for interactive query of
               ARPA Internet domain servers.  This program is useful
               for diagnosing routing or mail delivery problems, where
               often a local domain server is responding with an
               incorrect internet address.  It is essentially a data-
               base front end which converts user queries into domain
               name queries.  By default nslookup queries the local
               domain name server but you can specify additional
               servers.  Additional information beyond the mapping of
               domain names to internet addresses is possible.

               Formats and sends domain name queries.

          ABSTRACT
               The osimic program is a human user interface to the
               management information base on the ISODE Transport
               layer (ISO Transport Protocol class 0).  It allows
               browsing through the management information tree and
               enables the manipulation of attribute values.  It is
               implemented using the SunView package of the SunTools
               window system.

          ABSTRACT
               The osimon program monitors activity of the ISODE Tran-
               sport layer (ISO Transport Protocol class 0), display-
               ing entries for the active transport entities and con-
               nections.  The display is dynamically updated in the
               case of significant events such as connection opening
               and closing and packet traffic, as information is
               received in the form of event reports from a SMA.  It
               uses the UNIX curses package for screen management.
          
          MECHANISM
               It communicates with the System Management Agent (SMA)
               on the selected system via CMIP.
          
          CAVEATS
               The System Management Agent (SMA) must be running on
               the host being monitored.
          
          BUGS
               For the terminal type Sun, there are some transient
               problems with the display.

          ABSTRACT
               OSITRACE is a network performance tool that displays
               information about ISO TP4 connections.  One line of
               output is displayed for each packet indicating the
               time, source, destination, length, packet type,
               sequence number, credit, and any optional parameters
               contained in the packet.  Numerous options are avail-
               able to control the output of OSITRACE.
          
               To obtain packets to analyze, OSITRACE uses Sun
               Microsystems' Network Interface Tap (NIT) in SunOS 3.4,
               3.5, and 4.0.X.  OSITRACE may also obtain data from the
               NETMON utility which is described as another tool
               entry.
          
               In Sun systems, OSITRACE may be easily installed: OSI
               kernel support is not needed, nor is any other form of
               OSI software support.
          
          MECHANISM
               This tool has been designed in such a way that code to
               process different protocol suites may be easily added.
               As such, OSITRACE also has the ability to trace the DOD
               TCP protocols.

          ABSTRACT
               Ping is perhaps the most basic tool for internet
               management.  It verifies that a remote IP implementa-
               tion and the intervening networks and interfaces are
               functional.  It can be used to measure round trip
               delay.  Numerous versions of the ping program exist.
          
          MECHANISM
               Ping is based on the ICMP ECHO_REQUEST message.
          
          CAVEATS
               If run repeatedly, ping could generate high system
               loads.
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               PC/TCP's ping is the only implementation known support
               both loose and strict source routing.  Though some ping
               implementations support the ICMP "record route"
               feature, the usefulness of this option for debugging
               routes is limited by the fact that many gateways do not
               correctly implement it.

          NAME
               proxyd -- SNMP proxy agent daemons from SNMP Research.
          
          KEYWORDS
               control, status; bridge, ethernet, IP, ring, star; NMS,
               SNMP; UNIX; library, sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               SNMP proxy agents may be used to permit the monitoring
               and controlling of network elements which are otherwise
               not addressable using the SNMP management protocol
               (e.g., a network bridge that implements a proprietary
               management protocol).  Similarly, SNMP proxy agents may
               be used to protect SNMP agents from redundant network
               management agents through the use of caches.  Finally,
               SNMP proxy agents may be used to implement elaborate
               MIB access policies.  The proxy agent daemon listens
               for SNMP queries and commands from logically remote
               network management stations, translates and retransmits
               those as appropriate network management queries or
               cache lookups, listens for and parses the responses,
               translates the responses into SNMP responses, and
               returns those responses as SNMP messages to the network
               management station that originated the transaction.
               The proxy agent daemon also emits SNMP traps to identi-
               fied trap receivers.  The proxy agent daemon is archi-
               tected to make the addition of additional vendor-
               specific variables a straight-forward task.  The proxy
               application comes complete with source code including a
               powerful set of portable libraries for generating and
               parsing SNMP messages and a set of command line utili-
               ties.
          
          MECHANISM
               Network management variables are made available for
               inspection and/or alteration by means of the Simple
               Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

          ABSTRACT
               Query allows remote viewing of a gateway's routing
               tables.
          
          MECHANISM
               Query formats and sends a RIP request or POLL command
               to a destination gateway.
          
          CAVEATS
               Query is intended to be used a a tool for debugging
               gateways, not for network management.  SNMP is the pre-
               ferred protocol for network management.

          ABSTRACT
               The Simple Event Reporting and Alarm Generation (SERAG)
               collects error messages and other event reports from
               servers on a LAN.  Any node with UDP/IP can be the
               source of such messages/reports.  The logging of error
               messages is integrated with the audit trail facility of
               the Network Control Server (NCS) from 3COM.  Alarms are
               generated on the NCS based on predefined conditions.
               Alarms may be sent to the console of the NCS, logged in
               a file, or routed via WAN to a service center.
          
               SERAG can automatically detect a predefined set of
               errors in the servers and generate alarms.  The break-
               down of a server in the LAN may also result in alarm
               generation.
          
               SERAG creates an error log that can be used for post-
               testing analysis.
          
          MECHANISM
               The tool searches through the audit trail (error log)
               files for events specified by the user.  The search may
               be constrained to specific nodes in the network and to
               a specific time frame.  Events may be combined into
               conditions which are logical expressions (e.g., look
               for eventA and eventB and not eventC within time frame
               so and so).  This is an interactive query facility to
               analyze the audit trail (error log).
          
               The user may also ask for such conditions to be checked
               at regular intervals, and specify routing of error mes-
               sages in case the condition is satisfied.  The checking
               of such conditions is done by a daemon process running
               in the background.
          
          CAVEATS
               May impact the performance of the NCS if error logs are
               big, or if conditions are computationally complex.
          
          BUGS
               None known.

          ABSTRACT
               The sma is a CMIP agent which runs on BSD UNIX and pro-
               vides access to management information on the operation
               of the ISODE transport layer (ISO Transport Protocol
               class 0).  It also supports the sending of event
               reports.  Activity can be recorded in a log file.
          
          MECHANISM
               The sma communicates with the active ISODE transport
               entities using UNIX UDP sockets in order to receive the
               management information which is made available to other
               manager processes via CMIP.

          ABSTRACT
               The Network General Sniffer is a protocol analyzer for
               performing LAN diagnostics, monitoring, traffic genera-
               tion, and troubleshooting.  The Sniffer protocol
               analyzer has the capability of capturing every packet
               on a network and of decoding all seven layers of the
               OSI protocol model.  Capture frame selection is based
               on several different filters: protocol content at lower
               levels; node addresses; pattern matching (up to 8
               logically-related patterns of 32 bytes each); and des-
               tination class.  Users may extend the protocol
               interpretation capability of the Sniffer by writing
               their own customized protocol interpreters and linking
               them to the Sniffer software.
          
               The Sniffer displays network traffic information and
               performance statistics in real time, in user-selectable
               formats.  Numeric station addresses are translated to
               symbolic names or manufacturer ID names.  Network
               activities measured include frames accepted, Kbytes
               accepted, and buffer use.  Each network version has
               additional counters for activities specific to that
               network.  Network activity is expressed as
               frames/second, Kbytes/second, or per cent of network
               bandwidth utilization.
          
               Data collection by the Sniffer may be output to printer
               or stored to disk in either print-file or spread-sheet
               format.
          
               Protocol suites understood by the Sniffer include:
               Banyan Vines, IBM Token-Ring, Novell Netware, XNS/MS-
               Net (3Com 3+), DECnet, TCP/IP (including SNMP and
               applications-layer protocols such as FTP, SMTP, and
               TELNET), X Windows (for X version 11), NFS, and several
               SUN proprietary protocols (including mount, pmap, RPC,
               and YP).  Supported LANs include: ethernet, Token-ring
               (4Mb and 16Mb versions), ARCNET, StarLAN, IBM PC Net-
               work (Broadband), and Apple Localtalk Network.

               The Sniffer is a self-contained, portable protocol
               analyzer that require only AC line power and connection
               to a network to operate.  Normally passive (except when
               in Traffic Generator mode), it captures images of all
               or of selected frames in a working buffer, ready for
               immediate analysis and display.
          
               The Sniffer is a standalone device.  Two platforms are
               available: one for use with single network topologies,
               the other for use with multi-network topologies.  Both
               include Sniffer core software, a modified network
               interface card (or multiple cards), and optional proto-
               col interpreter suites.
          
               All Sniffer functions may be remotely controlled from a
               modem-connected PC.  Output from the Sniffer can be
               imported to database or spreadsheet packages.
          
          CAVEATS
               In normal use, the Sniffer is a passive device, and so
               will not adversely effect network performance.  Perfor-
               mance degradation will be observed, of course, if the
               Sniffer is set to Traffic Generator mode and connected
               to an active network.
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               None reported.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               None.  The Sniffer is a self-contained unit, and
               includes its own interface card.  It installs into a
               network as would any normal workstation.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               None.

          NAME
               The SNMP Development Kit
          
          KEYWORDS
               manager, status; IP; NMS, SNMP; UNIX; free, sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               The SNMP Development Kit comprises C Language source
               code for a programming library that facilitates access
               to the management services of the SNMP (<a href="rfc1098.html">RFC 1098</a>).
               Sources are also included for a few simple client
               applications whose main purpose is to illustrate the
               use of the library.  Example client applications query
               remote SNMP agents in a variety of modes, and generate
               or collect SNMP traps.  Code for an example SNMP agent
               that supports a subset of the Internet MIB (<a href="rfc1066.html">RFC 1066</a>)
               is also included.
          
          MECHANISM
               The Development Kit facilitates development of SNMP-
               based management applications -- both clients and
               agents.  Example applications execute SNMP management
               operations according to the values of command line
               arguments.
          
          CAVEATS
               None.
          
          BUGS
               Fixed in the next release.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               None reported.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               The SNMP library source code is highly portable and
               runs on a wide range of platforms.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               The SNMP library source code has almost no operating
               system dependencies and runs in a wide range of
               environments.  Certain portions of the example SNMP
               agent code are specific to the 4.3BSD implementation of
               the UNIX system for the DEC MicroVAX.
          
          AVAILABILITY
               The Development Kit is available via anonymous FTP from

               UNIX, VMS; sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               The SNMP Libraries and Utilities serve two purposes:
          
               1)   to act as building blocks for the construction of
                    SNMP-based agent and manager applications; and
          
               2)   to act as network management tools for network
                    fire fighting and report generation.
          
               The libraries perform ASN.1 parsing and generation
               tasks for both network management station applications
               and network management agent applications.  These
               libraries hide the details of ASN.1 parsing and genera-
               tion from application writers and make it unnecessary
               for them to be expert in these areas.  The libraries
               are very robust with considerable error checking
               designed in.  The several command line utilities
               include applications for retrieving one or many vari-
               ables, retrieving tables, or effecting commands via the
               setting of remote network management variables.
          
          MECHANISM
               The parsing is performed via recursive descent methods.
               Messages are passed via the Simple Network Management
               Protocol (SNMP).

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpask is a network monitoring application which gath-
               ers specific information from a single network entity
               at regular intervals and stores this information into
               UNIX flat files.  A report generation package is
               included in the NYSERNet SNMP Software Distribution to
               produce reports and graphs from the raw data.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpask uses SNMP to gather its information.  The agent
               which must be queried and the variables to query for
               are specified in a configuration file.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being monitored in order for snmpask to be useful.
          
          BUGS
               None outstanding.  They are fixed as reports come in.
               Report bugs to:  nysersnmp@nisc.nyser.net
          
          LIMITATIONS
               SNMP polling is done synchronously.  Only a single
               agent can be polled per snmpask process.  Only 16 vari-
               ables can be requested per snmpask process.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpd is an SNMP agent which runs on UNIX derivatives
               and answers network management queries from network
               management stations supporting SNMP.  Snmpd also sup-
               ports the sending of SNMP traps.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpd conforms to SNMP as specified in <a href="rfc1098.html">RFC 1098</a>.  Cer-
               tain user configurable options are manipulated through
               a simple configuration file.
          
          CAVEATS
               UNIX does not support all of the MIB variables speci-
               fied in <a href="rfc1066.html">RFC 1066</a>.  Snmpd does the best it can to find
               the answers.

          NAME
               snmpd -- an SNMP host/gateway agent daemon from SNMP
               Research.
          
          KEYWORDS
               manager, status; bridge, ethernet, IP, ring, star; NMS,
               SNMP; DOS, UNIX; sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               The snmpd agent daemon listens for and responds to net-
               work management queries and commands from logically
               remote network management stations.  The agent daemon
               also emits SNMP traps to identified trap receivers.
               The agent daemon is architected to make the addition of
               additional vendor-specific variables a straight-forward
               task.  The snmpd application comes complete with source
               code including a powerful set of portable libraries for
               generating and parsing SNMP messages and a set of com-
               mand line utilities.
          
          MECHANISM
               Network management variables are made available for
               inspection and/or alteration by means of the Simple
               Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
          
          CAVEATS
               None.
          
          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               Only the operating system variables available without
               source code modifications to the operating system and
               device device drivers are supported.
          
          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               This software has been ported to a wide range of sys-
               tems, too numerous to itemize.  It includes worksta-
               tions, general purpose timesharing systems, and embed-
               ded hardware in intelligent network devices such as
               repeaters, bridges, and routers.
          
          SOFTWARE REQUIRED

          ABSTRACT
               Snmplookup is a network monitoring application that
               allows the interactive querying of a network entity.
               Snmplookup mimics nslookup, the DNS interactive query
               tool, in style and feel.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmplookup uses SNMP to gather its information.  The
               network entity to be queried and the variable to be
               retrieved can be entered from the command shell after
               snmplookup is invoked.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running on the network entity
               being monitored.
          
          BUGS
               None outstanding.  They are fixed as reports come in.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpperfmon is a network monitoring application based
               on the Berkeley curses terminal graphics package and
               the Simple Network Management Protocol.  The applica-
               tion monitors certain interface statistics from a sin-
               gle agent and displays them in tabular form on a stan-
               dard terminal screen.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpperfmon uses SNMP to gather its information.  The
               agent to be queried is specified on the command line.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being monitored in order for snmpperfmon to be useful.
          
          BUGS
               None outstanding.  They are fixed as reports come in.
               Report bugs to:  nysersnmp@nisc.nyser.net
          
          LIMITATIONS
               SNMP polling is done synchronously.  Only the predeter-
               mined (read "hard coded") interface statistics can be
               displayed.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmppoll is a network monitoring application which
               gathers specific information from a network at regular
               intervals and stores this information into UNIX flat
               files.  A report generation package is included in the
               NYSERNet SNMP Software Distribution to produce reports
               and graphs of raw data collected via SNMP.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmppoll uses SNMP to gather its information.  The
               agents which must be queried and the variables to query
               for are specified in a configuration file.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being monitored in order for snmppoll to be useful.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmproute is a network monitoring application that
               allows the user to query for the entire routing table
               or a single routing table entry from a network entity.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmproute uses SNMP to gather its information.  The
               network entity to be queried and the destination net-
               work to be queried for must be specified on the command
               line.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running on the network entity
               being monitored.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpset is a network management application that allows
               the alteration of a single variable in a specific
               agent.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpset uses SNMP to alter the agent variables.  The
               agent to which the set is directed and the variable to
               alter must be specified on the command line.  The user
               is prompted before any changes are made.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being managed in order for snmpset to be useful.  In
               addition, a read-write community must be configured on
               the agent.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpsrc is a network monitoring application that starts
               at a specified router in the network and traces the
               path of a given destination network from the starting
               router.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpsrc uses SNMP to gather its information.  The
               starting router and destination network must be speci-
               fied on the command line.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running on all of the routers in
               the path to the destination network in order for a com-
               plete path to be reported back to the user.  The same
               SNMP community must also be configured in every SNMP
               agent in the path to the destination network.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpstat is a network monitoring application that gath-
               ers specific information from a network at regular
               intervals and stores this information into a commercial
               database.  A report generation package is included in
               the NYSERNet SNMP Software Distribution to produce
               reports and graphs of raw data collected via SNMP.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpstat uses SNMP to gather its information.  The
               agents which must be queried and the variables to query
               for are specified in a configuration file.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being monitored in order for snmpstat to be useful.

          LIMITATIONS
               SNMP polling is done synchronously.  Currently, Ingres
               is the only commercial database supported.  SQL is the
               query language being used.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmptrapd is an SNMP trap agent that runs on UNIX
               derivatives.  It receives and logs traps which are gen-
               erated from snmp agents.  A report generation package
               is included in the NYSERNet SNMP Software Distribution
               to produce reports and graphs of raw data collected via
               SNMP.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmptrapd conforms to SNMP as specified in <a href="rfc1098.html">RFC 1098</a>.
               Certain user configurable options are manipulated
               through a simple configuration file.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpwatch is a network monitoring application that mon-
               itors variables in a single network entity and reports
               when they have changed value.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpwatch uses SNMP to gather its information.  The
               entity to be monitored and the variables to be watched
               must be specified on the command line.  Once a value
               changes, snmpwatch prints out the value and the vari-
               able to the standard output.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running on the network entity
               being monitored.  Upon invocation, the initial value of
               each variable will printed out to the standard output.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpxbar is a network monitoring application based on
               X-Windows Version 11 Release 2 and the Simple Network
               Management Protocol.  The application monitors a single
               numeric MIB object and displays its value in a bar
               chart.  Snmpxbar supports color graphics.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpxbar uses SNMP to gather its information.  The MIB
               object to be graphed must be specified on the command
               line.  The polling interval can be changed dynamically
               from within snmpxbar.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being monitored in order for snmpxbar to be useful.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpxconn is a network monitoring application based on
               X-Windows Version 11 Release 2 and the Simple Network
               Management Protocol.  The application monitors a number
               of (configurable) network entities and graphically dep-
               icts the TCP connections associated with the network
               entities via a TCP topology map.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpxconn uses SNMP to gather its information.  A con-
               figuration file is used to determine the network enti-
               ties to be monitored.  There are certain command line
               arguments which manipulate the X environment and SNMP
               actions.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being monitored in order for snmpxconn to be useful.
          
          BUGS
               None outstanding.  They are fixed as reports come in.
               Report bugs to:  nysersnmp@nisc.nyser.net
          
          LIMITATIONS
               SNMP polling is done synchronously.  The network enti-
               ties must be configured by manually adding information
               to a configuration file.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpxperf is a network monitoring application based on
               X-Windows Version 11 Release 2 and the Simple Network
               Management Protocol.  The application monitors a single
               numeric MIB object and displays its value in an EKG
               style histogram.  Snmpxperf supports color graphics.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpxperf uses SNMP to gather its information.  The MIB
               object to be graphed must be specified on the command
               line.  The polling interval can be changed dynamically
               from within snmpxperf.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being monitored in order for snmpxperf to be useful.
          
          BUGS
               Auto-scaling sometimes doesn't downscale the EKG-graph
               enough on large spikes.  This results in some of the
               graph running into the button boxes at the top of the
               window.  Generally, Bugs are fixed as reports come in.
               Report bugs to:  nysersnmp@nisc.nyser.net
          
          LIMITATIONS
               Can only graph one numeric MIB object per invocation.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpxperfmon is a network monitoring application based
               on X-Windows Version 11 Release 2 and the Simple Net-
               work Management Protocol.  The application monitors a
               single Network Entity and displays graphical informa-
               tion pertaining to the entities interface traffic
               statistics.  Snmpxperfmon supports color graphics.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpxperfmon uses SNMP to gather its information.  The
               MIB agent to be polled must be specified on the command
               line.  The agent is then queried about all of its
               interfaces.  Four EKG-style graphs are constructed for
               each interface (input pkts, output pkts, input Octets,
               output Octets).
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being monitored in order for snmpxperfmon to be useful.

          LIMITATIONS
               Can only graph one network entity per invocation.  Can
               only graph the amount of interfaces which will fit on a
               single bitmap display.  Does not auto-scale or resize.

          ABSTRACT
               Snmpxrtmetric is a network monitoring application based
               on X-Windows Version 11 Release 2 and the Simple Net-
               work Management Protocol.  The application monitors the
               routing table of a specific agent and displays the RIP
               routing metric of certain destination networks in bar
               chart format.
          
          MECHANISM
               Snmpxrtmetric uses SNMP to gather its information.  A
               configuration file is used to determine which destina-
               tion networks will be graphed.  The agent to be queried
               is specified on the command line.  Snmpxrtmetrtic sup-
               ports color graphics.
          
          CAVEATS
               An SNMP agent must be running in the network entity
               being monitored in order for snmpxrtmetric to be use-
               ful.

          NAME
               SpiderMonitor P220, K220 and
               SpiderAnalyzer P320, K320
          
          KEYWORDS
               alarm, analyzer, generator, traffic; DECnet, ethernet,
               IP, OSI; eavesdrop; standalone; sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               The SpiderMonitor and SpiderAnalyzer are protocol
               analyzers for performing ethernet LAN diagnostics, mon-
               itoring, traffic generation, and troubleshooting.  The
               SpiderMonitor has the capability of capturing every
               packet on a network and of decoding the first four
               layers of the OSI protocol model.  The SpiderAnalyzer
               has additional software for decoding higher protocol
               layers.  Protocol suites understood: TCP/IP (including
               SNMP and applications-layer protocols), OSI, XNS, DEC-
               net and IPX.  User-definable decodes can be written in
               'C' with the Microsoft version 5.0 'C' compiler.  A
               decode guide is provided.
          
               The SpiderAnalyzer supports multiple simultaneous
               filters for capturing packets using predefined patterns
               and error states.  Filter patterns can also trigger on
               NOT matching 1 or more filters, an alarm, or a speci-
               fied time.
          
               The SpiderAnalyzer can also employ TDR (Time Domain
               Reflectometry) to find media faults, open or short cir-
               cuits, or transceiver faults.  It can transmit OSI,
               XNS, and Xerox link-level echo packets to user-
               specified stations, performs loop round tests.
          
               In traffic generation mode, the SpiderAnalyzer has the
               ability to generate packets at random intervals of ran-
               dom lengths or any combination of random or fixed
               interval or length, generation of packets with CRC
               errors, or packets that are too short, or packets that
               are too long.
          
               Output from the SpiderMonitor/Analyzer can be imported
               to database or spreadsheet packages.
          
          MECHANISM

          NAME
               SPIMS -- the Swedish Institute of Computer Science
               (SICS) Protocol Implementation Measurement System tool.
          
          KEYWORDS
               benchmark, debugger; IP, OSI; spoof; UNIX.
          
          ABSTRACT
               SPIMS is used to measure the performance of protocol
               and "protocol-like" services including response time
               (two-way delay), throughput and the time to open and
               close connections.  It has been used to:
          
               o+    benchmark alternative protocol implementations,
          
               o+    observe how performance varies when parameters in
                    specific implementations have been varied (i.e.,
                    to tune parameters).
          
               SPIMS currently has interfaces to the DoD Internet Pro-
               tocols: UDP, TCP, FTP, SunRPC, the OSI protocols from
               the ISODE 4.0 distribution package: FTAM, ROSE, ISO TP0
               and to Sunlink 5.2 ISO TP4 as well as Stanford's VMTP.
               Also available are a rudimentary set of benchmarks,
               stubs for new protocol interfaces and a user manual.
               For an example of the use of SPIMS to tune protocols,
               see:

          MECHANISM
          
               SPIMS runs as user processes and uses a TCP connection
               for measurement set-up.  Measurements take place
               between processes over the measured protocol.  SPIMS
               generates messages and transfers them via the measured
               protocol service according to a user-supplied specifi-
               cation.  SPIMS has a unique measurement specification
               language that is used to specify a measurement session.
               In the language there are constructs for different
               application types (e.g., bulk data transfer), for
               specifying frequency and sequence of messages, for dis-
               tribution over message sizes and for combining basic
               specifications.  These specifications are independent
               of both protocols and protocol implementations and can
               be used for benchmarking.  For more details on the

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               SPIMS is implemented on UNIX, including SunOS 4.,
               4.3BSD UNIX, DN (UNIX System V, with extensions) and
               Ultrix 2.0/3.0.  It requires a TCP connection for meas-
               urement set-up.  No kernel modifications or any modifi-
               cations to measured protocols are required.
          
          AVAILABILITY
               SPIMS is not in the public domain; the software is
               covered by licenses.  The Swedish Institute of Computer
               Science has released the research prototype of SPIMS
               for research and non-commercial use.  Commercial organ-
               izations may obtain the research prototype, but it is
               for internal research only and for no commercial use
               whatsoever. A commercial, supported version of SPIMS is
               distributed by TeleLOGIC Uppsala AB, Sweden.
          
               For universities and non-profit organizations, SPIMS
               source code is distributed free of charge.  There are
               two ways to get the software:
          
               1.   FTP.  If you have an Internet FTP connection, you
                    can use anonymous FTP to sics.se [192.16.123.90],
                    and retrieve the file in pub/spims-
                    dist/dist890915.tar.Z (this is a .6MB tar image)

                    or envelopes.
          
               For other organizations, the SPIMS source code for the
               research prototype is distributed for a one-time fee of
               US$500.00.  Organizations interested in the research
               prototype need to contact SICS via email and briefly
               motivate why they qualify (non-commercial use) for the
               research prototype.  They will thereafter get a permis-
               sion to obtain a copy from the same distribution source
               as for universities.

          ABSTRACT
               Spray is a traffic generation tool that generates RPC
               or UDP packets, or ICMP Echo Requests.  The packets are
               sent to a remote procedure call application at the des-
               tination host.  The count of received packets is
               retrieved from the remote application after a certain
               number of packets have been transmitted.  The differ-
               ence in packets received versus packets sent represents
               (on a LAN) the packets that the destination host had to
               drop due to increasing queue length.  A measure of
               throughput relative to system speed and network load
               can thus be obtained.

          ABSTRACT
               Tcpdump can interpret and print headers for the follow-
               ing protocols: ethernet, IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, NFS, ND,
               ARP/RARP, AppleTalk.  Tcpdump has proven useful for
               examining and evaluating the retransmission and window
               management operations of TCP implementations.
          
          MECHANISM
               Much like etherfind, tcpdump writes a log file of the
               frames traversing an ethernet interface.  Each output
               line includes the time a packet is received, the type
               of packet, and various values from its header.

               tcplogger
          
          KEYWORDS
               traffic; IP; eavesdrop; UNIX; free.
          
          ABSTRACT
               Tcplogger consists of modifications to the 4.3BSD UNIX
               source code, and a large library of post-processing
               software.  Tcplogger records timestamped information
               from TCP and IP packets that are sent and received on a
               specified connection.  For each TCP packet, information
               such as sequence number, acknowledgement sequence
               number, packet size, and header flags is recorded.  For
               an IP packet, header length, packet length and TTL
               values are recorded.  Customized use of the TCP option
               field allows the detection of lost or duplicate pack-
               ets.
          
          MECHANISM
               Routines of 4.3BSD UNIX in the netinet directory have
               been modified to append information to a log in memory.
               The log is read continuously by a user process and
               written to a file.  A TCP option has been added to
               start the logging of a connection.  Lots of post-
               processing software has been written to analyze the
               data.

          BUGS
               None known.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               To get a log at both ends of the connection, the modi-
               fied kernel should be run at both the hosts.
          
               All connections are logged in a single file, but
               software is provided to filter out the record of a sin-
               gle connection.

          NAME
               traceroute
          
          KEYWORDS

          ABSTRACT
               Traceroute is a tool that allows the route taken by
               packets from source to destination to be discovered.
               It can be used for situations where the IP record route
               option would fail, such as intermediate gateways dis-
               carding packets, routes that exceed the capacity of an
               datagram, or intermediate IP implementations that don't
               support record route.  Round trip delays between the
               source and intermediate gateways are also reported
               allowing the determination of individual gateways con-
               tribution to end-to-end delay.
          
               Enhanced versions of traceroute have been developed
               that allow specification of loose source routes for
               datagrams.  This allows one to investigate the return
               path from remote machines back to the local host.
          
          MECHANISM
               Traceroute relies on the ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED error
               reporting mechanism.  When an IP packet is received by
               an gateway with a time-to-live value of 0, an ICMP
               packet is sent to the host which generated the packet.
               By sending packets to a destination with a TTL of 0,
               the next hop can be identified as the source of the
               ICMP TIME EXCEEDED message.  By incrementing the TTL
               field the subsequent hops can be identified.  Each
               packet sent out is also time stamped.  The time stamp
               is returned as part of the ICMP packet so a round trip
               delay can be calculated.
          
          CAVEATS
               Some IP implementations forward packets with a TTL of
               0, thus escaping identification.  Others use the TTL
               field in the arriving packet as the TTL for the ICMP
               error reply, which delays identification.
          
               Sending datagrams with the source route option will
               cause some gateways to crash.  It is considered poor
               form to repeat this behavior.
          
          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               Most versions of UNIX have errors in the raw IP code
               that require kernel mods for the standard version of
               traceroute to work.  A version of traceroute exists
               that runs without kernel mods under SunOS 3.5 (see
               below), but it only operates over an ethernet inter-
               face.

          ABSTRACT
               TRPT displays a trace of a TCP socket events.  When no
               options are supplied, TRPT prints all the trace records
               found in a system, grouped according to TCP connection
               protocol control block (PCB).
          
               An example of TRPT output is:

          MECHANISM
               TRPT interrogates the buffer of TCP trace records that
               is created when a TCP socket is marked for debugging.
          
          CAVEATS
               Prior to using TRPT, an analyst should take steps to
               isolate the problem connection and find the address of
               its protocol control blocks.
          
          BUGS
               None reported.
          
          LIMITATIONS
               A socket must have the debugging option set for TRPT to
               operate.  Another problem is that the output format of
               TRPT is difficult.

               ing end-to-end throughput.  It is good for evaluating
               TCP/IP implementations.
          
          MECHANISM
               Cooperating processes are started on two hosts.  The
               open a TCP connection and transfer a high volume of
               data.  Delay and throughput are calculated.

          ABSTRACT
               The Unisys Defense Systems Network Control Center (NCC)
               provides high-performance software to support the
               management and control of TCP/IP-based networks.  The
               network management system uses the Simple Network
               Management Protocol (SNMP) to exchange management
               information between the NCC and network devices.  The
               NCC supports the Management Information Base (MIB)
               [<a href="rfc1066.html">RFC-1066</a>] and the Structure and Identification of
               Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets
               [<a href="rfc1065.html">RFC-1065</a>].  In addition, Unisys has extended the MIB
               definitions to support the features of Unisys FDDI LAN
               devices, such as the FDDI Smart Concentrators, the FDDI
               Host Network Front Ends, and the Remote FDDI, FDDI-to-
               LAN, and FDDI-to-DDN gateways.
          
               The NCC supports seven applications.  The network
               topology map displays the physical and logical maps of
               the network.  The configuration management tool sup-
               ports the modification and validation of network device
               configuration data as well as the modification of MIB
               configuration data.  The performance monitoring tool
               supports the collection and analysis of statistical
               parameters from network devices.  The status monitoring
               tool reports on the up/down status and responsiveness
               of network devices using ICMP.  The accounting tool is
               used to collect, store, and display user job activity
               at the subscriber hosts.  The NCC database entry sup-
               ports <a href="rfc1066.html">RFC 1066</a> object definitions and Unisys-specific
               object definitions to support the Unisys FDDI devices.
               And finally, the trap reporting tool reports the
               arrival of error and event notifications using UDP
               datagrams.  The NCC supports all the trap messages
               defined in <a href="rfc1098.html">RFC 1098</a>.
          
          MECHANISM
               The NCC is based on the Simple Network Management Pro-
               tocol (SNMP).

          NAME
               WIN/MGT Station -- Network Management Station for
               SunOS.
          
          KEYWORDS
               alarm, control, manager, routing, status, traffic; eth-
               ernet, IP; NMS, SNMP, X; UNIX; library.
          
          ABSTRACT
               WIN/MGT Station for SunOS is a network management
               software product based on the SNMP.  It provides the
               capability to manage standards-based networking pro-
               ducts from The Wollongong Group as well as other ven-
               dors.  Fully compliant with RFCs 1065, 1066 and 1098,
               WIN/MGT Station uses a menu-driven graphical user
               interface.
          
               WIN/MGT capabilities include configuration, performance
               and fault management for SNMP-based agents.  The
               WIN/MGT station can perform polling to monitor the
               status of all MIB variables defined in <a href="rfc1066.html">RFC 1066</a>,
               "Management Information Base for network management of
               TCP/IP-based internets."  In addition, the WIN/MGT Sta-
               tion can process "trap" messages from SNMP agents.
               Furthermore, the WIN/MGT Station can support any
               private extension to the Management Information Base
               with minimal user configuration.
          
               An icon-driven network interface map allows the user to
               monitor their network topology and status.  Changes in
               the operational status of any manageable network ele-
               ment is displayed visually and audibly.
          
               The WIN/MGT package includes an Applications Program-
               ming Interface (API) for the "C" language.  The API is
               a set of libraries that enable an applications program
               to perform SNMP "set" and "get" operations.  This
               allows users to integrate site-specific applications
               with WIN/MGT.
          
               SNMP agent software for the Sun 3 host is also provided
               so that the Network Management Station itself can also
               be monitored and managed.
          
          MECHANISM
               The WIN/MGT Station uses SNMP to monitor and control
               SNMP agents.

          ABSTRACT
               Xnetmon and xpmon provide graphical representation of
               performance and status of SNMP-capable network ele-
               ments.  Xnetmon presents a schematic network map
               representing the up/down status of network elements;
               xpmon draws a pen plot style graph of the change over
               time of any arbitrary MIB object (<a href="rfc1066.html">RFC1066</a>).  Both xnet-
               mon and xpmon use the SNMP (<a href="rfc1098.html">RFC1098</a>) for retrieving
               status and performance data.
          
          MECHANISM
               Xnetmon polls network elements for the status of their
               interfaces on a controllable polling interval.  Pop-up
               windows displaying the values of any MIB variable are
               supported by separate polls.  When SNMP traps are
               received from a network element, that element and all
               adjacent elements are immediately re-polled to update
               their status.  The layout of the network map is stati-
               cally configured.  Xpmon repeatedly polls (using SNMP)
               the designated network element for the value of the
               designated MIB variable on the user-specified interval.
               The change in the variable is then plotted on the strip
               chart.  The strip chart regularly adjusts its scale to
               the current maximum value on the graph.
          
          CAVEATS
               Polling intervals should be chosen with care so as not
               to affect system performance adversely.

          ABSTRACT
               The XNETMON application implements a powerful network
               management station based on the X window system.  It
               provides network managers tools for fault management,
               configuration management, performance management, and
               security management.  It can be successfully used with
               many types of networks including those based on various
               LAN media, and wide area networks.  XNETMON has been
               used with multiprotocol devices including those which
               support TCP/IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols.  The fault
               management tool displays the map of the network confi-
               guration with node and link state indicated in one of
               several colors to indicate current status.  Alarms may
               be enabled to alert the operator of events occurring in
               the network.  Events are logged to disk.  The confi-
               guration management tool may be used to edit the net-
               work management information base stored in the network
               management station to reflect changes occurring in the
               network.  Other features include graphs and tabular
               tools for use in fault and performance management and
               mechanisms by which additional variables, such as
               vendor-specific variables, may be added.  The XNETMON
               application comes complete with source code including a
               powerful set of portable libraries for generating and
               parsing SNMP messages.  Output data from XNETMON may be
               transferred via flat files for additional report gen-
               eration by a variety of statistical packages.
          
          MECHANISM
               The XNETMON application is based on the Simple Network
               Management Protocol (SNMP).  Polling is performed via
               the powerful SNMP get-next operator and the SNMP get
               operator.  Trap directed polling is used to regulate
               the focus and intensity of the polling.

          NAME
               xnetperfmon -- a graphical network performance and
               fault management tool from SNMP Research.
          
          KEYWORDS
               manager, status; DECnet, ethernet, IP, OSI, ring, star;
               NMS, SNMP, X; DOS, UNIX, VMS; sourcelib.
          
          ABSTRACT
               Xnetperfmon may be used to plot SNMP variables as a
               graphical display.  These graphs are often useful for
               fault and performance management.  Variables may be
               plotted as gauges versus time.  Alternatively, counters
               may be plotted as delta count/delta time (rates).  The
               user may easily customize the variables to be plotted,
               labels, step size, update interval, and the like.  The
               scales automatically adjust whenever a point to be
               plotted would go off scale.
          
          MECHANISM
               The xnetperfmon application communicates with remote
               agents or proxy agents via the Simple Network Manage-
               ment Protocol (SNMP).
          
          CAVEATS
               All plots for a single invocation of xnetperfmon must
               be for variables provided by a single network manage-
               ment agent.  However, multiple invocations of xnetperf-
               mon may be active on a single display simultaneously or
               proxy agents may be used to summarize information at a
               common point.

                             Network Management Tutorial
          
          
          This tutorial is an overview of the practice of network
          management.  Reading this section is no substitute for know-
          ing your system, and knowing how it is used.  Do not wait
          until things break to learn what they ought to do or how
          they usually work: a crisis is not the time for determining
          how "normal" packet traces should look.  Furthermore, it
          takes little imagination to realize that you do not want to
          be digging through manuals while your boss is screaming for
          network service to be restored.
          
          We assume an acquaintance with the TCP/IP protocol suite and
          the Internet architecture.  There are many available refer-
          ences on these topics, several of which are listed below in
          <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.
          
          Since many of the details of network management are system-
          specific, this tutorial is a bit superficial.  There is,
          however, a more fundamental problem in prescribing network
          management practices: network management is not a well-
          understood endeavor.  At present, the cutting edge of net-
          work management is the use of distributed systems to collect
          and exchange status information, and then to display the
          data as histograms or trend lines.  It is not clear that we
          know what data should be collected, how to analyze it when
          we get it, or how to structure our collection systems.  For
          now, automated, real-time control of internets is an aspira-
          tion, rather than a reality.  The communications systems
          that we field are apparently more complex than we can
          comprehend, which no doubt accounts in part for their fre-
          quently surprising behavior.
          
          The first section of this tutorial lists the overall goals
          and functions of network management.  It presents several
          aspects of network management, including system monitoring,
          fault detection and isolation, performance testing, confi-
          guration management, and security.  These discussions are
          followed by a bibliographic section.  The tutorial closes
          with some final advice for network managers.

          An organization's view of network management goals is shaped
          by two factors:
          
          
          
          
          
          <span class="grey">IETF NOCTools Working Group                       [Page 155]</span></pre>

          <span class="grey">Appendix                         Network Management Tutorial</span>
          
          
          
               1.   people in the organization depend on the system
                    working,
          
               2.   LANs, routers, lines, and other communications
                    resources have costs.
          
          From the organizational vantage point, the ultimate goal of
          network management is to provide a consistent, predictable,
          acceptable level of service from the available data communi-
          cations resources.  To achieve this, a network manager must
          first be able to perform fault detection, isolation, and
          correction.  He must also be able to effect configuration
          changes with a minimum of disruption, and measure the utili-
          zation of system components.
          
          People actually managing networks have a different focus.
          Network managers are usually evaluated by the availability
          and performance of their communications systems, even though
          many factors of net performance are beyond their control.
          To them, the most important requirement of a network manage-
          ment tool is that it allows the detection and diagnosis of
          faults before users can call to complain: users (and bosses)
          can often be placated just by knowing that a network problem
          has been diagnosed.  Another vital network management func-
          tion is the ability to collect data that justify current or
          future expenditures for the data communications plant and
          staff.
          
          Following a section on system monitoring, this tutorial
          addresses fault, performance, configuration, and security
          management.  By fault management, we mean the detection,
          diagnosis, and correction of network malfunctions.  Under
          the subject of performance management, we include support
          for predictable, efficient service, as well as capacity
          planning and capacity testing.  Configuration management
          includes support for orderly configuration changes (usually,
          system growth), and local administration of component names
          and addresses.  Security management includes both protecting
          system components from damage and protecting sensitive
          information from unintentional or malicious disclosure or
          corruption.
          
          Readers familiar with the ISO management standards and
          drafts will note both that we have borrowed heavily from the
          "OSI Management Framework," except that we have omitted the
          "account management" function.  Account management seems a
          bit out of place with the other network management

          functions.  The logging required by account management is
          likely to be done by specialized, dedicated subsystems that
          are distinct from other network management components.
          Hence, this tutorial does not cover account management.
          Rest assured, however, that account management, if required,
          will be adequately supported and staffed.
          
          For those with a DoD background, security may also seem out
          of place as a subtopic of network management.  Without
          doubt, communications security is an important issue that
          should be considered in its own right.  Because of the
          requirements of trust for security mechanisms, security com-
          ponents will probably not be integrated subcomponents of a
          larger network management system.  Nevertheless, because a
          network manager has a responsibility to protect his system

          System monitoring is a fundamental aspect of network manage-
          ment.  One can divide system monitoring into two rough
          categories: error detection and baseline monitoring.
          
          System errors, such as misformatted frames or dropped pack-
          ets, are not in themselves cause for concern.  Spikes in
          error rates, however, should be investigated.  It is sound
          practice to log error rates over time, so that increases can
          be recognized.  Furthermore, logging error rates as a func-
          tion of traffic rates can be used to detect congestion.
          Investigate unusual error rates and other anomalies as they
          are detected, and keep a notebook to record your
          discoveries.
          
          Day-to-day traffic should be monitored, so that the opera-
          tional baselines of a system and its components can be
          determined.  As well as being essential for performance
          management, baseline determination and traffic monitoring
          are the keys to early fault detection.
          
          A preliminary step to developing baseline measurements is
          construction of a system map: a graphical representation of
          the system components and their interfaces.  Then, measure-
          ments of utilization (i.e., use divided by capacity) are
          needed.  Problems are most likely to arise, and system tun-
          ing efforts are most likely to be beneficial, at highly
          utilized components.

          It is worthwhile to develop a source/destination traffic
          matrix, including a breakdown of traffic between the local
          system and other internet sites.  Both volume and type of
          traffic should be logged, along with its evolution over
          time.  Of particular interest for systems with diskless
          workstations is memory swapping and other disk server
          access.  For all systems, broadcast traffic and routing
          traffic should be monitored.  Sudden increases in the vari-
          ance of delay or the volume of routing traffic may indicate
          thrashing or other soft failures.
          
          In monitoring a system, long-term averages are of little
          use.  Hourly averages are a better indicator of system use.
          Variance in utilization and delay should also be tracked.
          Sudden spikes in variance are tell-tale signs that a problem
          is looming or exists.  So, too, are trends of increased
          packet or line errors, broadcasts, routing traffic, or
          delay.

          When a system fails, caution is in order.  A net manager
          should make an attempt to diagnose the cause of a system
          crash before rebooting.  In many cases, however, a quick
          diagnosis will not be possible.  For some high priority
          applications, restoring at least some level of service will
          have priority over fault repair or even complete fault diag-
          nosis.  This necessitates prior planning.  A net manager
          must know the vital applications at his site.  If applica-
          tions require it, he must also have a fall-back plan for
          bringing them online.  Meanwhile, repeated crashes or
          hardware failures are unambiguous signs of a problem that
          must be corrected.
          
          A network manager should prepare for fault diagnosis by
          becoming familiar with how diagnostic tools respond to net-
          work failure.  In times of relative peace, a net manager
          should occasionally unplug the network connection from an
          unused workstation and then "debug" the problem.
          
          When diagnosing a fault or anomaly, it is vital to proceed
          in an orderly manner, especially since network faults will
          usually generate spurious as well as accurate error mes-
          sages.  Remember to keep in mind that the network itself is
          failing.  Do not place too much trust in anything obtained
          remotely.  Furthermore, it is unlikely to be significant
          that remote information such as DNS names or NFS files can-
          not be obtained.

          Even spurious messages can be revealing, because they pro-
          vide clues to the problem.  From the data at hand, develop
          working hypotheses about probable causes of the problems you
          detect.  Direct your further data gathering efforts so that
          the information you get will either refute or support your
          hypotheses.
          
          An orderly approach to debugging is facilitated if it is
          guided by a model of network behavior.  The following por-
          tions of this section present such a model, along with a
          procedure for checking network connectivity.  The section
          concludes with  some hints for diagnosing a particularly
          tricky class of connectivity problem.
          
          <span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1%20A%20Network%20Model%20as%20a%20Diagnostic%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a> A Network Model as a Diagnostic Framework</span>
          
          The point of having a model of how things work is to have a
          basis for developing educated guesses about how things go
          wrong.  The problem of cascading faults -- faults generating
          other faults -- makes use of a conceptual model a virtual
          necessity.
          
          In general, only problems in a component's hardware or
          operating system will generate simultaneous faults in multi-
          ple protocol layers.  Otherwise, faults will propagate vert-
          ically (up the protocol stack) or horizontally (between
          peer-level communications components).  Applying a concep-
          tual model that includes the architectural relations of net-
          work components can help to order an otherwise senseless
          barrage of error messages and symptoms.
          
          The model does not have to be formal or complex to bring
          structure to debugging efforts.  A useful start is something
          as simple as the following:
          
               1.   Applications programs use transport services:
                    TCP/UDP.  Before using service, applications that
                    accept host names as parameters must translate the
                    names into IP addresses.  Translation may be based
                    on a static table lookup (/etc/hosts file in UNIX
                    hosts), the DNS, or yellow pages.  Nslookup and
                    DiG are tools for monitoring the activities of the
                    DNS.
          
               2.   Transport protocol implementations use IP ser-
                    vices.  The local IP module makes the initial
                    decision on forwarding.  An IP datagram is for-
                    warded directly to the destination host if the
          
          
          
          <span class="grey">IETF NOCTools Working Group                       [Page 159]</span></pre>
          <hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-160" id="page-160" name="page-160"> </a>
          <span class="grey">Appendix                         Network Management Tutorial</span>
          
          
                    destination is on the same network as the source.
                    Otherwise, the datagram is forwarded to a gateway
                    attached to the network.  On BSD hosts, the con-
                    tents of a host's routing table are visible by use
                    of the "netstat" command.*
          
               3.   IP implementations translate the IP address of a
                    datagram's next hop (either the destination host
                    or a gateway) to a local network address.  For
                    ethernets, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
                    is commonly used for this translation.  On BSD
                    systems, an interface's IP address and other con-
                    figuration options can be viewed by use of the
                    "ifconfig" command, while the contents of a host's
                    ARP cache may be viewed by use of "arp" command.
          
               4.   IP implementations in hosts and gateways route
                    datagrams based on subnet and net identifiers.
                    Subnetting is a means of allocating and preserving
                    IP address space, and of insulating users from the
                    topological details of a multi-network campus.
                    Sites that use subnetting reserve portions of the
                    IP address's host identifier to indicate particu-
                    lar networks at their campus.  Subnetting is
                    highly system-dependent.  The details are a criti-
                    cal, though local, issue.  As for routing between
                    separate networks, a variety of gateway-to-gateway
                    protocols are used.  Traceroute is a useful tool
                    for investigating routing problems.  The tool,
                    "query," can be used to examine RIP routing
                    tables.
          
          A neophyte network manager should expand the above descrip-
          tion so that it accurately describes his particular system,
          _________________________
          * Initial forwarding may actually be complex and
          vulnerable to multiple points of failure.  For example,
          when sending an IP datagram, 4.3BSD hosts first look
          for a route to the particular host.  If none has been
          specified for the destination, then a search is made
          for a route to the network of the destination.  If this
          search also fails, then as a last resort, a search is
          made for a route to a "default" gateway.  Routes to
          hosts, networks, and the "default" gateway may be stat-
          ic, loaded at boot time and perhaps updated by operator
          commands.  Alternatively, they may be dynamic, loaded
          from redirects and routing protocol updates.

          TCP/IP connectivity problem.** In this procedure, a series

               If traceroute is not available, ping, netstat, arp, and
               a knowledge of the IP addresses of all the gateway's
               interfaces can be used to isolate the cause of the
               problem.  Use netstat to determine your next hop to the
               destination.  Ping that IP address to ensure the router
               is up.  Next, ping the router interface on the far sub-
               net.  If the router returns "network unreachable" or
               other errors, investigate the router's routing tables
               and interface status.  If the pings succeed, ping the
               close interface of the succeeding next hop gateway, and
               so on.  Remember the routing along the outbound and
               return paths may be different.

          or tcpdump) can help to pinpoint the problem.
          
          The above procedure is sound and useful, especially if lit-
          tle is known about the cause of the connectivity problem.
          It is not, however, guaranteed to be the shortest path to
          diagnosis.  In some cases, a binary search on the problem
          might be more effective (i.e., try a test "in the middle,"
          in a spot where the failure modes are well defined).  In
          other cases, available information might so strongly suggest
          a particular failure that immediately testing for it is in
          order.  This last "approach," which might be called "hunting
          and pecking," should be used with caution: chasing one will
          o' the wisp after another can waste much time and effort.
          
          Note that line problems are still among the most common
          causes of connectivity loss.  Problems in transmission
          across local media are outside the scope of this tutorial.

          But, if a host or workstation loses or cannot establish con-
          nectivity, check its physical connection.

          An interesting class of problems can result in a particu-
          larly mysterious failure: TELNET or other low-volume TCP
          connections work, but large file transfers fail.  FTP
          transfers may start, but then hang.  There are several pos-
          sible culprits in this problem.  The most likely suspects
          are IP implementations that cannot fragment or reassemble
          datagrams, and TCP implementations that do not perform
          dynamic window sizing (a.k.a. Van Jacobson's "Slow Start"
          algorithm).  Another possibility is mixing incompatible
          frame formats on an ethernet.
          
          Even today, some IP implementations in the Internet cannot
          correctly handle fragmentation or reassembly.  They will
          work fine for small packets, but drop all large packets.
          
          The problem can also be caused by buffer exhaustion at gate-
          ways that connect interfaces of widely differing bandwidth.
          Datagrams from a TCP connection that traverses a bottleneck
          will experience queue delays, and will be dropped if buffer
          resources are depleted.  The congestion can be made worse if
          the TCP implementation at the traffic source does not use
          the recommended algorithms for computing retransmission
          times, since spuriously retransmitted datagrams will only
          add to the congestion.* Fragmentation, even if correctly
          implemented, will compound this problem, since processing
          delays and congestion will be increased at the bottleneck.
          
          Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) links are especially
          vulnerable to this and other congestion problems.  SLIP
          lines are typically an order of magnitude slower than other
          gateway interfaces.  Also, the SLIP lines are at times con-
          figured with MTUs (Maximum Transfer Unit, the maximum length
          of an IP datagram for a particular subnet) as small as 256
          _________________________
          * To avoid this problem, TCP implementations on the In-
          ternet must use "exponential backoff" between succes-
          sive retransmissions, Karn's algorithm for filtering
          samples used to estimate round-trip delay between TCP
          peers, and Jacobson's algorithm for incorporating vari-
          ance into the "retransmission time-out" computation for
          TCP segments.  See <a href="rfc1122.html#section-4.2.3.1">Section 4.2.3.1 of RFC 1122</a>, "Re-
          quirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers."

          bytes, which virtually guarantees fragmentation.
          
          To alleviate this problem, TCP implementations behind slow
          lines should advertise small windows.  Also, if possible,
          SLIP lines should be configured with an MTU no less than 576
          bytes.  The tradeoff to weigh is whether interactive traffic
          will be penalized too severly by transmission delays of
          lengthy datagrams from concurrent file transfers.
          
          Misuse of ethernet trailers can also cause the problem of
          hanging file transfers.  "Trailers" refers to an ethernet
          frame format optionally employed by BSD systems to minimize
          buffer copying by system software.  BSD systems with ether-
          net interfaces can be configured to send large frames so
          that their address and control data are at the end of a
          frame (hence, a "trailer" instead of a "header").  After a
          memory page is allocated and loaded with a received ethernet
          frame, the ethernet data will begin at the start of the
          memory page boundary.  Hence, the ethernet control informa-
          tion can be logically stripped from the end merely by
          adjusting the page's length field.  By manipulating virtual
          memory mapping, this same page (sans ethernet control infor-
          mation), can then be passed to the local IP module without
          additional allocation and loading of memory.  The disadvan-
          tage in using trailers is that it is non-standard.  Many
          implementations cannot parse trailers.
          
          The hanging FTP problem will appear if a gateway is not con-
          figured to recognize trailers, but a host or gateway immedi-
          ately "upstream" on an ethernet uses them.  Short datagrams
          will not be formatted with trailers, and so will be pro-
          cessed correctly.  When the bulk data transfer starts, how-
          ever, full-sized frames will be sent, and will use the
          trailer format.  To the gateway that receives them, they
          appear simply as misformatted frames, and are quietly
          dropped.  The solution, obviously, is to insure that all
          hosts and gateways on an ethernet are consistent in their
          use of trailers.  Note that <a href="rfc1122.html">RFC 1122</a>, "Internet Host
          Requirements," places very strict restrictions on the use of
          trailers.

          Performance management encompasses two rather different
          activities.  One is passive system monitoring to detect
          problems and determine operational baselines.  The goal is
          to measure system and component utilization and so locate
          bottlenecks, since bottlenecks should receive the focus of

          performance tuning efforts.  Also, performance data is usu-
          ally required by upper level management to justify the costs
          of communications systems.  This is essentially identical to
          system monitoring, and is addressed at greater length in
          <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, above.
          
          Another aspect of performance management is active perfor-
          mance testing and capacity planning.  Some work in this area
          can be based on analysis.  For example, a rough estimate of
          gateway capacity can be deduced from a simple model given by
          Charles Hedrick in his "Introduction to Administration of an
          Internet-based Local Network," which is
          
               per-packet processing time =
                         switching time +
                                   (packet size) * (transmission bps).
          
          Another guideline for capacity planning is that in order to
          avoid excessive queuing delays, a system should be sized at
          about double its expected load.  In other words, system
          capacity should be so high that utilization is no greater
          than 50%.
          
          Although there are more sophisticated analytic models of
          communications systems than those above, their added com-
          plexity does not usually gain a corresponding accuracy.
          Most analytic models of communications nets require assump-
          tions about traffic load distributions and service rates
          that are not merely problematic, but are patently false.
          These errors tend to result in underestimating queuing
          delays.  Hence, it is often necessary to actually load and
          measure the performance of a real communications system if
          one is to get accurate performance predictions.  Obviously,
          this type of testing is performed on isolated systems or
          during off hours.  The results can be used to evaluate
          parameter settings or predict performance during normal
          operations.
          
          Simulations can be used to supplement the testing of real
          systems.  To be believable, however, simulations require
          validation, which, in turn, requires measurements from a
          real system.  Whether testing or simulating a system's per-
          formance, actual traffic traces should be incorporated as
          input to traffic generators.  The performance of a communi-
          cations system will be greatly influenced by its load
          characteristics (burstiness, volume, etc.), which are them-
          selves highly dependent on the applications that are run.

          When tuning a net, in addition to the usual configuration
          parameters, consider the impact of the location of gateways
          and print and file servers.  A few rules of thumb can guide
          the location of shared system resources.  First, there is
          the principle of locality: a system will perform better if
          most traffic is between nearby destinations.  The second
          rule is to avoid creating bottlenecks.  For example, multi-
          ple diskservers may be called for to support a large number
          of workstations.  Furthermore, to avoid LAN and diskserver
          congestion, workstations should be configured with enough
          memory to avoid frequent swapping.
          
          As a final note on performance management, proceed cau-
          tiously if your ethernet interface allows you to customize
          its collision recovery algorithm.  This is almost always a
          bad idea.  The best that it can accomplish is to give a few
          favored hosts a disproportionate share of the ethernet
          bandwidth, perhaps at the cost of a reduction in total sys-
          tem throughput.  Worse, it is possible that differing colli-
          sion recovery algorithms may exhibit a self-synchronizing
          behavior, so that excess collisions are generated.

          Configuration management is the setting, collecting, and
          storing of the state and parameters of network resources.
          It overlaps all other network management functions.  Hence,
          some aspects of configuration management have already been
          addressed (e.g., tuning for performance).  In this section,
          we will focus on configuration management activities needed
          to "hook up" a net or campus to a larger internet.  We will
          not, of course, include specific details on installing or
          maintaining internetted communications systems.  We will,
          however, skim over some of the TCP/IP configuration
          highlights.
          
          Configuration management includes "name management" -- the
          control and allocation of system names and addresses, and
          the translation between names and addresses.  Name-to-
          address translation is performed by "name servers." We con-
          clude this section with a few strictures on the simultaneous
          use of two automated name-servers, the Domain Name System
          (DNS), and Yellow Pages (YP).

          host-specific, while other information will be common for
          all hosts on a subnet.  In a soon to be published RFC docu-
          ment,* R. Droms identifies the following configuration data
          required by internet hosts:
          
               o+    An IP address, a host specific value that can be
                    hard-coded or obtained via BOOTP, the Reverse
                    Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) or Dynamic RARP
                    (DRARP).
          
               o+    Subnet properties, such as the subnet mask and the
                    Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU); obviously, these
                    values are not host-specific.
          
               o+    Addresses of "entry" gateways to the internet;
                    addresses of default gateways are usually hard-
                    coded; though the ICMP "redirect" message can be
                    used to refine a host's routing tables, there is
                    currently no dynamic TCP/IP mechanism or protocol
                    for a host to locate a gateway; an IETF working
                    group is busy on this problem.
          
               o+    For hosts in internets using the Domain Name Sys-
                    tem (DNS) for name-to-address translation, the
                    location of a local DNS server is needed; this
                    information is not host-specific, and usually
                    hard-coded;
          
               o+    Host name (domain name, for hosts using DNS);
                    obviously host-specific; either hard-coded or
                    obtained in a boot procedure.
          
               o+    For diskless hosts, various boot services.  BOOTP
                    is the standard Internet protocol for downloading
                    boot configuration information.  The Trivial File
                    Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is typically used for
                    downloading boot images.  Sun computers use the
                    "bootparams" RPC mechanism for downloading initial
                    configuration data to a host.
          
          There are ongoing developments, most notably the work of the
          Dynamic Host Configuration Working Group of the IETF, to
          support dynamic, automatic gathering of the above data.  In
          the meantime, most systems will rely on hand-crafted confi-
          guration files.

          The original TCP/IP Internet (spelled with an upper-case
          "I") is still active, and still growing.  An interesting
          aspect of the Internet is that it spans many independently
          administered systems.
          
          Connection to the Internet requires: a registered network
          number, for use in IP addresses; a registered autonomous
          system number (ASN), for use in internet routing; and, a
          registered domain name.  Fielding a primary and backup DNS
          server is a condition for registering a domain name.
          
          The Defense Data Network (DDN) Network Information Center
          (NIC) is responsible for registering network numbers, auto-
          nomous system numbers, and domain names.  Regional nets will
          have their own policies and requirements for Internet con-
          nections, but all use the NIC for this registration service.

          system can be configured to provide an identical service, by
          providing remote, keyed access to the "hosts.byname" map.
          Unfortunately, if both DNS and the YP hosts.byname map are
          installed, they can interact in disruptive ways.
          
          The problem has been noted in systems in which DNS is used
          as a fallback, to resolve hostnames that YP cannot.  If DNS
          is slow in responding, the timeout in program ypserv may
          expire, which triggers a repeated request.  This can result
          in disaster if DNS was initially slow because of congestion:
          the slower things get, the more requests are generated,
          which slows things even more.  A symptom of this problem is
          that failures by the DNS server or network will trigger

          numerous requests to DNS.
          
          Reportedly, the bug in YP that results in the avalanche of
          DNS requests has been repaired in SunOS 4.1.  The problem,
          however, is more fundamental than an implementation error.
          The YP map hosts.byname and the DNS contain the same class
          of information.  One can get an answer to the same query
          from each system.  These answers may well be different:
          there is not a mechanism to maintain consistency between the
          systems.  More critical, however, is the lack of a mechanism
          or procedure to establish which system is authoritative.
          Hence, running the DNS and YP name services in parallel is
          pointless.  If the systems stay consistent, then only one is
          needed.  If they differ, there is no way to choose which is
          correct.
          
          The YP hosts.byname service and DNS are comparable, but
          incompatible.  If possible, a site should not run both ser-
          vices.  Because of Internet policy, sites with Internet con-
          nections MUST use the DNS.  If YP is also used, then it
          should be configured with YP-to-DNS disabled.
          
          Hacking a system so that it uses DNS rather than the YP
          hosts.byname map is not trivial, and should not be attempted
          by novices.  The approach is to rebuild the shared C link-
          library, so that system calls to gethostbyname() and
          gethostbyaddr() will use DNS rather than YP.  To complete
          the change, programs that do not dynamically link the shared
          C library (rcp, arp, etc.)  must also be rebuilt.
          
          Modified shared C libraries for Sun 3s and Sun 4s are avail-
          able via anonymous FTP from host uunet.uu.net, in the sun-
          fixes directory.  Note that use of DNS routines rather than
          YP for general name resolution is not a supported SunOS
          feature at this time.

          The guidelines and advice in this section pertain to enhanc-
          ing the protection of data that are merely "sensitive."  By
          themselves, these measures are insufficient for protecting
          "classified" data.  Implementing the policies required to
          protect classified data is subject to stringent, formal
          review procedures, and is regulated by agencies such as the
          Defense Investigative Service (DIS) and the National Secu-
          rity Agency (NSA).
          
          A network manager must realize that he is responsible for

          protecting his system and its users.  Furthermore, though
          the Internet may appear to be a grand example of a coopera-
          tive joint enterprise, recent incidents have made it clear
          that not all Internet denizens are benign.
          
          A network manager should be aware that the network services
          he runs have a large impact on the security risks to which
          his system is exposed.  The prudent network manager will be
          very careful as to what services his site provides to the
          rest of the Internet, and what access restrictions are
          enforced.  For example, the protocol "finger" may provide
          more information about a user than should be given to the
          world at large.  Worse, most implementations of the protocol
          TFTP give access to all world-readable files.
          
          This section highlights several basic security considera-
          tions for Internet sites.  It then lists several sources of
          information and advice on improving the security of systems
          connected to the Internet.
          
          <span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1%20Basic%20Internet%20Security"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a> Basic Internet Security</span>
          
          Two major Internet security threats are denial of service
          and unauthorized access.
          
          Denial of service threats often take the form of protocol
          spoofers or other malicious traffic generators.  These prob-
          lems can be detected through system monitoring logs.  If an
          attack is suspected, immediately contact your regional net
          office (e.g., SURANET, MILNET).  In addition, DDN users
          should contact SCC, while other Internet users should con-
          tact CERT (see below).  A cogent description of your
          system's symptoms will be needed.
          
          At your own site, be prepared to isolate the problems (e.g.,
          by limiting disk space available to the message queue of a
          mail system under attack).  As a last resort, coping with an
          attack may require taking down an Internet connection.  It
          is better, however, not to be too quick to quarantine your
          site, since information for coping with the attack may come
          via the Internet.
          
          Unauthorized access is a potentially more ominous security
          threat.  The main avenues are attacks against passwords and
          attacks against privileged system processes.
          
          An appallingly common means of gaining entry to systems is
          by use of the initial passwords to root, sysdiag, and other
          
          
          
          <span class="grey">IETF NOCTools Working Group                       [Page 170]</span></pre>
          <hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-171" id="page-171" name="page-171"> </a>
          <span class="grey">Appendix                         Network Management Tutorial</span>
          
          
          management accounts that systems are shipped with.  Only
          slightly less vulnerable are common or trivial passwords,
          since these are readily subverted by dictionary attacks.*
          Obvious steps can reduce the risk of password attacks: pass-
          words should be short-lived, at least eight characters long,
          with a mix of upper and lower case, and preferably random.
          The distasteful aspect of memorizing a random string can be
          alleviated if the password is pronounceable.
          
          Improving passwords does not remove all risks.  Passwords
          transmitted over an ethernet are visible to all attached
          systems.  Furthermore, gateways have the potential to inter-
          cept passwords used by any FTP or TELNET connections that
          traverse them.  It is a bad idea for the root account to be
          accessed by FTP or TELNET if the connections must cross
          untrusted elements.
          
          Attacks against system processes are another avenue of unau-
          thorized access.  The principle is that by subverting a sys-
          tem process, the attacker can then gain its access
          privileges.
          
          One approach to reducing this risk is to make system pro-
          grams harder to subvert.  For example, the widespread attack
          in November 1988 by a self-replicating computer program
          ("worm," analogous to a tapeworm) subverted the "fingerd"
          process, by loading an intrusive bootstrap program (known
          variously as a "grappling hook" or "vector" program), and
          then corrupting the stack space so that a subroutine's
          return address was overwritten with the address of the
          bootstrap program.** The security hole in fingerd consisted
          of an input routine that did not have a length check.  Secu-
          rity fixes to "fingerd" include the use of a revised input
          routine.
          
          A more general protection is to apply the principle of
          "least privilege."  Where possible, system routines should
          run under separate user IDs, and should have no more
          privilege than is necessary for them to function.

          To further protect against attacks on system processes, sys-
          tem managers should regularly check their system programs to
          ensure that they have not been tampered with or modified in
          any way.  Checksums should be used for this purpose.  Using
          the operating system to check a file's last date of modifi-
          cation is insufficient, since the date itself can be
          compromised.
          
          Finally, to avoid the unauthorized replacement of system
          code, care should be exercised in assigning protection to
          its directory paths.
          
          Some system programs actually have "trap doors" that facili-
          tate subversion.  A trap door is the epitome of an undocu-
          mented feature: it is a hidden capability of a system pro-
          gram that allows a knowledgeable person to gain access to a
          system.  The Internet Worm exploited what was essentially a
          trap door in the BSD sendmail program.
          
          Ensuring against trap doors in software as complex as send-
          mail may be infeasible.  In an ideal world, the BSD sendmail
          program would be replaced by an entire mail subsystem (i.e.,
          perhaps including mail user agents, mail transfer agents,
          and text preparation and filing programs).  Any site using
          sendmail should at least obtain the less vulnerable,
          toughened distribution from ucbarpa.berkeley.edu, in file
          ~ftp/4.3/sendmail.tar.Z.  Sites running SunOS should note
          that the 4.0.3 release closed the security holes exploited
          by the Internet Worm.  Fixes for a more obscure security
          hole in SunOS are available from host uunet.uu.net in
          ~ftp/sun-fixes; these improvements have been incorporated in
          SunOS 4.1.
          
          Sendmail has problems other than size and complexity.  Its
          use of root privileges, its approach to alias expansion, and
          several other design characteristics present potential ave-
          nues of attack.  For UNIX sites, an alternative mail server
          to consider is MMDF, which is now at version 2.  MMDF is
          distributed as part of the SCO UNIX distribution, and is
          also available in the user contributed portion of 4.3BSD.
          Though free, MMDF is licensed, and resale is restricted.
          Sites running MMDF should be on the mmdf email list;
          requests to join this list should be sent to:
               mmdf2-request@relay.cs.net.
          
          Programs that masquerade as legitimate system code but which
          contain trap doors or other aides to unauthorized access are
          known as trojan horses.  Computer "viruses," intrusive

          software that infects seemingly innocent programs and pro-
          pagates when the infected programs are executed or copied,
          are a special case of trojan horse programs.*
          
          To guard against trojan horse attacks, be wary of programs
          downloaded from remote sources.  At minimum, do not download
          executables from any but the most trusted sources.  Also, as
          noted above, to avoid proliferation of "infected" software,
          checksums should be computed, recorded, and periodically
          verified.

          The Internet community can get security assistance from the
          Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), established by
          DARPA in November 1988.  The Coordination Center for the
          CERT (CERT/CC) is located at the Software Engineering Insti-
          tute at Carnegie Mellon University.  The CERT is intended to
          respond to computer security threats such as the November
          '88 worm attack that invaded many defense and research com-
          puters.  Consult <a href="rfc1135.html">RFC 1135</a> (Reynolds, J., "The Helminthiasis
          of the Internet", USC/ISI, December 1989), for further
          information.
          
          CERT assists Internet sites in response to security attacks
          or other emergency situations.  It can immediately tap
          experts to diagnose and solve the problems, as well as
          establish and maintain communications with the affected com-
          puter users and with government authorities as appropriate.
          Specific responses will be taken in accordance with the
          nature of the problem and the magnitude of the threat.
          
          CERT is also an information clearing-house for the identifi-
          cation and repair of security vulnerabilities, informal
          assessments of existing systems in the research community,
          improvement to emergency response capability, and both ven-
          dor and user security awareness.  This security information
          is distributed by periodic bulletins, and is posted to the
          USENET news group comp.security.announce.  In addition, the
          security advisories issued by CERT, as well as other useful
          security-related information, are available via anonymous

          There are many additional online sources on Internet Manage-
          ment.  <a href="rfc1118.html">RFC 1118</a>, "A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Internet," by
          Ed Krol, is a useful introduction to the Internet routing
          algorithms.  For more of the nitty-gritty on laying out and
          configuring a campus net, see Charles Hedrick's "Introduc-
          tion to Administration of an Internet-based Local Network,"
          available via anonymous FTP from cs.rutgers.edu (sometimes
          listed in host tables as aramis.rutgers.edu), in subdirec-
          tory runet, file tcp-ip-admin.  Finally, anyone responsible
          for systems connected to the Internet must be thoroughly
          versed in the Host Requirements RFCs (<a href="rfc1122.html">RFC 1122</a> and <a href="rfc1123.html">RFC 1123</a>)
