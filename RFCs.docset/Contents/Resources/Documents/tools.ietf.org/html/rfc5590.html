Abstract

   This document defines a Transport Subsystem, extending the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) architecture defined in <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>.
   This document defines a subsystem to contain Transport Models that is
   comparable to other subsystems in the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture.  As work
   is being done to expand the transports to include secure transports,
   such as the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol and Transport Layer Security

   This document defines a Transport Subsystem, extending the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) architecture defined in [<a href="rfc3411.html" title='"An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks"'>RFC3411</a>].
   This document identifies and describes some key aspects that need to
   be considered for any Transport Model for SNMP.

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="rfc3410.html#section-7">Section 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="rfc3410.html" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   Lowercase versions of the keywords should be read as in normal
   English.  They will usually, but not always, be used in a context
   that relates to compatibility with the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture or the
   subsystem defined here but that might have no impact on on-the-wire
   compatibility.  These terms are used as guidance for designers of
   proposed IETF models to make the designs compatible with <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>
   subsystems and Abstract Service Interfaces (ASIs).  Implementers are
   free to implement differently.  Some usages of these lowercase terms
   are simply normal English usage.

   For consistency with SNMP-related specifications, this document
   favors terminology as defined in STD 62, rather than favoring
   terminology that is consistent with non-SNMP specifications that use
   different variations of the same terminology.  This is consistent
   with the IESG decision to not require the SNMPv3 terminology be
   modified to match the usage of other non-SNMP specifications when
   SNMPv3 was advanced to Full Standard.

   This document discusses an extension to the modular <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>
   architecture; this is not a protocol document.  An architectural
   "MUST" is a really sharp constraint; to allow for the evolution of
   technology and to not unnecessarily constrain future models, often a

   "SHOULD" or a "should" is more appropriate than a "MUST" in an
   architecture.  Future models MAY express tighter requirements for
   their own model-specific processing.

   It is expected that readers of this document will have read RFCs 3410
   and 3411, and have a general understanding of the functionality
   defined in RFCs 3412-3418.

   The "Transport Subsystem" is an additional component for the SNMP
   Engine depicted in <a href="rfc3411.html#section-3.1">RFC 3411, Section 3.1</a>.

   The following diagram depicts its place in the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture.

   The transport mappings defined in <a href="rfc3417.html">RFC 3417</a> do not provide lower-layer
   security functionality, and thus do not provide transport-specific
   security parameters.  This document updates <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> and <a href="rfc3417.html">RFC 3417</a> by
   defining an architectural extension and modifying the ASIs that
   transport mappings (hereafter called "Transport Models") can use to
   pass transport-specific security parameters to other subsystems,
   including transport-specific security parameters that are translated
   into the transport-independent securityName and securityLevel
   parameters.

   The Transport Security Model [<a href="rfc5591.html" title='"Transport Security Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5591</a>] and the Secure Shell Transport
   Model [<a href="rfc5592.html" title='"Secure Shell Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5592</a>] utilize the Transport Subsystem.  The Transport
   Security Model is an alternative to the existing SNMPv1 Security
   Model [<a href="rfc3584.html" title='"Coexistence between Version 1, Version 2, and Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC3584</a>], the SNMPv2c Security Model [<a href="rfc3584.html" title='"Coexistence between Version 1, Version 2, and Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC3584</a>], and the User-
   based Security Model [<a href="rfc3414.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC3414</a>].  The Secure Shell Transport Model is
   an alternative to existing transport mappings as described in
   [<a href="rfc3417.html" title='"Transport Mappings for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC3417</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Motivation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Motivation</span>

   Just as there are multiple ways to secure one's home or business, in
   a continuum of alternatives, there are multiple ways to secure a
   network management protocol.  Let's consider three general
   approaches.

   In the first approach, an individual could sit on his front porch
   waiting for intruders.  In the second approach, he could hire an
   employee, schedule the employee, position the employee to guard what
   he wants protected, hire a second guard to cover if the first gets
   sick, and so on.  In the third approach, he could hire a security
   company, tell them what he wants protected, and leave the details to
   them.  Considerations of hiring and training employees, positioning
   and scheduling the guards, arranging for cover, etc., are the
   responsibility of the security company.  The individual therefore
   achieves the desired security, with significantly less effort on his
   part except for identifying requirements and verifying the quality of
   service being provided.

   The User-based Security Model (USM) as defined in [<a href="rfc3414.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC3414</a>] largely
   uses the first approach -- it provides its own security.  It utilizes
   existing mechanisms (e.g., SHA), but provides all the coordination.
   USM provides for the authentication of a principal, message
   encryption, data integrity checking, timeliness checking, etc.

   USM was designed to be independent of other existing security
   infrastructures.  USM therefore uses a separate principal and key
   management infrastructure.  Operators have reported that deploying
   another principal and key management infrastructure in order to use



<span class="grey">Harrington &amp; Schoenwaelder  Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-6" id="page-6" name="page-6"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5590.html">RFC 5590</a>                SNMP Transport Subsystem               June 2009</span>


   SNMPv3 is a deterrent to deploying SNMPv3.  It is possible to use
   external mechanisms to handle the distribution of keys for use by
   USM.  The more important issue is that operators wanted to leverage
   existing user management infrastructures that were not specific to
   SNMP.

   A USM-compliant architecture might combine the authentication
   mechanism with an external mechanism, such as RADIUS [<a href="rfc2865.html" title='"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"'>RFC2865</a>], to
   provide the authentication service.  Similarly, it might be possible
   to utilize an external protocol to encrypt a message, to check
   timeliness, to check data integrity, etc.  However, this corresponds
   to the second approach -- requiring the coordination of a number of
   differently subcontracted services.  Building solid security between
   the various services is difficult, and there is a significant
   potential for gaps in security.

   An alternative approach might be to utilize one or more lower-layer
   security mechanisms to provide the message-oriented security services
   required.  These would include authentication of the sender,
   encryption, timeliness checking, and data integrity checking.  This
   corresponds to the third approach described above.  There are a
   number of IETF standards available or in development to address these
   problems through security layers at the transport layer or
   application layer, among them are TLS [<a href="rfc5246.html" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>], Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [<a href="rfc4422.html" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>], and SSH [<a href="rfc4251.html" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>]

   From an operational perspective, it is highly desirable to use
   security mechanisms that can unify the administrative security
   management for SNMPv3, command line interfaces (CLIs), and other
   management interfaces.  The use of security services provided by
   lower layers is the approach commonly used for the CLI, and is also
   the approach being proposed for other network management protocols,
   such as syslog [<a href="rfc5424.html" title='"The Syslog Protocol"'>RFC5424</a>] and NETCONF [<a href="rfc4741.html" title='"NETCONF Configuration Protocol"'>RFC4741</a>].

   This document defines a Transport Subsystem extension to the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>
   architecture that is based on the third approach.  This extension
   specifies how other lower-layer protocols with common security
   infrastructures can be used underneath the SNMP protocol and the
   desired goal of unified administrative security can be met.

   This extension allows security to be provided by an external protocol
   connected to the SNMP engine through an SNMP Transport Model
   [<a href="rfc3417.html" title='"Transport Mappings for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC3417</a>].  Such a Transport Model would then enable the use of
   existing security mechanisms, such as TLS [<a href="rfc5246.html" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>] or SSH [<a href="rfc4251.html" title='"The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture"'>RFC4251</a>],
   within the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture.

   There are a number of Internet security protocols and mechanisms that
   are in widespread use.  Many of them try to provide a generic
   infrastructure to be used by many different application-layer
   protocols.  The motivation behind the Transport Subsystem is to
   leverage these protocols where it seems useful.

   There are a number of challenges to be addressed to map the security
   provided by a secure transport into the SNMP architecture so that
   SNMP continues to provide interoperability with existing
   implementations.  These challenges are described in detail in this
   document.  For some key issues, design choices are described that
   might be made to provide a workable solution that meets operational
   requirements and fits into the SNMP architecture defined in
   [<a href="rfc3411.html" title='"An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks"'>RFC3411</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Requirements%20of%20a%20Transport%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Requirements of a Transport Model</span>

   Transport security protocols SHOULD provide protection against the
   following message-oriented threats:

   1.  modification of information

   2.  masquerade

   3.  message stream modification

   4.  disclosure

   These threats are described in <a href="rfc3411.html#section-1.4">Section 1.4 of [RFC3411]</a>.  The
   security requirements outlined there do not require protection
   against denial of service or traffic analysis; however, transport
   security protocols should not make those threats significantly worse.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.%20%20Security%20Protocol%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" name="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Security Protocol Requirements</span>

   There are a number of standard protocols that could be proposed as
   possible solutions within the Transport Subsystem.  Some factors
   should be considered when selecting a protocol.

   Using a protocol in a manner for which it was not designed has
   numerous problems.  The advertised security characteristics of a
   protocol might depend on it being used as designed; when used in
   other ways, it might not deliver the expected security
   characteristics.  It is recommended that any proposed model include a
   description of the applicability of the Transport Model.




<span class="grey">Harrington &amp; Schoenwaelder  Standards Track                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

   A Transport Model SHOULD NOT require modifications to the underlying
   protocol.  Modifying the protocol might change its security
   characteristics in ways that could impact other existing usages.  If
   a change is necessary, the change SHOULD be an extension that has no
   impact on the existing usages.  Any Transport Model specification
   should include a description of potential impact on other usages of
   the protocol.

   Since multiple Transport Models can exist simultaneously within the
   Transport Subsystem, Transport Models MUST be able to coexist with
   each other.

   SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3) is based on a modular architecture (defined
   in <a href="rfc3411.html#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC3411]</a>) to allow the evolution of the SNMP
   protocol standards over time and to minimize the side effects between
   subsystems when changes are made.

   The <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture includes a Message Processing Subsystem for
   permitting different message versions to be handled by a single
   engine, a Security Subsystem for enabling different methods of
   providing security services, Applications to support different types
   of Application processors, and an Access Control Subsystem for
   allowing multiple approaches to access control.  The <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>
   architecture does not include a subsystem for Transport Models,
   despite the fact there are multiple transport mappings already
   defined for SNMP [<a href="rfc3417.html" title='"Transport Mappings for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC3417</a>].  This document describes a Transport
   Subsystem that is compatible with the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture.  As work
   is being done to use secure transports such as SSH and TLS, using a
   subsystem will enable consistent design and modularity of such
   Transport Models.

   The design of this Transport Subsystem accepts the goals of the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc3411.html">3411</a> architecture that are defined in <a href="rfc3411.html#section-1.5">Section 1.5 of [RFC3411]</a>.  This
   Transport Subsystem uses a modular design that permits Transport
   Models (which might or might not be security-aware) to be "plugged
   into" the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture.  Such Transport Models would be
   independent of other modular SNMP components as much as possible.
   This design also permits Transport Models to be advanced through the
   standards process independently of other Transport Models.

   The following diagram depicts the SNMPv3 architecture, including the
   new Transport Subsystem defined in this document and a new Transport
   Security Model defined in [<a href="rfc5591.html" title='"Transport Security Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5591</a>].

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.1.1.%20%20Changes%20to%20the%20RFC%203411%20Architecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1.1" name="section-3.2.1.1">3.2.1.1</a>.  Changes to the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> Architecture</span>

   The <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture and the Security Subsystem assume that a
   Security Model is called by a Message Processing Model and will
   perform multiple security functions within the Security Subsystem.  A
   Transport Model that supports a secure transport protocol might
   perform similar security functions within the Transport Subsystem,
   including the translation of transport-security parameters to/from
   Security-Model-independent parameters.

   To accommodate this, an implementation-specific cache of transport-
   specific information will be described (not shown), and the data
   flows on this path will be extended to pass Security-Model-
   independent values.  This document amends some of the ASIs defined in
   <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>; these changes are covered in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> of this document.

   New Security Models might be defined that understand how to work with
   these modified ASIs and the transport-information cache.  One such
   Security Model, the Transport Security Model, is defined in
   [<a href="rfc5591.html" title='"Transport Security Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC5591</a>].

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.1.2.%20%20Changes%20to%20RFC%203411%20Processing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1.2" name="section-3.2.1.2">3.2.1.2</a>.  Changes to <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> Processing</span>

   The introduction of secure transports affects the responsibilities
   and order of processing within the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture.  While the
   steps are the same, they might occur in a different order, and might
   be done by different subsystems.  With the existing <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>
   architecture, security processing starts when the Message Processing
   Model decodes portions of the encoded message to extract parameters
   that identify which Security Model MUST handle the security-related
   tasks.

   A secure transport performs those security functions on the message,
   before the message is decoded.  Some of these functions might then be
   repeated by the selected Security Model.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.1.3.%20%20Passing%20Information%20between%20SNMP%20Engines"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1.3" name="section-3.2.1.3">3.2.1.3</a>.  Passing Information between SNMP Engines</span>

   A secure Transport Model will establish an authenticated and possibly
   encrypted tunnel between the Transport Models of two SNMP engines.
   After a transport-layer tunnel is established, then SNMP messages can
   be sent through the tunnel from one SNMP engine to the other.  While
   the Community Security Models [<a href="rfc3584.html" title='"Coexistence between Version 1, Version 2, and Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC3584</a>] and the User-based Security
   Model establish a security association for each SNMP message, newer
   Transport Models MAY support sending multiple SNMP messages through
   the same tunnel to amortize the costs of establishing a security
   association.

   <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> made some design decisions related to the support of an
   Access Control Subsystem.  These include establishing and passing in
   a model-independent manner the securityModel, securityName, and
   securityLevel parameters, and separating message authentication from
   data-access authorization.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.2.1.%20%20securityName%20and%20securityLevel%20Mapping"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.2.1" name="section-3.2.2.1">3.2.2.1</a>.  securityName and securityLevel Mapping</span>

   SNMP data-access controls are expected to work on the basis of who
   can perform what operations on which subsets of data, and based on
   the security services that will be provided to secure the data in
   transit.  The securityModel and securityLevel parameters establish
   the protections for transit -- whether authentication and privacy
   services will be or have been applied to the message.  The
   securityName is a model-independent identifier of the security
   "principal".

   A Security Model plays a role in security that goes beyond protecting
   the message -- it provides a mapping between the Security-Model-
   specific principal for an incoming message to a Security-Model
   independent securityName that can be used for subsequent processing,
   such as for access control.  The securityName is mapped from a
   mechanism-specific identity, and this mapping must be done for
   incoming messages by the Security Model before it passes securityName
   to the Message Processing Model via the processIncoming ASI.

   A Security Model is also responsible to specify, via the
   securityLevel parameter, whether incoming messages have been
   authenticated and encrypted, and to ensure that outgoing messages are
   authenticated and encrypted based on the value of securityLevel.

   A Transport Model MAY provide suggested values for securityName and
   securityLevel.  A Security Model might have multiple sources for
   determining the principal and desired security services, and a
   particular Security Model might or might not utilize the values
   proposed by a Transport Model when deciding the value of securityName
   and securityLevel.

   Documents defining a new transport domain MUST define a prefix that
   MAY be prepended to all securityNames passed by the Security Model.
   The prefix MUST include one to four US-ASCII alpha-numeric
   characters, not including a ":" (US-ASCII 0x3a) character.  If a
   prefix is used, a securityName is constructed by concatenating the
   prefix and a ":" (US-ASCII 0x3a) character, followed by a non-empty
   identity in an snmpAdminString-compatible format.  The prefix can be
   used by SNMP Applications to distinguish "alice" authenticated by SSH

   corresponding prefixes are coordinated via the IANA registry "SNMP
   Transport Domains".

   A Message Processing Model might unpack SNMP-specific security
   parameters from an incoming message before calling a specific
   Security Model to handle the security-related processing of the
   message.  When using a secure Transport Model, some security
   parameters might be extracted from the transport layer by the
   Transport Model before the message is passed to the Message
   Processing Subsystem.

   This document describes a cache mechanism (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>) into which
   the Transport Model puts information about the transport and security
   parameters applied to a transport connection or an incoming message;
   a Security Model might extract that information from the cache.  A
   tmStateReference is passed as an extra parameter in the ASIs between
   the Transport Subsystem and the Message Processing and Security
   Subsystems in order to identify the relevant cache.  This approach of
   passing a model-independent reference is consistent with the
   securityStateReference cache already being passed around in the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc3411.html">3411</a> ASIs.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.4.%20%20Separation%20of%20Authentication%20and%20Authorization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.4" name="section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  Separation of Authentication and Authorization</span>

   The <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture defines a separation of authentication and
   the authorization to access and/or modify MIB data.  A set of model-
   independent parameters (securityModel, securityName, and
   securityLevel) are passed between the Security Subsystem, the
   Applications, and the Access Control Subsystem.

   This separation was a deliberate decision of the SNMPv3 WG, in order
   to allow support for authentication protocols that do not provide
   data-access authorization capabilities, and in order to support data-
   access authorization schemes, such as the View-based access Control
   Model (VACM), that do not perform their own authentication.

   A Message Processing Model determines which Security Model is used,
   either based on the message version (e.g., SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c) or
   possibly by a value specified in the message (e.g., msgSecurityModel
   field in SNMPv3).

   The Security Model makes the decision which securityName and
   securityLevel values are passed as model-independent parameters to an
   Application, which then passes them via the isAccessAllowed ASI to
   the Access Control Subsystem.

   An Access Control Model performs the mapping from the model-
   independent security parameters to a policy within the Access Control
   Model that is Access-Control-Model-dependent.

   A Transport Model does not know which Security Model will be used for
   an incoming message, and so cannot know how the securityName and
   securityLevel parameters will be determined.  It can propose an
   authenticated identity (via the tmSecurityName field), but there is
   no guarantee that this value will be used by the Security Model.  For
   example, non-transport-aware Security Models will typically determine
   the securityName (and securityLevel) based on the contents of the
   SNMP message itself.  Such Security Models will simply not know that
   the tmStateReference cache exists.

   Further, even if the Transport Model can influence the choice of
   securityName, it cannot directly determine the authorization allowed
   to this identity.  If two different Transport Models each
   authenticate a transport principal that are then both mapped to the
   same securityName, then these two identities will typically be
   afforded exactly the same authorization by the Access Control Model.

   The only way for the Access Control Model to differentiate between
   identities based on the underlying Transport Model would be for such
   transport-authenticated identities to be mapped to distinct
   securityNames.  How and if this is done is Security-Model-dependent.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Session%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Session Requirements</span>

   Some secure transports have a notion of sessions, while other secure
   transports provide channels or other session-like mechanisms.
   Throughout this document, the term "session" is used in a broad sense
   to cover transport sessions, transport channels, and other transport-
   layer, session-like mechanisms.  Transport-layer sessions that can
   secure multiple SNMP messages within the lifetime of the session are
   considered desirable because the cost of authentication can be
   amortized over potentially many transactions.  How a transport
   session is actually established, opened, closed, or maintained is
   specific to a particular Transport Model.

   To reduce redundancy, this document describes aspects that are
   expected to be common to all Transport Model sessions.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.1.%20%20No%20SNMP%20Sessions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.1" name="section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  No SNMP Sessions</span>

   The architecture defined in [<a href="rfc3411.html" title='"An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks"'>RFC3411</a>] and the Transport Subsystem
   defined in this document do not support SNMP sessions or include a
   session selector in the Abstract Service Interfaces.

   The Transport Subsystem might support transport sessions.  However,
   the Transport Subsystem does not have access to the pduType (i.e.,
   the SNMP operation type), and so cannot select a given transport
   session for particular types of traffic.

   Certain parameters of the Abstract Service Interfaces might be used
   to guide the selection of an appropriate transport session to use for
   a given request by an Application.

   The transportDomain and transportAddress identify the transport
   connection to a remote network node.  Elements of the transport
   address (such as the port number) might be used by an Application to
   send a particular PDU type to a particular transport address.  For
   example, the SNMP-TARGET-MIB and SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB [<a href="rfc3413.html" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Applications"'>RFC3413</a>] are
   used to configure notification originators with the destination port
   to which SNMPv2-Trap PDUs or Inform PDUs are to be sent, but the
   Transport Subsystem never looks inside the PDU.

   The securityName identifies which security principal to communicate
   with at that address (e.g., different Network Management System (NMS)
   applications), and the securityLevel might permit selection of
   different sets of security properties for different purposes (e.g.,
   encrypted SET vs. non-encrypted GET operations).

   However, because the handling of transport sessions is specific to
   each Transport Model, some Transport Models MAY restrict selecting a
   particular transport session.  A user application might use a unique
   combination of transportDomain, transportAddress, securityModel,
   securityName, and securityLevel to try to force the selection of a
   given transport session.  This usage is NOT RECOMMENDED because it is
   not guaranteed to be interoperable across implementations and across
   models.

   Implementations SHOULD be able to maintain some reasonable number of
   concurrent transport sessions, and MAY provide non-standard internal
   mechanisms to select transport sessions.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.2.%20%20Session%20Establishment%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.2" name="section-3.3.2">3.3.2</a>.  Session Establishment Requirements</span>

   SNMP Applications provide the transportDomain, transportAddress,
   securityName, and securityLevel to be used to create a new session.

   If the Transport Model cannot provide at least the requested level of
   security, the Transport Model should discard the message and should
   notify the Dispatcher that establishing a session and sending the
   message failed.  Similarly, if the session cannot be established,
   then the message should be discarded and the Dispatcher notified.

   Transport session establishment might require provisioning
   authentication credentials at an engine, either statically or
   dynamically.  How this is done is dependent on the Transport Model
   and the implementation.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.3.%20%20Session%20Maintenance%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.3" name="section-3.3.3">3.3.3</a>.  Session Maintenance Requirements</span>

   A Transport Model can tear down sessions as needed.  It might be
   necessary for some implementations to tear down sessions as the
   result of resource constraints, for example.

   The decision to tear down a session is implementation-dependent.  How
   an implementation determines that an operation has completed is
   implementation-dependent.  While it is possible to tear down each
   transport session after processing for each message has completed,
   this is not recommended for performance reasons.

   The elements of procedure describe when cached information can be
   discarded, and the timing of cache cleanup might have security
   implications, but cache memory management is an implementation issue.

   If a Transport Model defines MIB module objects to maintain session
   state information, then the Transport Model MUST define what happens
   to the objects when a related session is torn down, since this will
   impact the interoperability of the MIB module.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.4.%20%20Message%20Security%20versus%20Session%20Security"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.4" name="section-3.3.4">3.3.4</a>.  Message Security versus Session Security</span>

   A Transport Model session is associated with state information that
   is maintained for its lifetime.  This state information allows for
   the application of various security services to multiple messages.
   Cryptographic keys associated with the transport session SHOULD be
   used to provide authentication, integrity checking, and encryption
   services, as needed, for data that is communicated during the
   session.  The cryptographic protocols used to establish keys for a
   Transport Model session SHOULD ensure that fresh new session keys are
   generated for each session.  This would ensure that a cross-session
   replay attack would be unsuccessful; that is, an attacker could not
   take a message observed on one session and successfully replay it on
   another session.

   A good security protocol would also protect against replay attacks
   within a session; that is, an attacker could not take a message
   observed on a session and successfully replay it later in the same
   session.  One approach would be to use sequence information within
   the protocol, allowing the participants to detect if messages were
   replayed or reordered within a session.

   If a secure transport session is closed between the time a request
   message is received and the corresponding response message is sent,
   then the response message SHOULD be discarded, even if a new session
   has been established.  The SNMPv3 WG decided that this should be a
   "SHOULD" architecturally, and it is a Security-Model-specific
   decision whether to REQUIRE this.  The architecture does not mandate
   this requirement in order to allow for future Security Models where
   this might make sense; however, not requiring this could lead to
   added complexity and security vulnerabilities, so most Security
   Models SHOULD require this.

   SNMPv3 was designed to support multiple levels of security,
   selectable on a per-message basis by an SNMP Application, because,
   for example, there is not much value in using encryption for a
   command generator to poll for potentially non-sensitive performance
   data on thousands of interfaces every ten minutes; such encryption
   might add significant overhead to processing of the messages.

   Some Transport Models might support only specific authentication and
   encryption services, such as requiring all messages to be carried
   using both authentication and encryption, regardless of the security
   level requested by an SNMP Application.  A Transport Model MAY
   upgrade the security level requested by a transport-aware Security
   Model, i.e., noAuthNoPriv and authNoPriv might be sent over an
   authenticated and encrypted session.  A Transport Model MUST NOT
   downgrade the security level requested by a transport-aware Security
   Model, and SHOULD discard any message where this would occur.  This
   is a SHOULD rather than a MUST only to permit the potential
   development of models that can perform error-handling in a manner
   that is less severe than discarding the message.  However, any model
   that does not discard the message in this circumstance should have a
   clear justification for why not discarding will not create a security
   vulnerability.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Cached%20Information%20and%20References"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Cached Information and References</span>

   When performing SNMP processing, there are two levels of state
   information that might need to be retained: the immediate state
   linking a request-response pair and a potentially longer-term state
   relating to transport and security.

   The <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture uses caches to maintain the short-term
   message state, and uses references in the ASIs to pass this
   information between subsystems.

   This document defines the requirements for a cache to handle
   additional short-term message state and longer-term transport state
   information, using a tmStateReference parameter to pass this
   information between subsystems.

   To simplify the elements of procedure, the release of state
   information is not always explicitly specified.  As a general rule,
   if state information is available when a message being processed gets
   discarded, the state related to that message should also be
   discarded.  If state information is available when a relationship
   between engines is severed, such as the closing of a transport
   session, the state information for that relationship should also be
   discarded.

   Since the contents of a cache are meaningful only within an
   implementation, and not on-the-wire, the format of the cache is
   implementation-specific.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20securityStateReference"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  securityStateReference</span>

   The securityStateReference parameter is defined in <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>.  Its
   primary purpose is to provide a mapping between a request and the
   corresponding response.  This cache is not accessible to Transport
   Models, and an entry is typically only retained for the lifetime of a
   request-response pair of messages.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20tmStateReference"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  tmStateReference</span>

   For each transport session, information about the transport security
   is stored in a tmState cache or datastore that is referenced by a
   tmStateReference.  The tmStateReference parameter is used to pass
   model-specific and mechanism-specific parameters between the
   Transport Subsystem and transport-aware Security Models.

   In general, when necessary, the tmState is populated by the Security
   Model for outgoing messages and by the Transport Model for incoming
   messages.  However, in both cases, the model populating the tmState



<span class="grey">Harrington &amp; Schoenwaelder  Standards Track                    [Page 17]</span></pre>

   might have incomplete information, and the missing information might
   be populated by the other model when the information becomes
   available.

   The tmState might contain both long-term and short-term information.
   The session information typically remains valid for the duration of
   the transport session, might be used for several messages, and might
   be stored in a local configuration datastore.  Some information has a
   shorter lifespan, such as tmSameSecurity and
   tmRequestedSecurityLevel, which are associated with a specific
   message.

   Since this cache is only used within an implementation, and not on-
   the-wire, the precise contents and format of the cache are
   implementation-dependent.  For architectural modularity between
   Transport Models and transport-aware Security Models, a fully-defined
   tmState MUST conceptually include at least the following fields:

      tmTransportDomain

      tmTransportAddress

      tmSecurityName

      tmRequestedSecurityLevel

      tmTransportSecurityLevel

      tmSameSecurity

      tmSessionID

   The details of these fields are described in the following
   subsections.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.1.%20%20Transport%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.1" name="section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  Transport Information</span>

   Information about the source of an incoming SNMP message is passed up
   from the Transport Subsystem as far as the Message Processing
   Subsystem.  However, these parameters are not included in the
   processIncomingMsg ASI defined in <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>; hence, this information
   is not directly available to the Security Model.

   A transport-aware Security Model might wish to take account of the
   transport protocol and originating address when authenticating the
   request and setting up the authorization parameters.  It is therefore

   necessary for the Transport Model to include this information in the
   tmStateReference cache so that it is accessible to the Security
   Model.

   o  tmTransportDomain: the transport protocol (and hence the Transport
      Model) used to receive the incoming message.

   o  tmTransportAddress: the source of the incoming message.

   The ASIs used for processing an outgoing message all include explicit
   transportDomain and transportAddress parameters.  The values within
   the securityStateReference cache might override these parameters for
   outgoing messages.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.2.%20%20securityName"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.2" name="section-5.2.2">5.2.2</a>.  securityName</span>

   There are actually three distinct "identities" that can be identified
   during the processing of an SNMP request over a secure transport:

   o  transport principal: the transport-authenticated identity on whose
      behalf the secure transport connection was (or should be)
      established.  This value is transport-, mechanism-, and
      implementation-specific, and is only used within a given Transport
      Model.

   o  tmSecurityName: a human-readable name (in snmpAdminString format)
      representing this transport identity.  This value is transport-
      and implementation-specific, and is only used (directly) by the
      Transport and Security Models.

   o  securityName: a human-readable name (in snmpAdminString format)
      representing the SNMP principal in a model-independent manner.
      This value is used directly by SNMP Applications, the Access
      Control Subsystem, the Message Processing Subsystem, and the
      Security Subsystem.

   The transport principal might or might not be the same as the
   tmSecurityName.  Similarly, the tmSecurityName might or might not be
   the same as the securityName as seen by the Application and Access
   Control Subsystems.  In particular, a non-transport-aware Security
   Model will ignore tmSecurityName completely when determining the SNMP
   securityName.

   However, it is important that the mapping between the transport
   principal and the SNMP securityName (for transport-aware Security
   Models) is consistent and predictable in order to allow configuration
   of suitable access control and the establishment of transport
   connections.

   There are two distinct issues relating to security level as applied
   to secure transports.  For clarity, these are handled by separate
   fields in the tmStateReference cache:

   o  tmTransportSecurityLevel: an indication from the Transport Model
      of the level of security offered by this session.  The Security
      Model can use this to ensure that incoming messages were suitably
      protected before acting on them.

   o  tmRequestedSecurityLevel: an indication from the Security Model of
      the level of security required to be provided by the transport
      protocol.  The Transport Model can use this to ensure that
      outgoing messages will not be sent over an insufficiently secure
      session.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.4.%20%20Session%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.4" name="section-5.2.4">5.2.4</a>.  Session Information</span>

   For security reasons, if a secure transport session is closed between
   the time a request message is received and the corresponding response
   message is sent, then the response message SHOULD be discarded, even
   if a new session has been established.  The SNMPv3 WG decided that
   this should be a "SHOULD" architecturally, and it is a Security-
   Model-specific decision whether to REQUIRE this.

   o  tmSameSecurity: this flag is used by a transport-aware Security
      Model to indicate whether the Transport Model MUST enforce this
      restriction.

   o  tmSessionID: in order to verify whether the session has changed,
      the Transport Model must be able to compare the session used to
      receive the original request with the one to be used to send the
      response.  This typically needs some form of session identifier.
      This value is only ever used by the Transport Model, so the format
      and interpretation of this field are model-specific and
      implementation-dependent.

   When processing an outgoing message, if tmSameSecurity is true, then
   the tmSessionID MUST match the current transport session; otherwise,
   the message MUST be discarded and the Dispatcher notified that
   sending the message failed.

   Abstract service interfaces have been defined by <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> to describe
   the conceptual data flows between the various subsystems within an
   SNMP entity and to help keep the subsystems independent of each other
   except for the common parameters.

   This document introduces a couple of new ASIs to define the interface
   between the Transport and Dispatcher Subsystems; it also extends some
   of the ASIs defined in <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> to include transport-related
   information.

   This document follows the example of <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> regarding the release
   of state information and regarding error indications.

   1) The release of state information is not always explicitly
   specified in a Transport Model.  As a general rule, if state
   information is available when a message gets discarded, the message-
   state information should also be released, and if state information
   is available when a session is closed, the session-state information
   should also be released.  Keeping sensitive security information
   longer than necessary might introduce potential vulnerabilities to an
   implementation.

   2)An error indication in statusInformation will typically include the
   Object Identifier (OID) and value for an incremented error counter.
   This might be accompanied by values for contextEngineID and
   contextName for this counter, a value for securityLevel, and the
   appropriate state reference if the information is available at the
   point where the error is detected.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20%20sendMessage%20ASI"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  sendMessage ASI</span>

   The sendMessage ASI is used to pass a message from the Dispatcher to
   the appropriate Transport Model for sending.  The sendMessageASI
   defined in this document replaces the text "Send SNMP Request Message
   to Network" that appears in the diagram in <a href="rfc3411.html#section-4.6.1">Section 4.6.1 of RFC 3411</a>
   and the text "Send SNMP Message to Network" that appears in <a href="rfc3411.html#section-4.6.2">Section</a>
   <a href="rfc3411.html#section-4.6.2">4.6.2 of RFC 3411</a>.

   If present and valid, the tmStateReference refers to a cache
   containing Transport-Model-specific parameters for the transport and
   transport security.  How a tmStateReference is determined to be
   present and valid is implementation-dependent.  How the information
   in the cache is used is Transport-Model-dependent and implementation-
   dependent.

   This might sound underspecified, but a Transport Model might be
   something like SNMP over UDP over IPv6, where no security is
   provided, so it might have no mechanisms for utilizing a
   tmStateReference cache.

   A tmStateReference parameter has been added as an OUT parameter to

   transportDomain and transportAddress parameters have been added as IN

   If a cache exists for a session identifiable from the

   cache are discussed in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  How this information is determined
   is implementation- and Transport-Model-specific.

   "Might create one" might sound underspecified, but a Transport Model
   might be something like SNMP over UDP over IPv6, where transport
   security is not provided, so it might not create a cache.

   The Transport Model does not know the securityModel for an incoming
   message; this will be determined by the Message Processing Model in a
   Message-Processing-Model-dependent manner.

   statusInformation =
   receiveMessage(
   IN   transportDomain               -- origin transport domain
   IN   transportAddress              -- origin transport address
   IN   incomingMessage               -- the message received
   IN   incomingMessageLength         -- its length
   IN   tmStateReference              -- reference to transport state
    )

   The tmStateReference parameter has also been added to some of the
   incoming ASIs defined in <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>.  How or if a Message Processing
   Model or Security Model uses tmStateReference is message-processing-
   and Security-Model-specific.

   This might sound underspecified, but a Message Processing Model might
   have access to all the information from the cache and from the
   message.  The Message Processing Model might determine that the USM
   Security Model is specified in an SNMPv3 message header; the USM
   Security Model has no need of values in the tmStateReference cache to
   authenticate and secure the SNMP message, but an Application might
   have specified to use a secure transport such as that provided by the
   SSH Transport Model to send the message to its destination.

   The tmStateReference parameter of prepareDataElements is passed from
   the Dispatcher to the Message Processing Subsystem.  How or if the
   Message Processing Subsystem modifies or utilizes the contents of the
   cache is Message-Processing-Model-specific.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document defines an architectural approach that permits SNMP to
   utilize transport-layer security services.  Each proposed Transport
   Model should discuss the security considerations of that Transport
   Model.

   It is considered desirable by some industry segments that SNMP
   Transport Models utilize transport-layer security that addresses
   perfect forward secrecy at least for encryption keys.  Perfect
   forward secrecy guarantees that compromise of long-term secret keys
   does not result in disclosure of past session keys.  Each proposed
   Transport Model should include a discussion in its security
   considerations of whether perfect forward secrecy is appropriate for
   that Transport Model.

   The denial-of-service characteristics of various Transport Models and
   security protocols will vary and should be evaluated when determining
   the applicability of a Transport Model to a particular deployment
   situation.

   Since the cache will contain security-related parameters,
   implementers SHOULD store this information (in memory or in
   persistent storage) in a manner to protect it from unauthorized
   disclosure and/or modification.

   Care must be taken to ensure that an SNMP engine is sending packets
   out over a transport using credentials that are legal for that engine
   to use on behalf of that user.  Otherwise, an engine that has
   multiple transports open might be "tricked" into sending a message
   through the wrong transport.

   A Security Model might have multiple sources from which to define the
   securityName and securityLevel.  The use of a secure Transport Model
   does not imply that the securityName and securityLevel chosen by the
   Security Model represent the transport-authenticated identity or the
   transport-provided security services.  The securityModel,
   securityName, and securityLevel parameters are a related set, and an
   administrator should understand how the specified securityModel
   selects the corresponding securityName and securityLevel.

   In the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> architecture, the Message Processing Model makes the
   decision about which Security Model to use.  The architectural change
   described by this document does not alter that.





<span class="grey">Harrington &amp; Schoenwaelder  Standards Track                    [Page 27]</span></pre>

   The architecture change described by this document does, however,
   allow SNMP to support two different approaches to security --
   message-driven security and transport-driven security.  With message-
   driven security, SNMP provides its own security and passes security
   parameters within the SNMP message; with transport-driven security,
   SNMP depends on an external entity to provide security during
   transport by "wrapping" the SNMP message.

   Using a non-transport-aware Security Model with a secure Transport
   Model is NOT RECOMMENDED for the following reasons.

   Security Models defined before the Transport Security Model (i.e.,
   SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and USM) do not support transport-based security and
   only have access to the security parameters contained within the SNMP
   message.  They do not know about the security parameters associated
   with a secure transport.  As a result, the Access Control Subsystem
   bases its decisions on the security parameters extracted from the
   SNMP message, not on transport-based security parameters.

   Implications of combining older Security Models with Secure Transport
   Models are known.  The securityName used for access control decisions
   is based on the message-driven identity, which might be
   unauthenticated, and not on the transport-driven, authenticated
   identity:

   o  An SNMPv1 message will always be paired with an SNMPv1 Security
      Model (per <a href="rfc3584.html">RFC 3584</a>), regardless of the transport mapping or
      Transport Model used, and access controls will be based on the
      unauthenticated community name.

   o  An SNMPv2c message will always be paired with an SNMPv2c Security
      Model (per <a href="rfc3584.html">RFC 3584</a>), regardless of the transport mapping or
      Transport Model used, and access controls will be based on the
      unauthenticated community name.

   o  An SNMPv3 message will always be paired with the securityModel
      specified in the msgSecurityParameters field of the message (per
      <a href="rfc3412.html">RFC 3412</a>), regardless of the transport mapping or Transport Model
      used.  If the SNMPv3 message specifies the User-based Security
      Model (USM) with noAuthNoPriv, then the access controls will be
      based on the unauthenticated USM user.

   o  For outgoing messages, if a Secure Transport Model is selected in
      combination with a Security Model that does not populate a
      tmStateReference, the Secure Transport Model SHOULD detect the
      lack of a valid tmStateReference and fail.

   In times of network stress, a Secure Transport Model might not work
   properly if its underlying security mechanisms (e.g., Network Time
   Protocol (NTP) or Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
   protocols or certificate authorities) are not reachable.  The User-
   based Security Model was explicitly designed to not depend upon
   external network services, and provides its own security services.
   It is RECOMMENDED that operators provision authPriv USM as a fallback
   mechanism to supplement any Security Model or Transport Model that
   has external dependencies, so that secure SNMP communications can
   continue when the external network service is not available.

   IANA has created a new registry in the Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP) Number Spaces.  The new registry is called "SNMP
   Transport Domains".  This registry contains US-ASCII alpha-numeric
   strings of one to four characters to identify prefixes for
   corresponding SNMP transport domains.  Each transport domain MUST
   have an OID assignment under snmpDomains [<a href="rfc2578.html" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>].  Values are to be
   assigned via [<a href="rfc5226.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>RFC5226</a>] "Specification Required".

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5590.html">RFC 5590</a>                SNMP Transport Subsystem               June 2009</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Why%20tmStateReference%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" name="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Why tmStateReference?</span>

   This appendix considers why a cache-based approach was selected for
   passing parameters.

   There are four approaches that could be used for passing information
   between the Transport Model and a Security Model.

   1.  One could define an ASI to supplement the existing ASIs.

   2.  One could add a header to encapsulate the SNMP message.

   3.  One could utilize fields already defined in the existing SNMPv3
       message.

   4.  One could pass the information in an implementation-specific
       cache or via a MIB module.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.%20%20Define%20an%20Abstract%20Service%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" name="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Define an Abstract Service Interface</span>

   Abstract Service Interfaces (ASIs) are defined by a set of primitives
   that specify the services provided and the abstract data elements
   that are to be passed when the services are invoked.  Defining
   additional ASIs to pass the security and transport information from
   the Transport Subsystem to the Security Subsystem has the advantage
   of being consistent with existing <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a>/3412 practice; it also
   helps to ensure that any Transport Model proposals pass the necessary
   data and do not cause side effects by creating model-specific
   dependencies between itself and models or subsystems other than those
   that are clearly defined by an ASI.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.2.%20%20Using%20an%20Encapsulating%20Header"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2" name="appendix-A.2">A.2</a>.  Using an Encapsulating Header</span>

   A header could encapsulate the SNMP message to pass necessary
   information from the Transport Model to the Dispatcher and then to a
   Message Processing Model.  The message header would be included in
   the wholeMessage ASI parameter and would be removed by a
   corresponding Message Processing Model.  This would imply the (one
   and only) Message Dispatcher would need to be modified to determine
   which SNMP message version was involved, and a new Message Processing
   Model would need to be developed that knew how to extract the header
   from the message and pass it to the Security Model.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.3.%20%20Modifying%20Existing%20Fields%20in%20an%20SNMP%20Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3" name="appendix-A.3">A.3</a>.  Modifying Existing Fields in an SNMP Message</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC3412" name="ref-RFC3412">RFC3412</a>] defines the SNMPv3 message, which contains fields to pass
   security-related parameters.  The Transport Subsystem could use these
   fields in an SNMPv3 message (or comparable fields in other message

   formats) to pass information between Transport Models in different
   SNMP engines and to pass information between a Transport Model and a
   corresponding Message Processing Model.

   If the fields in an incoming SNMPv3 message are changed by the
   Transport Model before passing it to the Security Model, then the
   Transport Model will need to decode the ASN.1 message, modify the
   fields, and re-encode the message in ASN.1 before passing the message
   on to the Message Dispatcher or to the transport layer.  This would
   require an intimate knowledge of the message format and message
   versions in order for the Transport Model to know which fields could
   be modified.  This would seriously violate the modularity of the
   architecture.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.4.%20%20Using%20a%20Cache"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.4" name="appendix-A.4">A.4</a>.  Using a Cache</span>

   This document describes a cache into which the Transport Model (TM)
   puts information about the security applied to an incoming message; a
   Security Model can extract that information from the cache.  Given
   that there might be multiple TM security caches, a tmStateReference
   is passed as an extra parameter in the ASIs between the Transport
   Subsystem and the Security Subsystem so that the Security Model knows
   which cache of information to consult.

   This approach does create dependencies between a specific Transport
   Model and a corresponding specific Security Model.  However, the
   approach of passing a model-independent reference to a model-
   dependent cache is consistent with the securityStateReference already
   being passed around in the <a href="rfc3411.html">RFC 3411</a> ASIs.
