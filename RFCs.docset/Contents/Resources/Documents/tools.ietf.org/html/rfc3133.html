Abstract

   This memo discusses and defines terms associated with performance
   benchmarking tests and the results of these tests in the context of
   frame relay switching devices.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/I.%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-I" name="appendix-I">I</a>. Background</span>

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document provides terminology for Frame Relay switching devices.
   It extends terminology already defined for benchmarking network
   interconnect devices in RFCs 1242, 1944 and 2285.  Although some of
   the definitions in this memo may be applicable to a broader group of
   network interconnect devices, the primary focus of the terminology in
   this memo is on Frame Relay Signaling.

   This memo contains two major sections: Background and Definitions.
   The background section provides the reader with an overview of the
   technology and IETF formalisms.  The definitions section is split
   into two sub-sections.  The formal definitions sub-section is
   provided as a courtesy to the reader.  The measurement definitions
   sub-section contains performance metrics with inherent units.

   The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking
   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents.  The
   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms.
   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect
   the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.

   For the purposes of computing several of the metrics, certain textual
   conventions are required.  Specifically:

   1) The notation sum {i=1 to N} A_i denotes: the summation of N
   instances of the observable A.  For example, the set of observations
   {1,2,3,4,5} would yield the result 15.

   2) The notation max {I=1 to N} A_i and min {I=1 to N} A_i denotes:
   the maximum or minimum of the observable A over N instances.  For
   example, given the set of observations {1,2,3,4,5}, max {i=1 to 5} =
   5 and min {I=1 to 5} = 1.

   The terms defined in this memo will be used in addition to terms
   defined in RFCs 1242, 1944 and 2285.  This memo is a product of the
   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) of the Internet
   Engineering Task Force(IETF).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Existing%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Existing Definitions</span>

   <a href="rfc1242.html">RFC 1242</a>, "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect
   Devices", should be consulted before attempting to make use of this
   document.  <a href="rfc1944.html">RFC 1944</a>, "Benchmarking Methodology for Network
   Interconnect Devices", contains discussions of a number of terms
   relevant to the benchmarking of switching devices and should also be
   consulted.  <a href="rfc2285.html">RFC 2285</a>, "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching
   Devices", contains a number of terms pertaining to traffic
   distributions and datagram interarrival.  For the sake of clarity and
   continuity this RFC adopts the template for definitions set out in
   <a href="rfc1242.html#section-2">Section 2 of RFC 1242</a>.

II. Definitions

   The definitions presented in this section have been divided into two
   groups.  The first group is formal definitions, which are required in
   the definitions of the performance metrics but are not themselves
   strictly metrics.  These definitions are subsumed from other work
   done in other working groups both inside and outside the IETF.  They
   are provided as a courtesy to the reader.

   Term to be defined.

   Definition: The specific definition for the term.

   Discussion: A brief discussion of the term, its application and any
   restrictions on measurement procedures.

   Specification:  The working group and document in which the term is
   specified.  Listed in the references.

   Definition: Access channel refers to the user access channel across
   which frame relay data travels.  Within a given DS-3, T1 or E1
   physical line, a channel can be one of the following, depending of
   how the line is configured.  Possible line configurations are:

   A. Unchannelized: The entire DS-3/T1/E1 line is considered a channel,
   where:

   The DS-3 line operates at speeds of 45 Mbps and is a single channel.
   The T1 line operates at speeds of 1.536 Mbps and is a single channel
   consisting of 24 T1 time slots.  The E1 line operates at speeds of
   1.984 Mbps and is a single channel consisting of 30 DS0 time slots.

   B. Channelized: The channel is any one of N time slots within a given
   line, where:

   The T1 line consists of any one or more channels.  Each channel is
   any one of 24 time slots.  The T1 line operates at speeds in
   multiples of 56/64 Kbps to 1.536 Mbps, with aggregate speed not
   exceeding 1.536 Mbps.  The E1 line consists of one or more channels.
   Each channel is any one of 31 time slots.  The E1 line operates at
   speeds in multiples of 64 Kbps to 1.984 Mbps, with aggregate speed
   not exceeding 1.984 Mbps.

   C. Fractional: The T1/E1 channel is one of the following groupings of
   consecutively or non-consecutively assigned time slots:

   N DS0 time slots (NX56/64Kbps where N = 1 to 24 DS0 time slots per
   FT1 channel).

   N E1 time slots (NX64Kbps, where N = 1 to 30 DS0 time slots per E1
   channel).

   Discussion: Access channels specify the physical layer interface
   speed of a DTE or DCE.  In the case of a DTE, this may not correspond
   to either the CIR or EIR.  Specifically, based on the service level
   agreement in place, the user may not be able to access the entire
   bandwidth of the access channel.

   Definition: The data rate of the user access channel.  The speed of
   the access channel determines how rapidly (maximum rate) the end user
   can inject data into a frame relay network.

   Discussion: See Access Channel.

   Specification: FRF

   Definition: BECN is a bit in the frame relay header.  The bit is set
   by a congested network node in any frame that is traveling in the
   reverse direction of the congestion.

   Discussion: When a DTE receives frames with the BECN bit asserted, it
   should begin congestion avoidance procedures.  Since the BECN frames
   are traveling in the opposite direction as the congested traffic, the
   DTE will be the sender.  The frame relay layer may communicate the
   possibility of congestion to higher layers, which have inherent
   congestion avoidance procedures, such as TCP.  See Frame Relay Frame.

   Definition: The maximum amount of uncommitted data (in bits) in
   excess of Committed Burst Size (Bc) that a frame relay network can
   attempt to deliver during a Committed Rate Measurement Interval (Tc).
   This data (Be) generally is delivered with a lower probability than
   Bc.  The network treats Be data as discard eligible.

   Discussion: See also Committed burst Size (Bc), Committed Rate
   Measurement Interval (Tc) and Discard Eligible (De).

   Discussion: CIR specifies the guaranteed data rate between two frame
   relay terminal connected by a frame relay network.  Data presented to
   the network in excess of this data rate and below the Excess

   Definition: The time interval during which the user can send only
   Bc-committed amount of data and Be excess amount of data.  In
   general, the duration of Tc is proportional to the "burstiness" of
   the traffic.  Tc is computed (from the subscription parameters of CIR
   and Bc) as Tc = Bc/CIR.  Tc is not a periodic time interval.
   Instead, it is used only to measure incoming data, during which it
   acts like a sliding window.  Incoming data triggers the Tc interval,
   which continues until it completes its computed duration.

   Definition: This is a bit in the frame relay header that provides a

   event of congestion toward lower priority frames.  Similar to the CLP
   bit in ATM.

   Discussion: See Frame Relay Frame.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.13.%20Discardable%20frames"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2.13" name="section-1.2.13">1.2.13</a>. Discardable frames</span>

   Definition: Frames identified as being eligible to be dropped in the
   event of congestion.

   Discussion: The discard eligible field in the frame relay header is
   the correct -- and by far the most common -- means of indicating
   which frames may be dropped in the event of congestion.  However, DE
   is not the only means of identifying which frames may be dropped.
   There are at least three other cases that apply.

   In the first case, network devices may prioritize frame relay traffic
   by non-DE means.  For example, many service providers prioritize
   traffic on a per-PVC basis.  In this instance, any traffic from a
   given DLCI (data link channel identifier) may be dropped during
   congestion, regardless of whether DE is set.

   In the second case, some implementations use upper-layer criteria,
   such as IP addresses or TCP or UDP port numbers, to prioritize
   traffic within a single PVC.  In this instance, the network device
   may evaluate discard eligibility based on upper-layer criteria rather
   than the presence or absence of a DE bit.

   In the third case, the frame is discarded because of an error in the
   frame.  Specifically, frames that are too long or too short, frames
   that are not a multiple of 8 bits in length, frames with an invalid
   or unrecognized DLCI, frames with an abort sequence, frames with
   improper flag delimitation, and frames that fail FCS.

   Definition: Those frames dropped by a network device.

   Discussion: Discardable and discarded frames are not synonymous.
   Some implementations may ignore DE bits or other criteria, even
   though they supposedly use such criteria to determine which frames to
   drop in the event of congestion.

   In other cases, a frame with its DE bit set may not be dropped.  One
   example of this is in cases where congestion clears before the frame
   can be evaluated.

   Definition:  FECN is a bit in the frame relay header.  The bit is set
   by a congested network node in any frame that is traveling in the
   same direction of the congestion.

   Discussion: When a DTE receives frames with the FECN bit asserted, it
   should begin congestion avoidance procedures.  Since the FECN frames
   are traveling in the same direction as the congested traffic, the DTE
   will be the receiver.  The frame relay layer may communicate the
   possibility of congestion to higher layers, which have inherent
   congestion avoidance procedures, such as TCP.  See Frame Relay Frame.

   Definition: A logical grouping of information sent as a link-layer

   flags.  By default, the header is two octets, of which 10 bits are
   the Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI), 1 bit in each octet is
   used for address extension (AE), and 1 bit each for Forward Explicit
   Congestion Notification (FECN), Backward Explicit Congestion
   Notification (BECN) Command/Response (C/R) and Discard Eligible (DE).
   The EA bit is set to one in the final octet containing the DLCI.  A
   header may span 2, 3 or 4 octets.

   Definition: FRF.5 defines a protocol mapping called Network
   Interworking between

   Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  Protocol mapping

   Definition: FRF.8 defines a protocol encapsulation called Service
   Interworking.  Protocol encapsulation occurs when the conversions in
   the network or in the terminals are such that the protocols used to
   provide one service make use of the layer service provided by another
   protocol.  This means that at the interworking point, the two
   protocols are stacked.  When encapsulation is performed by the
   terminal, this scenario is also called interworking by port access.
   Specifically, the ATM service user performs no Frame Relaying
   specific functions, and Frame Relaying service user performs no ATM
   service specific functions.

   DDR is a ratio of  successful  payload octets received to attempted
   payload octets transmitted.  Attempted payload octets transmitted are
   referred to as DataOffered.  Successfully delivered payload octets
   are referred to as DataDelivered.  These loads are further
   differentiated as being within the committed information rate or as
   burst excess.

   Three data relay ratios may be reported:

   Data Delivery Ratio (DDR):

   Each direction of a full duplex connection has a discrete set of data
   delivery ratios.

   Discussion: Data delivery ratio measurements may not be
   representative of data delivery effectiveness for a given
   application.  For example, the discarding of a small frame containing
   an acknowledgement message may result in the retransmission of a
   large number of data frames.  In such an event, a good data delivery
   ratio would be reported while the user experienced poor performance.

   Definition: The number of received frames that are discarded because
   of a frame error divided by the total number of transmitted frames in
   one direction of a single virtual connection.  Frame errors are
   defined as follows:

   1) frames that are too long or too short,
   2) frames that are not a multiple of 8 bits in length,
   3) frames with an invalid or unrecognized DLCI,
   4) frames with an abort sequence,
   5) frames with improper flag delimitation,
   6) frames that fail FCS.

   The formal definition of frame discard ratio is as follows:

           sum {i=1 to N} fr_i
     FDR = -------------------
           sum {i=1 to N} ft_i,

   DLCI at second i

   and

   ft_i is the total number of attempted frame transmissions within the
   committed plus extended information rate for a particular DLCI at
   second i.

   Discussion: Frame discards can adversely effect applications running
   on IP over FR.  In general, frame discards will negatively impact TCP
   throughput; however, in the case of frame discard due to frame error,
   frame discard will improve performance by dropping errored frames.
   As a result, these frames will not adversely effect the forwarding of
   retransmitted frames

   in the Frame Check Sequence (FCS).  Frame errors in the absence of
   FCS errors can be detected by sending frames containing a known
   pattern; however, this indicates an equipment defect.

   Discussion: The delivery of frames containing errors will adversely
   effect applications running on IP over FR.  Typically, these errors
   are caused by transmission errors and flagged as failed FCS frames;
   however, when Frame Relay to ATM Network interworking is used, an
   error may be injected in the frame payload which, in turn, is
   encapsulated into an AAL5 PDU (see <a href="rfc2761.html">RFC 2761</a> for a discussion of AAL5
   related metrics).

   Definition: The number of frames received by the network and treated
   as excess traffic divided by the total number of transmitted frames
   in one direction of a single virtual connection.  Frames which are
   sent to the network with DE set to zero are treated as excess when
   more than Bc bits are submitted to the network during the Committed
   Information Rate Measurement Interval (Tc).  Excess traffic may or
   may not be discarded at the ingress if more than Bc + Be bits are
   submitted to the network during Tc.  Traffic discarded at the ingress
   is not recorded in this measurement.  Frames which are sent to the
   network with DE set to one are also treated as excess traffic.

   The formal definition of frame excess ratio is as follows:

               sum {i=1 to N} fc_i
     FXR = 1 - -------------------
               sum {i=1 to N} ft_i,

   fc_i is the total number of frames which were submitted within the
   traffic contract for a particular DLCI at second i

   and

   ft_i is the total number of attempted frame transmissions for a
   particular DLCI at second i.

   Discussion: Frame discards can adversely effect applications running
   on IP over FR.  Specifically, frame discards will negatively impact
   TCP throughput.

   Definition: The time required to transport frame relay data from
   measurement point 1 to measurement point 2.  The frame transfer delay
   is the difference in seconds between the time a frame exits
   measurement point 1 and the time the same frame enters measurement
   point 2, in one direction of a single virtual connection.  The formal
   definition of frame transfer delay is as follows:

      FTD = 1/N * sum {i=1 to N} t2_i - t1_i,

   where

   t1_i is the time in seconds when the ith frame leaves measurement
   point 1 (i.e., frame exit event),

   t2 is the time in seconds when the ith frame arrives at measurement
   point 2 (i.e., frame entry event)

   and

   N is the number of frames received during a measurement interval T.

   FTD is computed for a specific DLCI and a specified integration
   period of T seconds.  The computation does not include frames which
   are transmitted during the measurement period but not received.

   average and, thus, can effect neither IP nor TCP performance,
   applications such as voice over IP may be adversely effected by
   excessive FTD.

   Definition: The variation in the time required to transport frame
   relay data from measurement point 1 to measurement point 2.  The
   frame transfer delay variation is the difference in seconds between
   maximum frame transfer delay and the minimum frame transfer delay, in
   one direction of a single virtual connection.  The formal definition
   of frame transfer delay is as follows:

      FTDV = max {i=1 to N} FTD_i - min {i=1 to N} FTD_i.

   where

   FTD and N are defined as above.

   Discussion: Large values of FTDV can adversely effect TCP round trip
   time calculation and, thus, TCP throughput.
