Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism that allows a system to originate
   more than 256 Link State PDU (LSP) fragments, a limit set by the
   original Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Routing
   protocol, as described in ISO/IEC 10589.  This mechanism can be used
   in IP-only, OSI-only, and dual routers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   In the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol, a
   system floods its link-state information in Link State PDU (LSP) Data
   Units, or LSPs for short.  These logical LSPs can become quite large,
   therefore the protocol specifies a means of fragmenting this
   information into multiple LSP fragments.  The number of fragments a
   system can generate is limited by ISO/IEC 10589 [<a href="#ref-ISIS-ISO" title='"Intermediate System to Intermediate System Intra- Domain Routeing Exchange Protocol for use in Conjunction with the Protocol for Providing the Connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473)"'>ISIS-ISO</a>] to 256
   fragments, where each fragment's size is also limited.  Hence, there
   is a limit on the amount of link-state information a system can
   generate.

   A number of factors can contribute to exceeding this limit:

   -  Introduction of new TLVs and sub-TLVs to be included in LSPs.
   -  The use of LSPs to propagate various types of information (such as
      traffic-engineering information).
   -  The increasing number of destinations and AS topologies.
   -  Finer granularity routing, and the ability to inject external
      routes into areas [<a href="#ref-DOMAIN-WIDE" title='"Domain-wide Prefix Distribution with Two-Level IS-IS"'>DOMAIN-WIDE</a>].
   -  Other emerging technologies, such as optical, IPv6, etc.

   This document describes mechanisms to relax the limit on the number
   of LSP fragments.

   This section provides definitions for terms that are used throughout
   the text.

      Originating System
         A router physically running the IS-IS protocol.  As this
         document describes methods allowing a single IS-IS process to
         advertise its LSPs as multiple "virtual" routers, the
         Originating System represents the single "physical" IS-IS
         process.

      Normal system-id
         The system-id of an Originating System.

      Additional system-id
         An Additional system-id that is assigned by the network
         administrator.  Each Additional system-id allows generation of
         256 additional, or extended, LSP fragments.  The Additional
         system-id, like the Normal system-id, must be unique throughout
         the routing domain.

      Virtual System
         The system, identified by an Additional system-id, advertised
         as originating the extended LSP fragments.  These fragments
         specify the Additional system-id in their LSP IDs.

      Original LSP
         An LSP using the Normal system-id in its LSP ID.

      Extended LSP
         An LSP using an Additional system-id in its LSP ID.

      LSP set
         Logical LSP.  This term is used only to resolve the ambiguity
         between a logical LSP and an LSP fragment, both of which are
         sometimes termed "LSP".

      Extended LSP set
         A group of LSP fragments using an Additional system-id, and
         originated by the Originating System.

      Extension-capable IS
         An IS implementing the mechanisms described in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Operation%20Modes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Operation Modes</span>

   Two administrative operation modes are provided:

   -  Operation Mode 1 provides behavior that allows implementations
      that don't support this extension, to correctly process the
      extended fragment information, without any modifications.  This
      mode has some restrictions on what may be advertised in the
      extended LSP fragments.  Namely, only leaf information may be
      advertised in the extended LSPs.








<span class="grey">Hermelin, et al.             Informational                      [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-4" id="page-4" name="page-4"> </a>

   -  Operation Mode 2 extends the previous mode and relaxes its
      advertisement restrictions.  Any link-state information may be
      advertised in the extended LSPs.  However, it mandates a change to
      the way LSPs are considered during the SPF algorithm, in a way
      that is not compatible with previous implementations.

   These modes are configured on a per-level and area basis.  That is,
   all LSPs considered in the same SPF instance MUST use the same Mode.
   There is no restriction that an L1/L2 IS operates in the same mode,
   for both its L1 and L2 instances.  It can use Mode 1 for its L1 LSPs,
   and Mode 2 for its L2 LSPs, or vice versa.

   Mode 1 has the only advantage of being backwards compatible with
   older implementations.  It does have restrictions which are
   considered drawbacks.  Therefore, routers should operate in Mode 1
   only if backwards compatibility is desired.  Otherwise, it is
   recommended to run in Mode 2.

   Routers MAY implement Operational Mode 2 without supporting running
   in Operational Mode 1.  They will still interoperate correctly with
   routers that support both modes.

   Using Additional system-ids assigned by the administrator, the
   Originating System can advertise the excess link-state information in
   extended LSPs under these Additional system-ids.  It would do so as
   if other routers, or "Virtual Systems", were advertising this
   information.  These extended LSPs will also have the specified limit
   on their LSP fragments; however, the Originating System may generate
   extended LSPs under numerous Virtual Systems.

   For Operation Mode 1, 0-cost adjacencies are advertised from the
   Originating System to its Virtual System(s).  No adjacencies (other
   than back to the Originating System) are advertised in the extended
   LSPs.  As a consequence, the Virtual Systems are 'stub', meaning they
   can only be reached through their Originating System.  Therefore,
   older implementations do not need modifications in order to correctly
   process these extended LSPs.

   For both modes, each LSP (set) created by a node will contain in its
   fragment-0 a new TLV (IS Alias ID TLV) that contains the Normal
   system-id and PN Number of the Original LSP created by the router.
   Extension-capable ISs can then use this information and store the
   original and extended LSPs as one logical LSP.

   The only sections that deal only with Mode 1 additions are 3.2,
   3.2.1, and 3.2.2.  All other sections relate to both modes.

   Under both modes, the Originating System MUST include information

   it is trivially an extension-capable IS.  This is to ensure other

   ID TLV, which is advertised in all fragment 0 of Original and
   Extended LSPs.

             (both modes).  S' and S'' are configured as Additional
             system-ids.

   When new extended LSP fragments are generated, these fragments should
   be generated as specified in ISO/IEC 10589 [<a href="#ref-ISIS-ISO" title='"Intermediate System to Intermediate System Intra- Domain Routeing Exchange Protocol for use in Conjunction with the Protocol for Providing the Connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473)"'>ISIS-ISO</a>].  Furthermore,
   a system SHOULD treat its extended LSPs the same as it treats its
   original LSPs, with the exceptions noted in the following sections.
   Specifically, creating, flooding, renewing, purging and all other
   operations are similar for both Original and Extended LSPs, unless
   stated otherwise.  The Extended LSPs will use one of the Additional
   system-ids configured for the router, in their LSP ID.

   Extended LSPs fragment zero should be regarded in the same special
   manner as specified in ISO/IEC 10589 for LSPs with number zero, and
   should include the same type of extra information as specified in
   ISO/IEC 10589 and <a href="rfc1195.html">RFC 1195</a> [<a href="#ref-ISIS-IP" title='"Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP and dual environments"'>ISIS-IP</a>].  So, for example, when a system
   reissues its LSP fragment zero due to an area address change, it
   should reissue all extended LSPs fragment zero as well.

   An extended LSP fragment zero MUST be generated for every extended
   LSP set, to allow a router's SPF calculation to consider those
   fragments in that set.  See <a href="#section-5">section 5</a> for details.

   The Attached (ATT) bits SHOULD be set to zero for all four metric
   types, on all Extended LSPs.  This is due to the following: if a
   Virtual System is reachable, so is its Originating System.  It is
   preferable, then, that an L1 IS chooses the Originating System and
   not the Virtual System as its nearest L2 exit point, as connectivity
   to the Virtual System has a higher probability of being lost (as a
   result of the extended LSP no longer being advertised).  This could
   cause unnecessary computations on some implementations.

   [<a href="#ref-ISIS-IP" title='"Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP and dual environments"'>ISIS-IP</a>] relieves IP-only routers of this requirement.  However, for
   routers that do insert this ESN TLV in L1 LSPs (whether IP-only or
   OSI-capable), then in an extended LSP, the ESN TLV should include the
   relevant Additional system-id.  Furthermore, OSI-capable routers

   The following additions apply only to routers generating LSPs in Mode
   1.  Routers, which are configured to operate in Operation Mode 2,
   SHOULD NOT apply these additions to their advertisements.

   Under Operation Mode 1, adjacencies from the Originating System to
   its Virtual Systems are advertised using the standard neighbor TLVs.
   The metric for these connections MUST be zero, since the cost of
   reaching a Virtual System is the same as the cost of reaching its
   Originating System.

   To older implementations, Virtual Systems would appear reachable only
   through their Originating System, hence loss of connectivity to the
   Originating System means loss of connectivity to all of its
   information, including that advertised in its extended LSPs.
   Furthermore, the cost of reaching information advertised in non-
   extended LSPs is the same as the cost of reaching information
   advertised in the new extended LSPs, with an additional hop.

   Under Operation Mode 1, only "leaf" information, i.e., information
   that serves only as leaves in a shortest path tree, can be advertised
   in extended LSPs.

   When an Extended LSP belonging to Additional system-id S' is first
   created, the Original LSP MUST specify S' as a neighbor, with metric
   set to zero.  This is in order to consider the cost of reaching the
   Virtual System S' the same as the cost of reaching its Originating
   System.  Furthermore, the Extended LSP MUST specify the Normal
   system-id as a neighbor.  The metric SHOULD be set to MaxLinkMetric -
   1 (this is only for uniformity purpose, any metric greater than zero
   is acceptable).  This in order to satisfy the two-way connectivity
   check on other routers.  Where relevant, this adjacency SHOULD be
   considered as point-to-point.

   Note, that the restriction specified in ISO/IEC 10589 <a href="#section-7.2.5">section 7.2.5</a>
   holds:  if an LSP Number zero of the Originating System is not
   present, none of that system's neighbor entries would be processed
   during SPF, hence none of its extended LSPs would be processed as
   well.

   An Extended LSP must specify only the Originating System as a

   Other neighbors MUST NOT be specified in an Extended LSP, because

   those other neighbors would only specify the Originating System and
   not the Virtual System, and hence would not satisfy the bi-

   If the Originating System is in the overload state, information in
   the extended LSPs will not be processed by other routers in their SPF
   computation.  This is because in Mode 1, extended LSPs are reachable
   only through adjacencies from the Original LSP.  If this LSP has set
   its OL bit, adjacencies will not be processed in the SPF computation.

   This side effect should be taken into consideration when operating in
   Mode 1.

   implementation keeps the number of LSP fragments within a certain
   limit based on the optimal (minimal) number of fragments needed.
   <a href="#section-7.3.4.6">Section 7.3.4.6</a> also recommends that an IS purge its empty LSPs to
   conserve resources.  These recommendations hold for the extended LSP
   fragments as well.  However, an extended LSP fragment zero should not
   be purged until all of the fragments in its set (i.e., belonging to a
   particular Additional system-id), are empty as well.  This is to
   ensure implementations consider the fragments in their SPF
   computations, as specified in <a href="#section-7.2.5">section 7.2.5</a>.

   In Operational Mode 1, when all the extended LSP fragments of a

   System SHOULD remove the neighbor information to S' from its original
   LSPs.

   This section describes modifications to the way extension-capable ISs
   handle LSPs for the SPF computation.

   When considering LSPs of an extension-capable IS (identified by the
   inclusion of the IS Alias ID TLV), the original and extended LSPs are
   combined to form one large logical LSP.  If the LSP belongs to an IS
   running Operational Mode 1, there might be adjacencies between the
   original and extended LSPs.  These are trivially ignored (since when
   processing them the large logical LSP is already on PATHS), and does
   not complicate the SPF.  Furthermore, this check should already be
   implemented (this scenario could occur on error, without this
   extension).

   If LSP fragment 0 of the Original LSP set is missing or its
   RemainingLifetime is zero, all of the LSPs generated by that
   Originating System (Extended as well) MUST NOT be considered in the
   SPF.  That is, the large logical LSP is not considered in the SPF.
   The original LSP fragments are identified when the is-alias-id value
   is the same as the system-id of those LSPs.  If an LSP fragment 0 of
   an extended LSP set is missing or its RemainingLifetime is zero, only
   that LSP set MUST NOT be considered in the SPF.  These rules are
   present to ensure consistent SPF results on Mode 1 and Mode 2 LSPs.

   Note, that the above behavior is consistent with how previous
   implementations will interpret Mode 1 LSPs.

   It should be noted, that an IS MUST use the system-id of the LSP that
   will include a neighbor, when forming an adjacency with that
   neighbor.  That is, if a neighbor is to be included in extended LSP
   S', then S' should be used as the system-id in IS Hellos [3] and IS-
   IS Hellos when forming an adjacency with that neighbor.  This is
   regardless of the Operational Mode.  Of course, in Mode 1 this means
   that only the Normal system-id will be used when sending hellos.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/ISs."></a>    ISs.</span>

   In order to correctly advertise link-state information under
   Operation Mode 2, all ISs in an area must be extension-capable.
   However, it is possible to not upgrade every router in the network,
   if the extended information is not routing information, but rather
   data that is of use to only a subset of routers (e.g., optical
   switches using IS-IS could carry optical-specific information in
   extended LSPs)

   If a live network contains routers exceeding the 256 fragment limit,
   and for some reason the upgrade has to be done incrementally, it is
   possible to transition the network, using the following steps:

   -  Upgrade the routers, one-by-one, to run this extension in
      Operation Mode 1.  The other non-extension-capable routers will
      interoperate correctly.

   -  When all routers are extension-capable, configure them one-by-one
      to run in Operation Mode 2.  All extension-capable routers
      interoperate correctly, regardless of what mode they are run in.

   Implementations SHOULD support a configuration parameter controlling
   the LSP origination behavior.  The default value of this parameter
   SHOULD correspond to the behavior described in [<a href="#ref-ISIS-ISO" title='"Intermediate System to Intermediate System Intra- Domain Routeing Exchange Protocol for use in Conjunction with the Protocol for Providing the Connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473)"'>ISIS-ISO</a>], i.e.,
   neither of the two modes described in this document should be enabled
   without explicit configuration when the router software is upgraded
   with this extension.
