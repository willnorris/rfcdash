<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   A BGP [<a href="rfc4271.html" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] speaker can send Outbound Route Filters (ORFs)
   [<a href="rfc5291.html" title='"Outbound Route Filtering Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC5291</a>] to a peer.  The peer uses ORFs to filter routing updates
   that it sends to the BGP speaker.  Using ORF, a BGP speaker can
   realize a "route pull" paradigm in which the BGP speaker, on demand,
   pulls certain routes from the peer.

   This document defines a new ORF-type, called the Covering Prefixes
   ORF (CP-ORF).  A BGP speaker sends a CP-ORF to a peer in order to
   pull routes that cover a specified host address.  A prefix covers a
   host address if it can be used to forward traffic towards that host
   address.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> provides a more complete description of covering
   prefix selection criteria.

   CP-ORF is applicable in Virtual Hub-and-Spoke VPNs [<a href="rfc7024.html" title='"Virtual Hub-and-Spoke in BGP/MPLS VPNs"'>RFC7024</a>]
   [<a href="rfc4364.html" title='"BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4364</a>].  It also is applicable BGP/MPLS Ethernet VPN (EVPN)
   [<a href="rfc7432.html" title='"BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN"'>RFC7432</a>] networks.

   The CP-ORF recipient uses the following fields to select routes
   matching the CP-ORF:

   o  Sequence: the relative position of a CP-ORF entry among other
      CP-ORF entries

   o  Minlen: the minimum length of the selected route (measured in
      bits)

   o  Maxlen: the maximum length of the selected route (measured in
      bits)

   o  VPN Route Target: the VPN Route Target carried by the selected
      route

   o  Route Type: the type of the selected route

   o  Host Address: the address covered by the selected route

   See <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> for details.

   The CP-ORF recipient marks routes that match CP-ORF with the Import
   Route Target before advertising those routes to the CP-ORF
   originator.  See <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> for details.

   According to [<a href="rfc4271.html" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>], every BGP speaker maintains a single Loc-RIB.
   For each of its peers, the BGP speaker also maintains an Outbound
   Filter and an Adj-RIB-Out.  The Outbound Filter defines policy that
   determines which Loc-RIB entries are processed into the corresponding
   Adj-RIB-Out.  Mechanisms such as RT-Constrain [<a href="rfc4684.html" title='"Constrained Route Distribution for Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4684</a>] and ORF
   [<a href="rfc5291.html" title='"Outbound Route Filtering Capability for BGP-4"'>RFC5291</a>] enable a router's peer to influence the Outbound Filter.
   Therefore, the Outbound Filter for a given peer is constructed using
   a combination of the locally configured policy and the information
   received via RT-Constrain and ORF from the peer.

   Using this model, we can describe the operations of CP-ORF as
   follows:

   When a BGP speaker receives a ROUTE-REFRESH message that contains a
   CP-ORF and that ROUTE-REFRESH message violates any of the encoding
   rules specified in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, the BGP speaker MUST ignore the entire
   ROUTE-REFRESH message.  It SHOULD also log the event.  However, an
   implementation MAY apply logging thresholds to avoid excessive
   messaging or log file overflow.

   Otherwise, the BGP speaker processes each CP-ORF entry as indicated
   by the Action field.  If the Action is equal to ADD, the BGP speaker
   adds the CP-ORF entry to the Outbound Filter associated with the peer
   in the position specified by the Sequence field.  If the Action is
   equal to REMOVE, the BGP speaker removes the CP-ORF entry from the
   Outbound Filter.  If the Action is equal to REMOVE-ALL, the BGP
   speaker removes all CP-ORF entries from the Outbound Filter.

   Whenever the BGP speaker applies an Outbound Filter to a route
   contained in its Loc-RIB, it evaluates the route in terms of the
   CP-ORF entries first.  It then evaluates the route in terms of the
   remaining non-CP-ORF entries.  The rules for the former are described
   below.  The rules for the latter are outside the scope of this
   document.

   The following route types can match a CP-ORF:

   o  IPv4-VPN

   o  IPv6-VPN

   o  L2VPN

   In order for an IPv4-VPN route or IPv6-VPN route to match a CP-ORF,
   all of the following conditions MUST be true:

   o  the route carries an RT whose value is the same as the CP-ORF VPN
      Route Target;

   o  the route prefix length is greater than or equal to the CP-ORF
      Minlen plus 64 (i.e., the length of a VPN Route Distinguisher);

   o  the route prefix length is less than or equal to the CP-ORF Maxlen
      plus 64 (i.e., the length of a VPN Route Distinguisher);

   o  ignoring the Route Distinguisher, the leading bits of the route
      prefix are identical to the leading bits of the CP-ORF Host
      Address, and CP-ORF Minlen defines the number of bits that must be
      identical; and

   o  Loc-RIB does not contain a more specific route that also satisfies
      all of the above listed conditions.

   The BGP speaker ignores Route Distinguishers when determining whether
   a prefix matches a host address.  For example, assume that a CP-ORF
   carries the following information:

   o  Minlen equal to 1

   o  Maxlen equal to 32

   o  Host Address equal to 192.0.2.1

   Assume also that Loc-RIB contains routes for the following IPv4-VPN
   prefixes and that all of these routes carry an RT whose value is the
   same as the CP-ORF VPN Route Target:

   o  1:0.0.0.0/64.

   o  2:192.0.2.0/88

   o  3:192.0.2.0/89




<span class="grey">Jeng, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 8]</span></pre>

   Only the prefix 3:192.0.2.0/89 matches the CP-ORF.  The prefix
   1:0.0.0.0/64 does not match, because its length (64) is less than the
   CP-ORF Minlen (1) plus the length of an L3VPN Route Distinguisher
   (64).  If Loc-RIB did not contain the prefix 3:192.0.2.0/89,
   2:192.0.2.0/88 would match the CP-ORF.  However, because Loc-RIB also
   contains a more specific covering route (3:192.0.2.0/89),
   2:192.0.2.0/88 does not match.  Only 3:192.0.2.0/89 satisfies all of
   the above listed match criteria.  Note that the matching algorithm
   ignored Route Distinguishers.

   In order for an EVPN route to match a CP-ORF, all of the following
   conditions MUST be true:

   o  the EVPN route type is equal to the CP-ORF Route Type; and

   o  the route carries an RT whose value is equal to the CP-ORF VPN
      Route Target.

   In addition, if the CP-ORF Route Type is equal to MAC/IP
   Advertisement Route, the following conditions also MUST be true:

   o  the EVPN Route MAC Address Length is greater than or equal to the
      CP-ORF Minlen plus 64 (i.e., the length of a VPN Route
      Distinguisher);

   o  the EVPN Route MAC Address Length is less than or equal to the CP-
      ORF Maxlen plus 64 (i.e., the length of a VPN Route
      Distinguisher); and

   o  ignoring the Route Distinguisher, the leading bits of the EVPN
      Route MAC Address are identical to the leading bits of the CP-ORF
      Host Address.  CP-ORF Minlen defines the number of bits that must
      be identical.

   If a route matches the selection criteria of a CP-ORF entry and it
   does not violate any subsequent rule specified by the Outbound Filter
   (e.g., rules that reflect local policy or rules that are due to
   RT-Constrains), the BGP speaker places the route into the Adj-RIB-
   Out.  In Adj-RIB-Out, the BGP speaker adds the CP-ORF Import Route
   Target to the list of RTs that the route already carries.  The BGP
   speaker also adds a Transitive Opaque Extended Community [<a href="rfc4360.html" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>]
   with the sub-type equal to CP-ORF (0x03).  As a result of being
   placed in Adj-RIB-Out, the route is advertised to the peer associated
   with the Adj-RIB-Out.

   Receiving CP-ORF entries with REMOVE or REMOVE-ALL Actions may cause
   a route that has previously been installed in a particular Adj-RIB-
   Out to be excluded from that Adj-RIB-Out.  In this case, as specified
   in [<a href="rfc4271.html" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>], "the previously advertised route in that Adj-RIB-Out
   MUST be withdrawn from service by means of an UPDATE message".

   <a href="rfc5291.html">RFC 5291</a> states that a BGP speaker should respond to a ROUTE REFRESH
   message as follows:

      If the When-to-refresh indicates IMMEDIATE, then after processing
      all the ORF entries carried in the message the speaker
      re-advertises to the peer routes from the Adj-RIB-Out associated
      with the peer that have the same AFI/SAFI as what is carried in
      the message, and taking into account all the ORF entries for that
      AFI/SAFI received from the peer.  The speaker MUST re-advertise
      all the routes that have been affected by the ORF entries carried
      in the message, but MAY also re-advertise the routes that have not
      been affected by the ORF entries carried in the message.

   When the ROUTE-REFRESH message includes only CP-ORF entries, the BGP
   speaker MUST re-advertise routes that have been affected by these
   CP-ORF entries.  It is RECOMMENDED not to re-advertise the routes
   that have not been affected by the CP-ORF entries.

   When the ROUTE-REFRESH message includes one or more CP-ORF entries
   and one or more ORF entries of a different type, the behavior remains
   unchanged from that described in <a href="rfc5291.html">RFC 5291</a>.

   In a Virtual Hub-and-Spoke environment, VPN sites are attached to PE
   routers.  For a given VPN, a PE router acts in exactly one of the
   following roles:

   o  as a V-hub

   o  as a V-spoke

   o  as neither a V-hub nor a V-spoke

   To illustrate CP-ORF operation in conjunction with Virtual Hub-and-
   Spoke, assume the following:

   o  One of the sites in a particular VPN, RED-VPN, is connected to a
      PE that acts as neither a V-hub nor a V-spoke for RED-VPN.  We
      refer to this PE as PE1.





<span class="grey">Jeng, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 10]</span></pre>

   o  Another site in RED-VPN is connected to another PE, and that PE
      acts as a V-hub for RED-VPN.  We refer to this PE as V-hub1.

   o  Yet another site in RED-VPN is connected to another PE, and that
      PE acts as a V-spoke for RED-VPN.  We refer to this PE as
      V-spoke1.

   All of these PEs advertise RED-VPN routes to a Route Reflector (RR).
   They mark these routes with an RT, which we will call RT-RED.  In
   particular, PE1 advertises a RED-VPN route to a prefix that we will
   call P.  P covers a host address that we will call H.

   For the purpose of illustration, also assume that the PEs and the RRs
   use RT-Constrain [<a href="rfc4684.html" title='"Constrained Route Distribution for Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4684</a>].

   V-hub1 serves the RED-VPN.  Therefore, V-hub1 advertises a VPN-IP
   default route for the RED-VPN to the RR, carrying the route target
   RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.

   V-spoke1 establishes a BGP session with the RR, negotiating the
   CP-ORF capability as well as the Multiprotocol Extensions capability
   [<a href="rfc4760.html" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>RFC4760</a>].  Upon establishment of the BGP session, the RR does not
   advertise any routes to V-spoke1.  The RR will not advertise any
   routes until it receives either a ROUTE-REFRESH message or a BGP
   UPDATE message containing a Route Target Membership Network Layering
   Reachability Information (NLRI) [<a href="rfc4684.html" title='"Constrained Route Distribution for Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"'>RFC4684</a>].

   Immediately after the BGP session is established, V-spoke1 sends the
   RR a BGP UPDATE message containing a Route Target Membership NLRI.
   The Route Target Membership NLRI specifies RT-RED-FROM-HUB1 as its
   RT.  In response to the BGP-UPDATE message, the RR advertises the VPN
   IP default route for the RED-VPN to V-spoke1.  This route carries the
   route target RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.  V-spoke1 subjects this route to its
   import policy and accepts it because it carries the route target
   RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.

   Now, V-spoke1 begins normal operation, sending all of its RED-VPN
   traffic through V-hub1.  At some point, V-spoke1 determines that it
   might benefit from a more direct route to H.  (Note that criteria by
   which V-spoke1 determines that it needs a more direct route to H are
   beyond the scope of this document.)

   In order to discover a more direct route, V-spoke1 assigns a unique
   numeric identifier to H.  V-spoke1 then sends a ROUTE-REFRESH message
   to the RR, which contains the following information:

   o  AFI is equal to IPv4 or IPv6, as appropriate

   o  SAFI is equal to "MPLS-labeled VPN address"

   o  When-to-refresh is equal to IMMEDIATE

   o  Action is equal to ADD

   o  Match is equal to PERMIT

   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF

   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to the identifier associated with H

   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 1

   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 32 or 128, as appropriate

   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED

   o  CP-ORF Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED-FROM-HUB1

   o  CP-ORF Route Type is equal to 0 (i.e., undefined)

   o  CP-ORF Host Address is equal to H

   Upon receipt of the ROUTE-REFRESH message, the RR MUST ensure that it
   carries all routes belonging to the RED-VPN.  In at least one special
   case, where all of the RR clients are V-spokes and none of the RR
   clients are V-hubs, the RR will lack some or all of the required
   RED-VPN routes.  So, the RR sends a BGP UPDATE message containing a
   Route Target Membership NLRI for VPN-RED to all of its peers.  This
   causes the peers to advertise VPN-RED routes to the RR if they have
   not done so already.

   Next, the RR adds the received CP-ORF to the Outbound Filter
   associated with V-spoke1.  Using the procedures in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, the RR
   determines whether any of the routes in its Loc-RIB satisfy the
   selection criteria of the newly updated Outbound Filter.  If any
   routes satisfy the match criteria, they are added to the Adj-RIB-Out
   associated with V-spoke1.  In Adj-RIB-Out, the RR adds
   RT-RED-FROM-HUB1 to the list of RTs that the route already carries.
   The RR also adds a Transitive Opaque Extended Community [<a href="rfc4360.html" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>]

   In an EVPN environment, Customer Edge (CE) devices are attached to PE
   routers.  A CE can be a host, a router, or a switch.  For a given
   EVI, a PE router acts in exactly one of the following roles:

   o  as a DMG

   o  as a Spoke

   o  as neither a DMG nor a Spoke

   To illustrate CP-ORF operation in the EVPN environment, assume the
   following:

   o  A CE device in a particular EVI, RED-EVI, is connected to a PE
      that acts as neither a DMG nor a Spoke for RED-EVI.  We refer to
      this PE as PE1.

   o  Another CE device in RED-EVI is connected to another PE, and that
      PE acts as a DMG for RED-EVI.  We refer to this PE as DMG1.

   o  Yet another CE device in RED-EVI is connected to another PE, and
      that PE acts as a Spoke for RED-EVI.  We refer to this PE as
      Spoke1.

   All of these PEs advertise RED-EVI routes to a RR.  They mark these
   routes with an RT, which we will call RT-RED.  In particular, PE1
   advertises a RED-EVI route to a MAC Address that we will call M.

   The RED-EVI VPN Routing and Forwarding tables (VRFs) on all of these
   PEs are provisioned to import EVPN routes that carry RT-RED.

   Since DMG1 acts as a DMG for RED-EVI, DMG1 advertises a UMR for the
   RED-EVI to the RR, carrying the route target RT-RED.  The UMR is
   characterized as follows:

   o  EVPN Route Type is equal to MAC/IP Advertisement Route

   o  MAC address length is equal to 0

   o  IP address length is equal to 0

   Spoke1 establishes a BGP session with the RR, negotiating the CP-ORF
   capability as well as the Multiprotocol Extensions capability
   [<a href="rfc4760.html" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>RFC4760</a>].  Upon establishment of the BGP session, the RR does not
   advertise any routes to Spoke1.  The RR will not advertise any routes
   until it receives a ROUTE-REFRESH message.

   Immediately after the BGP session is established, Spoke1 sends the RR
   a ROUTE REFRESH message containing the following information:

   o  AFI is equal to L2VPN

   o  SAFI is equal to BGP EVPN

   o  When-to-refresh is equal to IMMEDIATE

   o  Action is equal to ADD

   o  Match is equal to PERMIT

   The ROUTE REFRESH message also contains four ORF entries.  The first
   ORF entry contains the following information:

   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF

   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to 1

   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 0

   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 0

   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED

   o  CP-ORF Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED

   o  CP-ORF Route Type is equal to 1 (Ethernet Autodiscovery Route)

   The second ORF entry contains the following information:

   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF

   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 0

   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 0

   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 0

   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 0

   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED

   o  CP-ORF Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED

   o  CP-ORF Route Type is equal to 3 (Inclusive Multicast Route)

   The fourth ORF entry contains the following information:

   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF

   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to 4

   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 0

   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 0

   In response to the ROUTE REFRESH message, the RR advertises the
   following to V-spoke1:

   o  All Ethernet Autodiscovery Routes belonging to RED-EVI

   o  A UMR advertised by DMG1 and belonging to RED-EVI

   o  All Inclusive Multicast Routes belonging to RED-EVI

   o  All Ethernet Segment Routes belonging to RED-EVI

   All of these routes carry the route target RT-RED.  Spoke1 subjects
   these routes to its import policy and accepts them because they carry
   the route target RT-RED.

   Now, Spoke1 begins normal operation, sending all of its RED-VPN
   traffic through DMG1.  At some point, Spoke1 determines that it might
   benefit from a more direct route to M.  (Note that criteria by which
   Spoke1 determines that it needs a more direct route to M are beyond
   the scope of this document.)

   In order to discover a more direct route, Spoke1 assigns a unique
   numeric identifier to M.  V-spoke1 then sends a ROUTE-REFRESH message
   to the RR, containing the following information:

   o  AFI is equal to L2VPN

   o  SAFI is equal to BGP EVPN

   o  When-to-refresh is equal to IMMEDIATE

   o  Action is equal to ADD

   o  Match is equal to PERMIT

   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF

   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to the identifier associated with M

   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 1

   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 48

   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED

   o  CP-ORF Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED

   o  CP-ORF Route Type is equal to 2 (i.e., MAC/IP Advertisement Route)

   o  CP-ORF Host Address is equal to M

   Next, the RR adds the received CP-ORF to the Outbound Filter
   associated with Spoke1.  Using the procedures in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, the RR
   determines whether any of the routes in its Loc-RIB satisfy the
   selection criteria of the newly updated Outbound Filter.  If any
   routes satisfy the match criteria, they are added to the Adj-RIB-Out
   associated with Spoke1.  The RR adds a Transitive Opaque Extended
   Community [<a href="rfc4360.html" title='"BGP Extended Communities Attribute"'>RFC4360</a>] with the sub-type equal to CP-ORF.  Note that as
   these routes are added to the Adj-RIB-Out, the RR does not change the
   list of RTs that the route already carries.  Finally, RR advertises
   the newly added routes to V-spoke1.  In this example, the RR
   advertises M to V-spoke1 with a next-hop of PE1.

   Spoke1 subjects the advertised routes to its import policy and
   accepts them because they carry the route target RT-RED.

   Spoke1 may repeat this process whenever it discovers another flow
   that might benefit from a more direct route to its destination.

   Note that, in general, an EVI may have more than one DMG, in which
   case each spoke would receive a UMR from each of them.  The spoke
   should follow its local route selection procedures to select one of
   them as the "best" and use the selected one.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Clean-up"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Clean-up</span>

   Each CP-ORF consumes memory and compute resources on the device that
   supports it.  Therefore, in order to obtain optimal performance, BGP
   speakers periodically evaluate all CP-ORFs that they have originated
   and remove unneeded CP-ORFs.  The criteria by which a BGP speaker
   identifies unneeded CP-ORF entries is a matter of local policy and is
   beyond the scope of this document.

   Each CP-ORF consumes memory and compute resources on the device that
   supports it.  Therefore, a device supporting CP-ORF takes the
   following steps to protect itself from oversubscription:

   o  When negotiating the ORF capability, advertise willingness to
      receive the CP-ORF only to known, trusted Internal BGP (iBGP)
      peers.  See <a href="rfc5291.html#section-5">Section 5 of RFC 5291</a> for negotiation details.

   o  Enforce a per-peer limit on the number of CP-ORFs that can be
      installed at any given time.  Ignore all requests to add CP-ORFs
      beyond that limit

   Security considerations for BGP are presented in [<a href="rfc4271.html" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>RFC4271</a>] while
