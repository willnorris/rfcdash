Abstract

   This document specifies conventions for X.509 certificate usage by
   Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) v3.2 agents.
   S/MIME provides a method to send and receive secure MIME messages,
   and certificates are an integral part of S/MIME agent processing.
   S/MIME agents validate certificates as described in <a href="rfc5280.html">RFC 5280</a>, the
   Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile.
   S/MIME agents must meet the certificate processing requirements in
   this document as well as those in <a href="rfc5280.html">RFC 5280</a>.  This document obsoletes
   <a href="rfc3850.html">RFC 3850</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) v3.2, described
   in [<a href="#ref-SMIME-MSG" title='"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Message Specification"'>SMIME-MSG</a>], provides a method to send and receive secure MIME
   messages.  Before using a public key to provide security services,
   the S/MIME agent MUST verify that the public key is valid.  S/MIME
   agents MUST use PKIX certificates to validate public keys as
   described in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX)
   Certificate and CRL Profile [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].  S/MIME agents MUST meet the
   certificate processing requirements documented in this document in
   addition to those stated in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].

   This specification is compatible with the Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS) <a href="rfc5652.html">RFC 5652</a> [<a href="#ref-CMS">CMS</a>] in that it uses the data types defined by
   CMS.  It also inherits all the varieties of architectures for
   certificate-based key management supported by CMS.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Definitions</span>

   For the purposes of this document, the following definitions apply.

   ASN.1: Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined in ITU-T X.680
   [<a href="#ref-X.680">X.680</a>].

   Attribute certificate (AC): An X.509 AC is a separate structure from
   a subject's public key X.509 certificate.  A subject may have
   multiple X.509 ACs associated with each of its public key X.509
   certificates.  Each X.509 AC binds one or more attributes with one of
   the subject's public key X.509 certificates.  The X.509 AC syntax is
   defined in [<a href="#ref-ACAUTH" title='"An Internet Attribute Certificate Profile for Authorization"'>ACAUTH</a>].

   Certificate: A type that binds an entity's name to a public key with
   a digital signature.  This type is defined in the Internet X.509
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) Certificate and CRL Profile [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].
   This type also contains the distinguished name of the certificate
   issuer (the signer), an issuer-specific serial number, the issuer's
   signature algorithm identifier, a validity period, and extensions
   also defined in that document.

   Certificate Revocation List (CRL): A type that contains information
   about certificates whose validity an issuer has prematurely revoked.
   The information consists of an issuer name, the time of issue, the
   next scheduled time of issue, a list of certificate serial numbers
   and their associated revocation times, and extensions as defined in
   [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].  The CRL is signed by the issuer.  The type intended by this

   The CMS message format allows for a wide variety of options in
   content and algorithm support.  This section puts forth a number of
   support requirements and recommendations in order to achieve a base
   level of interoperability among all S/MIME implementations.  Most of
   the CMS format for S/MIME messages is defined in [<a href="#ref-SMIME-MSG" title='"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Message Specification"'>SMIME-MSG</a>].

   Receiving agents MUST support the Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
   format defined in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].  If sending agents include CRLs in outgoing
   messages, the CRL format defined in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>] MUST be used.  In all
   cases, both v1 and v2 CRLs MUST be supported.

   All agents MUST be capable of performing revocation checks using CRLs
   as specified in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].  All agents MUST perform revocation status
   checking in accordance with [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].  Receiving agents MUST recognize
   CRLs in received S/MIME messages.

   Receiving agents SHOULD support X.509 version 2 attribute
   certificates.  See [<a href="#ref-ACAUTH" title='"An Internet Attribute Certificate Profile for Authorization"'>ACAUTH</a>] for details about the profile for
   attribute certificates.

   The CMS message format supports a choice of certificate formats for
   public key content types: PKIX, PKCS #6 extended certificates
   [<a href="#ref-PKCS6" title='"PKCS #6: Extended-Certificate Syntax Standard"'>PKCS6</a>], and PKIX attribute certificates.

   The PKCS #6 format is not in widespread use.  In addition, PKIX
   certificate extensions address much of the same functionality and
   flexibility as was intended in the PKCS #6.  Thus, sending and
   receiving agents MUST NOT use PKCS #6 extended certificates.

   X.509 version 1 attribute certificates are also not widely
   implemented, and have been superseded with version 2 attribute
   certificates.  Sending agents MUST NOT send version 1 attribute
   certificates.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.%20%20CertificateSet"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  CertificateSet</span>

   Receiving agents MUST be able to handle an arbitrary number of
   certificates of arbitrary relationship to the message sender and to
   each other in arbitrary order.  In many cases, the certificates
   included in a signed message may represent a chain of certification
   from the sender to a particular root.  There may be, however,
   situations where the certificates in a signed message may be
   unrelated and included for convenience.

   Sending agents SHOULD include any certificates for the user's public
   key(s) and associated issuer certificates.  This increases the
   likelihood that the intended recipient can establish trust in the
   originator's public key(s).  This is especially important when
   sending a message to recipients that may not have access to the
   sender's public key through any other means or when sending a signed
   message to a new recipient.  The inclusion of certificates in
   outgoing messages can be omitted if S/MIME objects are sent within a
   group of correspondents that has established access to each other's
   certificates by some other means such as a shared directory or manual
   certificate distribution.  Receiving S/MIME agents SHOULD be able to
   handle messages without certificates using a database or directory
   lookup scheme.

   A sending agent SHOULD include at least one chain of certificates up
   to, but not including, a certification authority (CA) that it
   believes that the recipient may trust as authoritative.  A receiving
   agent MUST be able to handle an arbitrarily large number of
   certificates and chains.

   Agents MAY send CA certificates, that is, cross-certificates, self-
   issued certificates, and self-signed certificates.  Note that
   receiving agents SHOULD NOT simply trust any self-signed certificates
   as valid CAs, but SHOULD use some other mechanism to determine if
   this is a CA that should be trusted.  Also note that when
   certificates contain Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) public keys
   the parameters may be located in the root certificate.  This would
   require that the recipient possess both the end-entity certificate
   and the root certificate to perform a signature verification, and is
   a valid example of a case where transmitting the root certificate may
   be required.

   Receiving agents MUST support chaining based on the distinguished
   name fields.  Other methods of building certificate chains MAY be
   supported.

   Receiving agents SHOULD support the decoding of X.509 attribute
   certificates included in CMS objects.  All other issues regarding the
   generation and use of X.509 attribute certificates are outside of the
   scope of this specification.  One specification that addresses
   attribute certificate use is defined in [<a href="#ref-SECLABEL" title='"Implementing Company Classification Policy with the S/MIME Security Label"'>SECLABEL</a>].

   End-entity certificates MAY contain an Internet mail address as
   described in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>], Section 4.2.1.6.  The email address SHOULD be in
   the subjectAltName extension, and SHOULD NOT be in the subject
   distinguished name.

   Receiving agents MUST recognize and accept certificates that contain
   no email address.  Agents are allowed to provide an alternative
   mechanism for associating an email address with a certificate that
   does not contain an email address, such as through the use of the
   agent's address book, if available.  Receiving agents MUST recognize
   email addresses in the subjectAltName field.  Receiving agents MUST
   recognize email addresses in the Distinguished Name field in the PKCS
   #9 [<a href="#ref-PKCS9" title='"PKCS #9: Selected Object Classes and Attribute Types Version 2.0"'>PKCS9</a>] emailAddress attribute:

   Note that this attribute MUST be encoded as IA5String and has an
   upper bound of 255 characters.  The right side of the email address
   SHOULD be treated as ASCII-case-insensitive.

   Sending agents SHOULD make the address in the From or Sender header
   in a mail message match an Internet mail address in the signer's
   certificate.  Receiving agents MUST check that the address in the
   From or Sender header of a mail message matches an Internet mail
   address, if present, in the signer's certificate, if mail addresses
   are present in the certificate.  A receiving agent SHOULD provide
   some explicit alternate processing of the message if this comparison
   fails, which may be to display a message that shows the recipient the
   addresses in the certificate or other certificate details.

   A receiving agent SHOULD display a subject name or other certificate
   details when displaying an indication of successful or unsuccessful
   signature verification.

   All subject and issuer names MUST be populated (i.e., not an empty
   SEQUENCE) in S/MIME-compliant X.509 certificates, except that the
   subject distinguished name (DN) in a user's (i.e., end-entity)
   certificate MAY be an empty SEQUENCE in which case the subjectAltName
   extension will include the subject's identifier and MUST be marked as
   critical.

   S/MIME agents need to provide some certificate retrieval mechanism in
   order to gain access to certificates for recipients of digital
   envelopes.  There are many ways to implement certificate retrieval
   mechanisms.  [<a href="#ref-X.500" title="Information technology - Open Systems Interconnection - The Directory: Overview of concepts">X.500</a>] directory service is an excellent example of a
   certificate retrieval-only mechanism that is compatible with classic
   X.500 Distinguished Names.  Another method under consideration by the
   IETF is to provide certificate retrieval services as part of the
   existing Domain Name System (DNS).  Until such mechanisms are widely
   used, their utility may be limited by the small number of the
   correspondent's certificates that can be retrieved.  At a minimum,
   for initial S/MIME deployment, a user agent could automatically
   generate a message to an intended recipient requesting the
   recipient's certificate in a signed return message.

   Receiving and sending agents SHOULD also provide a mechanism to allow
   a user to "store and protect" certificates for correspondents in such
   a way so as to guarantee their later retrieval.  In many
   environments, it may be desirable to link the certificate
   retrieval/storage mechanisms together in some sort of certificate
   database.  In its simplest form, a certificate database would be
   local to a particular user and would function in a similar way as an



<span class="grey">Ramsdell &amp; Turner            Standards Track                    [Page 9]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-10" id="page-10" name="page-10"> </a>

   "address book" that stores a user's frequent correspondents.  In this
   way, the certificate retrieval mechanism would be limited to the
   certificates that a user has stored (presumably from incoming
   messages).  A comprehensive certificate retrieval/storage solution
   may combine two or more mechanisms to allow the greatest flexibility
   and utility to the user.  For instance, a secure Internet mail agent
   may resort to checking a centralized certificate retrieval mechanism
   for a certificate if it cannot be found in a user's local certificate
   storage/retrieval database.

   Receiving and sending agents SHOULD provide a mechanism for the
   import and export of certificates, using a CMS certs-only message.
   This allows for import and export of full certificate chains as
   opposed to just a single certificate.  This is described in
   [<a href="#ref-SMIME-MSG" title='"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Message Specification"'>SMIME-MSG</a>].

   Agents MUST handle multiple valid certification authority (CA)
   certificates containing the same subject name and the same public
   keys but with overlapping validity intervals.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Certificate%20Revocation%20Lists"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Certificate Revocation Lists</span>

   In general, it is always better to get the latest CRL information
   from a CA than to get information stored away from incoming messages.
   A receiving agent SHOULD have access to some CRL retrieval mechanism
   in order to gain access to certificate revocation information when
   validating certification paths.  A receiving or sending agent SHOULD
   also provide a mechanism to allow a user to store incoming
   certificate revocation information for correspondents in such a way
   so as to guarantee its later retrieval.

   Receiving and sending agents SHOULD retrieve and utilize CRL
   information every time a certificate is verified as part of a
   certification path validation even if the certificate was already
   verified in the past.  However, in many instances (such as off-line
   verification) access to the latest CRL information may be difficult
   or impossible.  The use of CRL information, therefore, may be
   dictated by the value of the information that is protected.  The
   value of the CRL information in a particular context is beyond the
   scope of this specification but may be governed by the policies
   associated with particular certification paths.

   All agents MUST be capable of performing revocation checks using CRLs
   as specified in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].  All agents MUST perform revocation status
   checking in accordance with [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].  Receiving agents MUST recognize
   CRLs in received S/MIME messages.

   In creating a user agent for secure messaging, certificate, CRL, and
   certification path validation SHOULD be highly automated while still
   acting in the best interests of the user.  Certificate, CRL, and path
   validation MUST be performed as per [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>] when validating a
   correspondent's public key.  This is necessary before using a public
   key to provide security services such as verifying a signature,
   encrypting a content-encryption key (e.g., RSA), or forming a
   pairwise symmetric key (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) to be used to encrypt
   or decrypt a content-encryption key.

   Certificates and CRLs are made available to the path validation
   procedure in two ways: a) incoming messages, and b) certificate and
   CRL retrieval mechanisms.  Certificates and CRLs in incoming messages
   are not required to be in any particular order nor are they required
   to be in any way related to the sender or recipient of the message
   (although in most cases they will be related to the sender).
   Incoming certificates and CRLs SHOULD be cached for use in path
   validation and optionally stored for later use.  This temporary
   certificate and CRL cache SHOULD be used to augment any other
   certificate and CRL retrieval mechanisms for path validation on
   incoming signed messages.

   PKIX describes an extensible framework in which the basic certificate
   information can be extended and describes how such extensions can be
   used to control the process of issuing and validating certificates.
   The PKIX Working Group has ongoing efforts to identify and create

   extensions that have value in particular certification environments.
   Further, there are active efforts underway to issue PKIX certificates
   for business purposes.  This document identifies the minimum required
   set of certificate extensions that have the greatest value in the
   S/MIME environment.  The syntax and semantics of all the identified
   extensions are defined in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].

   Sending and receiving agents MUST correctly handle the basic
   constraints, key usage, authority key identifier, subject key
   identifier, and subject alternative names certificate extensions when
   they appear in end-entity and CA certificates.  Some mechanism SHOULD
   exist to gracefully handle other certificate extensions when they
   appear in end-entity or CA certificates.

   Certificates issued for the S/MIME environment SHOULD NOT contain any
   critical extensions (extensions that have the critical field set to
   TRUE) other than those listed here.  These extensions SHOULD be
   marked as non-critical unless the proper handling of the extension is
   deemed critical to the correct interpretation of the associated
   certificate.  Other extensions may be included, but those extensions
   SHOULD NOT be marked as critical.

   Interpretation and syntax for all extensions MUST follow [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>],
   unless otherwise specified here.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.1.%20%20Basic%20Constraints"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.1" name="section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  Basic Constraints</span>

   The basic constraints extension serves to delimit the role and
   position that an issuing authority or end-entity certificate plays in
   a certification path.

   For example, certificates issued to CAs and subordinate CAs contain a
   basic constraint extension that identifies them as issuing authority
   certificates.  End-entity certificates contain the key usage
   extension that restrains end entities from using the key when
   performing issuing authority operations (see <a href="#section-4.4.2">Section 4.4.2</a>).

   As per [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>], certificates MUST contain a basicConstraints extension
   in CA certificates, and SHOULD NOT contain that extension in end-
   entity certificates.

   The key usage extension serves to limit the technical purposes for
   which a public key listed in a valid certificate may be used.
   Issuing authority certificates may contain a key usage extension that
   restricts the key to signing certificates, certificate revocation
   lists, and other data.



<span class="grey">Ramsdell &amp; Turner            Standards Track                   [Page 13]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5750.html">RFC 5750</a>             S/MIME 3.2 Certificate Handling        January 2010</span>


   For example, a certification authority may create subordinate issuer
   certificates that contain a key usage extension that specifies that
   the corresponding public key can be used to sign end user
   certificates and sign CRLs.

   If a key usage extension is included in a PKIX certificate, then it
   MUST be marked as critical.

   S/MIME receiving agents MUST NOT accept the signature of a message if
   it was verified using a certificate that contains the key usage
   extension without either the digitalSignature or nonRepudiation bit
   set.  Sometimes S/MIME is used as a secure message transport for
   applications beyond interpersonal messaging.  In such cases, the
   S/MIME-enabled application can specify additional requirements
   concerning the digitalSignature or nonRepudiation bits within this
   extension.

   If the key usage extension is not specified, receiving clients MUST
   presume that the digitalSignature and nonRepudiation bits are set.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.3.%20%20Subject%20Alternative%20Name"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.3" name="section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.  Subject Alternative Name</span>

   The subject alternative name extension is used in S/MIME as the
   preferred means to convey the email address(es) that correspond(s) to
   the entity for this certificate.  Any email addresses present MUST be
   encoded using the rfc822Name CHOICE of the GeneralName type as
   described in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>], Section 4.2.1.6.  Since the SubjectAltName type
   is a SEQUENCE OF GeneralName, multiple email addresses MAY be
   present.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.4.%20%20Extended%20Key%20Usage%20Extension"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.4" name="section-4.4.4">4.4.4</a>.  Extended Key Usage Extension</span>

   The extended key usage extension also serves to limit the technical
   purposes for which a public key listed in a valid certificate may be
   used.  The set of technical purposes for the certificate therefore
   are the intersection of the uses indicated in the key usage and
   extended key usage extensions.

   For example, if the certificate contains a key usage extension
   indicating digital signature and an extended key usage extension that
   includes the email protection OID, then the certificate may be used
   for signing but not encrypting S/MIME messages.  If the certificate
   contains a key usage extension indicating digital signature but no
   extended key usage extension, then the certificate may also be used
   to sign but not encrypt S/MIME messages.

   If the extended key usage extension is present in the certificate,
   then interpersonal message S/MIME receiving agents MUST check that it
   contains either the emailProtection or the anyExtendedKeyUsage OID as
   defined in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>].  S/MIME uses other than interpersonal messaging
   MAY require the explicit presence of the extended key usage extension
   or other OIDs to be present in the extension or both.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
   must be faced by a S/MIME agent.  Among these issues are protecting
   the user's private key, preventing various attacks, and helping the
   user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently encrypting a message for
   the wrong recipient.  The entire list of security considerations is
   beyond the scope of this document, but some significant concerns are
   listed here.

   When processing certificates, there are many situations where the
   processing might fail.  Because the processing may be done by a user
   agent, a security gateway, or other program, there is no single way
   to handle such failures.  Just because the methods to handle the
   failures have not been listed, however, the reader should not assume
   that they are not important.  The opposite is true: if a certificate
   is not provably valid and associated with the message, the processing
   software should take immediate and noticeable steps to inform the end
   user about it.

   Some of the many places where signature and certificate checking
   might fail include:

   - no Internet mail addresses in a certificate match the sender of a
     message, if the certificate contains at least one mail address

   - no certificate chain leads to a trusted CA

   - no ability to check the CRL for a certificate

   - an invalid CRL was received

   - the CRL being checked is expired

   - the certificate is expired

   - the certificate has been revoked







<span class="grey">Ramsdell &amp; Turner            Standards Track                   [Page 15]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-16" id="page-16" name="page-16"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5750.html">RFC 5750</a>             S/MIME 3.2 Certificate Handling        January 2010</span>


   There are certainly other instances where a certificate may be
   invalid, and it is the responsibility of the processing software to
   check them all thoroughly, and to decide what to do if the check
   fails.

   It is possible for there to be multiple unexpired CRLs for a CA.  If
   an agent is consulting CRLs for certificate validation, it SHOULD
   make sure that the most recently issued CRL for that CA is consulted,
   since an S/MIME message sender could deliberately include an older
   unexpired CRL in an S/MIME message.  This older CRL might not include
   recently revoked certificates, which might lead an agent to accept a
   certificate that has been revoked in a subsequent CRL.

   When determining the time for a certificate validity check, agents
   have to be careful to use a reliable time.  Unless it is from a
   trusted agent, this time MUST NOT be the SigningTime attribute found
   in an S/MIME message.  For most sending agents, the SigningTime
   attribute could be deliberately set to direct the receiving agent to
   check a CRL that could have out-of-date revocation status for a
   certificate, or cause an improper result when checking the Validity
   field of a certificate.

   In addition to the Security Considerations identified in [<a href="#ref-KEYM" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>KEYM</a>],
   caution should be taken when processing certificates that have not
   first been validated to a trust anchor.  Certificates could be
   manufactured by untrusted sources for the purpose of mounting denial
   of service or other attacks.  For example, keys selected to require
   excessive cryptographic processing, or extensive lists of CRL
   Distribution Point (CDP) and/or Authority Information Access (AIA)
   addresses in the certificate, could be used to mount denial-of-
   service attacks.  Similarly, attacker-specified CDP and/or AIA
   addresses could be included in fake certificates to allow the
   originator to detect receipt of the message even if signature
   verification fails.

   The 4096-bit RSA key size requirement for certificate and CRL
   verification is larger than the 2048-bit RSA key sizes for message
   signature generation/verification or message encryption/decryption in
   [<a href="#ref-SMIME-MSG" title='"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Message Specification"'>SMIME-MSG</a>] because many root CAs included in certificate stores have
   already issued root certificates with the 4096-bit key.  The standard
   that defines comparable key sizes for DSA is not yet available.  In
   particular, [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-2" title='"Digital Signature Standard (DSS)"'>FIPS186-2</a>] without Change Notice 1 allowed DSA key sizes
   between 512 and 1024 bits, [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-2" title='"Digital Signature Standard (DSS)"'>FIPS186-2</a>] with Change Notice 1 only
   allowed DSA key sizes of 1024 bits, and [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-3" title=" FIPS Publication 186-3: Digital Signature Standard">FIPS186-3</a>] allowed DSA key
   sizes from 1024 to 3072 bits.  Further, 4096-bit keys are normally
   only used by Root certificates and not by subordinate CA
   certificates, thereby lengthening the root CA certificate's validity
   period.

   RSA and DSA keys of less than 1024 bits are now considered by many
   experts to be cryptographically insecure (due to advances in
   computing power), and should no longer be used to sign certificates
   or CRLs.  Such keys were previously considered secure, so processing
   previously received signed and encrypted mail may require processing
   certificates or CRLs signed with weak keys.  Implementations that
   wish to support previous versions of S/MIME or process old messages
   need to consider the security risks that result from accepting
   certificates and CRLs with smaller key sizes (e.g., spoofed
   certificates) versus the costs of denial of service.  If an
   implementation supports verification of certificates or CRLs
   generated with RSA and DSA keys of less than 1024 bits, it MUST warn
   the user.  Implementers should consider providing a stronger warning
   for weak signatures on certificates and CRLs associated with newly
   received messages than the one provided for certificates and CRLs
   associated with previously stored messages.  Server implementations
   (e.g., secure mail list servers) where user warnings are not
   appropriate SHOULD reject messages with weak cryptography.

   If an implementation is concerned about compliance with National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) key size
   recommendations, then see [<a href="#ref-SP800-57" title=" Special Publication 800-57: Recommendation for Key Management">SP800-57</a>].

Moving S/MIME v2 Certificate Handling to Historic Status</span>

   The S/MIME v3 [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv3" title=" [RFC2634">SMIMEv3</a>], v3.1 [SMIMEv3.1], and v3.2 (this document)
   are backwards compatible with the S/MIME v2 Certificate Handling
   Specification [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv2" title="RFC2314">SMIMEv2</a>], with the exception of the algorithms
   (dropped RC2/40 requirement and added DSA and RSASSA-PSS
   requirements).  Therefore, it is recommended that <a href="rfc2312.html">RFC 2312</a> [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv2" title="RFC2314">SMIMEv2</a>]
   be moved to Historic status.

   Many thanks go out to the other authors of the S/MIME v2 RFC: Steve
   Dusse, Paul Hoffman, and Jeff Weinstein.  Without v2, there wouldn't
   be a v3, v3.1, or v3.2.

   A number of the members of the S/MIME Working Group have also worked
   very hard and contributed to this document.  Any list of people is
   doomed to omission, and for that I apologize.  In alphabetical order,
   the following people stand out in my mind because they made direct
   contributions to this document.

   Bill Flanigan, Trevor Freeman, Elliott Ginsburg, Alfred Hoenes, Paul
   Hoffman, Russ Housley, David P. Kemp, Michael Myers, John Pawling,
   Denis Pinkas, and Jim Schaad.
