Abstract

   This document provides requirements for Layer 2 Provider-Provisioned
   Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs).  It first provides taxonomy and
   terminology and states generic and general service requirements.  It
   covers point-to-point VPNs, referred to as Virtual Private Wire
   Service (VPWS), as well as multipoint-to-multipoint VPNs, also known
   as Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).  Detailed requirements are
   expressed from both a customer as well as a service provider
   perspectives.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This section describes the scope and outline of the document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Scope%20of%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Scope of This Document</span>

   This document provides requirements for provider-provisioned Layer 2
   Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN).  It identifies requirements that
   MAY apply to one or more individual approaches that a Service
   Provider (SP) may use for the provisioning of a Layer 2 VPN service.
   The content of this document makes use of the terminology defined in
   [<a href="rfc4026.html" title='"Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Network (VPN) Terminology"'>RFC4026</a>] and common components for deploying L2VPNs described in
   [<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>].

   The technical specifications to provide L2VPN services are outside
   the scope of this document.  The framework document [<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>] and
   several other documents, which explain technical approaches providing
   L2VPN services, such as [<a href="#ref-VPLS_LDP" title='"Virtual Private LAN Services over MPLS"'>VPLS_LDP</a>], [<a href="#ref-VPLS_BGP" title='"Virtual Private LAN Service"'>VPLS_BGP</a>], and [<a href="#ref-IPLS" title='"IP-Only LAN Service (IPLS)"'>IPLS</a>], are
   available to cover this aspect.

   This document describes requirements for two types of L2VPNs: (1)
   Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), and (2) Virtual Private LAN
   Service (VPLS).  The approach followed in this document distinguishes
   L2VPN types as to how the connectivity is provided (point-point or
   multipoint-multipoint), as detailed in [<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>].

   This document is intended as a "checklist" of requirements that will
   provide a consistent way to evaluate and document how well each
   individual approach satisfies specific requirements.  The
   applicability statement document for each individual approach should
   document the results of this evaluation.

   In the context of provider-provisioned VPNs, there are two entities
   involved in operation of such services, the Provider and the
   Customer.  The Provider engages in a binding agreement with the
   Customer as to the behavior of the service in a normal situation as
   well as in exceptional situations.  Such agreement is known as
   Service Level Specification (SLS), which is part of the Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) established between the Provider and the Customer.

   A proper design of L2VPNs aids formulation of SLSes in that it
   provides means for proper separation between Customer Edge (CE) and
   Provider Edge (PE), allows proper execution of the SLS offer, and
   supports a flexible and rich set of capabilities.

   This document provides requirements from both the Provider's and the
   Customer's point of view.  It begins with common customer's and
   service provider's point of view, followed by a customer's

   perspective, and concludes with specific needs of an SP.  These
   requirements provide high-level L2VPN features expected by an SP in
   provisioning L2VPNs, which include SP requirements for security,
   privacy, manageability, interoperability, and scalability.

   The PE devices provide a logical interconnect such that a pair of CE
   devices appears to be connected by a single logical Layer 2 circuit.
   PE devices act as Layer 2 circuit switches.  Layer 2 circuits are
   then mapped onto tunnels in the SP network.  These tunnels can either
   be specific to a particular VPWS, or be shared among several
   services.  VPWS applies for all services, including Ethernet, ATM,
   Frame Relay, etc.  In Figure 1, L2VPN B represents a VPWS case.

   Each PE device is responsible for allocating customer Layer 2 frames
   to the appropriate VPWS and for proper forwarding to the intended
   destinations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20VPLS"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  VPLS</span>

   In case of VPLS, the PE devices provide a logical interconnect such
   that CE devices belonging to a specific VPLS appear to be connected
   by a single LAN.  End-to-end VPLS consists of a bridge module and a
   LAN emulation module ([<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>]).  A VPLS can contain a single VLAN
   or multiple VLANs ([<a href="#ref-IEEE_802.1Q" title='"Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks"'>IEEE_802.1Q</a>]).  A variation of this service is
   IPLS ([<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>]), which is limited to supporting only customer IP
   traffic.

   In a VPLS, a customer site receives Layer 2 service from the SP.  The
   PE is attached via an access connection to one or more CEs.  The PE
   performs forwarding of user data packets based on information in the
   Layer 2 header, such as a MAC destination address.  In Figure 1,
   L2VPN A represents a VPLS case.

   The details of VPLS reference model, which we summarize here, can be
   found in [<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>].  In VPLS, the PE can be viewed as containing a
   Virtual Switching Instance (VSI) for each L2VPN that it serves.  A CE
   device attaches, possibly through an access network, to a bridge
   module of a PE.  Within the PE, the bridge module attaches, through
   an Emulated LAN Interface to an Emulated LAN.  For each VPLS, there
   is an Emulated LAN instance.  The Emulated LAN consists of VPLS
   Forwarder module (one per PE per VPLS service instance) connected by
   pseudo wires (PW), where the PWs may be traveling through Packet
   Switched Network (PSN) tunnels over a routed backbone.  VSI is a
   logical entity that contains a VPLS forwarder module and part of the
   bridge module relevant to the VPLS service instance [<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>].
   Hence, the VSI terminates PWs for interconnection with other VSIs and
   also terminates Attachment Circuits (ACs) (see [<a href="rfc3985.html" title='"Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge- to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture"'>RFC3985</a>] for
   definition) for accommodating CEs.  A VSI includes the forwarding
   information base for an L2VPN [<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>] which is the set of
   information regarding how to forward Layer 2 frames received over the
   AC from the CE to VSIs in other PEs supporting the same L2VPN service
   (and/or to other ACs), and it contains information regarding how to
   forward Layer 2 frames received from PWs to ACs.  Forwarding
   information bases can be populated dynamically (such as by source MAC
   address learning) or statically (e.g., by configuration).  Each PE
   device is responsible for proper forwarding of the customer traffic
   to the appropriate destination(s) based on the forwarding information
   base of the corresponding VSI.

   This section contains requirements that apply to both the customer
   and the provider, or that are of an otherwise general nature.

   L2VPN protocols SHOULD NOT interfere with existing Layer 2 protocols
   and standards of the Layer 2 network the customer is managing.  If
   they impact customer Layer 2 protocols that are sent over the VPLS,
   then these impacts MUST be documented.

   Some possibly salient differences between VPLS and a real LAN are:

   - The reliability may likely be less, i.e., the probability that a
     message broadcast over the VPLS is not seen by one of the bridge
     modules in PEs is higher than in a true Ethernet.

   - VPLS frames can get duplicated if the PW sequencing option isn't
     turned on.  The data frames on the PWs are sent in IP datagrams,
     and under certain failure scenarios, IP networks can duplicate
     packets.  If the PW data transmission protocol does not ensure
     sequence of data packets, frames can be duplicated or received out
     of sequence.  If the customer's Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU)
     frames are sent as data packets, then BPDU frames can be duplicated
     or mis-sequenced, although this may not create any problems for
     Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RSTP).

   - Delayed delivery of packets (e.g., more than half a second), rather
     than dropping them, could have adverse effect on the performance of
     the service.

   - 802.3x Pause frames will not be transported over a VPLS, as the
     bridge module ([<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>]) in the PE terminates them.

   - Since the IPLS solution aims at transporting encapsulated traffic
     (rather than Layer 2 frames themselves), the IPLS solution is NOT
     REQUIRED to preserve the Layer 2 Header transparently from CE to
     CE.  For example, Source MAC address will probably not be preserved
     by the IPLS solution.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Traffic%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Traffic Types</span>

   A VPLS MUST support unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic.
   Support for efficient replication of broadcast and multicast traffic
   is highly desirable.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20Topology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Topology</span>

   A SP network may be realized using one or more network tunnel
   topologies to interconnect PEs, ranging from simple point-to-point to
   distributed hierarchical arrangements.  The typical topologies
   include:



<span class="grey">Augustyn &amp; Serbest           Informational                      [Page 8]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-9" id="page-9" name="page-9"> </a>

      - Point-to-point
      - Point-to-multipoint, a.k.a. hub and spoke
      - Any-to-any, a.k.a. full mesh
      - Mixed, a.k.a. partial mesh
      - Hierarchical

   Regardless of the SP topology employed, the service to the customers
   MUST retain the connectivity type implied by the type of L2VPN.  For
   example, a VPLS MUST allow multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity even
   if it is implemented with point-to-point circuits.  This requirement
   does not imply that all traffic characteristics (such as bandwidth,
   QoS, delay, etc.) necessarily be the same between any two end points
   of an L2VPN.  It is important to note that SLS requirements of a
   service have a bearing on the type of topology that can be used.

   To the extent possible, an L2VPN service SHOULD be capable of
   crossing multiple administrative boundaries.

   To the extent possible, the L2VPN services SHOULD be independent of
   access network technology.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.%20%20Isolated%20Exchange%20of%20Data%20and%20Forwarding%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" name="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Isolated Exchange of Data and Forwarding Information</span>

   L2VPN solutions SHALL define means that prevent CEs in an L2VPN from
   interaction with unauthorized entities.

   L2VPN solutions SHALL avoid introducing undesired forwarding
   information that could corrupt the L2VPN forwarding information base.

   A means to constrain or isolate the distribution of addressed data to
   only those VPLS sites determined either by MAC learning and/or
   configuration MUST be provided.

   The internal structure of an L2VPN SHOULD not be advertised or
   discoverable from outside that L2VPN.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.5.%20%20Security"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.5" name="section-5.5">5.5</a>.  Security</span>

   A range of security features MUST be supported by the suite of L2VPN
   solutions.  Each L2VPN solution MUST state which security features it
   supports and how such features can be configured on a per-customer
   basis.

   A number of security concerns arise in the setup and operation of an
   L2VPN, ranging from misconfigurations to attacks that can be launched
   on an L2VPN and can strain network resources such as memory space,
   forwarding information base table, bandwidth, and CPU processing.

   An L2VPN solution MUST provide traffic separation between different
   L2VPNs.

   In case of VPLS, VLAN Ids MAY be used as service delimiters.  When
   used in this manner, they MUST be honored and traffic separation MUST
   be provided.

   An L2VPN solution MUST support overlapping addresses of different
   L2VPNs.  For instance, customers MUST NOT be prevented from using the
   same MAC addresses with different L2VPNs.  If a service provider uses
   VLANs as service delimiters, the L2VPN solution MUST ensure that VLAN
   Ids cannot overlap.  If VLANs are not used as service delimiters,
   L2VPN solutions MAY allow VLAN Ids to overlap.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.7.%20%20Quality%20of%20Service"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.7" name="section-5.7">5.7</a>.  Quality of Service</span>

   To the extent possible, L2VPN QoS SHOULD be independent of the access
   network technology.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.7.1.%20%20QoS%20Standards"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.7.1" name="section-5.7.1">5.7.1</a>.  QoS Standards</span>

   As provided in [<a href="rfc3809.html" title='"Generic Requirements for Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN)"'>RFC3809</a>], an L2VPN SHALL be able to support QoS in
   one or more of the following already standardized modes:

   - Best Effort  (support mandatory for all provider-provisioned
                  VPN types)

   - Aggregate CE Interface Level QoS (i.e., 'hose' level)

   - Site-to-site, or 'pipe' level QoS

   Note that all cases involving QoS MAY require that the CE and/or PE
   perform shaping and/or policing.

   Mappings or translations of Layer 2 QoS parameters into PSN QoS
   (e.g., DSCPs or MPLS EXP field) as well as QoS mapping based on VC
   (e.g., FR/ATM or VLAN) MAY be performed in order to provide QoS
   transparency.  The actual mechanisms for these mappings or
   translations are outside the scope of this document.  In addition,
   the Diffserv support of underlying tunneling technologies (e.g.,
   [<a href="rfc3270.html" title='"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services"'>RFC3270</a>] or [<a href="rfc3308.html" title='"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) Differentiated Services Extension"'>RFC3308</a>]) and the Intserv model ([<a href="rfc2205.html" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1 Functional Specification"'>RFC2205</a>]) MAY be
   used.  As such, the L2VPN SLS requirements SHOULD be supported by
   appropriate core mechanisms.

   A service provider may desire to offer QoS service to a customer for
   at least the following generic service types: managed access VPN
   service or an edge-to-edge QoS service.  The details of the service
   models can be found in [<a href="rfc3809.html" title='"Generic Requirements for Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN)"'>RFC3809</a>] and in [<a href="rfc4031.html" title='"Service Requirements for Layer 3 Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs)"'>RFC4031</a>].

   In L2VPN service, both DSCP ([<a href="rfc2474.html" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>RFC2474</a>]) and 802.1p ([<a href="#ref-IEEE_802.1D" title='"Part 3: Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges"'>IEEE_802.1D</a>])

   The L2VPN service infrastructure SHOULD provide redundant paths to
   ensure high availability.  The reaction to failures SHOULD result in
   an attempt to restore the service using alternative paths.

   The intention is to keep the restoration time small.  The restoration
   time MUST be less than the time it takes the CE devices, or customer
   Layer 2 control protocols as well as Layer 3 routing protocols, to
   detect a failure in the L2VPN.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.10.%20%20CE-to-PE%20and%20PE-to-PE%20Link%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.10" name="section-5.10">5.10</a>.  CE-to-PE and PE-to-PE Link Requirements</span>

   The CE-to-PE links MAY be

   - direct physical links (e.g., 100BaseTX, and T1/E1 TDM),
   - logical links (e.g., ATM PVC, and <a href="rfc2427.html">RFC2427</a>-encapsulated link),
   - transport networks carrying Ethernet,
   - a Layer 2 tunnel that goes through a Layer 3 network (e.g., L2TP
     sessions).

   Layer 2 frames MAY be tunneled through a Layer 3 backbone from PE to
   PE, using one of a variety of tunneling technologies (e.g., IP-in-IP,

   Standard interfaces to manage L2VPN services MUST be provided (e.g.,
   standard SNMP MIB Modules).  These interfaces SHOULD provide access
   to configuration, verification and runtime monitoring protocols.

   Service management MAY include the TMN 'FCAPS' functionalities, as
   follows: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security,
   as detailed in [<a href="#ref-ITU_Y.1311.1" title='"Network Based IP VPN over MPLS architecture"'>ITU_Y.1311.1</a>].

   Multi-vendor interoperability, which corresponds to similar network
   and service levels among different implementations, at the network
   element SHOULD be guaranteed.  This will likely rely on the
   completeness of the corresponding standard.

   The technical solution MUST be multi-vendor interoperable, not only
   within the SP network infrastructure, but also with the customer's
   network equipment and services making use of the L2VPN service.

   A L2VPN solution SHOULD NOT preclude different access technologies.
   For instance, customer access connections to an L2VPN service MAY be
   different at different CE devices (e.g., Frame Relay, ATM, 802.1D,
   MPLS).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.13.%20%20Inter-working"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.13" name="section-5.13">5.13</a>.  Inter-working</span>

   Inter-working scenarios among different solutions providing L2VPN
   services are highly desirable.  It is possible to have cases that
   require inter-working or interconnection between customer sites,
   which span network domains with different L2VPN solutions or
   different implementations of the same approach.  Inter-working SHOULD
   be supported in a scalable manner.

   Inter-working scenarios MUST consider at least traffic isolation,
   security, QoS, access, and management aspects.  This requirement is
   essential in the case of network migration, to ensure service
   continuity among sites belonging to different portions of the
   network.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Customer%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Customer Requirements</span>

   Customers MAY require L2VPN service that spans multiple
   administrative domains or SP networks.  Therefore, an L2VPN service
   MUST be able to span multiple AS and SP networks but still to act and
   to appear as a single, homogeneous L2VPN from a customer point of
   view.

   A customer might also start with an L2VPN provided in a single AS
   with a certain SLS but then ask for an expansion of the service
   spanning multiple ASes and/or multiple-SPs.  In this case, as well as
   for all kinds of multi-AS and multiple-SP L2VPNs, L2VPN service
   SHOULD be able to deliver the same SLS to all sites in a VPN
   regardless of the AS/SP to which it homes.

   With the exception of IPLS, an L2VPN service SHOULD be agnostic to
   customer's Layer 3 traffic (e.g., IP, IPX, Appletalk) encapsulated
   within Layer 2 frames.



<span class="grey">Augustyn &amp; Serbest           Informational                     [Page 13]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4665.html">RFC 4665</a>            Service Requirements for L2VPNs       September 2006</span>


   IPLS MUST allow transport of customer's IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
   encapsulated within Layer 2 frames.  IPLS SHOULD also allow CEs to
   run ISIS and MPLS protocols transparently among them when those are
   used in conjunction with IP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.3.%20%20Quality%20of%20Service%20and%20Traffic%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" name="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Quality of Service and Traffic Parameters</span>

   QoS is expected to be an important aspect of an L2VPN service for
   some customers.

   A customer requires that the L2VPN service provide the QoS applicable
   to his or her application, which can range from PWs (e.g., SONET
   emulation) to voice, interactive video, and multimedia applications.
   Hence, best-effort as well as delay and loss sensitive traffic MUST
   be supported over an L2VPN service.  A customer application SHOULD
   experience consistent QoS independent of the access network
   technology used at different sites connected to the same L2VPN.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.4.%20%20Service%20Level%20Specification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.4" name="section-6.4">6.4</a>.  Service Level Specification</span>

   Most customers simply want their applications to perform well.  A SLS
   is a vehicle for a customer to measure the quality of the service
   that SP(s) provide.  Therefore, when purchasing a service, a customer
   requires access to the measures from the SP(s) that support the SLS.

   Standard interfaces to monitor usage of L2VPN services SHOULD be
   provided (e.g., standard SNMP MIB Modules).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.5.%20%20Security"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.5" name="section-6.5">6.5</a>.  Security</span>

   An L2VPN solution MUST provide traffic as well as forwarding
   information base isolation for customers similar to that obtained in
   private lines, FR, or ATM services.

   An L2VPN service MAY use customer VLAN Ids as service delimiters.  In
   that case, they MUST be honored, and traffic separation MUST be
   provided.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.5.2.%20%20Access%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.5.2" name="section-6.5.2">6.5.2</a>.  Access Control</span>

   An L2VPN solution MAY have the mechanisms to activate the appropriate
   filtering capabilities upon request of a customer.  For instance, MAC
   and/or VLAN filtering MAY be considered between CE and PE for a VPLS.

   An L2VPN solution MAY provide value-added security services such as
   encryption and/or authentication of customer packets, certificate
   management, and similar services.

   L2VPN services MUST NOT interfere with the security mechanisms
   employed at Layer 3 and higher layers by customers.  Layer 2 security
   mechanisms, such as 802.10b ([<a href="#ref-IEEE_802.10" title='"Standard for Interoperable LAN/MAN Security (SILS)"'>IEEE_802.10</a>]) and 802.1AE
   ([<a href="#ref-IEEE_802.1AE" title='"Draft Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks - Media Access Control (MAC) Security"'>IEEE_802.1AE</a>]), MAY inhibit L2VPN services, when the service
   delimiting VLAN Ids are encrypted.

   Every packet exchanged between the customer and the SP over the
   access connection MUST appear as it would on a private network
   providing an equivalent service to that offered by the L2VPN.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.6.1.%20%20Physical%2FLink%20Layer%20Technology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.6.1" name="section-6.6.1">6.6.1</a>.  Physical/Link Layer Technology</span>

   L2VPN solutions SHOULD support a broad range of physical and link-
   layer access technologies, such as PSTN, ISDN, xDSL, cable modem,
   leased line, Ethernet, Ethernet VLAN, ATM, Frame Relay, Wireless
   local loop, mobile radio access, etc.  The capacity and QoS
   achievable MAY be dependent on the specific access technology in use.

   Various types of physical connectivity scenarios MUST be supported,
   such as multi-homed sites, backdoor links between customer sites, and
   devices homed to two or more SP networks.  In case of VPLS, IEEE
   802.3ad-2000 link aggregation SHOULD be supported.  L2VPN solutions
   SHOULD support at least the types of physical or link-layer
   connectivity arrangements shown in Figures 2 - 4 (in addition to the
   case shown in Figure 1).  As in Figure 2, a CE can be dual-homed to
   an SP or to two different SPs via diverse access networks.

   instance.  Different L2VPN services MAY have different committed MTU
   sizes.  If the customer VLANs are used as service delimiters, all
   VLANs within a given VPLS MUST inherit the same MTU size.

   A VPLS MAY use IP fragmentation if it presents reassembled packets at
   VPLS customer edge devices.

   The L2VPN service MAY support translation of customers' AC
   identifiers (e.g., VLAN tags, if the customer VLANs are used as
   service delimiters).  Such service simplifies connectivity of sites
   that want to keep their AC assignments or sites that belong to
   different administrative domains.  In the latter case, the
   connectivity is sometimes referred to as Layer 2 extranet.  On the
   other hand, it should be noted that VLAN tag translation affects the
   support for multiple spanning trees (i.e., 802.1s [<a href="#ref-IEEE_802.1s" title='"Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks-Amendment 3: Multiple Spanning Trees"'>IEEE_802.1s</a>]) and
   can break the proper operation.

   The L2VPN service is intended to be transparent to Layer 2 customer
   networks.  An L2VPN solution SHOULD NOT require any special packet
   processing by the end users before sending packets to the provider's
   network.

   If VLAN Ids are assigned by the SP, then VLANs are not transparent.
   Transparency does not apply in this case, as it is the same as FR/ATM
   service model.

   Since the IPLS solution aims at transporting encapsulated traffic
   (rather than Layer 2 frames themselves), the IPLS solution MUST not
   alter the packets encapsulated inside Layer 2 frames that are
   transported by the IPLS.  However, the IPLS solution is NOT REQUIRED
   to preserve the Layer 2 header transparently from CE to CE.  For
   example, Source MAC address might not be preserved by the IPLS
   solution.  The IPLS solution MAY remove Layer 2 headers for transport
   over the backbone when those can be reconstructed on egress without
   compromising transport of encapsulated traffic.

   The L2VPN solution SHOULD allow transparent operation of Layer 2
   control protocols employed by customers.

   In case of VPLS, the L2VPN service MUST ensure that loops be
   prevented.  This can be accomplished with a loop-free topology or
   appropriate forwarding rules.  Control protocols such as Spanning
   Tree (STP) or similar protocols could be employed.  The L2VPN
   solution MAY use indications from customer Layer 2 control protocols,
   e.g., STP BPDU snooping, to improve the operation of a VPLS.

   An SP domain MUST be uniquely identified at least within the set of
   all interconnected SP networks when supporting an L2VPN that spans
   multiple SPs.  Ideally, this identifier SHOULD be globally unique
   (e.g., an AS number).

   An identifier for each L2VPN SHOULD be unique, at least within each
   SP's network, as it MAY be used in auto-discovery, management (e.g.,
   alarm and service correlation, troubleshooting, performance
   statistics collection), and signaling.  Ideally, the L2VPN identifier
   SHOULD be globally unique to support the case, where an L2VPN spans
   multiple SPs (e.g., [<a href="rfc2685.html" title='"Virtual Private Networks Identifier"'>RFC2685</a>]).  Globally unique identifiers
   facilitate the support of inter-AS/SP L2VPNs.

   Configuration of PE devices (i.e., U-PE and N-PE [<a href="rfc4664.html" title='"Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs)"'>RFC4664</a>]) is a
   significant task for an SP.  Solutions SHOULD provide methods that
   dynamically allow L2VPN information to be discovered by the PEs to
   minimize the configuration steps.

   Each device in an L2VPN SHOULD be able to determine which other
   devices belong to the same L2VPN.  Such a membership discovery scheme
   MUST prevent unauthorized access, and it allows authentication of the
   source.

   Distribution of L2VPN information SHOULD be limited to those devices
   involved in that L2VPN.  An L2VPN solution SHOULD employ discovery
   mechanisms to minimize the amount of operational information
   maintained by the SPs.  For example, if an SP adds or removes a
   customer port on a given PE, the remaining PEs SHOULD determine the
   necessary actions to take without the SP's having to explicitly
   reconfigure those PEs.

   A L2VPN solution SHOULD support the means for attached CEs to
   authenticate each other and to verify that the SP L2VPN is correctly
   connected.

   The mechanism SHOULD respond to L2VPN membership changes in a timely
   manner.  A "timely manner" is no longer than the provisioning
   timeframe, typically on the order of minutes, and MAY be as short as
   the timeframe required for "rerouting," typically on the order of
   seconds.

   Dynamically creating, changing, and managing multiple L2VPN
   assignments to sites and/or customers is another aspect of membership
   that MUST be addressed in an L2VPN solution.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.4.%20%20Quality%20of%20Service%20%28QoS%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.4" name="section-7.4">7.4</a>.  Quality of Service (QoS)</span>

   A significant aspect of a provider-provisioned VPN is support for
   QoS.  An SP has control over the provisioning of resources and
   configuration of parameters in at least the PE and P devices, and in
   some cases the CE devices as well.  Therefore, the SP is to provide
   either managed QoS access service, or edge-to-edge QoS service, as
   defined in [<a href="rfc4031.html" title='"Service Requirements for Layer 3 Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs)"'>RFC4031</a>].

   From a high level SP perspective, an L2VPN MUST isolate the exchange
   of traffic and forwarding information to only those sites that are
   authenticated and authorized members of an L2VPN.

   An L2VPN solution SHOULD provide a means for meeting provider-
   provisioned VPN QoS SLS requirements that isolates L2VPN traffic from
   the affects of traffic offered by non-VPN customers.  Also, L2VPN
   solutions SHOULD provide a means so that traffic congestion produced
   by sites as part of one L2VPN does not affect another L2VPN.

   The security requirements are stated in <a href="#section-6.5">Section 6.5</a>.  The security
   requirements provided in [<a href="rfc3809.html" title='"Generic Requirements for Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN)"'>RFC3809</a>] SHOULD be met.  The security
   requirements, except Layer 3 and higher-layer dependent ones,
   specified in [<a href="rfc4031.html" title='"Service Requirements for Layer 3 Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs)"'>RFC4031</a>], SHOULD be met.

   In addition, an SP network MUST be protected against malformed or
   maliciously constructed customer traffic.  This includes but is not
   limited to duplicate or invalid Layer 2 addresses, customer side
   loops, short/long packets, spoofed management packets, spoofed VLAN
   tags, high volume traffic.

   The SP network devices MUST NOT be accessible from any L2VPN, unless
   specifically authorized.  The devices in the SP network SHOULD
   provide some means of reporting intrusion attempts to the SP, if the
   intrusion is detected.

   When an L2VPN solution operates over a part of the Internet, it
   should support a configurable option to support one or more of the
   following standard IPsec methods for securing a customer's VPN
   traffic:

   - Confidentiality, so that only authorized devices can decrypt it

   - Integrity, to ensure that the data has not been altered

   - Authentication, to ensure that the sender is indeed who he or she
     claims to be

   - Replay attack prevention.

   The above functions SHOULD be applicable to "data traffic" of the
   customer, which includes the traffic exchanged between sites.  It
   SHOULD also be possible to apply these functions to "control
   traffic", such as routing or signaling protocol exchanges, that is
   not necessarily perceived by the customer but is nevertheless
   essential to maintain his or her VPN.

   Furthermore, such security methods MUST be configurable between
   different end-points, such as PE-PE and PE-MTU, only in the case
   where L2VPN data traffic is carried over IP [<a href="rfc4023.html" title='"Encapsulating MPLS in IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)"'>RFC4023</a>].  Methods to
   secure data flows at the native service layer (Layer-2), from CE-CE,
   CE-MTU and CE-PE, are outside the scope of this document.  It is also
   desirable to configure security on a per-VPN basis.

   A VPN solution MAY support one or more encryption schemes, including
   AES, and 3DES.  Encryption, decryption, and key management SHOULD be
   included in profiles as part of the security management system.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.7.%20%20Inter-AS%2FSP%20L2VPNs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.7" name="section-7.7">7.7</a>.  Inter-AS/SP L2VPNs</span>

   All applicable SP requirements, such as traffic and forwarding
   information isolation, SLSes, management, security, provisioning,
   etc.  MUST be preserved across adjacent ASes.  The solution MUST
   describe the inter-SP network interface, encapsulation method(s),
   routing protocol(s), and all applicable parameters.

   An L2VPN solution MUST provide the specifics of offering L2VPN
   services spanning multiple ASes and/or SPs.

   An L2VPN solution MUST support proper dissemination of operational
   parameters to all elements of an L2VPN service in the presence of
   multiple ASes and/or SPs.  A L2VPN solution MUST employ mechanisms
   for sharing operational parameters between different ASes.

   An L2VPN solution SHOULD support policies for proper selection of
   operational parameters coming from different ASes.  Similarly, an
   L2VPN solution SHOULD support policies for selecting information to
   be disseminated to different ASes.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.7.1.%20%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.7.1" name="section-7.7.1">7.7.1</a>.  Management</span>

   The general requirements for managing a single AS apply to a
   concatenation of ASes.  A minimum subset of such capabilities is the
   following:

   - Diagnostic tools

   - Secured access to one AS management system by another

   - Configuration request and status query tools

   - Fault notification and trouble tracking tools

   When an L2VPN spans multiple ASes, there is a need for a brokering
   mechanism that requests certain SLS parameters, such as bandwidth and
   QoS, from the other domains and/or networks involved in transferring
   traffic to various sites.  The essential requirement is that a
   solution MUST be able to determine whether a set of ASes can
   establish and guarantee uniform QoS in support of a provider-
   provisioned VPN.

   The architecture MUST support the possibility of one SP's offering
   L2VPN service to another SP.  One example is when one SP sells L2VPN
   service at wholesale to another SP, who then resells that L2VPN
   service to his or her customers.

   Connectivity between CE sites or PE devices in the backbone SHOULD be
   able to use a range of tunneling technologies, such as L2TP, GRE,
   IP-in-IP, MPLS, etc.

   Every PE MUST support a tunnel setup protocol, if tunneling is used.
   A PE MAY support static configuration.  If employed, a tunnel
   establishment protocol SHOULD be capable of conveying information,
   such as the following:

   - Relevant identifiers

   - QoS/SLS parameters

   - Restoration parameters

   - Multiplexing identifiers

   - Security parameters

   There MUST be a means to monitor the following aspects of tunnels:

   - Statistics, such as amount of time spent in the up and down state

   - Count of transitions between the up and down state

   - Events, such as transitions between the up and down states

   The tunneling technology used by the VPN SP and its associated
   mechanisms for tunnel establishment, multiplexing, and maintenance
   MUST meet the requirements on scaling, isolation, security, QoS,
   manageability, etc.

   Regardless of the tunneling choice, the existence of the tunnels and
   their operations MUST be transparent to the customers.

   The connectivity between PE and CE devices is referred to as an AC.
   ACs MAY span networks of other providers or public networks.

   There are several choices for implementing ACs.  Some popular choices
   include Ethernet, ATM (DSL), Frame Relay, MPLS-based virtual circuits
   etc.

   In case of VPLS, the AC MUST use Ethernet frames as the Service
   Protocol Data Unit (SPDU).

   A CE access connection over an AC MUST be bi-directional.

   PE devices MAY support multiple ACs on a single physical interface.
   In such cases, PE devices MUST NOT rely on customer controlled
   parameters for distinguishing between different access connections.
   For example, if VLAN tags were used for that purpose, the provider
   would be controlling the assignment of the VLAN tag values and would
   strictly enforce compliance by the CEs.

   An AC, whether direct or virtual, MUST maintain all committed
   characteristics of the customer traffic, such as QoS, priorities etc.
   The characteristics of an AC are only applicable to that connection.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.11.%20%20Backbone%20Networks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.11" name="section-7.11">7.11</a>.  Backbone Networks</span>

   Ideally, the backbone interconnecting the SP's PE and P devices
   SHOULD be independent of physical and link-layer technology.
   Nevertheless, the characteristics of backbone technology MUST be
   taken into account when specifying the QoS aspects of SLSes for VPN
   service offerings.

   In case network resources such as memory space, forwarding
   information base table, bandwidth, and CPU processing are shared
   between L2VPNs, the solution SHOULD guarantee availability of
   resources necessary to prevent any specific L2VPN service instance
   from taking up available network resources and causing others to

   - To facilitate use of PE and managed CE devices within a single SP
     network

   - To implement L2VPN services across two or more interconnected SP
     networks

   - To achieve inter-working or interconnection between customer sites
     using different L2VPN solutions or different implementations of the
     same approach

   Each approach MUST describe whether any of the above objectives can
   be met.  If an objective can be met, the approach MUST describe how
   such interoperability could be achieved.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.14.%20%20Testing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.14" name="section-7.14">7.14</a>.  Testing</span>

   The L2VPN solution SHOULD provide the ability to test and verify
   operational and maintenance activities on a per L2VPN service basis,
   and, in case of VPLS, on a per-VLAN basis if customer VLANs are used
   as service delimiters.

   The L2VPN solution SHOULD provide mechanisms for connectivity
   verification, and for detecting and locating faults.

   Examples of testing mechanisms are as follows:

   - Checking connectivity between "service-aware" network nodes

   - Verifying data plane and control plane integrity

   - Verifying service membership

   The provided mechanisms MUST satisfy the following: the connectivity
   checking for a given customer MUST enable the end-to-end testing of
   the data path used by that of customer's data packets, and the test
   packets MUST not propagate beyond the boundary of the SP network.

   To the extent possible, the IPLS solution SHOULD facilitate support
   of IPLS on existing PE devices that may be already deployed by the SP
   and MAY have been designed primarily for Layer 3 services.

   An SP desires to have a means to view the topology, operational
   state, and other parameters associated with each customer's L2VPN.
   Furthermore, the SP requires a means to view the underlying logical
   and physical topology, operational state, provisioning status, and
   other parameters associated with the equipment providing the L2VPN
   service(s) to its customers.  Therefore, the devices SHOULD provide
   standards-based interfaces (e.g., L2VPN MIB Modules), wherever
   feasible.

   The details of service provider management requirements for a Network
   Management System (NMS) in the traditional fault, configuration,
   accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) management categories
   can be found in [<a href="#ref-ITU_Y.1311.1" title='"Network Based IP VPN over MPLS architecture"'>ITU_Y.1311.1</a>].

   These requirements are driven by implementation characteristics that
   make service and SP requirements achievable.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.1.%20%20Control%20Plane%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.1" name="section-9.1">9.1</a>.  Control Plane Requirements</span>

   An L2VPN service SHOULD be provisioned with minimum number of steps.
   Therefore, the control protocols SHOULD provide methods for signaling
   between PEs.  The signaling SHOULD inform of membership, tunneling
   information, and other relevant parameters.

   The infrastructure MAY employ manual configuration methods to provide
   this type of information.

   The infrastructure SHOULD use policies to scope the membership and
   reachability advertisements for a particular L2VPN service.  A
   mechanism for isolating the distribution of reachability information
   to only those sites associated with an L2VPN MUST be provided.

   The control plane traffic increases with the growth of L2VPN
   membership.  Similarly, the control plane traffic increases with the
   number of supported L2VPN services.  The use of control plane
   resources MAY increase as the number of hosts connected to an L2VPN
   service grows.

   An L2VPN solution SHOULD minimize control plane traffic and the
   consumption of control plane resources.  The control plane MAY offer
   means for enforcing a limit on the number of customer hosts attached
   to an L2VPN service.

   An L2VPN solution SHOULD utilize the encapsulation techniques defined
   by PWE3 ([<a href="rfc3985.html" title='"Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge- to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture"'>RFC3985</a>]), and SHOULD not impose any new requirements on
   these techniques.

   An L2VPN solution SHOULD utilize the congestion avoidance techniques
   defined by PWE3 ([<a href="rfc3985.html" title='"Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge- to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture"'>RFC3985</a>]).

   A separate Broadcast Domain MUST be maintained for each VPLS.

   In addition to VPLS Broadcast Domains, an L2VPN service MAY honor
   customer VLAN Broadcast Domains, if customer VLANs are used as
   service delimiters.  In that case, the L2VPN solution SHOULD maintain
   a separate VLAN Broadcast Domain for each customer VLAN.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.2.4.%20%20Virtual%20Switching%20Instance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.2.4" name="section-9.2.4">9.2.4</a>.  Virtual Switching Instance</span>

   L2VPN PE devices MUST maintain a separate VSI per VPLS.  Each VSI
   MUST have capabilities to forward traffic based on customer's traffic
   parameters, such as MAC addresses, VLAN tags (if supported), etc. as
   well as local policies.

   L2VPN PE devices MUST have capabilities to classify incoming customer
   traffic into the appropriate VSI.

   Each VSI MUST have flooding capabilities for its Broadcast Domain to
   facilitate proper forwarding of Broadcast, Multicast, and Unknown
   Unicast customer traffic.

   A VPLS SHOULD derive all topology and forwarding information from
   packets originating at customer sites.  Typically, MAC address
   learning mechanisms are used for this purpose.  With IPLS, snooping
   of particular packets originating at customer sites and signaling
   might also be used.

   Dynamic population of the forwarding information base (e.g., via MAC
   address learning) MUST take place on a per VSI basis; i.e., in the
   context of a VPLS and, if supported, in the context of VLANs therein.

   Security considerations occur at several levels and dimensions within
   L2VPNs, as detailed within this document.

   The requirements based on security concerns and potential security
   hazards are detailed in <a href="#section-6.5">Section 6.5</a>.  Further details on security
   requirements are given from the customer and service provider
   perspectives in Sections <a href="#section-6.5">6.5</a> and <a href="#section-7.6">7.6</a>, respectively.  In an analogous
   manner, further detail on traffic and routing isolation requirements
   are given from the customer and service provider perspectives in
   Sections <a href="#section-5.4">5.4</a> and <a href="#section-7.5">7.5</a>, respectively.  Safeguards to protect network
   resources such as CPU, memory, and bandwidth are required in <a href="#section-7.12">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-7.12">7.12</a>.

   IPsec can also be applied after tunneling Layer 2 traffic to provide
   additional security.

   In the case where an L2VPN service is carried over IP [<a href="rfc4023.html" title='"Encapsulating MPLS in IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)"'>RFC4023</a>],
   traverses multiple SP networks and passes through an unsecured SP,
   POP, NAP, or IX, then security mechanisms MUST be employed.  These
   security mechanisms include encryption, authentication, and resource
   protection, as described in <a href="#section-5.5">section 5.5</a>.  For example, a provider
   should consider using both authentication and encryption for a tunnel
   used as part of an L2VPN that traverses another service provider's
   network.
