     <span class="h1">A Framework for DNSSEC Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements</span>

Abstract

   This document presents a framework to assist writers of DNS Security
   Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements, such as
   domain managers and zone operators on both the top level and
   secondary level, who are managing and operating a DNS zone with
   Security Extensions implemented.

   In particular, the framework provides a comprehensive list of topics
   that should be considered for inclusion into a DNSSEC Policy
   definition and Practice Statement.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Background</span>

   The Domain Name System (DNS) was not originally designed with strong
   security mechanisms to provide integrity and authenticity of its
   data.  Over the years, a number of vulnerabilities have been
   discovered that threaten the reliability and trustworthiness of the
   system.

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC, [<a href="rfc4033.html" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>],
   [<a href="rfc4034.html" title='"Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4034</a>], [<a href="rfc4035.html" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>]) address these vulnerabilities by using public
   key cryptography to add data origin authentication, data integrity
   verification, and authenticated denial-of-existence capabilities to
   the DNS.  In short, DNSSEC provides a way for software to verify the
   origin of DNS data and validate that it has not been modified in
   transit or by intermediaries.

   To provide a means for stakeholders to evaluate the strength and
   security of the DNSSEC chain of trust, an entity operating a DNSSEC-
   enabled zone may publish a DNSSEC Practice Statement (DPS),
   comprising statements describing critical security controls and
   procedures relevant for scrutinizing the trustworthiness of the
   system.  The DPS may also identify any of the DNSSEC Policies (DPs)
   it supports, explaining how it meets their requirements.

   The DP and DPS are not primarily aimed at users who rely on signed
   responses from the DNS ("relying parties"); instead, their audience
   is other stakeholders of the DNS infrastructure, a group that may
   include bodies such as regulatory authorities.

   Even though this document is heavily inspired by the "Internet X.509
   Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification
   Practices Framework" [<a href="rfc3647.html" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practices Framework"'>RFC3647</a>], with large parts being drawn from
   that document, the properties and structure of the DNSSEC trust model
   are fundamentally different from those of the X.509 Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20Purpose"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Purpose</span>

   The purpose of this document is twofold.  Firstly, the document
   explains the concepts of a DNSSEC Policy (DP) and of a DNSSEC
   Practice Statement (DPS), and it describes the relationship between
   the two.  Secondly, it presents a framework to encourage and assist
   writers of Policies and Practice Statements in creating consistent
   and comparable documents.  In particular, the framework identifies
   the elements that should be considered in formulating a DP or a DPS.

   Statement, nor does it seek to provide legal advice or

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Scope</span>

   The scope of this document is limited to discussion of the topics
   that can be covered in a DP or a DPS, but it does not go into the
   specific details that could possibly be included in either a DP or a
   DPS.  In particular, this document describes the types of information
   that should be considered for inclusion in them.

   This framework should be viewed and used as a checklist of factors
   that ought be taken into consideration prior to deploying DNSSEC, and
   as an outline to create an operational practices disclosure document.
   As such, it focuses on the topics affected by the introduction of
   DNSSEC into a zone.  Other aspects, such as the operations of name
   servers and registry systems, are considered out of scope.  The
   framework is primarily aimed at Top-Level Domain (TLD) managers and
   organizations providing registry services, but it may be used by
   high-value domain holders and so serve as a checklist for DNSSEC
   readiness at a high level.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the general
   concepts of DNS, DNSSEC, and PKI.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Definitions</span>

   This document makes use of the following defined terms:

   Audit logs:  Control evidence information to prove the integrity of
      processes.  This may be generated by DNS and DNSSEC-related
      systems, supplied by the surrounding facility, or obtained from
      manually generated, non-electronic documentation.  Audit logs will
      be examined by the internal and/or external auditors.

   Activation data:  Data values, other than keys, required to operate
      the cryptographic modules used to protect the keys from
      unauthorized use.

   Chain of trust:  A hierarchical structure of trust consisting of DNS
      keys, signatures, and delegation signer records that, when
      validated in a series, can provide proof of authenticity of the
      last element in the chain, providing that the first element is
      trusted.  Usually, the first element is a trust anchor.

   Compromise (key compromise):  Key compromise is a situation where the
      private component of a signing key is lost, stolen, exposed,
      modified, or used in an unauthorized manner.  More strictly, even
      a suspicion that one of these has occurred will be enough to be
      considered as key compromise.

   DNS:  The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical global naming
      catalog for computers, services, or any resource connected to the
      Internet.

   DNS zone:  A portion of the global Domain Name System (DNS) namespace
      for which administrative responsibility has been delegated.

   DNSSEC:  DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a set of IETF
      specifications [<a href="rfc4033.html" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>] [<a href="rfc4034.html" title='"Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4034</a>] [<a href="rfc4035.html" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>] that uses public key
      cryptography to add data origin authentication, data integrity
      verification, and authenticated denial of existence capabilities
      to DNS.

   DNSSEC Policy:  A DNSSEC Policy (DP) sets forth the security
      requirements and standards to be implemented for a DNSSEC-signed
      zone.

   DNSSEC Practice Statement:  A DNSSEC Practice Statement (DPS) is a
      practices disclosure document that may support and be a
      supplemental document to the DNSSEC Policy (if such exists), and
      it states how the management of a given zone implements procedures
      and controls at a high level.

   Key rollover:  An operational process to change one of the DNSSEC
      keys used for signing a zone via distribution of public keys in a
      trusted manner.

   Multi-person control:  A security concept to distribute the authority
      of an operation over multiple persons, to mitigate threats caused
      by a single authorized individual.  For example, a key recovery
      function may require some number of authorized individuals (m) out
      of the (n) to whom a portion of the recovery key was distributed,
      to combine their key fragments, before key recovery can occur.

   PKI:  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a concept that makes use of
      asymmetric cryptography to provide a system with integrity,
      authentication, and confidentiality and to do it via distribution
      of public keys in a trusted manner.

   Policy authority:  The body responsible for setting and administering
      a DNSSEC Policy and for determining whether a DPS is suitable for
      that Policy.

   Relying party:  An entity that relies on a signed response from the
      DNS.

   Repository:  A location on the Internet to store DP, DPS, trust
      anchors, and other related information that should be kept public.

   Security posture:  A security posture is an indicator of how secure
      an entity is and how secure the entity should be.  It is the
      result of an adequate threat model and risk assessment.

   Separation of duties:  A security concept that limits the influence
      of a single person by segregating roles and responsibilities.

   Signing key:  Private component of an asymmetric key pair that is
      used for signing of resource records within the zone.  Note that
      the other component, called public key, is used for signature
      validation.

   TLD:  A Top-Level Domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest
      level below the root in the hierarchy of the DNS.

   Trust anchor:  Public portion of a key pair that is the authoritative
      entity used to authenticate the first element in a chain of trust.

   DNSSEC Practice Statement.  Other related concepts are described as
   well.

   A DNSSEC Policy (DP) sets forth requirements that are appropriate for
   a specified level of assurance.  For example, a DP may encompass all
   topics of this framework, each with a certain set of security
   requirements, possibly grouped according to impact.  The progression
   from medium to high levels of assurance would correspond to
   increasing security requirements and corresponding increasing levels
   of assurance.

   A DP also constitutes a basis for an audit, accreditation, or another
   assessment of an entity.  Each entity can be assessed against one or
   more DPs that it claims to implement.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20DNSSEC%20Practice%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  DNSSEC Practice Statement</span>

   Most zone managers using DNSSEC will not have the need to create a
   thorough and detailed statement of practices.  For example, a
   registrant may be the sole relying party of its own zone and would
   already be aware of the nature and trustworthiness of its services.
   In other cases, a zone manager may provide registration services with
   only a very low level of assurances where the domain names being
   secured may pose only marginal risks if compromised.  Publishing a
   DPS is most relevant for entities operating a zone that contains a
   significant number of delegations to other entities.

   A DNSSEC Practice Statement (DPS) should contain information that is
   relevant to the stakeholders of the relevant zone(s).  Since these
   generally include the Internet community, it should not contain such
   information that could be considered to be sensitive details of an
   entity's operations.

   A DNSSEC Practice Statement may identify a supported DP, which may
   subsequently be used by a relying party to evaluate the
   trustworthiness of any digital signatures verified using the public
   key of that entity.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Relationship%20between%20DNSSEC%20Policy%20and%20Practice%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Relationship between DNSSEC Policy and Practice Statement</span>

   A DNSSEC Policy and a DNSSEC Practice Statement address the same set
   of topics of interest to the stakeholders in terms of the level of
   confidence ascribed to the security posture of a zone.  The primary
   difference is in the focus of their provisions.  A Policy sets forth
   the requirements and standards to be implemented for a DNSSEC-signed
   zone, and may be used to communicate requirements that must be met by
   complying parties; as such, it may also be used to determine or
   establish equivalency between policies associated with different
   zones.  A Practice Statement, by contrast, describes how a zone
   operator (and possibly other participants in the management of a
   given zone) implements procedures and controls to meet the
   requirements of applicable Policies.  In other words, the Policy says
   what needs to be done, and the Practice Statement says what is being
   done.

   An additional difference between a Policy and a Practice Statement
   relates to the scope of coverage of the two kinds of documents, in
   terms of its applicability.  A Policy may apply to multiple




<span class="grey">Ljunggren, et al.             Informational                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6841.html">RFC 6841</a>                      DPS framework                 January 2013</span>


   organizations or multiple zones.  By contrast, a Practice Statement
   would usually apply only to a single zone operator or a single
   organization, since it describes the actual controls in place that
   meet the requirements of applicable Policy.

   For example, a TLD manager or regulatory authority may define
   requirements in a Policy for the operation of one or more zones.  The
   Policy will be a broad statement of the general requirements for
   managing the zone.  A zone operator may be required to write its own
   Practice Statement to support the Policy, explaining how it meets the
   requirements of the Policy.  Alternatively, a zone operator that is
   also the manager of that zone, and not governed by any external
   Policy, may still choose to disclose operational practices by
   publishing a DPS.  The zone operator might do so to provide
   transparency and to gain community trust in its operations.

   A Policy and a Practice Statement also differ in the level of detail
   each expresses: although there may be variations, a Practice
   Statement will provide a description of procedures and controls and
   so will usually be more detailed than a Policy, which provides
   general principles.

   The main differences between a Policy and Practice Statement can be
   summarized as follows:

   (a)  Operation of a DNS zone with DNSSEC may be governed by a Policy
        that establishes requirements stating what the entity operating
        that zone must do.  An entity can use a Practice Statement to
        disclose how it meets the requirements of a Policy or how it has
        implemented critical processes and controls, absent a
        controlling Policy.

   (b)  A Policy may serve the purpose of establishing a common basis of
        trusted operation throughout a set of zones in the DNS
        hierarchy.  By contrast, a Practice Statement is a statement of
        a single zone operator or organization.

   (c)  A Practice Statement is generally more detailed than a Policy
        and specifies how the zone operator or organization implements
        critical processes and controls, and how the entity meets any
        requirements specified in the one or more Policies under which
        it operates DNSSEC.

   A set of provisions is a collection of Policy requirements or
   Practice Statements, which may employ the approach described in this
   framework by covering the topics appearing in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> below.  The
   topics are described in detail in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   A Policy can be expressed as a single set of provisions.  A Practice
   Statement can also be expressed as a single set of provisions with
   each component addressing the requirements of one or more Policies.
   Alternatively, it could be a set of provisions that do not reference
   any particular policy but instead describe a set of self-imposed
   controls to the stakeholders.  For example, a Practice Statement
   could be expressed as a combination of the following:

   (a)  a list of Policies supported by the DPS;

   (b)  for each Policy in (a), a set of provisions that contains
        statements addressing the requirements by filling in details not
        stipulated in that policy or expressly left to the discretion of
        the implementer.  Such statements serve to show how this
        particular Practice Statement implements the requirements of the
        particular Policy; or

   (c)  a set of provisions that contains statements regarding the
        DNSSEC operations practices, independent of any Policy.

   The statements provided in (b) may augment or refine the stipulations
   of an applicable Policy, but generally they must not conflict with
   the stipulations.  In certain cases, however, a Policy authority may
   permit exceptions because certain compensating controls of the entity
   disclosed in its Practice Statement allow it to provide a level of
   assurance equivalent to full compliance with the policy.

   The framework outlines the contents of a set of provisions, in terms
   of eight primary components, as follows:

   1.  Introduction

   2.  Publication and Repositories

   3.  Operational Requirements

   4.  Facility, Management, and Operational Controls

   5.  Technical Security Controls

   6.  Zone Signing

   This component describes non-technical security controls (i.e.,
   physical, procedural, and personnel) in use by the entity to securely
   perform the DNSSEC related functions.  Such controls include physical
   access, key management, disaster recovery, auditing, and archiving.

   These non-technical security controls are critical for trusting the
   DNSSEC signatures, since lack of security may compromise DNSSEC
   operations.  For example, it could result in the creation of
   signatures with erroneous information or in the compromise of the
   signing key.

   Within each subcomponent, separate consideration will usually need to
   be given to each entity type.

   This subcomponent describes requirements relating to notification and
   recovery procedures in the event of compromise or disaster.  Each of
   the following may need to be addressed separately:

   o  Identification or listing of the applicable incident and
      compromise reporting and handling procedures, which may include
      the investigation of measures to prevent the event from
      reoccurring.

   o  The recovery procedures used if computing resources, software,
      and/or data are corrupted or suspected to have been corrupted.
      These procedures describe how, and under what circumstances,
      operations of the system are to be suspended; how and when normal
      operations are resumed; how the stakeholders are to be informed;
      and how to assess the damage and carry out the root cause
      analysis.

   o  The recovery procedures used if any keys are compromised.  These
      procedures describe how a secure environment is re-established,
      how the keys are rolled over, how a new trust anchor is provided
      to the community (if applicable), and how new zone information is
      published.

   o  The entity's capabilities to ensure business continuity following
      a natural or other disaster.  Such capabilities may include the
      availability of a disaster recovery site at which operations may
      be recovered.  They may also include procedures for securing its
      facility during the period of time following a natural or other
      disaster and before a secure environment is re-established, either
      at the original site or at a disaster recovery site, for example,
      procedures to protect against theft of sensitive materials from an

   3.  How are the zone's public keys provided securely to the parent
       zone and potential relying parties?

   4.  Who generates the public key parameters.  Is the quality of the
       parameters checked during key generation?

   5.  For what purposes may the keys be used, and/or for what purposes
       should usage of the key be restricted?

   1.   What standards, if any, are required for the cryptographic
        module used to generate the keys?  A cryptographic module can be
        composed of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination of
        them.  For example, are the zone's signatures required to be
        generated using modules compliant with the US FIPS 140-2
        [<a href="#ref-FIPS-140-2" title='"Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules"'>FIPS-140-2</a>] standard?  If so, what is the required FIPS 140-2
        level of the module?  Are there any other engineering or other
        controls relating to a cryptographic module, such as the
        identification of the cryptographic module boundary, input/
        output, roles and services, finite state machine, physical
        security, software security, operating system security,
        algorithm compliance, electromagnetic compatibility, and self
        tests?

   2.   Is the private key under m of n multi-person control?  If yes,
        provide m and n (two-person control is a special case of m of n,
        where m = 2 and n &gt;= 2).

   3.   Is the private key escrowed?  If so, who is the escrow agent, in
        what form is the key escrowed (e.g., plaintext, encrypted, split
        key), and what are the security controls on the escrow system?

   4.   Is the private key backed up?  If so, who is the backup agent,
        in what form is the key backed up (e.g., plaintext, encrypted,
        split key), and what are the security controls on the backup
        system?

   5.   Is the private key archived?  If so, who is the archival agent,
        in what form is the key archived (e.g. plaintext, encrypted,
        split key), and what are the security controls on the archival
        system?

   6.   Under what circumstances, if any, can a private key be
        transferred into or from a cryptographic module?  Who is
        permitted to perform such a transfer operation?  In what form is
        the private key during the transfer (e.g., plaintext, encrypted,
        or split key)?

   7.   How is the private key stored in the module (e.g., plaintext,
        encrypted, or split key)?

   8.   Who can activate (use) the private key?  What actions must be
        performed to activate the private key (e.g., login, power on,
        supply PIN, insert token/key, automatic, etc.)?  Once the key is
        activated, is the key active for an indefinite period, active
        for one time, or active for a defined time period?

   9.   Who can deactivate the private key and how?  Examples of methods
        of deactivating private keys include logging out, turning the
        power off, removing the token/key, automatic deactivation, and
        time expiration.

   10.  Who can destroy the private key and how?  Examples of methods of
        destroying private keys include token surrender, token
        destruction, and zeroizing the key.

   Other aspects of key management need to be considered for the zone
   operator and other participants.  For each of these types of
   entities, the following questions may need to be answered:

   1.  What are the life cycle states for the management of any signing
       keys?

   2.  What is the operational period of these keys?  What are the usage
       periods or active lifetimes for the pairs?

   Activation data refers to data values other than whole private keys
   that are required to operate private keys or cryptographic modules
   containing private keys, such as a PIN, passphrase, or portions of a
   private key used in a key-splitting scheme.  Protection of activation
   data prevents unauthorized use of the private key and potentially
   needs to be considered for the zone operator and other participants.
   Such a consideration may need to address the entire life cycle of the
   activation data from generation through archival and destruction.
   For each of the entity types, all of the questions listed in Sections
   4.5.1 through 4.5.3 potentially need to be answered with respect to
   activation data rather than with respect to keys.

   To prove the compliance with a Policy or the statements in the
   Practice Statement, a compliance audit can be conducted.  This
   component describes how the audit is to be conducted at the zone
   operator and, possibly, at other involved entities.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.7.1.%20%20Frequency%20of%20Entity%20Compliance%20Audit"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.7.1" name="section-4.7.1">4.7.1</a>.  Frequency of Entity Compliance Audit</span>

   This subcomponent describes the frequency of the compliance audit.

   specific association or that they have certain certifications.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.7.3.%20%20Auditor%27s%20Relationship%20to%20Audited%20Party"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.7.3" name="section-4.7.3">4.7.3</a>.  Auditor's Relationship to Audited Party</span>

   This subcomponent is used to clarify the relationship between the
   auditor and the entity being audited.  This becomes important if
   there are any requirements or guidelines for the selection of the
   auditor.

   Topics covered by audit depends on the scope of the audit.  Since the
   DNSSEC Policy and Practice Statement is the document to be audited
   against, it is ideal to set the scope of the audit to the scope of
   the DP/DPS.  However, the scope may be narrowed down or expanded as
   needed, for example, if there are not enough resources to conduct a
   full audit or if some portion is under development and not ready for
   the audit.

   The introduction of DNSSEC into a zone may have legal implications.
   Consequently, it may be appropriate to declare the legal status of
   the binding embodied in the DNSSEC digital signatures and to clarify
   on any limitations of liability asserted by the registry manager.

   In most cases, the DPS is not a contract or part of a contract;
   instead, it is laid out so that its terms and conditions are applied
   to the parties by separate documents, such as registrar or registrant
   agreements.  In other cases, its contents may form part of a legal
   contract between parties (either directly or via other agreements).
   In this case, legal expertise should be consulted when drawing up
   sections of the document that may have contractual implications.

   At a minimum, the Legal Matters section should indicate under what
   jurisdiction the registry is operated and provide references to any
   associated agreements that are in force.  It may also be appropriate
   to inform of any identified implications on the protection of
   personally identifiable private information.

   This section contains a recommended outline for a set of provisions,
   intended to serve as a checklist or a standard template for use by DP
   or DPS writers.  Such a common outline will facilitate:

   (a)  Comparison of a DPS with a DP to ensure that the DPS faithfully
        implements the policy.

   (b)  Comparison of two DPSs.

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of this document is structured so that it provides guidance
   for each corresponding component and subcomponent of the outline.

   The sensitivity of the information protected by DNSSEC at different
   tiers in the DNS tree varies significantly.  In addition, there are
   no restrictions as to what types of information (i.e., DNS records)
   that can be protected using DNSSEC.  Each relying party must evaluate
   its own environment and the chain of trust originating from a trust
   anchor, the associated threats and vulnerabilities, to determine the
   level of risk it is willing to accept when relying on DNSSEC-
   protected objects.
