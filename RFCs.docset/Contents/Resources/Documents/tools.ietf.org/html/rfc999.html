                                 Protocol

   This document is a description of, and a specification for, the NETBLT
   protocol.  It is a revision of the specification published in <a href="rfc969.html">RFC-969</a>.
   NETBLT (NETwork BLock Transfer) is a transport level protocol intended
   for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.
   It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is
   designed to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.
   Although NETBLT currently runs on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), it
   should be able to operate on top of any datagram protocol similar in
   function to IP. This document is published for discussion and comment,
   and does not constitute a standard.  The proposal may change and certain
   parts of the protocol have not yet been specified; implementation of this
   document is therefore not advised.  Obsoletes  <a href="rfc969.html">RFC-969</a>.

   This memo is an official status report on the network numbers used in
   the Internet community.  As of 1-Mar-87 the Network Information Center
   (NIC) at SRI International has assumed responsibility for assignment of
   Network Numbers and Autonomous System Numbers.  This RFC documents the
   current assignments of these numbers at the time of this transfer of
   responsibility.   Obsoletes <a href="rfc990.html">RFC-990</a>, 960, 943, 923 and 900.

   covers the services and protocols required to achieve such interconnection.
   This Protocol is positioned with respect to other related standards by
   the layers defined in the Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection
   (ISO 7498) and by the structure defined in the Internal Organization of the
   Network Layer (DIS 8648).  In particular, it is a protocol of the Network
   Layer.  This Protocol permits End Systems and Intermediate Systems to
   exchange configuration and routing information to facilitate the operation
   of the routing and relaying functions of the Network Layer.

                                 Procedures

   This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the Internet community and
   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This RFC is the
   outgrowth of a series of IAB Privacy Task Force meetings and of internal
   working papers distributed for those meetings.  This RFC defines message
   encipherment and authentication procedures, as the initial phase of an
   effort to provide privacy enhancement services for electronic mail
   transfer in the Internet. It is intended that the procedures defined
   here be compatible with a wide range of key management approaches,
   including both conventional (symmetric) and public-key (asymmetric)
   approaches for encryption of data encrypting keys.  Use of conventional

                                 Personal Computers

   This document is a preliminary discussion of the design of a
   personal-computer-based distributed mail system.  Pcmail is a
   distributed mail system that provides mail service to an arbitrary
   number of users, each of which owns one or more personal computers
   (PCs).  The system is divided into two halves.  The first consists of a
   single entity called the "repository".  The repository is a storage
   center for incoming mail.  Mail for a Pcmail user can arrive externally
   from the Internet or internally from other repository users.  The
   repository also maintains a stable copy of each user's mail state.  The
   repository is therefore typically a computer with a large amount of disk
   storage. It is published for discussion and comment, and does not
   constitute a standard.  As the proposal may change, implementation of
   this document is not advised.   See <a href="rfc993.html">RFC-993</a>.

   This memo describes a proposed protocol standard for the ARPA Internet
   community.  The CCITT and the ISO have defined various session,
   presentation, and application recommendations which have been adopted by
   the international community and numerous vendors.  To the largest extent
   possible, it is desirable to offer these higher level services directly
   in the ARPA Internet, without disrupting existing facilities.  This
   permits users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications which
   previously were not available in the ARPA Internet.  The intention is
   that hosts in the ARPA-Internet that choose to implement ISO TSAP
   services on top of the TCP be expected to adopt and implement this
   standard.  Suggestions for improvement are encouraged.

   The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular problem
   in the ARPA-Internet and possible methods of solution.  Most prior work
   on congestion in datagram systems focuses on buffer management.  In this
   memo the case of a packet switch with infinite storage is considered.
   Such a packet switch can never run out of buffers.  It can, however,
   still become congested.  The meaning of congestion in an
   infinite-storage system is explored.  An unexpected result is found that
   shows a datagram network with infinite storage, first-in-first-out
   queuing, at least two packet switches, and a finite packet lifetime
   will, under overload, drop all packets.  By attacking the problem of
   congestion for the infinite-storage case, new solutions applicable to
   switches with finite storage may be found.  No proposed solutions this
   document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet at this time.

                                 Synchronization

   This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in the
   ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  One of the services frequently neglected in computer
   network design is a high-quality, time-of-day clock capable of
   generating accurate timestamps with small errors compared to one-way
   network delays.  Such a service would be useful for tracing the progress
   of complex transactions, synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring
   network performance and isolating problems.  In this memo one such clock
   service design will be described and its performance assessed.  This
   design has been incorporated as an integral part of the network routing
   and control protocols of the Distributed Computer Network (DCnet)
   architecture.

   This RFC discussed clock synchronization algorithms for the
   ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  The recent interest within the Internet community in
   determining accurate time from a set of mutually suspicious network
   clocks has been prompted by several occasions in which errors were found
   in usually reliable, accurate clock servers after thunderstorms which
   disrupted their power supply.  To these sources of error should be added
   those due to malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator
   mistakes, as well as random errors in the mechanism used to set and
   synchronize clocks.  This report suggests a stochastic model and
   algorithms for computing a good estimator from time-offset samples
   measured between clocks connected via network links.  Included in this
   report are descriptions of certain experiments which give an indication
   of the effectiveness of the algorithms.

                                 Transaction Processing Applications

   The DoD Internet protocol suite includes two alternative transport
   service protocols, TCP and UDP, which provide virtual circuit and
   datagram service, respectively.  These two protocols represent points in
   the space of possible transport service attributes which are quite "far
   apart".  We want to examine an important class of applications, those
   which perform what is often called "transaction processing".  We will
   see that the communication needs for these applications fall into the
   gap "between" TCP and UDP -- neither protocol is very appropriate.
   This RFC is concerned with the possible design of one or more new
   protocols for the ARPA-Internet, to support kinds of applications which
   are not well supported at present.  The RFC is intended to spur

   This RFC describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which allows a
   diskless client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a
   server host, and the name of a file to be loaded into memory and
   executed.  The bootstrap operation can be thought of as consisting of
   TWO PHASES.  This RFC describes the first phase, which could be labeled
   `address determination and bootfile selection'.  After this address and
   filename information is obtained, control passes to the second phase of
   the bootstrap where a file transfer occurs.  The file transfer will
   typically use the TFTP protocol, since it is intended that both phases
   reside in PROM on the client.  However BOOTP could also work with other
   protocols such as SFTP or FTP.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol
   for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions

   This memo discusses the utility of "subnets" of Internet networks, which
   are logically visible sub-sections of a single Internet network.  For

   divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a
   set of Internet network numbers.  This memo specifies procedures for the
   use of subnets.  These procedures are for hosts (e.g., workstations).
   The procedures used in and between subnet gateways are not fully
   described.  Important motivation and background information for a
   subnetting standard is provided in <a href="rfc940.html">RFC-940</a>.  This RFC specifies a

   Many systems provide a mechanism for finding out where a user is logged
   in from usually including information about telephone extension and
   office occupants names.  The information is useful for physically
   locating people and/or calling them on the phone.  In 1982 CMU designed
   and implemented a terminal location database and modified existing
   network software to handle a 64-bit number called the Terminal Location
   Number (or TTYLOC).  It now seems appropriate to incorporate this
   mechanism into the TCP-based network protocol family.  The mechanism is
   not viewed as a replacement for the Terminal Location Telnet Option
   (SEND-LOCATION) but as a shorthand mechansim for communicating terminal

   Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected to the
   Internet via a gateway.  The details of the internal connectivity are of
   little interest to the rest of the Internet.  One way of organizing
   these local complexes of links is to use the same strategy as the
   Internet uses to organize networks, that is, to declare each link to be
   an entity (like a network) and to interconnect the links with devices
   that perform routing functions (like gateways).  This general scheme is
   called subnetting, the individual links are called subnets, and the
   connecting devices are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).
   This RFC discusses standardizing the protocol used in subnetted
   environments in the ARPA-Internet.

                                 Scheme

   There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use of a
   single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical
   networks under common administration which are reachable from the rest
   of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes allow a simplified view
   of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and gateways outside of
   this collection.  They allow the complexity of the number and  type of
   these networks, and routing to them, to be localized.  Additions and
   changes in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no
   interruption of service, due to slow propagation of routing and other
   information outside of the local environment.  These schemes also
   simplify the administration of the network, as changes do not require
   allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed.  This
   proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been in use at
   the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984.  This RFC
   suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and
   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

                                 Encapsulation

   This memo concerns itself with message forwarding.  Forwarding can be
   thought of as encapsulating one or more messages inside another.
   Although this is useful for transfer of past correspondence to new
   recipients, without a decapsulation process (which this memo terms
   "bursting"), the forwarded messages are of little use to the recipients
   because they can not be distributed, forwarded, replied-to, or otherwise
   processed as separate individual messages. In order to burst a message
   it is necessary to know how the component messages were encapsulated in
   the draft.  At present there is no unambiguous standard for interest
   group digests.  This RFC proposes a proposed protocol for the
   ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.

   The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as one
   Internet network has generated some interest and concern.  It is
   inappropriate to give each LAN within an site a distinct Internet
   network number.  It is desirable to hide the details of the
   interconnections between the LANs within an site from people, gateways,
   and hosts outside the site.  The question arises on how to best do this,
   and even how to do it at all.  In <a href="rfc917.html">RFC-917</a> Jeffery Mogul makes a case for
   the use of "explicit subnets" in a multi-LAN environment.  The explicit
   subnet scheme is a call to recursively apply the mechanisms the Internet
   uses to manage networks to the problem of managing LANs within one
   network.  In this note I urge another approach: the use of "transparent
   subnets" supported by a multi-LAN extension of the Address Resolution
   Protocol.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

   This RFC suggests a method for workstations to dynamically find their
   protocol address (e.g., their Internet Address), when they know only
   their hardware address (e.g., their attached physical network address).
   This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community,
   and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

   The purpose of this memo is to explain how protocol standards are
   adopted for the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research community.  There
   are three important aspects to be discussed:  the process, the
   authority, and the complex relationship between the DARPA community and
   the DDN community.  This memo is a policy statement on how protocols
   become official standards for the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research
   community.  This is an official policy statement of the ICCB and the
   DARPA.
