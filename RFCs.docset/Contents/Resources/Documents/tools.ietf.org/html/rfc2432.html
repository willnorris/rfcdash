Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to define terminology specific to the
   benchmarking of multicast IP forwarding devices. It builds upon the
   tenets set forth in <a href="rfc1242.html">RFC 1242</a>, <a href="rfc2285.html">RFC 2285</a>, and other IETF Benchmarking
   Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts.  This document seeks to
   extend these efforts to the multicast paradigm.

   The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking
   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents. The
   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms.
   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect
   the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Network forwarding devices are being required to take a single frame
   and support delivery to a number of destinations having membership to
   a particular group. As such, multicast support may place a different
   burden on the resources of these network forwarding devices than with
   unicast or broadcast traffic types.

   Such burdens may not be readily apparent at first glance - the IP
   multicast packet's Class D address may be the only noticeable
   difference from an IP unicast packet.  However, there are many
   factors that may impact the treatment of IP multicast packets.

   Consider how a device's architecture may impact the handling of a
   multicast frame.  For example, is the multicast packet subject to the
   same processing as its unicast analog?  Or is the multicast packet
   treated as an exeception and processed on a different data path?



<span class="grey">Dubray                       Informational                      [Page 1]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-2" id="page-2" name="page-2"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2432.html">RFC 2432</a>       Terminology for IP Multicast Benchmarking    October 1998</span>


   Consider, too, how a shared memory architecture may demonstrate a
   different performance profile than an architecture which explicitly
   passes each individual packet between the processing entities.

   In addition to forwarding device architecture, there are other
   factors that may impact a device's or system's multicast related
   performance.  Protocol requirements may demand that routers and
   switches consider destination and source addressing in its multicast
   forwarding decisions.  Capturing multicast source/destination
   addressing information may impact forwarding table size and lengthen
   lookups.  Topological factors such as the degree of packet
   replication, the number of multicast groups being supported by the
   system, or the placement of multicast packets in unicast wrappers to
   span non-multicast network paths may all potentially affect a
   system's multicast related performance. For an overall understanding
   of IP multicasting, the reader is directed to [<a href="#ref-Se98" title='"Introduction to IP Multicast Routing."'>Se98</a>], [<a href="#ref-Hu95" title='"Routing in the Internet."'>Hu95</a>], and
   [<a href="#ref-Mt98" title='"Deploying IP Multicast in the Enterprise."'>Mt98</a>].

   By clearly identifying IP multicast benchmarks and related
   terminology in this document, it is hoped that detailed methodologies
   can be generated in subsequent documents.  Taken in tandem, these two
   efforts endeavor to assist the clinical, empirical, and consistent
   characterization of certain aspects of multicast technologies and
   their individual implementations.  Understanding the operational
   profile of multicast forwarding devices may assist the network
   designer to better deploy multicast in his or her networking
   environment.

   Moreover, this document focuses on one source to many destinations
   profiling.  Elements of this document may require extension when
   considering multiple source to multiple destination IP multicast
   communication.

   Definition:
      An equivalence class of packets comprising one or more data
      streams.

   Discussion:
      In the scope of this document, Traffic Class will be considered a
      logical identifier used to discriminate between a set or sets of
      packets offered the DUT.

      For example, one Traffic Class may identify a set of unicast
      packets offered to the DUT.  Another Traffic Class may
      differentiate the multicast packets destined to multicast group X.
      Yet another Class may distinguish the set of multicast packets
      destined to multicast group Y.

      Unless otherwise qualified, the usage of the word "Class" in this
      document will refer simply to a Traffic Class.

   This section presents terminology related to the characterization of
   the packet forwarding ability of a DUT/SUT in a multicast
   environment.  Some metrics extend the concept of throughput presented
   in <a href="rfc1242.html">RFC 1242</a>.  The notion of Forwarding Rate is cited in <a href="rfc2285.html">RFC 2285</a>.

   Definition:
      The maximum rate at which none of the offered frames, comprised
      from a unicast Class and a multicast Class, to be forwarded are
      dropped by the device across a fixed number of ports.

   Discussion:
      Often times, throughput is collected on a homogenous traffic class
      - the offered load to the DUT is either singularly unicast or
      singularly multicast.  In most networking environments, the
      traffic mix is seldom so uniformly distributed.

      Based on the <a href="rfc1242.html">RFC 1242</a> definition for throughput, the Mixed Class
      Throughput benchmark attempts to characterize the DUT's ability to
      process both unicast and multicast frames in the same aggregated
      traffic stream.

   Discussion:
      A desirable attribute of many Internet mechanisms is the ability
      to "scale." This benchmark seeks to demonstrate the ability of a
      SUT to forward as the number of multicast groups is scaled
      upwards.

   Measurement units:

   Definition:
      The time duration it takes a DUT to start forwarding multicast
      packets from the time a successful IGMP group membership report

   Discussion:
      Many factors can contribute to different results, such as the
      number or type of multicast-related protocols configured on the
      device under test. Other factors are physical topology and "tree"
      configuration.

      Because of the number of variables that could impact this metric,

      While it is important to understand how quickly a device can
      process multicast frames; it may be beneficial to understand how
      quickly that same device can stop the process as well.

      While this metric attempts to identify a simple delay, the

   Network forwarding devices are generally required to provide more

   Definition:
      A measured response collected from a DUT/SUT in light of
      interacting, or potentially interacting, distinct stimulii.

   Discussion:
      Many metrics provide a one dimensional view into an operating
      characteristic of a tested system.  For example, the forwarding
      rate metric may yield information about the packet processing
      ability of a device.  Collecting that same metric in view of
      another control variable can oftentimes be very insightful. Taking
      that same forwarding rate measurement, for instance, while the
      device's address table is injected with an additional 50,000
      entries may yield a different perspective.

   Measurement units:
      A burdened response is a type of metric.  Metrics of this this
      type must follow guidelines when reporting results.

      The metric's principal result MUST be reported in conjunction with
      the contributing factors.

      For example, in reporting a Forwarding Burdened Latency, the
      latency measurement should be reported with respect to
      corresponding Offered Load and Forwarding Rates.

   Issues: A Burdened response may be very illuminating when trying to
      characterize a single device or system.  Extreme care must be
      exercised when attempting to use that characterization as a basis
      of comparison with other devices or systems.  Test agents must
      ensure that the measured response is a function of the controlled
      stimulii, and not secondary factors.  An example of of such an
      interfering factor would be configuration mismatch of a timer
      impacting a response process.
