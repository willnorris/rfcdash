Abstract

   OAuth 2.0 authorization requests from native apps should only be made
   through external user-agents, primarily the user's browser.  This
   specification details the security and usability reasons why this is
   the case and how native apps and authorization servers can implement
   this best practice.

   <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework [<a href="rfc6749.html" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>]
   documents two approaches for native apps to interact with the
   authorization endpoint: an embedded user-agent and an external user-
   agent.

   This best current practice requires that only external user-agents
   like the browser are used for OAuth by native apps.  It documents how
   native apps can implement authorization flows using the browser as
   the preferred external user-agent as well as the requirements for
   authorization servers to support such usage.

   This practice is also known as the "AppAuth pattern", in reference to
   open-source libraries [<a href="#ref-AppAuth" title='"AppAuth"'>AppAuth</a>] that implement it.

   In addition to the terms defined in referenced specifications, this
   document uses the following terms:

   "native app"  An app or application that is installed by the user to
      their device, as distinct from a web app that runs in the browser
      context only.  Apps implemented using web-based technology but
      distributed as a native app, so-called "hybrid apps", are
      considered equivalent to native apps for the purpose of this
      specification.

   "app"  A "native app" unless further specified.

   "app store"  An e-commerce store where users can download and
      purchase apps.

   "OAuth"  Authorization protocol specified by the OAuth 2.0
      Authorization Framework [<a href="rfc6749.html" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>].

   "external user-agent"  A user-agent capable of handling the
      authorization request that is a separate entity or security domain
      to the native app making the request, such that the app cannot
      access the cookie storage, nor inspect or modify page content.

   "embedded user-agent"  A user-agent hosted by the native app making
      the authorization request that forms a part of the app or shares
      the same security domain such that the app can access the cookie
      storage and/or inspect or modify page content.

   "browser"  The default application launched by the operating system
      to handle "http" and "https" scheme URI content.

   "in-app browser tab"  A programmatic instantiation of the browser
      that is displayed inside a host app but that retains the full
      security properties and authentication state of the browser.  It
      has different platform-specific product names, several of which
      are detailed in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

   "web-view"  A web browser UI (user interface) component that is
      embedded in apps to render web pages under the control of the app.

   "inter-app communication"  Communication between two apps on a
      device.

   "claimed "https" scheme URI"  Some platforms allow apps to claim an
      "https" scheme URI after proving ownership of the domain name.
      URIs claimed in such a way are then opened in the app instead of
      the browser.

   "private-use URI scheme"  As used by this document, a URI scheme
      defined by the app (following the requirements of <a href="rfc7595.html#section-3.8">Section 3.8 of
      [RFC7595]</a>) and registered with the operating system.  URI requests
      to such schemes launch the app that registered it to handle the
      request.

   "reverse domain name notation"  A naming convention based on the
      domain name system, but one where the domain components are
      reversed, for example, "app.example.com" becomes
      "com.example.app".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Overview</span>

   For authorizing users in native apps, the best current practice is to
   perform the OAuth authorization request in an external user-agent
   (typically the browser) rather than an embedded user-agent (such as
   one implemented with web-views).

   Previously, it was common for native apps to use embedded user-agents
   (commonly implemented with web-views) for OAuth authorization
   requests.  That approach has many drawbacks, including the host app
   being able to copy user credentials and cookies as well as the user
   needing to authenticate from scratch in each app.  See <a href="#section-8.12">Section 8.12</a>

   for a deeper analysis of the drawbacks of using embedded user-agents
   for OAuth.

   Native app authorization requests that use the browser are more
   secure and can take advantage of the user's authentication state.
   Being able to use the existing authentication session in the browser
   enables single sign-on, as users don't need to authenticate to the
   authorization server each time they use a new app (unless required by
   the authorization server policy).

   Supporting authorization flows between a native app and the browser
   is possible without changing the OAuth protocol itself, as the OAuth
   authorization request and response are already defined in terms of
   URIs.  This encompasses URIs that can be used for inter-app
   communication.  Some OAuth server implementations that assume all
   clients are confidential web clients will need to add an
   understanding of public native app clients and the types of redirect
   URIs they use to support this best practice.

       Figure 1: Native App Authorization via an External User-Agent

   Figure 1 illustrates the interaction between a native app and the
   browser to authorize the user.

   (1)  Client app opens a browser tab with the authorization request.

   (2)  Authorization endpoint receives the authorization request,
        authenticates the user, and obtains authorization.
        Authenticating the user may involve chaining to other
        authentication systems.

   (3)  Authorization server issues an authorization code to the
        redirect URI.

   (4)  Client receives the authorization code from the redirect URI.

   (5)  Client app presents the authorization code at the token
        endpoint.

   (6)  Token endpoint validates the authorization code and issues the
        tokens requested.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Using%20Inter-App%20URI%20Communication%20for%20OAuth"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Using Inter-App URI Communication for OAuth</span>

   Just as URIs are used for OAuth 2.0 [<a href="rfc6749.html" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>] on the web to initiate
   the authorization request and return the authorization response to
   the requesting website, URIs can be used by native apps to initiate
   the authorization request in the device's browser and return the
   response to the requesting native app.

   By adopting the same methods used on the web for OAuth, benefits seen
   in the web context like the usability of a single sign-on session and
   the security of a separate authentication context are likewise gained
   in the native app context.  Reusing the same approach also reduces
   the implementation complexity and increases interoperability by
   relying on standards-based web flows that are not specific to a
   particular platform.

   To conform to this best practice, native apps MUST use an external
   user-agent to perform OAuth authorization requests.  This is achieved
   by opening the authorization request in the browser (detailed in
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>) and using a redirect URI that will return the
   authorization response back to the native app (defined in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>).

   Native apps needing user authorization create an authorization
   request URI with the authorization code grant type per <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> of
   OAuth 2.0 [<a href="rfc6749.html" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>], using a redirect URI capable of being received
   by the native app.

   The function of the redirect URI for a native app authorization
   request is similar to that of a web-based authorization request.
   Rather than returning the authorization response to the OAuth
   client's server, the redirect URI used by a native app returns the
   response to the app.  Several options for a redirect URI that will
   return the authorization response to the native app in different
   platforms are documented in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.  Any redirect URI that allows
   the app to receive the URI and inspect its parameters is viable.

   Public native app clients MUST implement the Proof Key for Code
   Exchange (PKCE [<a href="rfc7636.html" title='"Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients"'>RFC7636</a>]) extension to OAuth, and authorization
   servers MUST support PKCE for such clients, for the reasons detailed
   in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.

   After constructing the authorization request URI, the app uses
   platform-specific APIs to open the URI in an external user-agent.
   Typically, the external user-agent used is the default browser, that
   is, the application configured for handling "http" and "https" scheme
   URIs on the system; however, different browser selection criteria and
   other categories of external user-agents MAY be used.

   This best practice focuses on the browser as the RECOMMENDED external
   user-agent for native apps.  An external user-agent designed
   specifically for user authorization and capable of processing
   authorization requests and responses like a browser MAY also be used.
   Other external user-agents, such as a native app provided by the
   authorization server may meet the criteria set out in this best
   practice, including using the same redirection URI properties, but
   their use is out of scope for this specification.

   Some platforms support a browser feature known as "in-app browser
   tabs", where an app can present a tab of the browser within the app
   context without switching apps, but still retain key benefits of the
   browser such as a shared authentication state and security context.
   On platforms where they are supported, it is RECOMMENDED, for
   usability reasons, that apps use in-app browser tabs for the
   authorization request.

   There are several redirect URI options available to native apps for
   receiving the authorization response from the browser, the
   availability and user experience of which varies by platform.

   To fully support this best practice, authorization servers MUST offer
   at least the three redirect URI options described in the following
   subsections to native apps.  Native apps MAY use whichever redirect
   option suits their needs best, taking into account platform-specific
   implementation details.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.%20%20Private-Use%20URI%20Scheme%20Redirection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Private-Use URI Scheme Redirection</span>

   Many mobile and desktop computing platforms support inter-app
   communication via URIs by allowing apps to register private-use URI
   schemes (sometimes colloquially referred to as "custom URL schemes")
   like "com.example.app".  When the browser or another app attempts to
   load a URI with a private-use URI scheme, the app that registered it
   is launched to handle the request.

   To perform an OAuth 2.0 authorization request with a private-use URI
   scheme redirect, the native app launches the browser with a standard
   authorization request, but one where the redirection URI utilizes a
   private-use URI scheme it registered with the operating system.

   When choosing a URI scheme to associate with the app, apps MUST use a
   URI scheme based on a domain name under their control, expressed in
   reverse order, as recommended by <a href="rfc7595.html#section-3.8">Section 3.8 of [RFC7595]</a> for
   private-use URI schemes.

   For example, an app that controls the domain name "app.example.com"
   can use "com.example.app" as their scheme.  Some authorization
   servers assign client identifiers based on domain names, for example,
   "client1234.usercontent.example.net", which can also be used as the
   domain name for the scheme when reversed in the same manner.  A
   scheme such as "myapp", however, would not meet this requirement, as
   it is not based on a domain name.

   When there are multiple apps by the same publisher, care must be
   taken so that each scheme is unique within that group.  On platforms
   that use app identifiers based on reverse-order domain names, those
   identifiers can be reused as the private-use URI scheme for the OAuth
   redirect to help avoid this problem.

   Following the requirements of <a href="rfc3986.html#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of [RFC3986]</a>, as there is
   no naming authority for private-use URI scheme redirects, only a
   single slash ("/") appears after the scheme component.  A complete
   example of a redirect URI utilizing a private-use URI scheme is:

     com.example.app:/oauth2redirect/example-provider

   When the authorization server completes the request, it redirects to
   the client's redirection URI as it would normally.  As the
   redirection URI uses a private-use URI scheme, it results in the
   operating system launching the native app, passing in the URI as a
   launch parameter.  Then, the native app uses normal processing for
   the authorization response.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.%20%20Claimed%20%22https%22%20Scheme%20URI%20Redirection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" name="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Claimed "https" Scheme URI Redirection</span>

   Some operating systems allow apps to claim "https" scheme [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>]
   URIs in the domains they control.  When the browser encounters a
   claimed URI, instead of the page being loaded in the browser, the
   native app is launched with the URI supplied as a launch parameter.

   Such URIs can be used as redirect URIs by native apps.  They are
   indistinguishable to the authorization server from a regular web-
   based client redirect URI.  An example is:

     https://app.example.com/oauth2redirect/example-provider

   As the redirect URI alone is not enough to distinguish public native
   app clients from confidential web clients, it is REQUIRED in
   <a href="#section-8.4">Section 8.4</a> that the client type be recorded during client
   registration to enable the server to determine the client type and
   act accordingly.

   App-claimed "https" scheme redirect URIs have some advantages
   compared to other native app redirect options in that the identity of
   the destination app is guaranteed to the authorization server by the
   operating system.  For this reason, native apps SHOULD use them over
   the other options where possible.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.3.%20%20Loopback%20Interface%20Redirection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3" name="section-7.3">7.3</a>.  Loopback Interface Redirection</span>

   Native apps that are able to open a port on the loopback network
   interface without needing special permissions (typically, those on
   desktop operating systems) can use the loopback interface to receive
   the OAuth redirect.

   Loopback redirect URIs use the "http" scheme and are constructed with
   the loopback IP literal and whatever port the client is listening on.

   That is, "<a href="http://127.0.0/">http://127.0.0</a>.1:{port}/{path}" for IPv4, and
   "http://[::1]:{port}/{path}" for IPv6.  An example redirect using the
   IPv4 loopback interface with a randomly assigned port:

     <a href="http://127.0.0.1:51004/oauth2redirect/example-provider">http://127.0.0.1:51004/oauth2redirect/example-provider</a>

   An example redirect using the IPv6 loopback interface with a randomly
   assigned port:

     http://[::1]:61023/oauth2redirect/example-provider

   The authorization server MUST allow any port to be specified at the
   time of the request for loopback IP redirect URIs, to accommodate
   clients that obtain an available ephemeral port from the operating
   system at the time of the request.

   Clients SHOULD NOT assume that the device supports a particular
   version of the Internet Protocol.  It is RECOMMENDED that clients
   attempt to bind to the loopback interface using both IPv4 and IPv6
   and use whichever is available.

   The redirect URI options documented in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> share the benefit
   that only a native app on the same device or the app's own website
   can receive the authorization code, which limits the attack surface.
   However, code interception by a different native app running on the
   same device may be possible.

   A limitation of using private-use URI schemes for redirect URIs is
   that multiple apps can typically register the same scheme, which
   makes it indeterminate as to which app will receive the authorization
   code.  <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> of PKCE [<a href="rfc7636.html" title='"Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients"'>RFC7636</a>] details how this limitation can be
   used to execute a code interception attack.

   Loopback IP-based redirect URIs may be susceptible to interception by
   other apps accessing the same loopback interface on some operating
   systems.

   App-claimed "https" scheme redirects are less susceptible to URI
   interception due to the presence of the URI authority, but the app is
   still a public client; further, the URI is sent using the operating
   system's URI dispatch handler with unknown security properties.

   The PKCE [<a href="rfc7636.html" title='"Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients"'>RFC7636</a>] protocol was created specifically to mitigate this
   attack.  It is a proof-of-possession extension to OAuth 2.0 that
   protects the authorization code from being used if it is intercepted.
   To provide protection, this extension has the client generate a
   secret verifier; it passes a hash of this verifier in the initial
   authorization request, and must present the unhashed verifier when
   redeeming the authorization code.  An app that intercepted the
   authorization code would not be in possession of this secret,
   rendering the code useless.

   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> requires that both clients and servers use PKCE for public

   (which is required in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>), the use of the Implicit Flow with
   native apps is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   Access tokens granted via the implicit flow also cannot be refreshed
   without user interaction, making the authorization code grant flow --
   which can issue refresh tokens -- the more practical option for
   native app authorizations that require refreshing of access tokens.

   Loopback interface redirect URIs use the "http" scheme (i.e., without
   Transport Layer Security (TLS)).  This is acceptable for loopback
   interface redirect URIs as the HTTP request never leaves the device.

   Clients should open the network port only when starting the
   authorization request and close it once the response is returned.

   Clients should listen on the loopback network interface only, in
   order to avoid interference by other network actors.

   While redirect URIs using localhost (i.e.,
   "http://localhost:{port}/{path}") function similarly to loopback IP
   redirects described in <a href="#section-7.3">Section 7.3</a>, the use of localhost is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Specifying a redirect URI with the loopback IP literal
   rather than localhost avoids inadvertently listening on network

   Except when using a mechanism like Dynamic Client Registration
   [<a href="rfc7591.html" title='"OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol"'>RFC7591</a>] to provision per-instance secrets, native apps are
   classified as public clients, as defined by <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> of OAuth 2.0
   [<a href="rfc6749.html" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>]; they MUST be registered with the authorization server as
   such.  Authorization servers MUST record the client type in the
   client registration details in order to identify and process requests
   accordingly.

   Authorization servers MUST require clients to register their complete
   redirect URI (including the path component) and reject authorization
   requests that specify a redirect URI that doesn't exactly match the
   one that was registered; the exception is loopback redirects, where
   an exact match is required except for the port URI component.

   For private-use URI scheme-based redirects, authorization servers
   SHOULD enforce the requirement in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a> that clients use
   schemes that are reverse domain name based.  At a minimum, any
   private-use URI scheme that doesn't contain a period character (".")
   SHOULD be rejected.

   In addition to the collision-resistant properties, requiring a URI
   scheme based on a domain name that is under the control of the app
   can help to prove ownership in the event of a dispute where two apps
   claim the same private-use URI scheme (where one app is acting
   maliciously).  For example, if two apps claimed "com.example.app",
   the owner of "example.com" could petition the app store operator to
   remove the counterfeit app.  Such a petition is harder to prove if a
   generic URI scheme was used.

   Authorization servers MAY request the inclusion of other platform-
   specific information, such as the app package or bundle name, or
   other information that may be useful for verifying the calling app's
   identity on operating systems that support such functions.

   Secrets that are statically included as part of an app distributed to

   authentication of public native apps clients using a shared secret,
   as this serves little value beyond client identification which is
   already provided by the "client_id" request parameter.

   Authorization servers that still require a statically included shared
   secret for native app clients MUST treat the client as a public
   client (as defined by <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> of OAuth 2.0 [<a href="rfc6749.html" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>]), and not
   accept the secret as proof of the client's identity.  Without
   additional measures, such clients are subject to client impersonation
   (see <a href="#section-8.6">Section 8.6</a>).

   As stated in <a href="#section-10.2">Section 10.2</a> of OAuth 2.0 [<a href="rfc6749.html" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>], the authorization
   server SHOULD NOT process authorization requests automatically
   without user consent or interaction, except when the identity of the
   client can be assured.  This includes the case where the user has
   previously approved an authorization request for a given client id --
   unless the identity of the client can be proven, the request SHOULD
   be processed as if no previous request had been approved.

   Measures such as claimed "https" scheme redirects MAY be accepted by
   authorization servers as identity proof.  Some operating systems may
   offer alternative platform-specific identity features that MAY be
   accepted, as appropriate.

   The native app that is initiating the authorization request has a
   large degree of control over the user interface and can potentially
   present a fake external user-agent, that is, an embedded user-agent
   made to appear as an external user-agent.

   When all good actors are using external user-agents, the advantage is
   that it is possible for security experts to detect bad actors, as
   anyone faking an external user-agent is provably bad.  On the other
   hand, if good and bad actors alike are using embedded user-agents,
   bad actors don't need to fake anything, making them harder to detect.
   Once a malicious app is detected, it may be possible to use this
   knowledge to blacklist the app's signature in malware scanning
   software, take removal action (in the case of apps distributed by app
   stores) and other steps to reduce the impact and spread of the
   malicious app.

   Authorization servers can also directly protect against fake external
   user-agents by requiring an authentication factor only available to
   true external user-agents.

   Users who are particularly concerned about their security when using
   in-app browser tabs may also take the additional step of opening the
   request in the full browser from the in-app browser tab and complete
   the authorization there, as most implementations of the in-app
   browser tab pattern offer such functionality.

   If a malicious app is able to configure itself as the default handler
   for "https" scheme URIs in the operating system, it will be able to
   intercept authorization requests that use the default browser and
   abuse this position of trust for malicious ends such as phishing the
   user.

   This attack is not confined to OAuth; a malicious app configured in
   this way would present a general and ongoing risk to the user beyond
   OAuth usage by native apps.  Many operating systems mitigate this
   issue by requiring an explicit user action to change the default
   handler for "http" and "https" scheme URIs.

   <a href="rfc6819.html#section-5.3.5">Section 5.3.5 of [RFC6819]</a> recommends using the "state" parameter to
   link client requests and responses to prevent CSRF (Cross-Site
   Request Forgery) attacks.

   To mitigate CSRF-style attacks over inter-app URI communication
   channels (so called "cross-app request forgery"), it is similarly
   RECOMMENDED that native apps include a high-entropy secure random
   number in the "state" parameter of the authorization request and
   reject any incoming authorization responses without a state value
   that matches a pending outgoing authorization request.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.10.%20%20Authorization%20Server%20Mix-Up%20Mitigation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.10" name="section-8.10">8.10</a>.  Authorization Server Mix-Up Mitigation</span>

   To protect against a compromised or malicious authorization server
   attacking another authorization server used by the same app, it is
   REQUIRED that a unique redirect URI is used for each authorization
   server used by the app (for example, by varying the path component),
   and that authorization responses are rejected if the redirect URI
   they were received on doesn't match the redirect URI in an outgoing
   authorization request.

   The native app MUST store the redirect URI used in the authorization
   request with the authorization session data (i.e., along with "state"
   and other related data) and MUST verify that the URI on which the
   authorization response was received exactly matches it.

   The requirement of <a href="#section-8.4">Section 8.4</a>, specifically that authorization
   servers reject requests with URIs that don't match what was
   registered, is also required to prevent such attacks.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.11.%20%20Non-Browser%20External%20User-Agents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.11" name="section-8.11">8.11</a>.  Non-Browser External User-Agents</span>

   This best practice recommends a particular type of external user-
   agent: the user's browser.  Other external user-agent patterns may
   also be viable for secure and usable OAuth.  This document makes no
   comment on those patterns.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.12.%20%20Embedded%20User-Agents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.12" name="section-8.12">8.12</a>.  Embedded User-Agents</span>

   <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> of OAuth 2.0 [<a href="rfc6749.html" title='"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"'>RFC6749</a>] documents two approaches for native
   apps to interact with the authorization endpoint.  This best current
   practice requires that native apps MUST NOT use embedded user-agents
   to perform authorization requests and allows that authorization
   endpoints MAY take steps to detect and block authorization requests
   in embedded user-agents.  The security considerations for these
   requirements are detailed herein.

   Embedded user-agents are an alternative method for authorizing native
   apps.  These embedded user-agents are unsafe for use by third parties
   to the authorization server by definition, as the app that hosts the
   embedded user-agent can access the user's full authentication
   credential, not just the OAuth authorization grant that was intended
   for the app.

   In typical web-view-based implementations of embedded user-agents,
   the host application can record every keystroke entered in the login
   form to capture usernames and passwords, automatically submit forms
   to bypass user consent, and copy session cookies and use them to
   perform authenticated actions as the user.

   Even when used by trusted apps belonging to the same party as the
   authorization server, embedded user-agents violate the principle of
   least privilege by having access to more powerful credentials than
   they need, potentially increasing the attack surface.

   Encouraging users to enter credentials in an embedded user-agent
   without the usual address bar and visible certificate validation
   features that browsers have makes it impossible for the user to know
   if they are signing in to the legitimate site; even when they are, it
   trains them that it's OK to enter credentials without validating the
   site first.

   Aside from the security concerns, embedded user-agents do not share
   the authentication state with other apps or the browser, requiring
   the user to log in for every authorization request, which is often
   considered an inferior user experience.

       <a href="#section-7.2">Section 7.2</a>.

   3.  Support loopback IP redirect URIs.  This is required to support
       desktop operating systems.  See <a href="#section-7.3">Section 7.3</a>.

   4.  Not assume that native app clients can keep a secret.  If secrets
       are distributed to multiple installs of the same native app, they
       should not be treated as confidential.  See <a href="#section-8.5">Section 8.5</a>.

   5.  Support PKCE [<a href="rfc7636.html" title='"Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients"'>RFC7636</a>].  Required to protect authorization code
       grants sent to public clients over inter-app communication
       channels.  See <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>

   This document primarily defines best practices in a generic manner,
   referencing techniques commonly available in a variety of
   environments.  This non-normative section documents implementation
   details of the best practice for various operating systems.

   The implementation details herein are considered accurate at the time
   of publishing but will likely change over time.  It is hoped that
   such a change won't invalidate the generic principles in the rest of
   the document and that those principles should take precedence in the
   event of a conflict.

   Apps can initiate an authorization request in the browser, without
   the user leaving the app, through the "SFSafariViewController" class
   or its successor "SFAuthenticationSession", which implement the in-
   app browser tab pattern.  Safari can be used to handle requests on
   old versions of iOS without in-app browser tab functionality.

   To receive the authorization response, both private-use URI scheme
   (referred to as "custom URL scheme") redirects and claimed "https"
   scheme URIs (known as "Universal Links") are viable choices.  Apps
   can claim private-use URI schemes with the "CFBundleURLTypes" key in

   the application's property list file, "Info.plist", and "https"
   scheme URIs using the Universal Links feature with an entitlement
   file in the app and an association file hosted on the domain.

   Claimed "https" scheme URIs are the preferred redirect choice on iOS
   9 and above due to the ownership proof that is provided by the
   operating system.

   A complete open-source sample is included in the AppAuth for iOS and
   macOS [<a href="#ref-AppAuth.iOSmacOS">AppAuth.iOSmacOS</a>] library.

   Apps can initiate an authorization request in the browser, without
   the user leaving the app, through the Android Custom Tab feature,
   which implements the in-app browser tab pattern.  The user's default
   browser can be used to handle requests when no browser supports
   Custom Tabs.

   Android browser vendors should support the Custom Tabs protocol (by
   providing an implementation of the "CustomTabsService" class), to
   provide the in-app browser tab user-experience optimization to their
   users.  Chrome is one such browser that implements Custom Tabs.

   To receive the authorization response, private-use URI schemes are
   broadly supported through Android Implicit Intents.  Claimed "https"
   scheme redirect URIs through Android App Links are available on
   Android 6.0 and above.  Both types of redirect URIs are registered in
   the application's manifest.

   A complete open-source sample is included in the AppAuth for Android
   [<a href="#ref-AppAuth.Android">AppAuth.Android</a>] library.

   Both traditional and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps can
   perform authorization requests in the user's browser.  Traditional
   apps typically use a loopback redirect to receive the authorization
   response, and listening on the loopback interface is allowed by
   default firewall rules.  When creating the loopback network socket,
   apps SHOULD set the "SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE" socket option to prevent
   other apps binding to the same socket.

   UWP apps can use private-use URI scheme redirects to receive the
   authorization response from the browser, which will bring the app to
   the foreground.  Known on the platform as "URI Activation", the URI

   scheme is limited to 39 characters in length, and it may include the
   "." character, making short reverse domain name based schemes (as
   required in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>) possible.

   UWP apps can alternatively use the Web Authentication Broker API in
   Single Sign-on (SSO) mode, which is an external user-agent designed
   for authorization flows.  Cookies are shared between invocations of
   the broker but not the user's preferred browser, meaning the user
   will need to log in again, even if they have an active session in
   their browser; but the session created in the broker will be
   available to subsequent apps that use the broker.  Personalizations
   the user has made to their browser, such as configuring a password
   manager, may not be available in the broker.  To qualify as an
   external user-agent, the broker MUST be used in SSO mode.

   To use the Web Authentication Broker in SSO mode, the redirect URI
   must be of the form "msapp://{appSID}" where "{appSID}" is the app's
   security identifier (SID), which can be found in the app's
   registration information or by calling the
   "GetCurrentApplicationCallbackUri" method.  While Windows enforces
   the URI authority on such redirects, ensuring that only the app with
   the matching SID can receive the response on Windows, the URI scheme
   could be claimed by apps on other platforms without the same
   authority present; thus, this redirect type should be treated
   similarly to private-use URI scheme redirects for security purposes.

   An open-source sample demonstrating these patterns is available
   [<a href="#ref-SamplesForWindows">SamplesForWindows</a>].

   Apps can initiate an authorization request in the user's default
   browser using platform APIs for opening URIs in the browser.

   To receive the authorization response, private-use URI schemes are a
   good redirect URI choice on macOS, as the user is returned right back
   to the app they launched the request from.  These are registered in
   the application's bundle information property list using the
   "CFBundleURLSchemes" key.  Loopback IP redirects are another viable
   option, and listening on the loopback interface is allowed by default
   firewall rules.

   A complete open-source sample is included in the AppAuth for iOS and
   macOS [<a href="#ref-AppAuth.iOSmacOS">AppAuth.iOSmacOS</a>] library.

   Opening the authorization request in the user's default browser
   requires a distro-specific command: "xdg-open" is one such tool.

   The loopback redirect is the recommended redirect choice for desktop
   apps on Linux to receive the authorization response.  Apps SHOULD NOT
   set the "SO_REUSEPORT" or "SO_REUSEADDR" socket options in order to
   prevent other apps binding to the same socket.
