<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Photuris [<a href="#ref-Firefly" title='"Photuris"'>Firefly</a>] establishes short-lived session-keys between two
   parties, without passing the session-keys across the Internet.  These
   session-keys directly replace the long-lived secret-keys (such as
   passwords and passphrases) that have been historically configured for
   security purposes.

   The basic Photuris protocol utilizes these existing previously
   configured secret-keys for identification of the parties.  This is
   intended to speed deployment and reduce administrative configuration
   changes.

   This document is primarily intended for implementing the Photuris
   protocol.  It does not detail service and application interface
   definitions, although it does mention some basic policy areas
   required for the proper implementation and operation of the protocol
   mechanisms.

   Since the basic Photuris protocol is extensible, new data types and
   protocol behaviour should be expected.  The implementor is especially
   cautioned not to depend on values that appear in examples to be
   current or complete, since their purpose is primarily pedagogical.

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC-2119</a>].

   byte             An 8-bit quantity; also known as "octet" in
                    standardese.

   exchange-value   The publically distributable value used to calculate
                    a shared-secret.  As used in this document, refers
                    to a Diffie-Hellman exchange, not the public part of
                    a public/private key-pair.

   private-key      A value that is kept secret, and is part of an
                    asymmetric public/private key-pair.

   public-key       A publically distributable value that is part of an

                    key-pair.  An example is a user password.

   Security Association (SA)
                    A collection of parameters describing the security
                    relationship between two nodes.  These parameters
                    include the identities of the parties, the transform
                    (including algorithm and algorithm mode), the key(s)
                    (such as a session-key, secret-key, or appropriate
                    public/private key-pair), and possibly other
                    information such as sensitivity labelling.

   Security Parameters Index (SPI)
                    A number that indicates a particular set of uni-
                    directional attributes used under a Security
                    Association, such as transform(s) and session-
                    key(s).  The number is relative to the IP
                    Destination, which is the SPI Owner, and is unique
                    per IP (Next Header) Protocol.  That is, the same
                    value MAY be used by multiple protocols to
                    concurrently indicate different Security Association
                    parameters.

   session-key      A key that is independently derived from a shared-
                    secret by the parties, and used for keying one
                    direction of traffic.  This key is changed
                    frequently.

   shared-secret    As used in this document, the calculated result of
                    the Photuris exchange.

   SPI Owner        The party that corresponds to the IP Destination;
                    the intended recipient of a protected datagram.

   SPI User         The party that corresponds to the IP Source; the
                    sender of a protected datagram.

   transform        A cryptographic manipulation of a particular set of
                    data.  As used in this document, refers to certain
                    well-specified methods (defined elsewhere).  For
                    example, AH-MD5 [<a href="rfc1828.html" title='"IP Authentication using Keyed MD5"'>RFC-1828</a>] transforms an IP datagram
                    into a cryptographic hash, and ESP-DES-CBC [RFC-
                    1829] transforms plaintext to ciphertext and back
                    again.

   Many of these terms are hierarchically related:

      Security Association (bi-directional)
       - one or more lists of Security Parameters (uni-directional)

   The Photuris protocol consists of several simple phases:

   1. A "Cookie" Exchange guards against simple flooding attacks sent
      with bogus IP Sources or UDP Ports.  Each party passes a "cookie"
      to the other.

      In return, a list of supported Exchange-Schemes are offered by the
      Responder for calculating a shared-secret.

   2. A Value Exchange establishes a shared-secret between the parties.
      Each party passes an Exchange-Value to the other.  These values
      are used to calculate a shared-secret.  The Responder remains
      stateless until a shared-secret has been created.

      In addition, supported attributes are offered by each party for
      use in establishing new Security Parameters.

   3. An Identification Exchange identifies the parties to each other,
      and verifies the integrity of values sent in phases 1 and 2.

      In addition, the shared-secret provides a basis to generate
      separate session-keys in each direction, which are in turn used
      for conventional authentication or encryption.  Additional
      security attributes are also exchanged as needed.

      This exchange is masked for party privacy protection using a
      message privacy-key based on the shared-secret.  This protects the
      identities of the parties, hides the Security Parameter attribute
      values, and improves security for the exchange protocol and
      security transforms.

   4. Additional messages may be exchanged to periodically change the
      session-keys, and to establish new or revised Security Parameters.

      These exchanges are also masked for party privacy protection in
      the same fashion as above.

   The sequence of message types and their purposes are summarized in
   the diagram below.  The first three phases (cookie, exchange, and
   identification) must be carried out in their entirety before any
   Security Association can be used.

   Either party may initiate an exchange at any time.  For example, the
   Initiator need not be a "caller" in a telephony link.

   The Initiator is responsible for recovering from all message losses
   by retransmission.


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Security%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Security Parameters</span>

   A Photuris exchange between two parties results in a pair of SPI
   values (one in each direction).  Each SPI is used in creating
   separate session-key(s) in each direction.

   The SPI is assigned by the entity controlling the IP Destination: the
   SPI Owner (receiver).  The parties use the combination of IP
   Destination, IP (Next Header) Protocol, and SPI to distinguish the
   correct Security Association.

   When both parties initiate Photuris exchanges concurrently, or one
   party initiates more than one Photuris exchange, the Initiator
   Cookies (and UDP Ports) keep the exchanges separate.  This results in
   more than one initial SPI for each Destination.

   To create multiple SPIs with different parameters, the parties may
   also send SPI_Updates.

   There is no requirement that all such outstanding SPIs be used.  The
   SPI User (sender) selects an appropriate SPI for each datagram
   transmission.

   Implementation Notes:

      The method used for SPI assignment is implementation dependent.
      The only requirement is that the SPI be unique for the IP
      Destination and IP (Next Header) Protocol.

      However, selection of a cryptographically random SPI value can
      help prevent attacks that depend on a predicatable sequence of
      values.  The implementor MUST NOT expect SPI values to have a
      particular order or range.


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4.%20%20LifeTimes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" name="section-1.4">1.4</a>.  LifeTimes</span>

   The Photuris exchange results in two kinds of state, each with
   separate LifeTimes.

   1) The Exchange LifeTime of the small amount of state associated with
      the Photuris exchange itself.  This state may be viewed as between
      Internet nodes.

   2) The SPI LifeTimes of the individual SPIs that are established.
      This state may be viewed as between users and nodes.

   The SPI LifeTimes may be shorter or longer than the Exchange
   LifeTime.  These LifeTimes are not required to be related to each
   other.

   When an Exchange-Value expires (or is replaced by a newer value), any
   unexpired derived SPIs are not affected.  This is important to allow
   traffic to continue without interruption during new Photuris
   exchanges.


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4.1.%20%20Exchange%20LifeTimes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4.1" name="section-1.4.1">1.4.1</a>.  Exchange LifeTimes</span>

   All retained exchange state of both parties has an associated
   Exchange LifeTime (ELT), and is subject to periodic expiration.  This
   depends on the physical and logistical security of the machine, and
   is typically in the range of 10 minutes to one day (default 30
   minutes).

   In addition, during a Photuris exchange, an Exchange TimeOut (ETO)
   limits the wait for the exchange to complete.  This timeout includes
   the packet round trips, and the time for completing the
   Identification Exchange calculations.  The time is bounded by both
   the maximum amount of calculation delay expected for the processing
   power of an unknown peer, and the minimum user expectation for

   results (default 30 seconds).

   These Exchange LifeTimes and TimeOuts are implementation dependent
   and are not disclosed in any Photuris message.  The paranoid operator
   will have a fairly short Exchange LifeTime, but it MUST NOT be less
   than twice the ETO.

   To prevent synchronization between Photuris exchanges, the
   implementation SHOULD randomly vary each Exchange LifeTime within
   twice the range of seconds that are required to calculate a new
   Exchange-Value.  For example, when the Responder uses a base ELT of
   30 minutes, and takes 10 seconds to calculate the new Exchange-Value,
   the equation might be (in milliseconds):

      1790000 + urandom(20000)

   The Exchange-Scheme, Exchange-Values, and resulting shared-secret MAY
   be cached in short-term storage for the Exchange LifeTime.  When
   repetitive Photuris exchanges occur between the same parties, and the
   Exchange-Values are discovered to be unchanged, the previously
   calculated shared-secret can be used to rapidly generate new
   session-keys.


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4.2.%20%20SPI%20LifeTimes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4.2" name="section-1.4.2">1.4.2</a>.  SPI LifeTimes</span>

   Each SPI has an associated LifeTime, specified by the SPI owner
   (receiver).  This SPI LifeTime (SPILT) is usually related to the
   speed of the link (typically 2 to 30 minutes), but it MUST NOT be
   less than thrice the ETO.

   The SPI can also be deleted by the SPI Owner using the SPI_Update.
   Once the SPI has expired or been deleted, the parties cease using the
   SPI.

   To prevent synchronization between multiple Photuris exchanges, the
   implementation SHOULD randomly vary each SPI LifeTime.  For example,
   when the Responder uses a base SPILT of 5 minutes, and 30 seconds for
   the ETO, the equation might be (in milliseconds):

      285000 + urandom(30000)

   There is no requirement that a long LifeTime be accepted by the SPI
   User.  The SPI User might never use an established SPI, or cease
   using the SPI at any time.

   When more than one unexpired SPI is available to the SPI User for the
   same function, a common implementation technique is to select the SPI

   with the greatest remaining LifeTime.  However, selecting randomly
   among a large number of SPIs might provide some defense against
   traffic analysis.

   To prevent resurrection of deleted or expired SPIs, SPI Owners SHOULD
   remember those SPIs, but mark them as unusable until the Photuris
   exchange shared-secret used to create them also expires and purges
   the associated state.

   When the SPI Owner detects an incoming SPI that has recently expired,
   but the associated exchange state has not yet been purged, the
   implementation MAY accept the SPI.  The length of time allowed is
   highly dependent on clock drift and variable packet round trip time,
   and is therefore implementation dependent.

   The security of Photuris critically depends on the quality of the
   secret random numbers generated by each party.  A poor random number
   generator at either party will compromise the shared-secret produced
   by the algorithm.

   Generating cryptographic quality random numbers on a general purpose
   computer without hardware assistance is a very tricky problem.  In
   general, this requires using a cryptographic hashing function to
   "distill" the entropy from a large number of semi-random external
   events, such as the timing of key strokes.  An excellent discussion
   can be found in [<a href="rfc1750.html">RFC-1750</a>].

   The Initiator begins a Photuris exchange under several circumstances:

   -  The Initiator has a datagram that it wishes to send with
      confidentiality, and has no current Photuris exchange state with
      the IP Destination.  This datagram is discarded, and a
      Cookie_Request is sent instead.

   -  The Initiator has received the ICMP message [<a href="rfc1812.html" title='"Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers"'>RFC-1812</a>] Destination
      Unreachable: Communication Administratively Prohibited (Type 3,
      Code 13), and has no current Photuris exchange state with the ICMP
      Source.

   -  The Initiator has received the ICMP message [<a href="rfc2521.html" title='"ICMP Security Failures Messages"'>RFC-2521</a>] Security
      Failures: Bad SPI (Type 40, Code 0), that matches current Photuris
      exchange state with the ICMP Source.

   -  The Initiator has received the ICMP message [<a href="rfc2521.html" title='"ICMP Security Failures Messages"'>RFC-2521</a>] Security
      Failures: Need Authentication (Type 40, Code 4), and has no
      current Photuris exchange state with the ICMP Source.

   -  The Initiator has received the ICMP message [<a href="rfc2521.html" title='"ICMP Security Failures Messages"'>RFC-2521</a>] Security
      Failures: Need Authorization (Type 40, Code 5), that matches
      current Photuris exchange state with the ICMP Source.

   When the event is an ICMP message, special care MUST be taken that
   the ICMP message actually includes information that matches a
   previously sent IP datagram.  Otherwise, this could provide an
   opportunity for a clogging attack, by stimulating a new Photuris
   Exchange.

   All Photuris messages use the User Datagram Protocol header [RFC-
   768].  The Initiator sends to UDP Destination Port 468.

   When replying to the Initiator, the Responder swaps the IP Source and
   Destination, and the UDP Source and Destination Ports.

   The UDP checksum MUST be correctly calculated when sent.  When a
   message is received with an incorrect UDP checksum, it is silently
   discarded.

   Implementation Notes:

      It is expected that installation of Photuris will ensure that UDP
      checksum calculations are enabled for the computer operating
      system and later disabling by operators is prevented.

      Internet Protocol version 4 [<a href="rfc791.html" title='"Internet Protocol"'>RFC-791</a>] restricts the maximum
      reassembled datagram to 576 bytes.

      When processing datagrams containing variable size values, the
      length must be checked against the overall datagram length.  An
      invalid size (too long or short) that causes a poorly coded
      receiver to abort could be used as a denial of service attack.

                    significant byte first.

                    When the Size is zero, no Value field is present;
                    there are no significant bits.  This means "missing"
                    or "null".  It should not be confused with the value
                    zero, which includes an indication of the number of
                    significant bits.

                    When the most significant byte is in the range 0
                    through 254 (0xfe), the field is 2 bytes.  Both

                    When the most significant 2 bytes are 65,535

                    significant byte first.

                    The bits used are right justified within byte
                    boundaries; that is, any unused bits are in the most
                    significant byte.  When there are no unused bits, or
                    unused bits are zero filled, the value is assumed to
                    be an unsigned positive integer.

                    When the leading unused bits are ones filled, the
                    number is assumed to be a two's-complement negative
                    integer.  A negative integer will always have at
                    least one unused leading sign bit in the most
                    significant byte.

   Shortened forms SHOULD NOT be used when the Value includes a number
   of leading zero significant bits.  The Size SHOULD indicate the
   correct number of significant bits.

   Implementation Notes:

      Negative integers are not required to be supported, but are
      included for completeness.

      No more than 65,279 significant bits are required to be supported.
      Other ranges are vastly too long for these UDP messages, but are
      included for completeness.

   The Initiator initializes local state, and generates a unique
   "cookie".  The Initiator-Cookie MUST be different in each new
   Cookie_Request between the same parties.  See "Cookie Generation" for
   details.

   -  If any previous exchange between the peer IP nodes has not expired
      in which this party was the Initiator, this Responder-Cookie is
      set to the most recent Responder-Cookie, and this Counter is set
      to the corresponding Counter.

      For example, a new Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel is about
      to be established to an existing partner.  The Counter is the same
      value received in the prior Cookie_Response, the Responder-Cookie
      remains the same, and a new Initiator-Cookie is generated.

   -  If the new Cookie_Request is in response to a message of a
      previous exchange in which this party was the Responder, this
      Responder-Cookie is set to the previous Initiator-Cookie, and this
      Counter is set to zero.

      For example, a Bad_Cookie message was received from the previous
      Initiator in response to SPI_Needed.  The Responder-Cookie is
      replaced with the Initiator-Cookie, and a new Initiator-Cookie is
      generated.  This provides bookkeeping to detect bogus Bad_Cookie
      messages.

      Also, can be used for bi-directional User, Transport, and Process
      oriented keying.  Such mechanisms are outside the scope of this
      document.

   -  Otherwise, this Responder-Cookie and Counter are both set to zero.

      By default, the Initiator operates in the same manner as when all
      of its previous exchange state has expired.  The Responder will
      send a Resource_Limit when its own exchange state has not expired.

   The Initiator also starts a retransmission timer.  If no valid
   Cookie_Response arrives within the time limit, the same
   Cookie_Request is retransmitted for the remaining number of
   Retransmissions.  The Initiator-Cookie value MUST be the same in each
   such retransmission to the same IP Destination and UDP Port.

   When Retransmissions have been exceeded, if a Resource_Limit message
   has been received during the exchange, the Initiator SHOULD begin the
   Photuris exchange again by sending a new Cookie_Request with updated
   values.

   On receipt of a Cookie_Request, the Responder determines whether
   there are sufficient resources to begin another Photuris exchange.

   -  When too many SPI values are already in use for this particular
      peer, or too many concurrent exchanges are in progress, or some
      other resource limit is reached, a Resource_Limit message is sent.

   -  When any previous exchange initiated by this particular peer has
      not exceeded the Exchange TimeOut, and the Responder-Cookie does
      not specify one of these previous exchanges, a Resource_Limit
      message is sent.

   Otherwise, the Responder returns a Cookie_Response.

   Note that the Responder creates no additional state at this time.


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.0.3.%20%20Send%20Cookie_Response"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.0.3" name="section-3.0.3">3.0.3</a>.  Send Cookie_Response</span>

   The IP Source for the Initiator is examined.  If any previous
   exchange between the peer IP nodes has not expired, the response
   Counter is set to the most recent exchange Counter plus one (allowing
   for out of order retransmissions).  Otherwise, the response Counter
   is set to the request Counter plus one.

   If (through rollover of the Counter) the new Counter value is zero
   (modulo 256), the value is set to one.

   If this new Counter value matches some previous exchange initiated by
   this particular peer that has not yet exceeded the Exchange TimeOut,

   the Counter is incremented again, until a unique Counter value is
   reached.

   Nota Bene:
      No more than 254 concurrent exchanges between the same two peers
      are supported.

   The Responder generates a unique cookie.  The Responder-Cookie value
   in each successive response SHOULD be different.  See "Cookie
   Generation" for details.

   The Exchange-Schemes available between the peers are listed in the
   Offered-Schemes.

   The Initiator validates the Initiator-Cookie, and the Offered-
   Schemes.

   -  When an invalid/expired Initiator-Cookie is detected, the message
      is silently discarded.

   -  When the variable length Offered-Schemes do not match the UDP
      Length, or all Offered-Schemes are obviously defective and/or
      insufficient for the purposes intended, the message is silently
      discarded; the implementation SHOULD log the occurance, and notify
      an operator as appropriate.

   -  Once a valid message has been received, later Cookie_Responses
      with matching Initiator-Cookies are also silently discarded, until
      a new Cookie_Request is sent.

   When the message is valid, an Exchange-Scheme is chosen from the list
   of Offered-Schemes.

   This Scheme-Choice may affect the next Photuris message sent.  By
   default, the next Photuris message is a Value_Request.

   Implementation Notes:

      Only the Initiator-Cookie is used to identify the exchange.  The
      Counter and Responder-Cookie will both be different from the
      Cookie_Request.

      Various proposals for extensions utilize the Scheme-Choice to
      indicate a different message sequence.  Such mechanisms are
      outside the scope of this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Cookie%20Generation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Cookie Generation</span>

   The exact technique by which a Photuris party generates a cookie is
   implementation dependent.  The method chosen must satisfy some basic
   requirements:

   1. The cookie MUST depend on the specific parties.  This prevents an
      attacker from obtaining a cookie using a real IP address and UDP
      port, and then using it to swamp the victim with requests from
      randomly chosen IP addresses or ports.

   2. It MUST NOT be possible for anyone other than the issuing entity
      to generate cookies that will be accepted by that entity.  This
      implies that the issuing entity will use local secret information
      in the generation and subsequent verification of a cookie.  It
      must not be possible to deduce this secret information from any
      particular cookie.

   3. The cookie generation and verification methods MUST be fast to
      thwart attacks intended to sabotage CPU resources.

   A recommended technique is to use a cryptographic hashing function
   (such as MD5).

   An incoming cookie can be verified at any time by regenerating it
   locally from values contained in the incoming datagram and the local
   secret random value.


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.1.%20%20Initiator%20Cookie"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.1" name="section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  Initiator Cookie</span>

   The Initiator secret value that affects its cookie SHOULD change for
   each new Photuris exchange, and is thereafter internally cached on a
   per Responder basis.  This provides improved synchronization and
   protection against replay attacks.

   An alternative is to cache the cookie instead of the secret value.
   Incoming cookies can be compared directly without the computational
   cost of regeneration.

   It is recommended that the cookie be calculated over the secret
   value, the IP Source and Destination addresses, and the UDP Source
   and Destination ports.

   Implementation Notes:

      Although the recommendation includes the UDP Source port, this is
      very implementation specific.  For example, it might not be
      included when the value is constant.

      However, it is important that the implementation protect mutually
      suspicious users of the same machine from generating the same
      cookie.


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.2.%20%20Responder%20Cookie"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.2" name="section-3.3.2">3.3.2</a>.  Responder Cookie</span>

   The Responder secret value that affects its cookies MAY remain the
   same for many different Initiators.  However, this secret SHOULD be
   changed periodically to limit the time for use of its cookies
   (typically each 60 seconds).

   The Responder-Cookie SHOULD include the Initiator-Cookie.  The
   Responder-Cookie MUST include the Counter (that is returned in the
   Cookie_Response).  This provides improved synchronization and
   protection against replay attacks.

   It is recommended that the cookie be calculated over the secret
   value, the IP Source and Destination addresses, its own UDP
   Destination port, the Counter, the Initiator-Cookie, and the
   currently Offered-Schemes.

   The cookie is not cached per Initiator to avoid saving state during
   the initial Cookie Exchange.  On receipt of a Value_Request
   (described later), the Responder regenerates its cookie for
   validation.

   Once the Value_Response is sent (also described later), both
   Initiator and Responder cookies are cached to identify the exchange.

   Implementation Notes:

      Although the recommendation does not include the UDP Source port,
      this is very implementation specific.  It might be successfully
      included in some variants.

      However, it is important that the UDP Source port not be included
      when matching existing Photuris exchanges for determining the
      appropriate Counter.

      The recommendation includes the Offered-Schemes to detect a
      dynamic change of scheme value between the Cookie_Response and

      Some mechanism MAY be needed to detect a dynamic change of pre-
      calculated Responder Exchange-Value between the Value_Response and

   The IP Source for the Initiator is examined, and the attributes
   available between the parties are listed in the Offered-Attributes.

   Implementation Notes:

      At this time, the Responder begins calculation of the shared-
      secret.  Calculation of the shared-secret is executed in parallel
      to minimize delay.

      This may take a substantial amount of time.  The implementor
      should ensure that retransmission is not blocked by this
      calculation.  This is not usually a problem, as retransmission
      timeouts typically exceed calculation time.

   The Initiator validates the pair of Cookies, the Exchange-Value, and
   the Offered-Attributes.

   -  When an invalid/expired cookie is detected, the message is
      silently discarded.

   -  When the Exchange-Value is obviously defective, or the variable
      length Offered-Attributes do not match the UDP Length, the message
      is silently discarded; the implementation SHOULD log the
      occurance, and notify an operator as appropriate.

   -  Once a valid message has been received, later Value_Responses with
      both matching cookies are also silently discarded, until a new
      Cookie_Request is sent.

   When the message is valid, the Initiator begins its parallel
   computation of the shared-secret.

   When the Initiator completes computation, it sends an
   Identity_Request to the Responder.

   This list includes those attributes supported by the party that are
   available to the other party.  The attribute formats are specified in
   the "Basic Attributes".

   The list is composed of two or three sections: Identification-
   Attributes, Authentication-Attributes, and (optional) Encapsulation-
   Attributes.  Within each section, the attributes are ordered from
   most to least preferable.

   The first section of the list includes methods of identification.  An
   Identity-Choice is selected from this list.

   The second section of the list begins with "AH-Attributes" (#1).  It
   includes methods of authentication, and other operational types.

   The third section of the list begins with "ESP-Attributes" (#2).  It
   includes methods of authentication, compression, encryption, and
   other operational types.  When no Encapsulation-Attributes are
   offered, the "ESP-Attributes" attribute itself is omitted from the
   list.

   Attribute-Choices are selected from the latter two sections of the
   list.

   Support is required for the "MD5-IPMAC" (#5) attribute for both
   "Symmetric Identification" and "Authentication" and they SHOULD be
   present in every Offered-Attributes list.

   Implementation Notes:

      For example,

         "MD5-IPMAC" (Symmetric Identification),
         "AH-Attributes",
         "MD5-IPMAC" (Authentication).

      Since the offer is made by the prospective SPI User (sender),
      order of preference likely reflects the capabilities and
      engineering tradeoffs of a particular implementation.

      However, the critical processing bottlenecks are frequently in the
      receiver.  The SPI Owner (receiver) may express its needs by
      choosing a less preferable attribute.

      The order may also be affected by operational policy and requested
      services for an application.  Such considerations are outside the
      scope of this document.

      The list may be divided into additional sections.  These sections
      will always follow the ESP-Attributes section, and are
      indistinguishable from unrecognized attributes.

      The authentication, compression, encryption and identification
      mechanisms chosen, as well as the encapsulation modes (if any),
      need not be the same in both directions.

   The exchange of messages is ordered, although the formats and
   meanings of the messages are identical in each direction.  The
   messages are easily distinguished by the parties themselves, by
   examining the Message and Identification fields.

   Implementation Notes:

      The amount of time for the calculation may be dependent on the
      value of particular bits in secret values used in generating the
      shared-secret or identity verification.  To prevent analysis of
      these secret bits by recording the time for calculation, sending
      of the Identity_Messages SHOULD be delayed until the time expected
      for the longest calculation.  This will be different for different
      processor speeds, different algorithms, and different length
      variables.  Therefore, the method for estimating time is
      implementation dependent.

      Any authenticated and/or encrypted user datagrams received before
      the completion of identity verification can be placed on a queue
      pending completion of this step.  If verification succeeds, the
      queue is processed as though the datagrams had arrived subsequent
      to the verification.  If verification fails, the queue is
      discarded.

   The Initiator chooses an appropriate Identification, the SPI and
   SPILT, a set of Attributes for the SPI, calculates the Verification,
   and masks the message using the Privacy-Method indicated by the
   current Scheme-Choice.

   The Initiator also starts a retransmission timer.  If no valid
   Identity_Response arrives within the time limit, its previous
   Identity_Request is retransmitted for the remaining number of
   Retransmissions.

   When Retransmissions have been exceeded, if a Bad_Cookie message has
   been received during the exchange, the Initiator SHOULD begin the
   Photuris exchange again by sending a new Cookie_Request.

   The Responder validates the pair of Cookies, the Padding, the
   Identification, the Verification, and the Attribute-Choices.

   -  When an invalid/expired cookie is detected, a Bad_Cookie message
      is sent.

   -  After unmasking, when invalid Padding is detected, the variable
      length Attribute-Choices do not match the UDP Length, or an
      attribute was not in the Offered-Attributes, the message is
      silently discarded.

   -  When an invalid Identification is detected, or the message
      verification fails, a Verification_Failure message is sent.

   -  Whenever such a problem is detected, the Security Association is
      not established; the implementation SHOULD log the occurance, and
      notify an operator as appropriate.

   When the message is valid, the Responder sets its Exchange timer to
   the Exchange LifeTime (if this has not already been done for a
   previous exchange).  When its parallel computation of the shared-
   secret is complete, the Responder returns an Identity_Response.

   The Responder keeps a copy of the incoming Identity_Request values,
   and its Identity_Response.  If a duplicate Identity_Request is
   received, it merely resends its previous Identity_Response, and takes
   no further action.

   Attribute-Choices
                    0 or more bytes.  When the SPI is non-zero, a list
                    of attributes selected from the list of Offered-
                    Attributes supported by the peer.

                    The contents and usage of this list are further
                    described in "Attribute Choices List".  The end of
                    the list is indicated by the UDP Length after
                    removing the Padding (UDP Length - last Padding

                    current Scheme-Choice requires the plaintext to be a
                    multiple of some number of bytes (the block size of
                    a block cipher), this field is adjusted as necessary
                    to the size required by the algorithm.

                    Self-Describing-Padding begins with the value 1.
                    Each byte contains the index of that byte.  Thus,
                    the final pad byte indicates the number of pad bytes
                    to remove.  For example, when the unpadded message
                    length is 120 bytes, the padding values might be 1,
                    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

   The portion of the message after the SPI field is masked using the
   Privacy-Method indicated by the current Scheme-Choice.

   The fields following the SPI are opaque.  That is, the values are set
   prior to masking (and optional encryption), and examined only after
   unmasking (and optional decryption).

   This list specifies the attributes of the SPI.  The attribute formats
   are specified in the "Basic Attributes".

   The list is composed of one or two sections: Authentication-
   Attributes, and/or Encapsulation-Attributes.

   When sending from the SPI User to the SPI Owner, the attributes are
   processed in the order listed.  For example,

      "ESP-Attributes",
      "Deflate" (Compression),
      "XOR" (Encryption),
      "DES-CBC" (Encryption),
      "XOR" (Encryption),
      "AH-Attributes",
      "AH-Sequence",
      "MD5-IPMAC" (Authentication),

   would result in ESP with compression and triple encryption (inside),
   and then AH authentication with sequence numbers (outside) of the ESP
   payload.

   The SPI Owner will naturally process the datagram in the reverse
   order.

   This ordering also affects the order of key generation.  Both SPI

   Owner and SPI User generate the keys in the order listed.

   Implementation Notes:

      When choices are made from the list of Offered-Attributes, it is
      not required that any Security Association include every kind of
      offered attribute in any single SPI, or that a separate SPI be
      created for every offered attribute.

      Some kinds of attributes may be included more than once in a
      single SPI.  The set of allowable combinations of attributes are
      dependent on implementation and operational policy.  Such
      considerations are outside the scope of this document.

      The list may be divided into additional sections.  This can occur
      only when both parties recognize the affected attributes.

      The authentication, compression, encryption and identification
      mechanisms chosen, as well as the encapsulation modes (if any),
      need not be the same in both directions.

   A shared-secret is used in a number of calculations.  Regardless of
   the internal representation of the shared-secret, when used in
   calculations it is in the same form as the Value part of a Variable
   Precision Integer:

    - most significant byte first.
    - bits used are right justified within byte boundaries.
    - any unused bits are in the most significant byte.
    - unused bits are zero filled.

   The shared-secret does not include a Size field.

   These messages are authenticated using the Identity-Choice.  The
   Verification value is calculated prior to masking (and optional
   encryption), and verified after unmasking (and optional decryption).

   The Identity-Choice authentication function is supplied with two
   input values:

    - the sender (SPI Owner) verification-key,
    - the data to be verified (as a concatenated sequence of bytes).

   The resulting output value is stored in the Verification field.

   The Identity-Choice verification data consists of the following
   concatenated values:

    + the Initiator Cookie,
    + the Responder Cookie,
    + the Message, LifeTime and SPI fields,
    + the Identity-Choice and Identification,
    + the SPI User Identity Verification (response only),
    + the Attribute-Choices following the Verification field,
    + the Padding,
    + the SPI Owner TBV,
    + the SPI Owner Exchange-Value,
    + the SPI Owner Offered-Attributes,
    + the SPI User TBV,
    + the SPI User Exchange-Value,
    + the SPI User Offered-Attributes,
    + the Responder Offered-Schemes.

   The TBV (Three Byte Value) consists of the Counter and Scheme-Choice
   fields from the Value_Request, or the Reserved field from the
   Value_Response, immediately preceding the associated Exchange-Value.

   Note that the order of the Exchange-Value and Offered-Attributes
   fields is different in each direction, and the Identification and SPI
   fields are also likely to be different in each direction.  Note also
   that the SPI User Identity Verification (from the Identity_Request)
   is present only in the Identity_Response.

   If the verification fails, the users are notified, and a
   Verification_Failure message is sent, without adding any SPI.  On
   success, normal operation begins with the authentication and/or
   encryption of user datagrams.

   Implementation Notes:

      This is distinct from any authentication method specified for the
      SPI.

      The exact details of the Identification and verification-key
      included in the Verification calculation are dependent on the
      Identity-Choice, as described in the "Basic Attributes".

      Each party may wish to keep their own trusted databases, such as
      the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) web of trust, and accept only those
      identities found there.  Failure to find the Identification in
      either an internal or external database results in the same

   Identification Exchange messages are masked using the Privacy-Method
   indicated by the current Scheme-Choice.  Masking begins with the next
   field after the SPI, and continues to the end of the data indicated
   by the UDP Length, including the Padding.

   The Scheme-Choice specified Key-Generation-Function is used to create
   a special privacy-key for each message.  This function is calculated
   over the following concatenated values:

    + the SPI Owner Exchange-Value,
    + the SPI User Exchange-Value,
    + the Initiator Cookie,
    + the Responder Cookie,
    + the Message, LifeTime and SPI (or Reserved) fields,
    + the computed shared-secret.

   Since the order of the Exchange-Value fields is different in each
   direction, and the Message, LifeTime and SPI fields are also
   different in each direction, the resulting privacy-key will usually
   be different in each direction.

   When a larger number of keying-bits are needed than are available
   from one iteration of the specified Key-Generation-Function, more
   keying-bits are generated by duplicating the trailing shared-secret,
   and recalculating the function.  That is, the first iteration will
   have one trailing copy of the shared-secret, the second iteration
   will have two trailing copies of the shared-secret, and so forth.

   Implementation Notes:

      This is distinct from any encryption method specified for the SPI.

      The length of the Padding, and other details, are dependent on the
      Privacy-Method.  See the "Basic Privacy-Method" list for details.

      To avoid keeping the Exchange-Values in memory after the initial
      verification, it is often possible to pre-compute the function
      over the initial bytes of the concatenated data values for each

   Each SPI has one or more session-keys.  These keys are generated
   based on the attributes of the SPI.  See the "Basic Attributes" for
   details.

   The Scheme-Choice specified Key-Generation-Function is used to create
   the SPI session-key for that particular attribute.  This function is
   calculated over the following concatenated values:

    + the Initiator Cookie,
    + the Responder Cookie,
    + the SPI Owner generation-key,
    + the SPI User generation-key,
    + the message Verification field,
    + the computed shared-secret.

   Since the order of the generation-keys is different in each
   direction, and the Verification field is also likely to be different
   in each direction, the resulting session-key will usually be
   different in each direction.

   When a larger number of keying-bits are needed than are available
   from one iteration of the specified Key-Generation-Function, more
   keying-bits are generated by duplicating the trailing shared-secret,
   and recalculating the function.  That is, the first iteration will
   have one trailing copy of the shared-secret, the second iteration
   will have two trailing copies of the shared-secret, and so forth.

   Implementation Notes:

      This is distinct from any privacy-key generated for the Photuris
      exchange.  Different initialization data is used, and iterations
      are maintained separately.

      The exact details of the Verification field and generation-keys
      that are included in the session-key calculation are dependent on
      the Identity-Choices, as described in the "Basic Attributes".

      To avoid keeping the generation-keys in memory after the initial
      verification, it is often possible to pre-compute the function
      over the initial bytes of the concatenated data values for each
      direction, and append the trailing copies of the shared-secret.

      When both authentication and encryption attributes are used for

   The potential SPI Owner validates the pair of Cookies, the Padding,
   the Verification, and the Attributes-Needed.

   -  When an invalid/expired cookie is detected, a Bad_Cookie message
      is sent.

   -  When too many SPI values are already in use for this particular
      peer, or some other resource limit is reached, a Resource_Limit
      message is sent.

   -  After unmasking, when invalid Padding is detected, the variable
      length Attributes-Needed do not match the UDP Length, or an
      attribute was not in the Offered-Attributes, the message is
      silently discarded.

   -  When the message verification fails, a Verification_Failure
      message is sent.

   -  Whenever such a problem is detected, the SPI is not established;
      the implementation SHOULD log the occurance, and notify an
      operator as appropriate.

   When the message is valid, the party SHOULD send SPI_Update with the
   necessary attributes.

   If an existing SPI has those attributes, that SPI is returned in the
   SPI_Update with the remaining SPILT.

   Each SPI requires replacement under several circumstances:

   -  the volume of data processed (inhibiting probability
      cryptanalysis),

   -  exhaustion of available anti-replay Sequence Numbers,

   -  and expiration of the LifeTime.

   In general, a determination is made upon receipt of a datagram.  If
   the transform specific processing finds that refreshment is needed,
   an automated SPI_Update is triggered.

   In addition, automated SPI_Updates allow rapid SPI refreshment for
   high bandwidth applications in a high delay environment.  The update
   messages flow in the opposite direction from the primary traffic,
   conserving bandwidth and avoiding service interruption.

   When creating each SPI, the implementation MAY optionally set an
   Update TimeOut (UTO); by default, to half the value of the LifeTime
   (SPILT/2).  This time is highly dynamic, and adjustable to provide an
   automated SPI_Update long before transform specific processing.  If
   no new Photuris exchange occurs within the time limit, and the
   current exchange state has not expired, an automated SPI_Update is
   sent.

   When the LifeTime is non-zero, and the SPI is also non-zero, the
   SPI_Update can be used to create a new SPI.  When the SPI is zero,
   the SPI_Update is silently discarded.

   The new session-keys are calculated in the same fashion as the
   Identity_Messages.  Since the SPI value is always different than any
   previous SPI during the Exchange LifeTime of the shared-secret, the
   resulting session-keys will necessarily be different from all others
   used in the same direction.

   No retransmission timer is necessary.  Success is indicated by the
   peer use of the new SPI.

   Should all creation attempts fail, eventually the peer will find that
   all existing SPIs have expired, and will begin the Photuris exchange
   again by sending a new Cookie_Request.  When appropriate, this
   Cookie_Request MAY include a Responder-Cookie to retain previous
   party pairings.

   When the LifeTime is zero, the SPI_Update can be used to delete a
   single existing SPI.  When the SPI is also zero, the SPI_Update will
   delete all existing SPIs related to this Security Association, and
   mark the Photuris exchange state as expired.  This is especially
   useful when the application that needed them terminates.

   No retransmission timer is necessary.  This message is advisory, to
   reduce the number of ICMP Security Failures messages.

   Should any deletion attempts fail, the peer will learn that the
   deleted SPIs are invalid through the normal ICMP Security Failures
   messages, and will initiate a Photuris exchange by sending a new

   The resulting output value is stored in the Verification field.

   If the verification fails, the users are notified, and a

   SPIs.  On success, normal operation begins with the authentication
   and/or encryption of user datagrams.

   Implementation Notes:

      This is distinct from any authentication method specified for the

   These messages are not masked.

   The receiver checks the Cookies for validity.  Special care MUST be

   such an Error Message might be expected.  Otherwise, these messages

   This error message is sent when a Value_Request, Identity_Request,
   SPI_Needed, or SPI_Update is received, and the receiver specific
   Cookie is invalid or the associated exchange state has expired.

   During the Photuris exchange, when this error message is received, it
   has no immediate effect on the operation of the protocol phases.
   Later, when Retransmissions have been exceeded, and this error
   message has been received, the Initiator SHOULD begin the Photuris
   exchange again by sending a new Cookie_Request with the Responder-
   Cookie and Counter updated appropriately.

   When this error message is received in response to SPI_Needed, the
   exchange state SHOULD NOT be marked as expired, but the party SHOULD
   initiate a Photuris exchange by sending a new Cookie_Request.

   When this error message is received in response to SPI_Update, the
   exchange state SHOULD NOT be marked as expired, and no further action
   is taken.  A new exchange will be initiated later when needed by the
   peer to send authenticated and/or encrypted data.

   Existing SPIs are not deleted.  They expire normally, and are purged

   Photuris is based in principle on public-key cryptography,
   specifically Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  Exchange of public D-H
   Exchange-Values based on private-secret values results in a mutual
   shared-secret between the parties.  This shared-secret can be used on
   its own, or to generate a series of session-keys for authentication
   and encryption of subsequent traffic.

   This document assumes familiarity with the Diffie-Hellman public-key
   algorithm.  A good description can be found in [<a href="#ref-Schneier95">Schneier95</a>].


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.%20%20Modular%20Exponentiation%20Groups"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" name="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Modular Exponentiation Groups</span>

   The original Diffie-Hellman technique [<a href="#ref-DH76" title='"New Directions in Cryptography"'>DH76</a>] specified modular
   exponentiation.  A public-value is generated using a generator (g),
   raised to a private-secret exponent (x), modulo a prime (p):

      (g**x) mod p.

   When these public-values are exchanged between parties, the parties
   can calculate a shared-secret value between themselves:

      (g**xy) mod p.

   The generator (g) and modulus (p) are established by the Scheme-
   Choice (see the "Basic Exchange-Schemes" for details).  They are
   offered in the Cookie_Response, and one pair is chosen in the
   Value_Request.

   The private exponents (x) and (y) are kept secret by the parties.
   Only the public-value result of the modular exponentiation with (x)
   or (y) is sent as the Initiator and Responder Exchange-Value.

   These public-values are represented in single Variable Precision
   Integers.  The Size of these Exchange-Values will match the Size of
   the modulus (p).

   Each implementation proposes one or more moduli in its Offered-
   Schemes.  Every implementation MUST support up to 1024-bit moduli.

   For any particular Photuris node, these moduli need not change for
   significant periods of time; likely days or weeks.  A background
   process can periodically generate new moduli.

      For 512-bit moduli, current estimates would provide 64
      (pessimistic) bit-equivalents of cryptographic strength.

      For 1024-bit moduli, current estimates would range from 80
      (pessimistic) through 98 (optimistic) bit-equivalents of
      cryptographic strength.

   These estimates are used when choosing moduli that are appropriate
   for the desired Security Parameter attributes.

   Each implementation is likely to use a fixed modulus during its
   bootstrap, until it can generate another modulus in the background.
   As the bootstrap modulus will be widely distributed, and reused
   whenever the machine reinitializes, it SHOULD be a "safe" prime (p =
   2q+1) to provide the greatest long-term protection.

   Implementors are encouraged to generate their own bootstrap moduli,
   and to change bootstrap moduli in successive implementation releases.

   As Photuris exchanges are initiated, new moduli will be learned from
   the Responder Offered-Schemes.  The Initiator MAY cache these moduli
   for its own use.

   Before offering any learned modulus, the implementation MUST perform
   at least one iteration of probable primality verification.  In this
   fashion, many processors will perform verification in parallel as
   moduli are passed around.

   When primality verification failures are found, the failed moduli
   SHOULD be retained for some (implementation dependent) period of
   time, to avoid re-learning and re-testing after subsequent exchanges.

   The generator (g) should be chosen such that the private-secret
   exponents will generate all possible public-values, evenly
   distributed throughout the range of the modulus (p), without cycling
   through a smaller subset.  Such a generator is called a "primitive
   root" (which is trivial to find when p is "safe").

   Only one generator (2) is required to be supported.

   Implementation Notes:

      One useful technique is to select the generator, and then limit
      the modulus selection sieve to primes with that generator:

         2   when p (mod 24) = 11.
         3   when p (mod 12) = 5.
         5   when p (mod 10) = 3 or 7.

      The required generator (2) improves efficiency in multiplication
      performance.  It is usable even when it is not a primitive root,
      as it still covers half of the space of possible residues.


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.4.%20%20Exponent%20Selection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.4" name="section-8.4">8.4</a>.  Exponent Selection</span>

   Each implementation generates a separate random private-secret
   exponent for each different modulus.  Then, a D-H Exchange-Value is
   calculated for the given modulus, generator, and exponent.

   This specification recommends that the exponent length be at least
   twice the desired cryptographic strength of the longest session-key
   needed by the strongest offered-attribute.

   Based on the estimates in "Moduli Selection" (above):

      For 512-bit moduli, exponent lengths of 128 bits (or more) are
      recommended.

      For 1024-bit moduli, exponent lengths of 160 to 256 bits (or more)
      are recommended.

   Although the same exponent and Exchange-Value may be used with
   several parties whenever the same modulus and generator are used, the
   exponent SHOULD be changed at random intervals.  A background process
   can periodically destroy the old values, generate a new random
   private-secret exponent, and recalculate the Exchange-Value.

   Implementation Notes:

      The size of the exponent is entirely implementation dependent, is
      unknown to the other party, and can be easily changed.

      Since these operations involve several time-consuming modular
      exponentiations, moving them to the "background" substantially
      improves the apparent execution speed of the Photuris protocol.
      It also reduces CPU loading sufficiently to allow a single
      public/private key-pair to be used in several closely spaced

   Some exponents do not qualify as secret.  The exponent 0 will
   generate the Exchange-Value 1, and the exponent 1 will generate the
   Exchange-Value g.  Small exponents will be easily visible and SHOULD
   be avoided where:

      g**x &lt; p.

   Depending on the structure of the moduli, certain exponents can be
   used for sub-group confinement attacks.  For "safe" primes (p =
   2q+1), these exponents are p-1 and (p-1)/2, which will generate the
   Exchange-Values 1 and p-1 respectively.

   When an implementation chooses a random exponent, the resulting
   Exchange-Value is examined.  If the Exchange-Value is represented in
   less than half the number of significant bits in the modulus, then a
   new random exponent MUST be chosen.

      For 512-bit moduli, Exchange-Values of 2**256 or greater are
      required.

      For 1024-bit moduli, Exchange-Values of 2**512 or greater are
      required.

   In addition, if the resulting Exchange-Value is p-1, then a new
   random exponent MUST be chosen.

   Upon receipt of an Exchange-Value that fails to meet the
   requirements, the Value Exchange message is silently discarded.

   Implementation Notes:

      Avoidance of small exponents can be assured by setting at least
      one bit in the most significant half of the exponent.

   As described in "Validity Verification", the Verification field value
   is the MD5 [<a href="rfc1321.html" title='"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>RFC-1321</a>] hash over the concatenation of

      MD5( key, keyfill, data, datafill, key, md5fill )

   where the key is the computed verification-key.

   The keyfill and datafill use the same pad-with-length technique
   defined for md5fill.  This padding and length is implicit, and does
   not appear in the datagram.

   The resulting Verification field is a 128-bit Variable Precision
   Integer (18 bytes including Size).  When used in calculations, the
   Verification data includes both the Size and Value fields.

   Each attribute may have value fields that are multiple bytes.  To
   facilitate processing efficiency, these fields are aligned on
   integral modulo 8 byte (64-bit) boundaries.

   Padding is accomplished by insertion of 1 to 7 Attribute 0 padding
   bytes before the attribute that needs alignment.

   No padding is used after the final attribute in a list.

   When selected as an Identity-Choice, the immediately following
   Identification field contains an unstructured Variable Precision
   Integer.  Valid Identifications and symmetric secret-keys are
   preconfigured by the parties.

   There is no required format or content for the Identification value.
   The value may be a number or string of any kind.  See "Use of
   Identification and Secrets" for details.

   The symmetric secret-key (as specified) is selected based on the
   contents of the Identification field.  All implementations MUST
   support at least 62 bytes.  The selected symmetric secret-key SHOULD
   provide at least 64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in "Identity Verification", the Verification field value
   is the MD5 [<a href="rfc1321.html" title='"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>RFC-1321</a>] hash over the concatenation of:

      MD5( key, keyfill, data, datafill, key, md5fill )

   where the key is the computed verification-key.

   The keyfill and datafill use the same pad-with-length technique
   defined for md5fill.  This padding and length is implicit, and does
   not appear in the datagram.

   The resulting Verification field is a 128-bit Variable Precision
   Integer (18 bytes including Size).  When used in calculations, the
   Verification data includes both the Size and Value fields.

   For both "Identity Verification" and "Validity Verification", the
   verification-key is the MD5 [<a href="rfc1321.html" title='"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>RFC-1321</a>] hash of the following
   concatenated values:

    + the symmetric secret-key,
    + the computed shared-secret.

   For "Session-Key Computation", the symmetric secret-key is used
   directly as the generation-key.

   Regardless of the internal representation of the symmetric secret-
   key, when used in calculations it is in the same form as the Value
   part of a Variable Precision Integer:

    - most significant byte first.
    - bits used are right justified within byte boundaries.
    - any unused bits are in the most significant byte.
    - unused bits are zero filled.

   The symmetric secret-key does not include a Size field.


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/13.4.2.%20%20Authentication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-13.4.2" name="section-13.4.2">13.4.2</a>.  Authentication</span>

   May be selected as an AH or ESP Attribute-Choice, pursuant to [RFC-
   1828] et sequitur.  The selected Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide at
   least 64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in "Session-Key Computation", the most significant 384-
   bits (48 bytes) of the Key-Generation-Function iterations are used
   for the key.

   Profile:

      When negotiated with Photuris, the transform differs slightly from
      [<a href="rfc1828.html" title='"IP Authentication using Keyed MD5"'>RFC-1828</a>].

      The form of the authenticated message is:

         MD5( key, keyfill, datagram, datafill, key, md5fill )

      where the key is the SPI session-key.

      The additional datafill protects against the (impractical) attack
      described in [<a href="#ref-PO96" title='"On the security of two MAC algorithms"'>PO96</a>].  The keyfill and datafill use the same pad-
      with-length technique defined for md5fill.  This padding and
      length is implicit, and does not appear in the datagram.

   available to specify these without encumbering the authors with

   Implementation of the base protocol requires support for operator
   configuration of participant identities and associated symmetric
   secret-keys.

   The form of the Identification and Secret fields is not constrained
   to be a readable string.  In addition to a simpler quoted string
   configuration, an implementation MUST allow configuration of an
   arbitrary stream of bytes.


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.1.%20%20Identification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.1" name="appendix-B.1">B.1</a>.  Identification</span>

   Typically, the Identification is a user name, a site name, a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name, or an email address which contains a user name
   and a domain name.  Examples include:

      user
      node.site.
      user@node.site.
      rcmd@node.site.
      "Mundane Name" &lt;user@node.site&gt;

   There is no requirement that the domain name match any of the
   particular IP addresses in use by the parties.


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/B.2.%20%20Group%20Identity%20With%20Group%20Secret"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B.2" name="appendix-B.2">B.2</a>.  Group Identity With Group Secret</span>

   A simple configuration approach could use a single Identity and
   Secret, distributed to all the participants in the trusted group.
   This might be appropriate between routers under a single
   administration comprising a Virtual Private Network over the
   Internet.

   Nota Bene:
      The passwords used in these examples do not meet the "MD5-IPMAC
      Symmetric Identification" recommendation for at least 64-bits of
      cryptographic strength.

   The administrator configures each router with the same username and
   password:

      identity local "Tiny VPN 1995 November" "abracadabra"
      identity remote "Tiny VPN 1995 November" "abracadabra"

   When the Initiator sends its Identity_Request, the SPI Owner

   Identification field is "Tiny VPN 1995 November" and the SPI Owner
   secret-key is "abracadabra".

   When the Responder sends its Identity_Response, the SPI Owner
   Identification field is "Tiny VPN 1995 November" and the SPI Owner
   secret-key is "abracadabra".  The SPI User Identification is "Tiny
   VPN 1995 November" (taken from the request), and the SPI User
   secret-key is "abracadabra".

   Note that even in the face of implementations with very poor random
   number generation yielding the same random numbers for both parties
   at every step, and with this completely identical configuration, the
   addition of the SPI User Verification field in the response
   calculation is highly likely to produce a different Verification
   value (see "Identity Verification").  In turn, the different
   Verification values affect the calculation of SPI session-keys that
   are highly likely to be different in each direction (see "Session-Key
   Computation").

   A more robust configuration approach could use a separate Identity
   and Secret for each party, distributed to the participants in the
   trusted group.  This might be appropriate for authenticated firewall
   traversal.

   An administrator has one or more networks, and a number of mobile
   users.  It is desirable to restrict access to authorized external
   users.  The example boundary router is 10.0.0.1.

   The administrator gives each user a different username and password,
   together with a group username and password for the router.

   The administrator configures (in part):

      identity local "199511@router.site" "FalDaRah"
      identity remote "Happy_Wanderer@router.site" "FalDaRee"

   Each mobile user adds commands to tunnel and authenticate.

      route addprivate 10.0.0.0/8 tunnel 10.0.0.1
      secure 10.0.0.1 authenticate-only
      identity local "Happy_Wanderer@router.site" "FalDaRee"
      identity remote "199511@router.site" "FalDaRah"
      identity remote "199512@router.site" "FalDaHaHaHaHaHaHa"

   When the mobile Initiator sends its Identity_Request, the SPI Owner

   Identification field is "Happy_Wanderer@router.site" and the SPI
   Owner secret-key is "FalDaRee".

   When the firewall Responder sends its Identity_Response, the SPI
   Owner Identification field is "199511@router.site" and the SPI Owner
   secret-key is "FalDaRah".  The SPI User Identification field is
   "Happy_Wanderer@router.site" (taken from the request), and the SPI
   User secret-key is "FalDaRee".

   In this example, the mobile user is already prepared for a monthly
   password changeover, where the router might identify itself as
   "199512@router.site".

   Greater security might be achieved through configuration of a pair of
   secrets between each party.  As before, one secret is used for
   initial contact to any member of the group, but another secret is
   used between specific parties.  Compromise of one secret or pair of
   secrets does not affect any other member of the group.  This might be
   appropriate between the routers forming a boundary between
   cooperating Virtual Private Networks that establish local policy for
   each VPN member access.

   One administrator configures:

      identity local "Apple" "all for one"
      identity local "Apple-Baker" "Apple to Baker" "Baker"
      identity remote "Baker" "one for all"
      identity remote "Baker-Apple" "Baker to Apple"

   Another configures:

      identity local "Baker" "one for all"
      identity local "Baker-Apple" "Baker to Apple" "Apple"
      identity remote "Apple" "all for one"
      identity remote "Apple-Baker" "Apple to Baker"

   When the Initiator sends its Identity_Request, the SPI Owner
   Identification field is "Apple" and the SPI Owner secret-key is "all
   for one".

   When the Responder sends its Identity_Response, finding that the
   special pairing exists for "Apple" (in this example, indicated by a
   third field), the SPI Owner Identification field is "Baker-Apple" and
   the SPI Owner secret-key is "Baker to Apple".  The SPI User
   Identification is "Apple" (taken from the request), and the SPI User

   secret-key is "all for one".


Operational Considerations

   The specification provides only a few configurable parameters, with
   defaults that should satisfy most situations.

   Retransmissions
      Default: 3.

   Initial Retransmission TimeOut (IRTO)
      Default: 5 seconds.

   Exchange TimeOut (ETO)
      Default: 30 seconds.  Minimum: Retransmissions * IRTO.

   Exchange LifeTime (ELT)
      Default: 30 minutes.  Minimum: 2 * ETO.

   SPI LifeTime (SPILT)
      Default: 5 minutes.  Minimum: 3 * ETO.

   Each party configures a list of known identities and symmetric
   secret-keys.

   In addition, each party configures local policy that determines what
   access (if any) is granted to the holder of a particular identity.
   For example, the party might allow anonymous FTP, but prohibit
   Telnet.  Such considerations are outside the scope of this document.


Security Considerations

   Photuris was based on currently available tools, by experienced
   network protocol designers with an interest in cryptography, rather
   than by cryptographers with an interest in network protocols.  This
   specification is intended to be readily implementable without
   requiring an extensive background in cryptology.

   Therefore, only minimal background cryptologic discussion and
   rationale is included in this document.  Although some review has
   been provided by the general cryptologic community, it is anticipated
   that design decisions and tradeoffs will be thoroughly analysed in
   subsequent dissertations and debated for many years to come.

   Cryptologic details are reserved for separate documents that may be
   more readily and timely updated with new analysis.

History

   The initial specification of Photuris, now called version 1 (December
   1994 to March 1995), was based on a short list of design
   requirements, and simple experimental code by Phil Karn.  Only one
   modular exponentiation form was used, with a single byte index of
   pre-specified group parameters.  The transform attributes were
   selected during the public value exchange.  Party privacy was
   protected in the identification signature exchange with standard ESP
   transforms.

   Upon submission for review by the IP Security Working Group, a large
   number of features were demanded.  A mere 254 future group choices
   were not deemed enough; it was expanded to two bytes (and renamed
   schemes), and was expanded again to carry variable parameters.  The
   transform attributes were made variable length to accomodate optional
   parameters.  Every other possible parameter was made negotiable.
   Some participants were unable to switch modes on the UDP sockets to
   use standard ESP transforms for only some messages, and party privacy
   was integrated into the protocol.  The message headers were
   reorganized, and selection of transform attributes was delayed until
   the identification exchange.  An additional update message phase was
   added.

   Version 2 (July 1995 to December 1995) specification stability was
   achieved in November 1995 by moving most parameters into separate
   documents for later discussion, and leaving only a few mandatory
   features in the base specification.  Within a month, multiple
   interoperable implementations were produced.

   Unfortunately, in a fit of demagoguery, the IP Security Working Group
   decided in a straw poll to remove party privacy protection, and the
   Working Group chair terminated the meeting without allowing further
   discussion.  Because the identification exchange messages required
   privacy to function correctly, the messages were reorganized again.
   Party privacy and other optional schemes were split into a separate
   document.

   The implementors established a separate discussion group.  Version 3
   (April 1996 to June 1997) enjoyed a long period of specification
   stability and multiple implementations on half a dozen platforms.

   Meanwhile, the IP Security Working Group has developed a competing
   specification with large numbers of negotiable parameters.  Also, the
   PPP Extensions Working Group has deployed link security transforms.

   Version 4 (July 1997 onward) attempts to maintain a semblance of
   interface compatibility with these other efforts.  Minor changes are

   specified in transform padding format and key generation.  More than
   one value is permitted per scheme, giving greater latitude in choice
   for future extensions.  The opportunity is taken to return party
   privacy to the base document, and make small semantic changes in
   automated updates and error recovery.  All ESP transform attributes
   are moved to separate documents, to (hopefully) avoid future
   incompatible changes to the base document.


Acknowledgements

      Thou shalt make no law restricting the size of integers that may
      be multiplied together, nor the number of times that an integer
      may be multiplied by itself, nor the modulus by which an integer
      may be reduced.  [Prime Commandment]

   Phil Karn was principally responsible for the design of the protocol
   phases, particularly the "cookie" anti-clogging defense, developed
   the initial testing implementation, and provided much of the design
   rationale text (now removed to a separate document).

   William Simpson was responsible for the packet formats and
   attributes, additional message types, editing and formatting.  All
   such mistakes are his responsibility.

   This protocol was later discovered to have many elements in common
   with the Station-To-Station authentication protocol [<a href="#ref-DOW92" title='"Authentication and Authenticated Key Exchanges"'>DOW92</a>].

   Angelos Keromytis developed the first completely independent
   implementation (circa October 1995).  Also, he suggested the cookie
   exchange rate limitation counter.

   Paul C van Oorschot suggested signing both the public exponents and
   the shared-secret, to provide an authentication-only version of
   identity verification.  Also, he provided text regarding moduli,
   generator, and exponent selection (now removed to a separate
   document).

   Hilarie Orman suggested adding secret "nonces" to session-key
   generation for asymmetric public/private-key identity methods (now
   removed to a separate document), and provided extensive review of the
   protocol details.

   Bart Preneel and Paul C van Oorschot in [<a href="#ref-PO96" title='"On the security of two MAC algorithms"'>PO96</a>] recommended padding
   between the data and trailing key when hashing for authentication.

   Niels Provos developed another independent implementation (circa May
   1997), ported to AIX, Linux, OpenBSD, and Solaris.  Also, he made

   suggestions regarding automated update, and listing multiple moduli
   per scheme.

   Bill Sommerfeld suggested including the authentication symmetric
   secret-keys in the session-key generation, and using the Cookie
   values on successive exchanges to provide bi-directional user-
   oriented keying (now removed to a separate document).

   Oliver Spatscheck developed the second independent implementation
   (circa December 1995) for the Xkernel.

   International interoperability testing between early implementors
   provided the impetus for many of the implementation notes herein, and
   numerous refinements in the semantics of the protocol messages.
