large number of independent administrative domains (autonomous

of a metric. It is generally recognized that any attempt to do so
would incur significant scalability problems as well as inter-
administration coordination problems. However, there are deployments
in which a single administration runs several contiguous BGP networks.

              <span class="h1">The Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute for BGP</span>

Abstract

   Routing protocols that have been designed to run within a single
   administrative domain (IGPs) generally do so by assigning a metric to
   each link and then choosing, as the installed path between two nodes,
   the path for which the total distance (sum of the metric of each link
   along the path) is minimized.  BGP, designed to provide routing over
   a large number of independent administrative domains (autonomous
   systems), does not make its path-selection decisions through the use
   of a metric.  It is generally recognized that any attempt to do so
   would incur significant scalability problems as well as inter-
   administration coordination problems.  However, there are deployments
   in which a single administration runs several contiguous BGP
   networks.  In such cases, it can be desirable, within that single
   administrative domain, for BGP to select paths based on a metric,
   just as an IGP would do.  The purpose of this document is to provide
   a specification for doing so.

   There are many routing protocols that have been designed to run
   within a single administrative domain.  These are known collectively
   as "Interior Gateway Protocols" (IGPs).  Typically, each link is
   assigned a particular "metric" value.  The path between two nodes can
   then be assigned a "distance", which is the sum of the metrics of all
   the links that belong to that path.  An IGP selects the "shortest"
   (minimal distance) path between any two nodes, perhaps subject to the
   constraint that if the IGP provides multiple "areas", it may prefer
   the shortest path within an area to a path that traverses more than
   one area.  Typically, the administration of the network has some
   routing policy that can be approximated by selecting shortest paths
   in this way.

   BGP, as distinguished from the IGPs, was designed to run over an
   arbitrarily large number of administrative domains ("autonomous
   systems" or "ASes") with limited coordination among the various
   administrations.  BGP does not make its path-selection decisions
   based on a metric; there is no such thing as an "inter-AS metric".
   There are two fundamental reasons for this:

   -  The distance between two nodes in a common administrative domain
      may change at any time due to events occurring in that domain.
      These changes are not propagated around the Internet unless they
      actually cause the border routers of the domain to select routes
      with different BGP attributes for some set of address prefixes.
      This accords with a fundamental principle of scaling, viz., that
      changes with only local significance must not have global effects.
      If local changes in distance were always propagated around the
      Internet, this principle would be violated.

   -  A basic principle of inter-domain routing is that the different
      administrative domains may have their own policies, which do not
      have to be revealed to other domains and which certainly do not
      have to be agreed to by other domains.  Yet, the use of an inter-
      AS metric in the Internet would have exactly these effects.

   There are, however, deployments in which a single administration runs
   a network that has been sub-divided into multiple, contiguous ASes,
   each running BGP.  There are several reasons why a single
   administrative domain may be broken into several ASes (which, in this
   case, are not really autonomous.)  It may be that the existing IGPs
   do not scale well in the particular environment; it may be that a
   more generalized topology is desired than could be obtained by use of
   a single IGP domain; it may be that a more finely grained routing
   policy is desired than can be supported by an IGP.  In such
   deployments, it can be useful to allow BGP to make its routing

   decisions based on the IGP metric, so that BGP chooses the shortest
   path between two nodes, even if the nodes are in two different ASes
   within that same administrative domain.

   There are, in fact, some implementations that already do something
   like this, using BGP's MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) attribute to carry a
   value based on IGP metrics.  However, that doesn't really provide
   IGP-like shortest path routing, as the BGP decision process gives
   priority to other factors, such as the AS_PATH length.  Also, the
   standard procedures for use of the MED do not ensure that the IGP
   metric is properly accumulated so that it covers all the links along
   the path.

   In this document, we define a new optional, non-transitive BGP
   attribute, called the "Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute", or "AIGP
   attribute", and specify the procedures for using it.

   The specified procedures prevent the AIGP attribute from "leaking
   out" past an administrative domain boundary into the Internet.  We
   will refer to the set of ASes in a common administrative domain as an
   "AIGP administrative domain".

   The specified procedures also ensure that the value in the AIGP
   attribute has been accumulated all along the path from the
   destination, i.e., that the AIGP attribute does not appear when there
   are "gaps" along the path where the IGP metric is unknown.

   The AIGP attribute is an optional, non-transitive BGP path attribute.
   The attribute type code for the AIGP attribute is 26.

   The value field of the AIGP attribute is defined here to be a set of
   elements encoded as "Type/Length/Value" (i.e., a set of TLVs).  Each
   such TLV is encoded as shown in Figure 1.

                           Figure 1: AIGP TLV

   -  Type: A single octet encoding the TLV Type.  Only type 1, "AIGP
      TLV", is defined in this document.  Use of other TLV types is
      outside the scope of this document.

   -  Length: Two octets encoding the length in octets of the TLV,
      including the Type and Length fields.  The length is encoded as an
      unsigned binary integer.  (Note that the minimum length is 3,
      indicating that no Value field is present.)

   -  Value: A field containing zero or more octets.

   This document defines only a single such TLV, the "AIGP TLV".  The
   AIGP TLV is encoded as follows:

   -  Type: 1

   -  Length: 11

   -  Value: Accumulated IGP Metric.

      The value field of the AIGP TLV is always 8 octets long, and its
      value is interpreted as an unsigned 64-bit integer.  IGP metrics
      are frequently expressed as 4-octet values.  By using an 8-octet
      field, we ensure that the AIGP attribute can be used to hold the
      sum of an arbitrary number of 4-octet values.

   When an AIGP attribute is created, it SHOULD contain no more than one
   AIGP TLV.  However, if it contains more than one AIGP TLV, only the
   first one is used as described in Sections <a href="#section-3.4">3.4</a> and <a href="#section-4">4</a>.  In the
   remainder of this document, we will use the term "value of the AIGP
   TLV" to mean the value of the first AIGP TLV in the AIGP attribute.
   Any other AIGP TLVs in the AIGP attribute MUST be passed along
   unchanged if the AIGP attribute is passed along.

   This document only considers the use of the AIGP attribute in
   networks where each router uses tunneling of some sort to deliver a
   packet to its BGP next hop.  Use of the AIGP attribute in other
   scenarios is outside the scope of this document.

   If a Route Reflector supports the AIGP attribute but some of its
   clients do not, then the routing choices that result may not all
   reflect the intended routing policy.

   When receiving a BGP Update message containing a malformed AIGP
   attribute, the attribute MUST be treated exactly as if it were an
   unrecognized non-transitive attribute.  That is, it "MUST be quietly
   ignored and not passed along to other BGP peers" (see [<a href="#ref-BGP" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP</a>], <a href="#section-5">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-5">5</a>).  This is equivalent to the "attribute discard" action specified
   in [<a href="#ref-BGP-ERROR" title='"Revised Error Handling for BGP UPDATE Messages"'>BGP-ERROR</a>].

   Note that an AIGP attribute MUST NOT be considered to be malformed
   because it contains more than one TLV of a given type or because it
   contains TLVs of unknown types.

   If a BGP path attribute is received that has the AIGP attribute
   codepoint but also has the transitive bit set, the attribute MUST be
   considered to be a malformed AIGP attribute and MUST be discarded as
   specified in this section.

   If an AIGP attribute is received and its first AIGP TLV contains the
   maximum value 0xffffffffffffffff, the attribute SHOULD be considered
   to be malformed and SHOULD be discarded as specified in this section.
   (Since the TLV value cannot be increased any further, it is not
   useful for metric-based path selection.)

   An implementation that supports the AIGP attribute MUST support a
   per-session configuration item, AIGP_SESSION, that indicates whether
   the attribute is enabled or disabled for use on that session.

   -  For Internal BGP (IBGP) sessions, and for External BGP (EBGP)
      sessions between members of the same BGP Confederation
      [<a href="#ref-BGP-CONFED" title='"Autonomous System Confederations for BGP"'>BGP-CONFED</a>], the default value of AIGP_SESSION SHOULD be
      "enabled".

   -  For all other External BGP (EBGP) sessions, the default value of
      AIGP_SESSION MUST be "disabled".

   The AIGP attribute MUST NOT be sent on any BGP session for which
   AIGP_SESSION is disabled.

   If an AIGP attribute is received on a BGP session for which
   AIGP_SESSION is disabled, the attribute MUST be treated exactly as if

   be quietly ignored and not passed along to other BGP peers" (see

   An implementation that supports the AIGP attribute MUST support a
   configuration item, AIGP_ORIGINATE, that enables or disables its
   creation and attachment to routes.  The default value of
   AIGP_ORIGINATE MUST be "disabled".

   A BGP speaker MUST NOT add the AIGP attribute to any route whose path
   leads outside the AIGP administrative domain to which the BGP speaker
   belongs.  When the AIGP attribute is used, changes in IGP routing
   will directly impact BGP routing.  Attaching the AIGP attribute to
   customer routes, Internet routes, or other routes whose paths lead
   outside the infrastructure of a particular AIGP administrative domain
   could result in BGP scaling and/or thrashing problems.

   The AIGP attribute may be added only to routes that satisfy one of
   the following conditions:

   -  The route is a static route, not leading outside the AIGP
      administrative domain, that is being redistributed into BGP;

   -  The route is an IGP route that is being redistributed into BGP;

   -  The route is an IBGP-learned route whose AS_PATH attribute is
      empty; or

   -  The route is an EBGP-learned route whose AS_PATH contains only
      ASes that are in the same AIGP administrative domain as the BGP
      speaker.

   A BGP speaker R MUST NOT add the AIGP attribute to any route for
   which R does not set itself as the next hop.

   It SHOULD be possible to set AIGP_ORIGINATE to "enabled for the
   routes of a particular IGP that are redistributed into BGP" (where "a
   particular IGP" might be OSPF or IS-IS).  Other policies determining
   when and whether to originate an AIGP attribute are also possible,
   depending on the needs of a particular deployment scenario.

   When originating an AIGP attribute for a BGP route to address prefix
   P, the value of the AIGP TLV is set according to policy.  There are a
   number of useful policies, some of which are in the following list:

   -  When a BGP speaker R is redistributing into BGP an IGP route to
      address prefix P, the IGP will have computed a distance from R to
      P.  This distance MAY be assigned as the value of the AIGP TLV.

   -  A BGP speaker R may be redistributing into BGP a static route to
      address prefix P, for which a distance from R to P has been
      configured.  This distance MAY be assigned as the value of the
      AIGP TLV.

   -  A BGP speaker R may have received and installed a BGP-learned
      route to prefix P, with next hop N.  Or it may be redistributing a
      static route to P, with next hop N.  Then:

      *  If R has an IGP route to N, the IGP-computed distance from R to
         N MAY be used as the value of the AIGP TLV of the route to P.

      *  If R has a BGP route to N, and an AIGP TLV attribute value has
         been computed for that route (see <a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a>), that value
         MAY be used as the AIGP TLV value of the route to P.

   If BGP speaker R is the originator of the AIGP attribute of prefix P,
   and the distance from R to P changes at some point, R SHOULD issue a
   new BGP update containing the new value of the AIGP TLV of the AIGP
   attribute.  (Here we use the term "distance" to refer to whatever
   value the originator assigns to the AIGP TLV, however it is computed;
   see <a href="#section-3.4.1">Section 3.4.1</a>.) However, if the difference between the new
   distance and the distance advertised in the AIGP TLV is less than a
   configurable threshold, the update MAY be suppressed.

   Suppose a BGP speaker R1 receives a route with an AIGP attribute
   whose value is A and with a next hop whose value is R2.  Suppose also
   that R1 is about to redistribute that route on a BGP session that is
   enabled for sending/receiving the attribute.

   If R1 does not change the next hop of the route, then R1 MUST NOT
   change the AIGP attribute value of the route.

   In all the computations discussed in this section, the AIGP value
   MUST be capped at its maximum unsigned value 0xffffffffffffffff.
   Increasing the AIGP value MUST NOT cause the value to wrap around.

   Suppose R1 changes the next hop of the route from R2 to R1.  If R1's
   route to R2 is either (a) an IGP-learned route or (b) a static route
   that does not require recursive next hop resolution, then R1 MUST
   increase the value of the AIGP TLV by adding to A the distance from
   R1 to R2.  This distance is either the IGP-computed distance from R1
   to R2 or some value determined by policy.  However, A MUST be
   increased by a non-zero amount.

   It is possible that R1 and R2 above are EBGP neighbors and that there
   is a direct link between them on which no IGP is running.  Then, when
   R1 changes the next hop of a route from R2 to R1, the AIGP TLV value
   MUST be increased by a non-zero amount.  The amount of the increase
   SHOULD be such that it is properly comparable to the IGP metrics.
   For example, if the IGP metric is a function of latency, then the
   amount of the increase should be a function of the latency from R1 to
   R2.

   Suppose R1 changes the next hop of the route from R2 to R1 and R1's
   route to R2 is either (a) a BGP-learned route or (b) a static route
   that requires recursive next-hop resolution.  Then, the AIGP TLV
   value needs to be increased in several steps, according to the
   following procedure.  (Note that this procedure is ONLY used when
   recursive next-hop resolution is needed.)

   1.  Let Xattr be the new AIGP TLV value.

   2.  Initialize Xattr to A.

   3.  Set XNH to R2.

   4.  Find the route to XNH.

   5.  If the route to XNH does not require recursive next-hop
       resolution, get the distance D from R1 to XNH.  (Note that this
       condition cannot be satisfied the first time through this
       procedure.)  If D is above a configurable threshold, set the AIGP
       TLV value to Xattr+D.  If D is below a configurable threshold,
       set the AIGP TLV value to Xattr.  In either case, exit this
       procedure.

   6.  If the route to XNH is a BGP-learned route that does NOT have an
       AIGP attribute, then exit this procedure and do not pass on any
       AIGP attribute.  If the route has an AIGP attribute without an
       AIGP TLV, then the AIGP attribute MAY be passed along unchanged.

   7.  If the route to XNH is a BGP-learned route that has an AIGP TLV
       value of Y, then set Xattr to Xattr+Y and set XNH to the next hop
       of this route.  (The intention here is that Y is the AIGP TLV
       value of the route as it was received by R1, without having been
       modified by R1.)

   8.  Go to step 4.

   The AIGP TLV value of a given route depends on (a) the AIGP TLV
   values of all the next hops that are recursively resolved during this
   procedure, and (b) the IGP distance to any next hop that is not
   recursively resolved.  Any change due to (a) in any of these values
   MUST trigger a new AIGP computation for that route.  Whether a change
   due to (b) triggers a new AIGP computation depends upon whether the
   change in IGP distance exceeds a configurable threshold.

   If the AIGP attribute is carried across several ASes, each with its
   own IGP domain, it is clear that these procedures are unlikely to
   give a sensible result if the IGPs are different (e.g., some OSPF and
   some IS-IS) or if the meaning of the metrics is different in the
   different IGPs (e.g., if the metric represents bandwidth in some IGP
   domains but represents latency in others).  These procedures also are
   unlikely to give a sensible result if the metric assigned to inter-AS
   BGP links (on which no IGP is running) or to static routes is not
   comparable to the IGP metrics.  All such cases are outside the scope
   of the current document.

   Support for the AIGP attribute involves several modifications to the
   tie-breaking procedures of the BGP "phase 2" decision described in
   [<a href="#ref-BGP" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP</a>], Section 9.1.2.2.  These modifications are described in
   Sections <a href="#section-4.1">4.1</a> and <a href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.

   In some cases, the BGP decision process may install a route without
   executing any tie-breaking procedures.  This may happen, e.g., if
   only one route to a given prefix has the highest degree of preference
   (as defined in [<a href="#ref-BGP" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP</a>], Section 9.1.1).  In this case, the AIGP
   attribute is not considered.

   In other cases, some routes may be eliminated before the tie-breaking
   procedures are invoked, e.g., routes with AS-PATH attributes
   indicating a loop or routes with unresolvable next hops.  In these
   cases, the AIGP attributes of the eliminated routes are not
   considered.

   Assuming that the BGP decision process invokes the tie-breaking
   procedures, the procedures in this section MUST be executed BEFORE
   any of the tie-breaking procedures described in [<a href="#ref-BGP" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP</a>], <a href="#section-9.1.2.2">Section</a>

   If any routes have an AIGP attribute containing an AIGP TLV, remove
   from consideration all routes that do not have an AIGP attribute
   containing an AIGP TLV.

   If router R is considering route T, where T has an AIGP attribute
   with an AIGP TLV,

   -  then R must compute the value A, defined as follows: set A to the
      sum of (a) T's AIGP TLV value and (b) the IGP distance from R to
      T's next hop.

   -  remove from consideration all routes that are not tied for the
      lowest value of A.

   Suppose that a given router R1 is comparing two BGP-learned routes,
   such that either:

   -  the two routes have equal AIGP TLV values, or else

   -  neither of the two routes has an AIGP attribute containing an AIGP
      TLV.

   The BGP decision process as specified in [<a href="#ref-BGP" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP</a>] makes use, in its tie-
   breaking procedures, of "interior cost", defined as follows:

      interior cost of a route is determined by calculating the metric
      to the NEXT_HOP for the route using the Routing Table.

   This document replaces the "interior cost" tie breaker of [<a href="#ref-BGP" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP</a>] with
   a tie breaker based on the "AIGP-enhanced interior cost".  Suppose
   route T has a next hop of N.  The "AIGP-enhanced interior cost" from
   node R1 to node N is defined as follows:

   -  If the installed route to N has an AIGP attribute with an AIGP
      TLV, set A to its AIGP TLV value, computed according to the
      procedure in <a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a>.

   -  If the installed route to N does not have an AIGP attribute with
      an AIGP TLV, set A to 0.

   -  The "AIGP-enhanced interior cost" of route T is the quantity A+m.

   The "interior cost" tie breaker of [<a href="#ref-BGP" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP</a>] is then applied, using the
   "AIGP-enhanced interior cost" instead of the "interior cost" as
   defined in [<a href="#ref-BGP" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP</a>].

   -  Using the AIGP attribute to achieve a desired routing policy will
      be more effective if each BGP speaker can use it to choose from
      among multiple routes.  Thus, it is highly recommended that the
      procedures of [<a href="#ref-BESTEXT" title='"Advertisement of the best external route in BGP"'>BESTEXT</a>] and [<a href="#ref-ADD-PATH" title='"Advertisement of Multiple Paths in BGP"'>ADD-PATH</a>] be used in conjunction with
      the AIGP attribute.

   -  If a Route Reflector does not pass all paths to its clients, then
      it will tend to pass the paths for which the IGP distance from the
      Route Reflector itself to the next hop is smallest.  This may
      result in a non-optimal choice by the clients.

   -  When the procedures of this document are deployed, it must be
      understood that frequent changes of the IGP distance towards a
      certain prefix may result in equally frequent transmission of BGP
      updates about that prefix.

   -  In an IGP deployment, there are certain situations in which a
      network link may be temporarily assigned a metric whose value is
      the maximum metric value (or close to the maximum) for that IGP.
      This is known as "costing out" the link.  A link may be "costed
      out" to deflect traffic from the link before the link is actually
      brought down or to discourage traffic from using a link until all
      the necessary state for that link has been set up (e.g.,
      [<a href="#ref-LDP-IGP-SYNC" title='"LDP IGP Synchronization"'>LDP-IGP-SYNC</a>]).  This assumes, of course, that a path containing
      a "costed out" link will have a total distance that is larger than
      any alternate path within the same IGP area; in that case, the
      normal IGP decision process will choose the path that does not
      contain the "costed out" link.

      Costing out a link will have the same effect on BGP routes that
      carry the AIGP attribute.  The value of the AIGP TLV will be
      larger for a route (to a given prefix) that contains a "costed
      out" link than for a route (to the same prefix) that does not.  It
      must be understood, though, that a route that carries an AIGP
      attribute will be preferred to a route that does not, no matter
      what the value of the AIGP TLV is.  This is similar to the
      behavior in, e.g., an OSPF area, where an intra-area route is
      preferred to an inter-area or external route, even if the intra-
      area route's distance is large.

   IANA has assigned the codepoint 26 in the "BGP Path Attributes"
   registry to the AIGP attribute.

   IANA has created a registry for "BGP AIGP Attribute Types".  The Type
   field consists of a single octet, with possible values from 1 to 255.
   (The value 0 is "Reserved".)  The registration procedure for this
   registry is "Standards Action".  Type 1 is defined as "AIGP" and
   refers to this document.

   The spurious introduction, through error or malfeasance, of an AIGP
   attribute could result in the selection of paths other than those
   desired.

   Improper configuration on both ends of an EBGP connection could
   result in an AIGP attribute being passed from one service provider to
   another.  This would likely result in an unsound selection of paths.
